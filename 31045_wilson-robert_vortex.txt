vortex by robert charles wilson chapter one sandra and bose no more sandra cole thought when she woke up in her sweltering apartment today was the last day she would drive to work and spend her day in the company of emaciated prostitutes addicts in the first sweaty stages of withdrawal chronic liars petty criminals today was the day she would hand in her resignation she woke every weekday morning with the same thought it hadnt been true yesterday it wasnt true today but someday it would be true no more she savored the idea as she showered and dressed it kept her going through her first cup of coffee and a quick breakfast of yogurt and buttered toast by then she had mustered the courage to face the day to face the knowledge that nothing after all would change she happened to be passing the reception area at state care when the cop brought in the boy to be registered for evaluation the boy would be her responsibility for the next week his folder had already been attached to her morning case list his name was orrin mather and he was supposed to be nonviolent in fact he looked terrified his eyes were wide and moist and he darted his head left and right like a sparrow scouting for predators sandra didnt recognize the cop who brought him inhe wasnt one of the regulars in itself that wasnt unusual delivering minor arrests to the texas state care intake facility wasnt highprestige duty at the houston police department oddly though this particular cop seemed personally concerned with his charge the boy didnt cringe away but pressed close to him as if for protection the cop kept a steady hand on his shoulder and said something sandra couldnt hear but which seemed to soothe the boys anxiety they were a study in contrasts the cop was tall bigbodied but not fat with a dark complexion dark hair dark eyes the boy was six inches shorter dressed in a prisonissue jumper that sagged over his skinny body he was so pale he looked like hed been living in a cave for the past six months the orderly on reception duty at state was jack geddes a man plausibly rumored to moonlight as a bouncer in a downtown bar geddes was often rough with patientstoo rough in sandras opinion he sprang forward from his place behind the reception desk as soon as he registered orrin mathers agitation quickly followed by the duty nurse with her armamentarium of sedatives and needles the copand this was very unusualplaced himself squarely between orrin and the orderly none of that ought to be necessary he said his voice was texas with a hint of something foreign i can escort mr mather wherever you need him to go sandra stepped forward slightly embarrassed that she hadnt spoken first she introduced herself as dr cole and said the first thing well need to do is an intake interview do you understand mr mather that happens in a room down the corridor ill ask you some questions and take down your information then well assign you a room of your own do you understand orrin mather took a steadying breath and nodded geddes and the nurse backed off geddes looking a little annoyed the cop gave sandra an evaluative look im officer bose he said dr cole can i have a word with you once you get orrin settled that might take some time ill wait bose said if you dont mind and that was the most unusual thing of all daytime temperatures in the city had topped degrees fahrenheit for ten consecutive days now the state care evaluation facility was airconditioned often to the point of absurdity sandra kept a sweater in her office but only a trickle of cool air forced its way through a ceiling grate into the room that was reserved for intake interviews orrin mather was already sweating when sandra took the chair across the table from him morning mr mather she said he relaxed a little at the sound of her voice you can call me orrin maam his eyes were blue and his big lashes looked incongruous in his angular face a gash in his right cheek was healing into a scar most everybody does thank you orrin im dr cole and well be talking together over the next few days youre the one who decides who keeps me in a way thats true ill be doing your psychiatric evaluation but im not here to judge you do you understand im here to find out what kind of help you need and whether we can give it to you orrin nodded once ducking his chin to his chest you decide whether i go to a state care camp not just me the whole staff is involved one way or another but youre the one i talk to for now yes okay he said i get it there were four security cameras in the room one in each corner where the walls met the ceiling sandra had seen recordings of her own and other sessions and knew how she would look on the monitors in the adjoining room foreshortened and prim in a blue blouse and skirt her id badge dangling on a lanyard around her neck as she leaned across the plain pine table the boy would be reduced by the alchemy of closedcircuit video to a generic interviewee though she really ought to stop thinking of orrin mather as a boy as young as he looked he was nineteen according to his file old enough to know better as sandras mother used to say youre originally from north carolina orrin is that right i guess it says so in those papers youre looking at do the papers have it right born in raleigh and lived there yes maam all my life till i came to texas well talk about that later on for now i just need to be sure i have the basics right do you know why the police took you into custody he lowered his gaze yes can you tell me about it vagrancy thats the legal word what would you call it i dont know sleeping in an alley i guess and getting beat up by those men its not a crime to get beaten up the police took you into custody for your own protection didnt they i suppose they did i was pretty bloody when they found me i didnt do anything to provoke those fellas they just set on me because they were drunk they tried to get my satchel but i didnt let them i wish the police had come along a little earlier a police patrol had found orrin mather semiconscious and bleeding on a sidewalk in southwest houston no address no identification and no apparent means of support under the vagrancy laws written in the aftermath of the spin orrin had been taken into custody for evaluation his physical injuries had been easy enough to treat his mental state was an open question however one which sandra was expected to resolve over the course of the next seven days you have family orrin just my sister ariel back in raleigh and the police have contacted her they say so yes maam officer bose says shes coming by bus to get me thats a long trip that bus trip hot this time of year i expect ariel dont care for hot weather she would have to ask bose about that usually if a family member was willing to assume responsibility there was no need for a vag case to end up in state care there were no violent acts in orrins arrest record and he was clearly aware of his situation not obviously delusional at least not at the moment though there was something uncanny about him sandra thought an unprofessional observation which she would not record in her notes she began with the standard interview from the diagnostic and statistical manual did he know the date and so forth most of his answers were straightforward and coherent but when she asked him whether he heard voices orrin hesitated guess i dont he said at last are you sure its okay to talk about these things if theres a problem we want to help you with it he nodded earnestly i know that its a hard question though i dont hear voices maam no not exactly but i write things sometimes what kind of things things i dont always understand here then was the entry point sandra added a note to orrins file poss delusions written for later exploration then because the subject was obviously distressing to him she smiled and said well thats enough for now half an hour had passed well talk again soon ill have an orderly escort you to the room where youll be staying over the next few days im sure its very nice compared to the back alleys of urban houston maybe it would be the first day at state can be hard for some people but trust me its not as bad as seems evening meals are at six in the commissary orrin looked doubtful is that like a cafeteria yes can i ask you is it loud in there i dont care for noise when i eat the patient commissary was a zoo and generally sounded like one though the staff made sure it was safe sensitivity to noise sandra added to her notes it can get a little loud yes do you think you can deal with it he gave her a downcast look but nodded ill try thank you for warning me up fronti appreciate it one more lost soul more fragile and less combative than most sandra hoped a week in state would do orrin mather more good than harm but she wouldnt have cared to lay odds on it the remanding officer was still waiting when she left the interview room much to sandras surprise it was customary for cops to dump a case and walk away state care had begun its institutional existence as a means of relieving the overloaded prison system during the worst years of the spin and after that emergency had ended a quarter of a century ago but state still served as a dumping ground for trivial offenders with obvious head issues it was a convenient arrangement for the police less so for the overextended and underfunded state care staff there was seldom any followup from law enforcement as far as the police were concerned a transfer was a closed fileor worse a flushed toilet boses hpd uniform was crisp despite the heat he started to ask her about her impressions of orrin mather but because it was past time for lunch and her afternoon schedule was heavily booked sandra invited him to join her in the cafeteriathe staff cafeteria not the patient commissary orrin mather would almost certainly find distressing she took her usual monday soup and salad and waited while bose did the same it was late enough that they had no trouble finding a free table i want to do some followup on orrin bose said thats a new one excuse me we dont generally get a whole lot of followup from hpd i guess not but there are some unanswered questions in orrins case it was orrin she noticed not the prisoner or the patient clearly officer bose had taken a personal interest i didnt see anything too unusual in his file his name came up in connection with another case i cant talk about that in any detail but i wanted to ask did he mention anything about his writing sandras interest ticked up a notch very briefly yes when he was taken into custody orrin was carrying a leather satchel with a dozen lined notebooks inside all of them filled with writing thats what he was defending when he was attacked orrins generally a cooperative guy but we had to struggle to get the notebooks away from him he needed to be reassured that wed keep them safe and give them back as soon as his case was resolved and did you give them back i mean not yet no because if orrin is so concerned with those notebooks they might be pertinent to my evaluation i understand that dr cole thats why i wanted to talk to you the thing is the contents are relevant to another case hpd is dealing with im having them transcribed but its a slow processorrins handwriting isnt easy to decipher can i see the transcripts thats what i came here to suggest but i need to ask a favor of you in return until youve looked at the whole document can we keep this matter out of official channels it was an odd request and she hesitated before answering im not sure what you mean by official channels any pertinent observation goes into orrins evaluation thats nonnegotiable you can make any observation you like as long as you dont copy or quote directly from the notebooks just until we resolve certain issues orrins under my care for just seven days officer bose at the end of that time i have to submit a recommendation a recommendation that would change orrin mathers life drastically she did not add i understand and im not trying to interfere your evaluation is what im interested in what id like to get from you informally is your opinion of what orrin wrote specifically the reliability of it at last sandra began to understand something orrin had written was potential evidence in a pending case and bose needed to know how trustworthy it or its author was if youre asking me for testimony in a legal proceeding no nothing like that just a backchannel opinion anything you can tell me that doesnt violate patient confidentiality or any other professional concerns you have im not sure you might understand a little better once youve read the document it was boses earnestness that finally persuaded her to agree at least tentatively and she was genuinely curious about the notebooks and orrins attachment to them if she discovered something clinically relevant she would feel no compunction about disregarding any promise she made to bose her first loyalty was to her patient and she made sure he understood that he accepted her conditions without complaint then he stood up he had left his salad unfinished a bed of lettuce from which he had systematically extracted all the cherry tomatoes thanks dr cole i appreciate your help ill email you the first pages tonight he gave her an hpd card with his phone and an email address and his full name jefferson amrit bose she repeated it to herself as she watched him disappear into a throng of whiteclad clinicians at the commissary door after a day of routine consultations sandra drove home under the long light of the setting sun sunset often made her think of the spin the sun had aged and expanded during the radically foreshortened years of the spin and although it looked prosaic enough in the western sky that was an engineered illusion the real sun was an aged and bloated monster furiously dying at the heart of the solar system what she saw on the horizon was what remained of its lethal radiation after it had been filtered and regulated by the inconceivably powerful technology of the hypotheticals for years nowfor all of sandras adult lifehumanity had been living on the sufferance of those alien and voiceless beings the sky was a hard blue obscured to the southeast by clouds like glassy coral growths one hundred five degrees fahrenheit in downtown houston according to the weather report just as it had been yesterday and the day before the talk on the newscasts was all about the ongoing white sands launches rockets that injected sulfur aerosols into the upper atmosphere in an attempt to slow global warming against that pending apocalypse which was none of their doing the hypotheticals had offered no defense they would protect the earth from the swollen sun but the co content of the atmosphere apparently was none of their business it was selfevidently mankinds business and yet the tankers continued creeping up the houston ship channel with their cargoes of oil plentiful and cheap now that equatorian crude had begun to flow from the new world beyond the arch two planets worth of fossil fuels to cook ourselves with sandra thought the cars laboring air conditioner hummed a rebuke to her hypocrisy but she couldnt bring herself to forego the rush of cool air ever since she finished her internship at ucsf and went to work for state care sandra had spent her days rendering passfail verdicts over troubled minds applying tests most functional adults easily passed is the subject oriented to time and place does the subject understand the consequences of his actions but if she could give the same test to humanity as a whole sandra thought the outcome would be very much in doubt subject is confused and often selfdestructive subject pursues shortterm gratification at the expense of his own wellbeing by the time she reached her apartment in clear lake night had fallen and the temperature had dropped a trivial degree or two she microwaved dinner opened a bottle of red wine and checked to see if boses email had reached her yet it had a few dozen pages pages orrin mather had supposedly written but she saw at once how unlikely that was she printed the pages and settled down in a comfortable chair to read them my name is turk findley the document began chapter two turk findleys story my name is turk findley and this is the story of the life i lived long after everything i knew and loved was dead and gone it begins in the desert of a planet we used to call equatoria and it endswell thats hard to say these are my memories this is what happened ten thousand years more or less is how long i was away from the world that was a terrible thing to know and for a span of time it was nearly all i knew i woke up dizzy and naked in the open air the sun was hammering out of an empty blue sky i was radically painfully thirsty my body ached and my tongue felt thick and dead in my mouth i tried to sit up and nearly toppled over my vision was blurred i didnt know where i was or how i had got here nor could i really remember where i had come from all i had of knowledge was the sickening conviction that almost ten thousand years but who had counted them had passed i forced myself to sit absolutely still eyes closed until the worst of the vertigo passed then i raised my head and tried to make sense of what i saw i was outdoors in what appeared to be a desert there was no one on the ground for miles as far as i could tell but i wasnt exactly alone a number of aircraft were passing overhead at low speed the aircraft were peculiarly shaped and it wasnt obvious what was keeping them aloft since they seemed to have no wings or rotors i ignored them for the time being the first thing i needed to do was to get out of the sunlightmy skin was burned red and there was no telling how long id been exposed the desert was hardpacked sand all the way to the horizon but it was littered with fragments of what looked like gigantic broken toys a smoothly curved halfeggshell at least ten feet tall and dusty green a few yards away and in the distance other similar shapes in bright but fading colors as if a giants tea party had come to grief beyond all this there was a range of mountains like a blackened jawbone the air smelled of mineral dust and hot rock i crawled a few yards into the shadow of the fractured eggshell where the shade was blissfully cool what i needed next was water and maybe something to cover myself up but the effort of moving had made me dizzy again one of the strange aircraft seemed to be hovering overhead i tried to wave my arms to attract its attention but my strength had deserted me and i closed my eyes and passed out the next time i woke i was being lifted into some kind of stretcher the bearers were dressed in yellow uniforms and wore dust masks over their mouths and noses a woman in the same yellow clothing walked beside me when our eyes met she said please try to stay calm i know youre frightened we have to hurry but trust me well get you to a safe place several of the aircraft had landed and i was carried into one of them the woman in yellow said a few words to her companions in a language i didnt recognize my captors or saviors set me on my feet and i discovered i could stand without falling a door came down cutting off the view of the desert and the sky softer light suffused the interior of the aircraft men and women in yellow jumpers bustled around me but i kept my eye on the woman who had spoken english steady she said taking my arm she wasnt much taller than five feet and change and when she pulled off her mask she looked reassuringly human her skin was brown her features were vaguely asian her dark hair was cut short how do you feel that was a complicated question i managed to shrug we were in a large room and she escorted me to one corner of it a surface like a bed slid out of the wall along with a rack of what might have been medical equipment the woman in yellow told me to lie down the other soldiers or airmeni didnt know how to think of themignored us and went about their business working control surfaces along the walls or hurrying off to other chambers of the aircraft i felt a risingelevator sensation and i guessed we had lifted off though there was no noise apart from the sound of voices speaking a language i didnt recognize no bounce no chop no turbulence the woman in yellow pressed a blunt metallic tube against my forearm and then against my rib cage and i felt my anxiety ease into numbness i guessed i had been drugged but i didnt really mind my thirst had vanished can you tell me your name the woman asked i croaked out the fact that i was turk findley i told her i was an american by birth but that i had been living in equatoria lately i asked her who she was where she was from she smiled and said my name is treya and the place im from is called vox is that where were going now yes well be there soon try to sleep if you can so i closed my eyes and tried to take inventory of myself my name is turk findley turk findley born in the last years of the spin variously a day laborer sailor smallplane pilot worked my way across the arch to equatoria on a coastal freighter and lived in port magellan some years met a woman named lise adams who was searching for her father a search that took us among the kind of people who liked to experiment with martian drugstook us deep into the oil lands of the equatorian desert at a time when ash began to fall from the sky and strange things grew out of the ground i had loved lise adams well enough to know i wasnt good for her we had been separated in the desert and i believed it was then that the hypotheticals had taken me had picked me up and carried me the way a wave carries a grain of sand and dropped me on this beach this shoal this sandbar ten thousand years downcurrent that was my history as much as i could reconstruct of it when i came to myself again i was in a smaller and more private cabin of the aircraft treya my guard or my doctor i didnt know exactly how to think of her was sitting at my bedside humming a tune in a minor key she or someone else had dressed me in a simple tunic and trousers night had fallen a narrow window to the left of me showed scattered stars that turned like points on a wheel whenever the aircraft made a banking turn the small equatorian moon was on the horizon which meant i was still in equatoria however much it might have changed down below whitecapped waves glistened with phosphorescence we were flying over the sea far from land whats that song youre humming i asked treya gave a little start surprised to find me awake she was youngi guessed twenty or twentyfive years old her eyes were attentive but cautious as if she were subtly afraid of me but she smiled at the question just a tune a familiar tune it was one of those lamentations in waltz time that had been so popular in the aftermath of the spin reminds me of a song i used to know it was called après nous yes i had heard it in a bar in venezuela when i was young and alone in the world not a bad tune but i couldnt imagine how it had survived ten centuries how do you know it well thats not easy to explain in a way i grew up with that song really how old are you exactly another smile not as old as you turk findley i have some memories though thats why they assigned me to you im not just your nurse im your translator your guide then maybe you can explain i can explain a lot but not right now you need to rest i can give you something to make you sleep ive been asleep is that how it felt when you were with the hypotheticalslike sleep the question startled me i knew i had been with the hypotheticals in some sense but i had no real memory of it she appeared to know more about the subject than i did perhaps the memories will come back she said do you want to tell me what were running from she frowned i dont understand you all seemed in a hurry to get away from the desert well this world has changed since you were taken up wars were fought here the planet was radically depopulated and has never really recovered in a way a war is still being fought here as if to confirm this statement the aircraft banked sharply treya gave the window a nervous glance a burst of white light obscured the stars and lit the rolling waves below i sat up to get a better view and i thought i saw something on the horizon as the flash faded something like a distant continent or because it was almost geometrically flat an enormous ship then it was gone in the darkness stay down she said the aircraft went into an even steeper curve she ducked into a chair attached to the nearest wall more light bloomed in the window were out of range of their seagoing vessels but their aircraft it took us time to find you she said the others should be safe by now the room will protect you if our vehicle is damaged but you need to lie down it happened almost before the words were out of her mouth there were five aircraft i learned later in our formation we were the last flight out of the equatorian desert the attack came sooner and more powerfully than expected four escort craft went down protecting us and after that we were defenseless i remember treya reaching for my hand i wanted to ask her what kind of war this was i wanted to ask her what she meant by the others but there wasnt time her grip was fiercely tight and her skin was cold then there was sudden heat and a blinding light and we began to fall a combination of programmed emergency maneuvers and sheer luck carried our piece of the broken aircraft as far as the nearest island of vox vox was a seagoing vessela ship in the broadest sensebut it was much more than that word implies vox was an archipelago of floating islands vastly larger than anything that had ever put to sea in my lifetime it was a culture and a nation a history and a religion for nearly five hundred years it had sailed the oceans of the ring of worldstreyas name for the planets that had been linked together by the archways of the hypotheticals its enemies were powerful treya explained and they were close equatoria was an empty world now but an alliance of cortical democracies had sent pursuit vessels they were determined to prevent vox from reaching the arch that connected equatoria to earth she didnt believe they could succeed but the latest attack had been crippling and one of the casualties had been the aircraft in which we were traveling we survived because the compartment in which treya was treating me had been rigged with elaborate survival mechanisms aerogels to cushion us from catastrophic deceleration deployable wing surfaces to glide us to a landing place we had come to rest on one of the outislands of the vox archipelago currently uninhabited and far from the city treya called vox core vox core was the hub of the vox archipelago and it had been the primary target of the attack by the light of dawn we could see a pillar of smoke rising from below the windward horizon there treya said in a traumatized voice that smoke that must be from vox core we left the smoldering lifeship and stood in a grassy meadow as the sun cleared the horizon the network is silent she said it wasnt clear to me what this meant or how she knew it her face was rigid with grief apart from our survival compartment the rest of the aircraft must have fallen into the sea everyone aboard had died except us i asked treya how it happened that we had been singled out to survive not us she said you the aircraft acted to preserve you i just happened to be nearby why me we waited centuries for you for you and the others like you i didnt understand but she was dazed and bruised and i didnt press the question rescue would come she said her people would find us they would send out aircraft even if vox core had been damaged they wouldnt leave us in the wilderness she was wrong about that as it turned out the exterior wall of the downed survival chamber was still steamingit had scorched the meadow grass it landed onand the interior was too hot to use even as a temporary shelter treya and i ferried out a few armloads of salvageable material the survival room had been liberally stocked with what i guessed were pharmaceuticals and medical supplies less generously with packages treya identified as food i grabbed any box she pointed at and we stacked the salvage under a nearby tree not a species i recognized the tree was all we needed for shelter at the moment the air outside was warm the sky clear despite all this physical effort i felt reasonably good much better than i had when i first woke up in the desert i wasnt tired or even especially anxious no doubt because of the drugs treya had pumped into me i didnt feel sedated just calm and energetic and not inclined to dwell on the dangers at hand treya dabbed some sort of ointment on her cuts and scratches which closed immediately then she applied a blue glass tube to the inside of her arm a few minutes later she appeared to be as functional as i felt though she still wore her grief like a mask as the sun cleared the horizon it was possible to see more of the place where we had landed it was a sumptuous landscape when i was little my mother used to read to me from an illustrated childrens bible and the island reminded me of watercolor pictures of eden before the fall rolling meadows carpeted with small cloverlike plants merged into thickets of fruitbearing trees in every direction no lambs or lions though or people or roads not even a path it would help i said if you could explain a little of whats going on thats what i was trained forto help you understand but without the network its hard to know where to start just tell me what a complete stranger might like to know she looked up at the sky at the ominous pillar of smoke to windward her eyes reflected clouds all right she said ill tell you what i can while we wait to be rescued vox had been built and populated by a community of men and women who believed it was their destiny to travel to earth and enter into direct communication with the hypotheticals that was four worlds and five centuries ago treya said since then vox had held steadfastly to her purpose she had traversed three arches making temporary alliances fighting her declared enemies accreting new communities and new artificial outislands until she reached her current configuration as the vox archipelago her enemies the cortical democracies believed any attempt to attract the attention of the hypotheticals was not only doomed but suicidally dangerous and not just for vox itself the disagreement had occasionally escalated to the point of open warfare and twice in the last five hundred years vox had nearly been destroyed but her population had proven to be more disciplined and clever than her enemies or so treya declared when treyas slightly breathless narrative began to slow down i said how did you come to pluck me out of the desert that was planned from the beginning long before i was born you expected to find me there we know from experience and observation how the body of the hypotheticals repairs and restores itself we know from geological evidence that the cycle repeats every nine thousand eight hundred and seventyfive years and we knew from historical records that certain people had been taken up into the renewal cycle in the equatorian desertincluding you what goes in comes out it was predicted almost to the hour her voice became reverent youve been in the presence of the hypotheticals that makes you special thats why we need you need me for what the arch that joins equatoria to earth stopped functioning centuries ago no one has been to earth in all that time but we believe we can make the transit as long as you and the others are with us do you understand nobut i let it pass you said the otherswhat others the others who were taken up into the hypothetical renewal cycle you were there turk findley you must have seen it even if you dont remember it an arch smaller than the ones that connect the worlds but still very large rising out of the desert i remembered it the way you might remember a nightmare by the light of morning the earthquakes it caused had been deadly hypothetical machines had been drawn to it from across the solar system falling from the sky like toxic ash it had killed friends of mine treya called it a temporal arch and implied that it was part of some cycle in the life of the hypotheticals but we hadnt known that at the time i shivered despite the warm air and the comforting pharmaceuticals coursing through my bloodstream it took you up she said and held you in stasis for almost ten thousand years it marked you turk findley the hypotheticals know you thats why youre important you and the others tell me their names i dont know their names i was assigned to you in particular if the network was working properly but its not she hesitated they were probably in vox core at the time of the attack you might be the only survivor so someone has to come for us theyll come as soon as they can theyll find us and theyll take us home so she said though the sky remained blue and vacant that afternoon i scouted the area where wed landed keeping within sight of camp and collecting kindling for a fire many of the trees on this island of the vox archipelago produced edible fruit treya had said and i collected some of that too i bundled together the kindling with a length of ribbony twine salvaged from the lifeship and i tucked the fruityellow pods the size of bell peppersinto a cloth sack also salvaged it felt good to be doing something useful apart from an occasional bird call and the rustling of leaves the only sound was the rhythm of my breathing my feet moving through the meadow grass the rolling landscape would have been soothing if not for the column of smoke still smudging the horizon the smoke was on my mind when i came back to camp i asked treya whether the attack had been nuclear and whether we ought to worry about fallout or radiation she didnt know about thatthere hadnt been a thermonuclear attack on vox since the first orthodoxy wars more than two hundred years before she was born the history she had learned hadnt discussed the effects i guess it doesnt matter i said its not like we can do anything about it and it looks like the wind is favoring us the plume of smoke had begun to feather out parallel to our position treya frowned shielding her eyes and looking to windward vox is a ship under power she said were at the stern of itwe should be downwind of vox core whats that mean we may be rudderless i didnt know what that might imply or what might constitute a rudder on a vessel the size of a small continent but it was confirmation that the damage to vox core had been extensive and that help might not reach us as soon as treya hoped i guessed she had come to the same conclusion she helped me dig a shallow pit for the fire but she was moody and uncommunicative we didnt have a clock to count the hours of the day i slept a little when the stimulants wore off and when i woke the sun was just touching the horizon the air was cooler now treya showed me how to use one of the salvaged tools to light the kindling i had gathered once the fire was crackling i gave some thought to our positionthat is the physical position of vox relative to the coast of equatoria in my day equatoria had been a settled outpost in the new world the planet you reached when you sailed from sumatra through the arch of the hypotheticals if vox was making for earth she would have been headed toward the equatorian side of that same arch aiming to make the transverse journey so i wasnt surprised when the peak of the arch began to glitter in the darkening sky just after sunset the arch was a hypothetical construct built to their incomprehensible scale back home its legs were embedded in the floor of the indian ocean and its apex extended beyond the atmosphere of the earth its equatorian twin was the same size and may even have been in some sense the same physical object one arch two worlds long after sunset the peak of it still reflected the light of the sun a thread of silver high overhead ten thousand years hadnt changed it treya looked up steadily and whispered something quiet in her own language when she had finished i asked her whether the words had been a song or a prayer maybe both you might call it a poem can you translate it its about the cycles of the sky the life of the hypotheticals the poem says theres no such thing as a beginning or an ending i dont know anything about that im afraid theres a lot you dont know the unhappiness in her face was unmistakable i told her i didnt understand what had happened to vox core but i was sorry for her loss she gave me back a sad smile and im sorry for your loss i hadnt thought of what had happened to me that wayas a loss something to be mourned it was true i was ten irrevocable centuries away from home everything known and familiar was gone but i had been trying for most of my life to put a wall between myself and my past and i hadnt succeeded yet some things are taken away from you some you leave behindand some you carry with you world without end come morning treya gave me another hit from the apparently inexhaustible supply of pharmaceuticals she carried it was all the consolation she could offer and i accepted it gladly if help was coming it would have come by now we cant wait forever we have to walk to vox core she meant to the burning capital of her floating nation is that possible i think so we have all the food we need right here and if we stay close to the wreckage well be easier to find no turk we have to get to core before vox crosses the arch but its not just that the network is still down how is that a problem she frowned in a way i had begun to recognize struggling to find english words for an unfamiliar concept the network isnt just a passive connection there are parts of my body and mind that depend on it depend on it for what you seem to be doing okay the drugs ive been giving myself are helpful but they wont last forever i need to get back to vox coretake my word for it so she insisted and i was in no position to argue with her it was probably true about the drugs she had dosed herself twice that morning and it was obvious she was getting less mileage out of the pharmaceuticals than she had the day before so we bundled up all the useful salvage we could carry and began to walk we settled into a steady rhythm as the morning unfolded if the war was still going on there was no sign of it the enemy had no permanent bases in equatoria treya said and the attack had been a flailing lastditch attempt to keep us from attempting to cross the arch vox had launched a retaliatory strike before her defenses went down the empty blue sky was probably a sign that the counterattack had been successful the rolling land offered no real obstacles and we aimed ourselves at the pillar of smoke still rising from beyond the horizon around noon we crested a small hill that allowed a view to the margins of the islandocean on three sides and to windward a hump of land that must have been the next island in the chain more interestingly four towers rose above the canopy of the forest ahead of usmanmade structures windowless and black maybe twenty or thirty stories tall the towers were separated from one another by many miles and heading for any one of them would have required a serious detourbut if there were people there i suggested maybe we could get some help no treya shook her head fiercely no theres no one inside the towers are machines not places where people live they collect ambient radiation and pump it down below below down to the hollow part of the island where the farms are you keep your farms underground there was plenty of fertile land up here not to mention sunlight but no she said vox was designed to travel through inhospitable or changing environments all along the ring of worlds all the worlds in the ring were habitable but conditions varied from planet to planet the archipelagos food sources had to be protected from changes in the length of days or seasons wild variations in temperature greater or lesser degrees of sunlight or ultraviolet radiation over the long term aboveground agriculture would have been as impossible as raising crops on the deck of an aircraft carrier the forest here was lush but that was because vox had been anchored in hospitable climates for most of the last hundred years that might change treya said if we cross to earth originally these islands had been bare slabs of artificial granite the topsoil had accumulated over centuries and had been colonized by escaped cultivars and windblown seed from islands and continents on two neighboring worlds can we get down to the farmland possibly but it wouldnt be wise whyare the farmers dangerous without the network they might be its difficult to explain but the network also functions as a social control mechanism until its restored we should avoid untutored mobs the farm folk get rowdy when theyre off their leash she gave me a disdainful look please dont make facile judgments about things you dont understand she adjusted her pack and walked a few paces ahead of me cutting short the conversation i followed her down the hillside back into the shadow of the forest i tried to gauge our progress by marking the relative positions of the black towers whenever we crossed an open ridge i calculated that we might reach the windward shore in a day or two the weather turned sour that afternoon heavy clouds rolled in followed by erratic winds and bursts of rain we marched on grimly until we began to lose daylight then we found a sheltering grove and stretched a sheet of waterproof cloth between the closely woven branches to serve as a shelter i succeeded in getting a small fire going as night fell we huddled under the tarp the air reeked of woodsmoke and wet earth treya hummed to herself while i heated rations it was the same song she had been humming in the aircraft before it was destroyed i asked her again how she had come to know a tenthousandyearold popular song it was part of my training im sorry i didnt realize it was bothering you its not i know that song first time i heard it i was in venezuela waiting for a tanker assignment little bar there that played american tunes whered you hear it she looked past the fire out into the dark of the forest on a file server in my bedroom my parents were out so i cranked it up and danced her voice was faint where was this champlain she said champlain new york state up by the canadian border champlain on earth she looked at me strangely then her eyes widened she put her hand to her mouth treya are you all right apparently not she grabbed her rucksack fumbled through it then pulled out the pharmaceutical dispenser and pressed it against her arm as soon as she was breathing normally she said im sorry that was a mistake please dont ask me about these things maybe i can help if you tell me whats going on not now she curled closer to the fire and closed her eyes by morning the rain had turned to mist and fog the wind had calmed but during the night it had blown down a bounty of ripe fruit an easy breakfast the column of smoke from vox core was invisible in the overcast but two of the dark towers were close enough to serve as landmarks by midmorning the fog had thinned and by noon the clouds had lifted and we could hear the sound of the sea treya was talkative by daylight probably because she was fairly heavily medicated she had applied the ampoule to her arm twice already obviously she was leaning on the drug as a way of compensating for the loss of the network whatever that meant to her and just as obviously her problem was getting worse she started talking almost as soon as we broke camp and it wasnt a conversation but a nervy absentminded monologuea cocaine monologue i would have thought in another time and place i listened closely and didnt interrupt though half of what she said made no sense in the odd moments when she paused the wind in the trees seemed suddenly loud she told me she had been born to a family of workers in the far leeward quarter of vox core both her father and her mother had been equipped with neural interfaces that allowed them to perform any of dozens of skilled jobs overseeing infrastructure or implementing novel instrumentalities they were a lower caste than the managers but they were proud of their versatility treya herself had been trained from birth to join a group of therapists scholars and medics whose sole purpose was to interact with the survivors plucked from the equatorian desert as a liaison therapist assigned specifically to me knowing only as much about me as had been preserved in historical records my name and date of birth and the fact that i had vanished into the temporal arch she needed to speak colloquial english as it had been spoken ten centuries ago she had learned it from the network but the network had given her more than a vocabulary it had given her an entire secondary identitya set of implanted memories synthesized from twentyfirstcentury documents and channeled through the interactive node that had been attached to her spinal cord at birth she called this secondary personality an impersonanot just a lexicon but a life with all its context of places and people thoughts and feelings the primary source from which her impersona had been constructed was a woman named allison pearl allison pearl was born in champlain new york a little after the end of the spin allisons diary had survived as an historical document and the network had synthesized treyas impersona from those diary entries when i need an english word i get it from allison she loved words she loved writing them words like orange the fruit a fruit ive never seen or tasted allison loved oranges what i have from her is the word and the concept the roundness and brightness and the color of an orange though not the qualia the taste but memories like that are dangerous they have to be kept within boundaries without the networks neurological constraints allisons personality is beginning to metastasize i reach for my memories and i come up with hers its confusing and it will only get worse the drugs the drugs help but only temporarily treya said all that and more insofar as i understood it i believed she was telling the truth i believed her because her voice had taken on an american twang colored with phrases that might have been lifted directly from allison pearls diary it explained the song she had been compulsively humming her fits of absentmindedness the way she stared into space with her head cocked as if she were listening to a voice i couldnt hear i know these memories arent real theyre made of network inferences and collations of ancient data but even talking about it this way feels strange as if as if what she turned and stared at me probably she hadnt realized she was talking out loud i shouldnt have interrupted her as if i dont belong here as if this is all some peculiar future she scuffed her heel into the damp earth as if im a stranger here like you not long before sunset we reached the edge of the island edge not shore here the islands artificiality was obvious the forest gave way to a slope of scrub grass and exposed rock that fell away almost vertically a drop of some few hundred feet to the sea across that gap was the next island in the vox archipelago separated from this one by a chasm half a mile wide pity there isnt a bridge i said there is treya said tersely a sort of bridge we ought to be able to see it from here she got down on her belly and scooted to the edge of the cliff motioning for me to do the same heights dont bother me particularlyi had flown airplanes for a living in the world before this onebut inching over that vertical drop wasnt the most comfortable thing i had ever done down there treya said pointing do you see it the sun was sinking and the chasm was already in shadow seabirds nested where centuries of wind and rain had carved hollows in the obdurate artificial rock far to the left i could see what she was pointing at an enclosed tunnel connected this artificial island to the next though only the far end of it was visible around the precise curvature of the islands wall the tunnel was a saltrimed shade of black the same color as the sea below vertigo and the odd perspective made it hard to judge its true size but i guessed you could have put a dozen semi trucks abreast and driven them from one end to the other with room to spare even so there were no spars ropes wires or girders supporting itsomehow the structure carried its own weight each island in the archipelago contained its own drive system slaved to a central controller at vox core still i couldnt help wondering about the physical stress born by the link between these two enormous floating masses even if the tunnel itself was bearing only a fraction of the load automated freight carriers pass through the tunnel carrying raw biomass to vox core and refined goods back to the farmers treya said its not meant to be crossed on foot but itll have to do how do we get inside we dont we might be able to do that from down in the farmholds but not from here well have to cross on the outside i held that thought for a moment trying to keep it at a reassuring distance there are stairs carved into the cliff she added you cant see them from this angle but they were cut during the original construction so theyre probably somewhat eroded even the foamedgranite composite the islands were made of couldnt resist wind and salt water indefinitely it wont be an easy climb the top of the tunnel is a curved surface and it looks pretty slick it may be wider than you think or it may not we dont have a choice but it was too late to begin the attempt with only a couple of hours of daylight left we set up a fresh camp back in the forest i watched treya take another hit from her drug syringe i said is that thing bottomless it refills itself it has its own metabolism it draws a little blood during the injections and uses that as raw material to catalyze active molecules it runs on body heat and ambient light for you it fabricated a drug to suppress anxiety what it gives me is something different i had stopped taking doses when she offered themi had decided to live with my anxiety for better or worse how does it know what to synthesize she frowned the way she did whenever she tripped over a concept for which her ghostly tutor allison pearl didnt have a ready word it samples blood chemistry and makes an educated guess but no it isnt bottomless it needs to be refreshed and this one is getting tired she added if you want to use it though thats all right no whats it giving you a kind of you could call it a cognitive enhancer it helps maintain the boundary between my real and my virtual memories but its only a temporary solution she shivered in the firelight what i really need is the network tell me about the network its what some kind of internal wireless interface not exactly what you mean by that but yes in a sense except that the signals i receive are expressed as biological and neurological regulators everybody on vox wears a node and were all linked by the network the network helps us formulate a limbic consensus i dont know why it hasnt been repaired even if the transponders at vox core were destroyed workers should have been able to restore basic functionality by now unless the processors themselves were damaged but they were built to sustain anything short of a direct hit from a highyield weapon maybe thats what happeneda direct hit she shrugged unhappily by way of response which means theres a good chance were marching toward a radioactive ruin we dont have a choice she said i sat up after she fell asleep nursing the fire without the calming drugs my own recent memories had begun to firm up just days ago i had been trying to survive a series of earthquakes generated by the temporal arch as it rose from its dormant state in the equatorian desert now i was here on vox you cant really comprehend events like that i thought you can only endure them i let the fire burn down to a glow of embers the arch of the hypotheticals glimmered overhead an ironic smile among the stars and the rush of the sea was amplified by the echo from the nearby cliffs i wondered about the people who had nuked vox core the cortical democracies and why had they done it and whether their reasons were as superficial as treya had suggested i was a neutral in the conflict insofar as that was possible it wasnt my fight and i wondered whether allison pearl the champlain ghost might be similarly neutral maybe that was what treya found so disconcerting allison and i were both shades of a disinterested past both potentially disloyal to vox core we broke camp at dawn and followed the curving cliff until we came to what treya had called stairs broad declivities cut into the face of the granite time had beveled the steps into sloping ledges separated by giddy tenfoot drops every surface was slick with mossy growths and bird dung and the deeper we descended the louder the roar of the ocean became eventually the high edges of the two adjoining islands closed off all of the sky apart from a few slanting rays of sunlight we made slow progress and twice we paused while treya took hits from her hightech syringe her expression was grim and under that terrified she kept glancing backward and up as if she was afraid we were being followed by the angle of the light i guessed it was past noon when i helped her down the last vertical gap to the roof of the tunnel itself the roof of the tunnel was broader than it had looked from above and we were able to stand on it safely enough though it was unnerving to walk on a surface that rounded away on both sides to a sheer drop it was maybe a half mile to the opposite anchor point now concealed by mist where we would have to do another round of serious climbing with any luck before darkness set in night would come fast down here for the sake of distraction i asked treya what she or allison pearl remembered about champlain im not sure its safe to answer that question but she sighed and went on champlain cold winters hot summers swimming in the lake at catfish point my family was broke most of the time those were the years after the spin when everybody was talking about how the hypotheticals might actually be benevolent protecting us but i never believed that walking down those champlain sidewalks you know the way concrete glitters in the summer sun i couldnt have been more than ten years old but i remember thinking that was how we must look to the hypotheticalsnot just us but our whole planet just a glimmer underfoot something you notice and then forget thats not how treya talks about the hypotheticals she gave me an angry look i am treya and walked a few paces more allison was wrong the hypotheticalstheyre gods by any reasonable definition but theyre not indifferent she stopped and squinted at me wiping salt mist from her eyes you ought to know that maybe so before long we reached the midpoint of the transit where the wind came roaring between the chasm walls in a focused gale and we had to crawl on our hands and knees like ants clinging to a rainy clothesline conversation was impossible intermittent vibrations came through the palms of my hands from the tunnel as of metal groaning under incalculable stress i wondered what it would take to tear this damaged archipelago apartanother nuclear attack or something as simple as a high sea and a strong wind given what had already happened i pictured cables the size of subway trains snapping islandships like battered piñatas spilling their contents into the sea it wasnt a reassuring thought if not for treya i might have turned back but if not for treya i wouldnt have been here in the first place finally we came into the shadow of the opposing cliff wall where the wind eased to a low moan and we could stand upright again the stairs that had been cut into the granite cliff were identical to those across the gorge eroded and mossy steep and stinking of the sea we had climbed about a dozen of them when treya gasped and came to a dead halt the ledge above us was full of people they must have seen us coming must have hidden until they were ready to show themselves it didnt look like a welcoming committee farmers treya whispered there were thirty or so of them male and female all staring at us with grim expressions many of them carried implements that might have been weapons treya cast a quick look back at the bridge we had just crossed but it was too late and too dark to run we were outnumbered and effectively cornered she reached for my hand and took it her skin was cold i felt the beat of her pulse let me talk to them she said i boosted her up the next ledge and she pulled me after and then we were level with the crowd the farmers surrounded us treya held out her hands in a conciliatory gesture then the head man stepped up at least i guessed he was the head man he wasnt wearing any insignia to mark his rank but no one appeared to question his authority he carried a metallic rod the length of a walking stick tapered at the end to a fine point like the people behind him he was tall his dark skin was finely wrinkled before he could open his mouth treya said something in her native language he listened impatiently in english treya whispered i told him youre one of the uptaken if that matters to him at all but it didnt he barked a few words at treya she said something hesitant in return he barked again she bowed her head and trembled whatever happens she whispered dont interfere the head man put his hands on her shoulders he pushed her down to the slick surface of the granite tier and gave her a shove so that she sprawled onto her stomach her cheekbone grazed the rock and began to bleed she closed her eyes in pain i had been in my share of fights i wasnt a particularly good fighter but i couldnt stand passively and watch i lunged at the farmer before i could reach him his friends had their hands on me holding me back they forced me to my knees the boss farmer put his foot on treyas shoulder holding her down then he raised his weapon and slowly lowered it the sharp end touched a knob of treyas spine just below the neck her body stiffened at the pressure of it then the farmer drove the point down hard chapter three sandra and bose sandra went to bed convinced the document was a fakea bad joke though it was too late to call bose and accuse him of it although if it was a joke it was a pointlessly elaborate one she couldnt believe that orrin mather the shy and inarticulate young man she had interviewed at state had written any of this her best guess was that he had copied the text from some science fiction novel and pretended it was his own work though she couldnt imagine why so she tried to shrug off the unanswerable questions and get a decent nights rest come dawn she had managed she reckoned at most three hours of useful sleep which meant she would go through the day sandyeyed and irritable and the day would be another hot one judging by the haze tinting the view from her living room window the kind of smog only august in houston could brew up she tried to call bose from the dashboard phone in her car but the number bounced to voice mail she left her name and work number and added is it possible you sent me the wrong file or maybe i ought to be interviewing you for state care please call as soon as you can and clear this up sandra had been employed at the greater houston area state care facility long enough to have a feeling for the placethe flow of its internal politics the rhythm of daily business she could tell in other words when something was up this morning something was up the work she did had a certain moral ambiguity even at the best of times the state care system had been mandated by congress in the messy aftermath of the spin when homelessness and mental illness had risen to epidemic levels the legislation had been well intended and it was still true that for anyone with a fullblown psychiatric disorder state care was better than life on the street the doctors were sincere the pharmaceutical protocols were finely tuned and the communal housing while basic was reasonably clean and well policed too often however people were swept into state care who didnt belong there petty criminals the belligerent poor ordinary folks who had been driven to chronic bewilderment by economic hardship and state care once you were given involuntary commitment status wasnt easy to leave a generation of local pols had campaigned against inmates being dumped back on the street and states halfway house program was forever under attack from nimby activists which meant the state care population was continually rising while its budget remained fixed which led in turn to underpaid staff overpopulated residential camps and periodic scandals in the press as an intake physician it was sandras job to shortcircuit those problems at the front end to admit the genuinely needy while turning away or referring to other social welfare agencies the merely confused in theory it was as simple as checking off a patients symptoms and writing a recommendation in fact her work involved a great deal of surmise and many painful judgment calls turn away too many cases and the police or the courts would get testy accept too many and management began to complain about overinclusiveness worse her cases werent abstractions but people wounded weary angry sad and occasionally violent people people who too often saw state care as a kind of prison sentence which in a real sense it was so there was a certain inevitable tension a balance to be maintained and within the institution itself there were invisible wires that vibrated to the right or wrong notes coming into the wing where she had her office sandra noticed the nurse at the reception station giving her covert looks a vibrating wire wary now she paused at the warren of plastic cubbyholes where staff kept paperwork on pending cases the nurse whose name was wattmore said dont bother looking for the mather chart dr coledr congreve has it i dont understand dr congreve took orrin mathers case file isnt that what i just said why would he do that i guess youll have to ask him nurse wattmore turned back to her monitor and clicked a few keys dismissively sandra went to her office and put in a call to congreve arthur congreve was her superior at state he supervised all the intake staff sandra didnt like himhe struck her as aloof professionally indifferent and far too concerned with producing a smoothly trending flow of statistics that would impress the budget committees since he had been appointed last year two of the facilitys best intake physicians had elected to quit rather than submit to his patient quotas sandra couldnt imagine why he might have pulled the mather file without warning her individual cases were usually far below congreves personal radar congreve started talking as soon as he picked up help you sandra im in b wing by the way about to go into a meeting so lets make this quick nurse wattmore tells me you took the orrin mather file yeah i thought i saw her beady little eyes light up look im sorry i didnt talk to you beforehand its only that we have a new intake persondr abe fein ill be introducing him at the next general meetingand i thought i should walk him through a safe case mathers the least troublesome candidate weve got on hand and i didnt want to start out the new guy with a hostile subject dont worry ill be backstopping fein all the way i didnt know we had a new hire check your memos fein did his internship at baylor in dallas very promising and as i say ill keep him on a short leash until he gets a handle on what we do here thing is i already put in the preliminaries with orrin mather i think i established a little bit of rapport with him i assume everything pertinent is in the file is there anything else sandra i dont mean to be rude but i have people waiting she knew it would be useless to push despite his medical degree congreve had been hired by the board of directors for his managerial talents as far as he was concerned the intake psychiatrists were nothing more than hired help no nothing else okay well talk later threat or promise sandra settled behind her desk she was disappointed obviously and a little angry with congreve for his preemptive behavior not that it was uncharacteristic she thought about the file on orrin mather she hadnt entered anything into her notes about officer boses interest in the case shed promised bose she would be discreet about the scifi narrative mather had allegedly written was that promise still binding under the circumstances she was ethically required to divulge to congreve or the new guy dr fein anything that might be relevant to the evaluation but intake evaluation was a weeklong process and she guessed there was no need for full disclosure just yet at least not until she had a better sense of why bose was interested and whether the document she had been reading had in fact been written by orrin mather shed have to ask bose about that and as soon as possible as for orrin himself there was no rule against paying him a social visit was there even if he was no longer her patient nonviolent patients awaiting assessment were encouraged to socialize in the supervised lounge but orrin wasnt the sociable type sandra guessed he would be alone in his room which proved to be the case she found him sitting crosslegged on his matttress like a bony buddha staring at the cinderblock wall opposite the window these small rooms were pleasant enough if you ignored the evidence that they were effectively prison cells the shatterproof window panes threaded with fiberglass the conspicuous absence of all hooks hangers and sharp edges this one had been recently repainted disguising the generations of obscene graffiti scratched into the walls orrin smiled when he saw her his face was guileless transparent to every emotion big head high cheekbones eyes pleasant but open too wide he looked like he would be easy to lie to dr cole hi they told me i wouldnt be seeing you again another intake physician has been assigned to your case orrin but we can still talk if you like okay he said thats fine i spoke to officer bose yesterday do you remember officer bose yes maam of course i do officer bose is the only policeman who took an interest in me poe lease man in orrins trailerpark accent hes the one who called my sister ariel is she in town yet have you heard i dont know but ill be talking to officer bose lateri can ask she added not knowing how to approach the subject except bluntly he mentioned the notebooks you were carrying when the police picked you up orrin seemed neither surprised nor upset that sandra knew about the notebooks though his sunny expression dimmed a little officer bose says the police have to keep them for now but i can have them back sooner or later he frowned buckling a v under his high hairline thats true isnt it no matter what they decide about me here if officer bose says so i think its probably true are the notebooks important to you yes maam i suppose they are may i ask you whats written in them well thats hard to say is it a story you could call it that i guess whats the story about orrin well its hard for me to keep in my mind thats why i like to have the notebooks so i can refresh my memory it has to do with a certain man and a certain woman more than that its about you could say god or at least the hypotheticals hahpoe thet ickles did you write the story yourself peculiarly orrin blushed i wrote it down he said finally but i dont know i can say for sure i wrote it im not much of a writer never was a teacher at park valley schoolthats back in north carolinatold me i dont know a noun from a verb and never will and i guess thats true words dont come easy to me except except what orrin except those words sandra didnt want to push it any harder i understand she said though she didnt one more stab at it turk findley is that someone in your story or is he a real person orrins blush deepened i dont guess he exists maam i guess i made him up it was obvious he was lying but sandra left it at that she smiled and nodded when she stood up to leave orrin asked her about the flowers growing in the small garden outside the window of his cinderblock room did she know by what name they were called those theyre called bird of paradise his eyes widened he grinned thats their real name mmhm huh because those flowers surely do look like birds dont they the yellow beak the rounded head the single drop of crystalline sap that glinted like an eye yes they do its like a flower that has the idea of a bird inside it only nobody put it there unless you could say god did god or nature maybe comes to the same thing you have a nice day dr cole thank you orrin you too bose finally returned her call midafternoon though his voice was hard to hear coming through a background of what sounded like mass chanting sorry he said im down at the ship channel its some kind of environmental demonstration we have about fifty people sitting on the railroad tracks in front of a string of tanker cars more power to them sandras sympathies were entirely with the demonstrators the environmentalists wanted to ban the import of fossil fuels from beyond the arch of the hypotheticals in an attempt to keep global warming under five degrees celsius sufficient unto the planet are the carbon resources thereof they believed and to sandra it was ridiculously obvious that they were right as far as she could tell the exploitation of the vast oil reserves under the equatorian desert was a disaster in progress enabling a mad prosperity purchased at the price of redoubled co emissions the generation that had grown up in the wake of the spin wanted cheap gas and boom times and no cavilling voices at the table and the whole world was or would be paying the piper bose said im not sure having an activist crushed by a freight train would be absolutely helpful you got the document i sent yes she said wondering how to proceed you read it yes officer bose you can just call me bose my friends do okay but look i still dont know what you want from me do you honestly believe orrin mather wrote the text you sent me i know it hardly seems plausible even orrin is a reluctant to take credit for it i asked him about that he told me he wrote it down but he wasnt sure he actually wrote it as if somebody dictated it to him which i guess would explain a few things anyway what do you want from me exactly literary criticism because im not much of a science fiction fan theres more to the document than what youve seen im hoping i can send you another batch of pages today and maybe we can get together facetoface like say lunch tomorrow to talk about the details was she willing to take another step into this strangeness oddly she discovered she was put it down to curiosity and maybe compassion for the bashful childman she had discovered in orrin mather and the fact that she had found bose to be reasonably pleasant company she told him he could send along more pages but she felt compelled to add theres a complication you ought to know about im not orrins case physician anymore my boss turned him over to a trainee now it was boses turn to pause sandra tried to make out the chanting in the background somethingsomething our childrens children well damn bose said and i doubt my boss would be willing to take you into his confidence no offense hes youre talking about congreve people at hpd say hes a bureaucratic prick no comment okay but you still have access to orrin i can talk to him if thats what you mean what i dont have is any kind of decisionmaking authority complicates things bose admitted but id still like your opinion again it would help if i knew whats so important to you about orrin and these notebooks of his better if we discuss it tomorrow sandra negotiated the lunch details a place reasonably close to state care but slightly more upscale than the strip mall alternatives then bose said gotta go thanks dr cole sandra she said chapter four treyas story sllisons story you want to know what it was like what happened to vox and afterward well here it is something to leave behind you might say something for the wind and the stars to read i was born to the name treya and a fivesyllable suffix i wont repeat here but it might be better to think of me as allison pearl mark ii i had a tenyear gestation a painful eightday labor and a traumatic birth from my first full day of life i knew i was a fraud and i knew just as truly that i had no choice in the matter i was born seven days before vox was due to cross the arch to ancient earth i was born into the custody of rebel farmers born with my own blood weeping down my back by the time i remembered how to speak the blood had mostly dried the farmers had crushed and carved out of my body and subsequently destroyed my personal limbic implant my network interface my node because the node had been attached to my spine at the third vertebra almost since birth the pain was intense i woke up from the trauma with waves of agony sparking up my neck and into my skull but the worst part was what i didnt feel which was the rest of my body i was numb from the shoulders downnumb helpless hurt and frightened beyond thought eventually the farmers poked me with some kind of crude anesthetic from their primitive pharmacopoeia not out of kindness i suspect but simply because they were tired of hearing me scream the next time i came to myself my body was tingling and itching unbearably but that was okay because it meant i was recovering my physical functions even without the node my augmented body systems were busy splicing damaged nerves and repairing bone which meant i would eventually be able to sit up stand up even walk so i began to take a greater interest in my surroundings i was in the back of a cart lying on a sort of bed of dried vegetable matter the cart was moving along at a brisk pace the walls of the cart were too high to see over but it was open to daylight i could see the cloudflecked sky and the occasional treetop swaying past there was no way of knowing how much time had passed since i was captured and that was the question that preyed on my mind above all others how close were we to vox core and how close was vox to the arch of the hypotheticals my mouth was dry but my voice worked well enough hey i called out a couple of times before i realized i was speaking english so i switched to voxish veche veche mi all that yelling was painful and i shut up when i realized nobody was paying attention it was dusk when the cart finally jostled to a stop the first stars were coming out the sky was a shade of blue that reminded me of the stained glass in the church back in champlain im not a big fan of churches but i always liked stained glass the way it looked when the sunday morning sun lit it up i could hear the sound of farmer voices farmers speak voxish with an accent as if they all went around carrying stones in their mouths i could smell their cooking which was torture because i hadnt been given anything to eat eventually a face appeared above the side of the cart it was a mans face his skin was dark and wrinkly but that was true of all the farmers he was bald except for his bushy eyebrows his eyes were yellow around the iris and he looked at me with undisguised distaste you he said can you sit up i need to eat if you can sit up you can eat i spent the next few minutes forcing my stillunwieldy body into a sitting position the farmer didnt offer to help he watched me with a kind of clinical disinterest when i finally had my back braced against the wall of the cart i said i did what you wanted please feed me he glowered and went away i didnt really expect to see him again but he came back with a bowl of something green and glutinous which he put down next to me if you can use your hands he said its yours he turned away wait he sighed and looked back well tell me your name why what does it matter it doesnt matter i just want to know he said his name was choi he said his family was digger level three harvest quarter in my head i translated it into english as digger choi and youre treya worker outrider therapeutics sneering at the core honorifics i heard myself say my name is allison pearl we read your internal tags you cant lie allison i insisted pearl call yourself whatever you want i put my disobedient hand into the bowl of food and cupped it to my mouth it was a globby green muck that tasted like mown grass and i lost about half of every handful but my body accepted it hungrily digger choi stuck around until i was finished then took the bowl i was still hungry digger choi refused my request for seconds is this how you treat your prisoners we dont take prisoners what am i then a hostage you think im that valuable you might be if not it will be simple enough to kill you because i could move my body again the farmers took the precaution of tying my arms behind me they left me like that all nightin some ways it was worse that being paralyzed and in the morning they pulled me out of the cart and frogmarched me to another one identical in all ways except that it contained turk findley during the transfer i was able to survey the farmers encampment we had reached the island that contained vox core but here at the periphery it still looked like an outislandan uncultivated wilderness locally all the fruitbearing trees had been stripped to feed the marching farmers there were a lot of them an army of them i estimated maybe a thousand warm bodies in this meadow alone and i could see the smoke from other encampments the farmers were armed with makeshift blades and machine parts filched from harvesters and threshing machines weapons that would have been laughable in the face of a fully networked core militia but under the present circumstances who could say the farmers themselves were all dark and wrinkled descendents of the longago martian diaspora digger choi escorted me through a mob of his farmer compatriots who gave me hard looks and shouted a few hard words the cart he dragged me to was larger than the one id been dumped in from the outside it was basically a box on two wheels with long poles out front so an animal or a robot or an ablebodied farmer could drag it simple tech but not as primitive as it appeared the farmers carts were made of a smart material that transformed random bounces into forward momentum they were selfbalancing and could adapt to rough terrain they also made a suitable prison if your prisoners were securely bound turk was securely bound and so was i digger choi lowered the rear wall of the cart pushed me inside and locked the barricade behind me i rolled up against turk findley whose hands were also tied behind his back and we spent an awkward moment sorting ourselves out and bracing our legs so we could face each other turk was badly bruisedhe had put up a serious fight when the farmers took him the skin over his left cheekbone was cloudy black fading to green his left eye was swollen shut he looked at me sidelong and with unconcealed astonishment probably he had thought i was dead killed when they tore out my limbic implant i wanted to say something reassuring but i wasnt sure where to start he remembered me as treya of vox core and that was true enough i continued to be treya in a sense but only in a sense i had two histories treya had described allison pearl as the virtual mentor who had acculturated her to twentyfirstcentury american customs and language allison pearl wasnt real the way most people use that word but i was allison now fully installed fully functional it was allison who was running the showi was as the managers used to say psychologically annealed and anyway that wasnt the biggest problem we were facing youre alive he said obviously he gave me a curious look probably because it wasnt the kind of thing treya would have said i thought they killed you all that blood it had dried to a brown bib on my tunic it wasnt me they killed it was my network interface the node sits over my spine so it can talk to my brain the farmers have implants too but they must have disabled theirs as soon as the network failed they hate the nodes because the nodes keep them docile and useful so theyre what slaves this is a slave rebellion noits not as simple as that being allison pearl i held no brief for the social structure of vox but i had a powerful secondary memory of treyas fierce loyalty treya wasnt a bad person even if she was a drone i didnt want him thinking of her as some kind of slave overseer these peoples ancestors were taken captive centuries ago they were radical bionormatives part of the martian diaspora they refused to be assimilated so they made a bargain their lives in exchange for agricultural labor turk was still giving me uneasy looksthe blood on my clothes the way i was talkingand i figured it would be best to explain as bluntly as possible they cut out my node i said treya was a translator right for years she accessed allison pearl as a secondary personality she ran me like a junior mind if you understand what im saying and a lot of her own memories and personality got sourced out to the network we were all tangled up me and treya but the node always made sure treya was the controlling entity but now the nodes gone and im dominant she must have ceded a whole bunch of neural real estate to me over the last decade big mistake from her point of view though she could hardly have expected a tribe of insurgent farmers to cut out her network interface excuse me turk said slowly but who am i talking to again allison im allison pearl now allison he said and treyas what dead the network can still embody her if it wants to shes potential but shes not incarnate technical terms crudely translated turk thought this over the future seems like a pretty fuckedup place sometimes if you can just take it on faith that im allison now maybe we can get on with the business of trying to save ourselves you know how to do that the point is well die unless we get somewhere safe before vox crosses the arch that might not be possible you saw the sky before dawn the arch is at zenith a straight line across the meridian that means i know what it means it meant we were dangerously close to the crossing so whats safe allison pearl and how do we get there the farmers had eaten their breakfast and gathered their gear and now they were ready to resume their march on vox core a couple of men picked up the drawpoles of the cart which had the effect of rolling us around like peas in a skillet it made conversation awkward but i told turk what he needed to know he was almost up to speed by the time we caught our first glimpse of the ruins of vox core turk was a quick learner though the ten thousand years he had spent among the hypotheticals hadnt taught him much well how could it have in fact he had never really been among them even though it was conventional to talk about the people who passed through the temporal arch as if they had been touched by vast hyperintelligent powers treya believed he had spent those years in glorious communion with the hypotheticals whether he remembered it or not but now that i was allison pearl it sounded like so much quasireligious bs if youve traveled through any of the arches that connect the eight worlds youve been among the hypotheticals to just the same degree as turk had been lots of people even in my day allisons day crossed the arch from the indian ocean to equatoria which meant they had been taken up and carried across the stars by hypothetical forces that didnt make them gods or even godlikeit didnt make them anything at all except unusually well traveled but time is a different dimension supposedly spookier there were temporal arches elsewhere in the worlds of course theyre a common hypothetical construct we knew from geological evidence that temporal arches appeared and disappeared every ten thousand or so years they were part of some hypothetical feedback mechanism storing and dispensing information but the first temporal arch to engulf living human beings was the one that had popped up in the equatorian desert and swallowed among others turk findley which meant it would be the first to disgorge its human cargo which it had done precisely on schedule a couple of weeks ago so turk was one of the first people to exit a temporal arch alive but oh the bullshit that had accrued around that simple fact it was an article of voxish faith that the survivors would emerge transformed conduits between mere humanity and the forces that had engineered the ring of worlds and that those survivors would be able to shepherd us through a dysfunctional arch back to old earth treya had never questioned that dogma and maybe it was even true to some degree but if we did successfully manage the transit to earth that was liable to be more a problem than a solution because in all likelihood earth was no longer a habitable planet i said some of this to turk he asked me whether the people of vox were entirely sane believing what they did i felt the ghost of treya take offense at the question sane compared to what vox has been a functioning community for hundreds of years its survived a lot of battles its a limbic democracy modulated by the network and all this stuff about the hypotheticals and old earth is written into the code might even be some truth in it i dont know but vox has enemies turk pointed out who went to the trouble of bombing it they would have finished us by now if they had anything left to throw so well pass under the arch one way or another two possible outcomes i told him if nothing happens well be left adrift and defenseless on the equatorian ocean probably invaded and occupied by the bionormatives if they get their act together and if we do make it to earth no way of knowing but earth was barely habitable when the arch stopped working and that was a thousand years ago give or take the oceans were going bad huge bacterial blooms emitting massive amounts of hydrogen sulfide into the air we have to assume an atmosphere poisonous enough to kill any unprotected living thing which is why it would be a very bad idea to be out of doors if we cross so where do we find protection the only real safe place is vox core it can seal itself and recycle its air thats where the farmers are heading with the network and other systems down they cant count on protection for the outislands they want to get inside the walls before the transit but there isnt room in core for every outlier community in the archipelago the farmers will have to fight their way in at the end of another days march the farmer militia halted for the night digger choi lowered the gate of the cart pushed two bowls of green gruel inside and untied our hands so we could eat turk stood up for the first time today rubbing his wrists and legs he balanced himself against the wall of the cart and turned his head to see where we were that was when he got his first look at vox core the expression on his face was interestingawe and fear mixed together vox core was mostly underground but the fraction of it that showed was impressive enough the farmers had camped in the lee of a low hill and from this angle vox core looked like a jewelry box abandoned by a spendthrift god its halfmilehigh defensive walls were the box the jewels were the hundreds of faceted towers still standing communications and energydistribution points lightgathering surfaces aircraft bays managerial residences to turk i suppose it looked improbably gaudy but i knew because treya had known that every material and every surface served a purposeblack or white facades to sink or radiate heat bluegreen panels doing photosynthetic work rubyred or smoky indigo windows to block or enhance particular frequencies of visible light the setting sun gave it all a soft seductive sheen the part of it that was intact at least there was enough of treya in me to ache at the damage that had been done most of what i recognized as the starboard quadrant of the city was gone that was bad because what lay beneath that part of the visible city was some of vox cores essential infrastructure vox was complexly interconnected and in the past it had sustained major damage without loss of function but even the most decentralized network will fail if it loses too much connectivity and that was what must have happened when the nuke penetrated our defenses it was as if voxs brain had suffered a massive stroke the damage spreading and compounding itself until the whole organism lost function tendrils of smoke still wafted up from the impact point a hole had been punched in the starboard wall of the city which might have provided an entry point for farmer forces except that radioactive and stillsmoldering rubble had barred the gap treya had spent the whole of her life in this city and her shock welled up in me and made my eyes water turkonce he made sure digger choi was out of earshotsaid tell me about the people who did this built the city or dropped the bomb dropped the bomb an alliance of cortical democracies and radical bionormatives they were determined not to let us cross the arch scared well call down some kind of doom by attracting the attention of the hypotheticals you think that might happen it was a question treya would never have entertained treya had been a good voxish citizen blithely convinced that the hypotheticals were benevolent and that human beings could aspire to some kind of intercourse with them but as allison i could be agnostic about it i dont actually know sooner or later we might have to pick sides in one of these fights that would be a luxury i thought to pick a side but for now the question was moot we ate the peagreen gunk we had been given and stood up for a last look around before digger choi came to tie us up for the night the sky had gotten darker and the peak of the arch shimmered almost directly overhead vox core itself had filled with shadows that was the saddest thing of all it seemed to me the darkness of vox core all my life treyas life the core had been ablaze with light it leaked light like a glorious sieve its light was its heartbeat and now it was gone not even a twinkle the farmer attack if it was going to happen at all would have to happen soon until then there was nothing to do but look at the sky and it was obvious from the dire angle of the arch that we were at the critical point of the passage the vox archipelago was big enough that some of it must already be past the midway point but that didnt mattervox would transit all at once or not at all an archand this truth had been established many centuries agowas more like an intelligent filter than a door back when this arch was working it had been able to distinguish between a bird in flight and a boat in the water send the boat from earth to equatoria but leave the bird behind thats not a simple decision the arch had to be able to identify human beings and their works while ignoring the countless other living creatures who inhabited or had once inhabited both worlds crossing an arch in other words wasnt a mechanistic process the arch looked at you evaluated you accepted you or rejected you the most likely outcome was that we wouldnt be admitted to old earth at all but i was more afraid of the other possibility even before the arch stopped working the earth had changed beyond anything turk would have recognized the last refugees from the polar cities had described drastic shifts in the oceanic chemocline hs boiling out of hopelessly eutrophied offshore dead zones massive and sudden dryland extinctions i closed my eyes and drifted into the dazed semiconsciousness that passes for sleep when youre exhausted and hungry and in pain periodically i opened my eyes and looked at turk where he lay in the shadows with his arms bound behind him he was nothing like what treya had once pictured as an emissary from the hypotheticals he looked exactly like what he wasa rootless drifter no longer young and worn almost beyond endurance i guessed he was dreaming because he moaned from time to time maybe i dreamed too what woke me nextstill deep in that long nightwas a sound so loud it cut the darkness like a knife it was a deepthroated hooting continuous and inhuman but familiar familiar dazed i couldnt place it at first but when i recognized it i felt what i had not felt for many days hope i kicked at turk to rouse him he opened his eyes and rolled upright blinking listen i said you know what that is its the alarm turk its the callin the cometoshelter struggling to translate voxish words into ancient english its the fucking airraid siren the wailing was broadcast from the highest towers of vox core it was a signal to get inside the walls that some kind of attack was imminent and surely that was true but here was the important thing if vox core was able to sound the siren at least some of its power must have been restored vox core was alive means what asked turk still fighting sleep it means we have a chance of getting out of this i managed to wiggle upright so i could have a look vox core was still mainly dark but even as i registered that fact a searchlight rayed from the nearest watchtower and swept over the treeless meadows lighting up the farmers as they doused their fires and hurried to suit up for war then there were more lights tower by tower block by block vox core began to reclaim itself from the darkness smaller lights like fireflies scattered from the high aerodromes and those were aircraft armed and lethal it made me giddy i heard myself shouting into the noise here we are come and get us something stupid like that treyas old loyalties bursting out of my throat then the weapons rained down and the farmers began to die chapter five sandra and bose sandra booked off two hours for lunch making creative use of a free hour she had originally scheduled for her next consultation with orrin mather the restaurant where she had arranged to meet bose was crowded with employees from the carpet wholesaler across the highway but the table she snagged was out of the way and screened from the worst of the noise by a hedge of plastic ficus quiet enough for conversation bose nodded approvingly when he arrived he wasnt in uniform he looked better out of police drag sandra thought jeans and a white shirt that set off his complexion she asked him whether he was on duty today he said he was but i dont always wear the blues i work out of robberyhomicide really thats not as impressive as it sounds hpd went through massive reorganization after the spin departments were dismantled and put back together like lego blocks im not a detective i just do grunt work im relatively new in the division so how does that connect you to orrin mather he frowned ill explain but can we talk about the document first i notice you call it the document not orrins document so you dont believe he wrote it im not saying that you want to hear my opinion before you give me yours in other words okay well lets start with the obvious the pages you sent me appear to constitute an adventure story set in the future the vocabulary is way beyond anything ive heard from orrin the story isnt especially sophisticated but it displays a grasp of human behavior more nuanced than anything orrin demonstrated in the short time i had to speak with him and unless it was corrected in transcription the grammar and punctuation are a big notch up on orrins verbal skills bose nodded at this but youre still reserving judgment she considered the question to a degree yes why two reasons one is circumstantial it seems obvious orrin isnt the author but then why is he being cagy about that and why are you asking for my opinion the second reason is professional ive talked to a lot of people with personality disorders of various kinds and ive learned not to trust first impressions psychopaths can be charming and paranoiacs can appear sweetly reasonable its possible orrins mannerisms are a learned reflex or even a deliberate deception he may want us to think hes less intelligent than he really is now bose was giving her a peculiar and annoyingly cryptic smile good excellent what about the text itself what did you make of it i dont pretend to be a literary critic looking at it as a patients production however i cant help noticing how concerned it is with identity especially mixed identities there are two firstperson narratorsmore like three since the girl cant decide who she really is and even the male narrator is essentially stripped of his past beyond that theres the grandiosity of the storys concern with the hypotheticals and the possibility of interaction with them in real life when people claim they can talk to the hypotheticals its a diagnostic indicator for schizophrenia youre saying orrinif he wrote thismight be schizophrenic no not at all im just saying its possible to read the document that way actually my first impression of orrin is that he might be somewhere on the autistic spectrum which is another reason why i cant entirely dismiss him as the author of the text highfunctioning autistics are often eloquent and precise writers even though theyre profoundly inhibited in social interactions okay bose said thoughtfully good thats useful lunch arrived bose had ordered a club sandwich and fries sandras cobb salad was limp and disappointing and she slowed down after a few bites she waited for bose to say something more enlightening than okay he polished a dab of mayonnaise off his upper lip i like what you said it makes sense its not all psychiatric jargon great thanks but quid pro quo you owe me an explanation first let me give you this he pushed a manila envelope across the table its another installment of the document not a transcript this time a photocopy of the original a little hard to read but maybe more revealing the envelope was dismayingly thick not that sandra was reluctant to take it her professional curiosity had been piqued what she resented was that bose was still being cagy about what he wanted from her thank you she said but we can talk more freely later on say maybe tonight if youre free im free now i havent finished my salad yet bose lowered his voice the problem is were being watched excuse me woman in the booth behind the plastic plants sandra canted her head and nearly laughed out loud oh god whispering now herself thats mrs wattmore from state one of the ward nurses she followed you here shes a hopeless busybody but im sure its a coincidence well shes been taking a pretty deep interest in our conversation he mimed a cuppedhandtoear typical sotonight or we could move to a different table sandra thought or just keep our voices down she didnt suggest it however because it was possible bose was using this as an excuse to see her again and she wasnt sure how to interpret that was bose a colleague a collaborator a potential friend maybe even as mrs wattmore no doubt suspected a potential lover the situation was ambiguous perhaps exciting for that reason sandra hadnt been involved with a man since she broke up with andy beauton another state physician who had been fired in last years downsizing since then her work had eaten her alive okay she said tonight she was reassured by the smile he gave her but i still have an hour on lunch so lets talk about something else about each other as it turned out they laid out their life stories for inspection bose born in mumbai during his mothers illfated marriage to an indian wind turbine engineer raised there until the age of five which explained the ghost of an accent and his manners just a touch more genteel than the texas average brought back to houston for grade school and subsequently imbued with what he called his mothers wellhoned sense of injustice he had eventually qualified for police training at a time when hpd was in a hiring frenzy he talked about himself with a sense of humor that struck sandra as unusual in a cop or maybe she had been meeting the wrong cops in return she gave him the pocket versionto be honest the carefully edited versionof sandra cole her family in boston med school her job at state when bose asked about her choice of career she mentioned a desire to help people she didnt mention her fathers suicide or what had happened to her brother kyle the conversation evolved toward triviality as they lingered over coffee and sandra left the restaurant still unsure whether she ought to treat this as a professional exchange or a boygirl sizeup or which she wanted it to be she found bose at least superficially attractive it wasnt just his blue eyes and teakcolored skin it was the way he talked as if he was speaking from some calm and happily reasonable place deep inside himself and he seemed equally interested in her unless she was overinterpreting still did she need this in her life not to mention the inevitable gossip that would ensue in the parched social universe of the state care staff nurse wattmore beat her back to work by half an hour time enough to spread the word that sandra had been lunching with a cop she got a set of knowing glances and halfsmiles from the nurses at reception bad luckbut wattmore was a force of nature as unstoppable as the tides of course the tide of gossip flowed both ways sandra knew that mrs wattmore a widow fortyfour years of age had slept with three of the four former ward supervisors that woman lives in a glass house one of the nurses confided in sandra when they crossed paths in the staff commissary you know lately shes been taking her breaks with dr congreve sandra hurried to her office and closed the door she had two case summaries that needed writing up she gave the folders a guilty look and pushed them aside then she took the envelope bose had given her from her purse and tugged out the sheaf of closely written pages and began to read she was brimming with fresh questions when she met bose that evening this time he had picked the restaurant a northside theme pub shepherds pie and guinness and green paper napkins embossed with pictures of harps he was waiting when she arrived she was surprised to find another woman sitting at the table with him the woman wore a blue flowerprint dress that was neither fresh nor in good repair she was skinny to the point of emaciation and she seemed both nervous and angry when sandra approached the table the woman looked at her warily bose stood hastily sandra id like you to meet ariel matherorrins sister chapter six turk findleys story there had been moments during my captivity when i wasnt sure whether i wanted to live or die if there was any sense or meaning in the life i had livedfrom the unforgivable act that had caused me to leave houston many years ago to the moment i woke up in the equatorian deserti couldnt see it but now the mindless urge to live came roaring back i watched as swarms of voxish aircraft began the systematic slaughter of the farmer rebels and all i wanted was to get to a safe place from the cart on its hillside we were able to see the treeless plain surrounding vox core as it became the scene of a rolling apocalypse the farmer armies had already begun to retreat as soon as the sirens sounded at the first sight of the approaching aircraft they dropped their makeshift pikes and broke formation but the voxish warplanes came on relentlessly skimming over the ranks of their enemies like hunting birds the weapon they used was new to me the aircraft projected fiery wave fronts that rolled across the landscape and then vanished like summer lightning leaving coneshaped swathes of smoldering soil and charred bodies in their wake the sound they made was a seismic exhalation powerful enough that i felt it in my rib cage the war sirens went on wailing like mournful giants briefly it seemed as if we might be safe up here on the hill then one of the warplanes banked nearby as if considering us and the wind carried up the stench of smoke and burning flesh our guard detail evaporated running for the woods with the exception of digger choi who seemed immobilized i caught his eye he was clearly terrified i held out my bound hands to him hoping he could interpret the gesture dont leave us tied up like hogs at a slaughter allison added a few pleading words in voxish barely audible under the general roar digger choi turned his back i called out cut us loose you cowardly fuck and although he surely didnt understand english he stopped and turned back glowering through his fear he dropped the latch on the carts gate and cut us free with the knife he carried two hasty slashes first allison then me the blade bit my wrist but i didnt care i was cravenly grateful allison muttered a voxish word that might have meant thanks i couldnt translate the farmers response but the gotohell tone of it was unmistakeable down on the plain the carnage continued the stink of frying human flesh became nauseatingly dense digger choi turned to follow his friends in their dash for the treeline but stopped in his tracks when a shadow eclipsed the distant lights of vox core it was one of the voxish aircraft directly overhead flying slow and low suddenly there was light all around us so bright the air itself seemed whitewashed an amplified voice called out incomprehensible orders in voxish stay still allison said putting her hand on my arm dont move it was our clothing that saved usour greasy bloodstained roadworn yellow tunics the network had been restored and if allisons limbic implant had been intact it would have alerted the voxish forces to our presence but the farmers had destroyed her node and i had never worn one to begin with so we should have been indistinguishable from anyone else on this killing ground except for our clothes microscopic radiofrequency tags were embedded in the coarse weave identifying us or at least what we wore as survivors of the equatorian recovery mission that was enough to buy us a reprieve the aircraft bellied down to land a door sprang open and soldiers in military gear vaulted out and formed a cordon around us weapons aimed digger choi was caught inside the cordon he seemed to understand that surrender was his only option he dropped to his knees and put his hands over his head in a gesture that would have been familiar on any battlefield ten thousand or twenty thousand years ago the voxish soldiers kept their weapons trained as allison stammered out an explanation or a demand after a quick consultation the soldiers gestured to their aircraft theyre taking us to vox core allison said and the relief in her voice was palpable they dont know for sure that im telling the truth but they know were not farmers they knew with equal certainty that digger choi was a farmer and one of the soldiers aimed a weapon at his head i said im not going anywhere until that man puts his gun down tell him so given the slaughter that was taking place on every side of us maybe the summary execution of digger choi was a small bone to choke on but he had risked his life to set us free even if he had been sullen about it i didnt feel like watching his execution allison gave me a peculiar look but she gauged my temperament correctly she barked out a translation the soldier hesitated i stepped forward grabbed the farmers forearm and pulled him upright i could feel him trembling under my hand run i told him allison translated the single word digger choi didnt need to be told twice he darted toward a part of the forest not yet burning the soldiers shrugged and let him go he lived a little longer because of what i had done but only a little the aircraft carried us over the killing fields and across the city wall to a landing bay on one of the towers of vox core during the brief flight the voxish soldiers appeared to have received confirmation of our identities after a quiet mutual consultation they began to treat me with deference and spoke to allison in what sounded like sympathetic voices even before the aircraft docked we were given fresh clothing crisp new jumpers this time in a shade of blue one of the soldiers evidently a medic slathered a soothing balm on my wrist where digger choi had slashed it in the process of cutting me loose the same soldier attempted to examine the wound where allisons node had been removed but she pulled away from him and snarled we were given water to drink clean cool heavenly the landing dock was a windy rooftop we left the aircraft and the soldiers escorted us to an enormous elevator housing but allison balked at the entrance and asked the soldier in charge a question her eyes widened at his answer she spoke again he answered curtly the discussion began to sound like an argument until at last the soldier gave her an exasperated nod were almost exactly at the midpoint in the passage of the arch she said to me the network estimates twenty minutes or so to the transit assuming it happens im staying here until it does i didnt see the point vox would make the crossing to earth or not whether we were out here on this ledge or in some more comfortable space below i dont care she added in a lower voice i want to see it i told them you did too what i want doesnt matter but youre uptakenthey have to pay attention so we were escorted to an enclosed balcony a single level below the landing docks still high above the city and we stood there like two grimy and slightly bloodstained scarecrows gazing out at the island of vox and the far sea shimmering under the small equatorian moon smoke rose from the fields where the farmers were dying or had by this time surely died but it trailed abaft of us and the sky ahead was starry and clear the warplanes were already circling back to their bases allison spoke to the nearest soldier in our escort then translated her questions and his answers for me did the soldier think vox would actually achieve a transit to earth yes he was certain of it the prophecies were being fulfilled the uptaken were among us what about the uptaken who had already been taken to vox core when the city was bombed bad luck the soldier said bad luck that a missile had penetrated the voxish defenses bad luck that the strike had damaged vox cores essential infrastructureand very bad luck that the rescued uptaken had been situated so close to ground zero it wasnt clear to me how many others had been collected in the equatorian desert but i believed that would have included the hybrid boy isaac dvali possibly his mother maybe a few unlucky civilians who happened to be nearby had the missile killed them all all but one allison translated whos the survivor more translation the youngest one the boy then isaac but he was badly hurt allison added hes only barely alive and thats enough to get the attention of the hypotheticals you think theyll really open a closed arch and carry us to earth just because they recognize one injured boy and a confused exsailor it was a question she didnt have to answer the answer came out of the sky in a blush of green light it had been night on the equatorian ocean it was daylight on earth the transition was as sudden and as unnervingly simple as it had been the first time i rode a rusty freighter from sumatra to equatoria i felt a little heavierearth is a slightly more massive planet than equatoriabut it was a sensation no more alarming than the feeling you get in a rising elevator the other changes were less subtle we blinked at murky daylight beyond the shores of vox the sea was flat and oily to every horizon the sky was a nastylooking shade of green god no allison whispered the soldiers gawked poison she said its all poison the war sirens stopped wailing in the silence the voxish soldiers stood with abstracted expressions as if they were listening to voices i couldnt hearand probably thats what they were doing consulting their network or their superiors then one of them addressed allison she told me were ordered below no exceptions this time the citys being sealed before we turned away i took a last look at the open land beyond the walls the corpses of farmers lay motionless in charred meadowland bathed in sour green daylight a few survivors moved among them but even from this height they looked shocked and aimless i asked allison whether at least some of them could be brought inside as prisoners no she said but if the airs poisonous just be grateful we were rescued there might be hundreds of people out there youre talking about abandoning them to die she nodded blankly i said whoevers in charge here do they really want that on their conscience she gave me a peculiar look vox is a limbic democracy she said theres only one conscience its called the coryphaeus and it doesnt give a shit how many farmers die chapter seven sandra and bose this is sandra cole bose said orrins doctor over at state care well im not his doctor exactly sandra began feeling more than a little ambushed ariel mather gave her a look so steely and unwavering that her voice dried up in midsentence ariel was skinny but she was tall even though she was sitting down her head was almost level with sandras she would have towered over orrin she had orrins bony facial structure and similarly lustrous brown eyes but there was nothing of orrins baleful tentativeness about her her glare could have blinded a cat you got my brother locked up no not exactly hes being evaluated for admission to the texas state care adult custodial program whats that mean is he free to go or isnt he clearly the woman wanted a blunt answer sandra sat down and gave her one no hes not free to go not yet anyway take it easy ariel bose said sandras on our side were there sides apparently there were and apparently sandra had been recruited to one an intimidated waiter dropped off a basket of rolls and scurried away alls i know ariel said is that i got a call from this man telling me orrin was in jail for getting beat up which i guess is a crime in texas he was taken into custody bose said for his own protection custody then and would i come and get him well hes my little brother i took care of him all his life and half mine course ill come get him now i find out orrins not in jail anymore hes in something called state care thats your business you said dr cole sandra took a moment to compose her thoughts deliberately buttering a roll under ariels flinty scrutiny im an intake psychiatrist i work for state yes i spoke to orrin when officer bose first brought him in do you know how state care works its a little different in north carolina i believe officer bose says its some kind of lockup for crazy people sandra hoped bose had not said exactly that the way it works is when indigent people people with no fixed address or income have trouble with the police they can be remanded to state care even if they havent committed a crimeespecially if the police believe the person cant be safely abandoned back on the street state care isnt a lockup ms mather and its not a mental hospital theres an evaluation period of seven days during which we determine whether an individual is a candidate for fulltime care in what we call a custodial guidedliving environment at the end of that time the person in question is either released or accorded dependency status she was conscious of using words ariel probably wouldnt understandworse the same words printed in state cares threepage pamphlet for concerned families but what other words were there orrins not crazy i interviewed him myself and im inclined to agree with you in any case nonviolent candidates can always be released into the custody of a willing family member with an income and a legal address she spared a glance for bose who should have explained all this if you can prove youre orrins sisterjust a drivers license and a social security card will doand if youre verifiably employed and willing to sign the forms we can release orrin to you more or less immediately i told ariel the same thing bose said in fact i called state to say we were submitting the paperwork but theres a problem your supervisor dr congreve claims orrin had a violent spell this afternoon he assaulted an orderly congreve says sandra blinked seriously i didnt hear anything about a violent incident if orrin assaulted anyone its news to me its bullshit is what it is ariel said you talked to orrin even a little youd know its bullshit orrin never assaulted nobody in his life cant crush a bug without apologizing to it first the accusation may not be true bose said but it makes it more difficult to release him sandra was still struggling with the idea certainly it doesnt sound like behavior i would expect from orrin though how well did she really know him after a single interview and a followup conversation but what are you sayingthat congreve is lying why would he do that to keep orrin locked up ariel said yes but why were underfunded and overloaded as it is usually if we can remand a patient to family thats a bestcase outcome good for the patient good for us in fact its my impression congreve was hired because the board of directors believed he would reduce the number of people going on state lists ethically or not she added silently maybe ariel said you dont know as much as you think you know about what goes on where you work bose cleared his throat keep in mind that sandras here to help us shes our best shot at getting orrin a fair deal ill see what i can find out about this incident i dont know whether i can help but ill do my best ms mather would you mind if i asked you a couple of questions about orrin the more i know about his background the easier itll be for me to move the case forward i told officer bose everything already but if you dont mind repeating yourself my interest in orrin is a little different from officer boses or a lot different clearly sandra hadnt yet taken the full measure of jefferson amrit bose has orrin lived with you all his life up till the day he got on the bus to houston yes youre his sisterwhat about your parents me and orrin had different daddies and neither one of em stuck around mama was danela mather and she died when i was just sixteen she looked after us as best as she could but she got distracted pretty easy and she had trouble with drugs toward the end meth and the wrong men if you know what i mean after that it was only me there to take care of orrin did he need a lot of taking care of yes and no he never asked for much in the way of attention orrin was always happy to be by himself looking at picture books or whatever even when he was little he didnt cry much at all but he was pretty useless at school and he cried plenty when mama took him to class so he just mostly stayed home and he wasnt good at feeding himself you didnt put food in front of him twice a day hed blink and go hungry thats just how he was different from other children in other words different he surely was but if you mean is he retarded i have to say no he is not he can write letters and read words hes smart enough to hold a job if anybodyd hire him he worked a night watchman job a while back in raleighand here too officer bose tells me until he got fired does orrin ever hear voices or see things that arent there ariel mather crossed her arms and glared i already told you hes not crazy he just has a good imagination that was obvious even when he was little the way hed make up stories about his toy animals or whatnot sometimes id find him staring at the tv when it wasnt even turned on like what he saw in that empty screen was just as interesting as any show on cable or at the sky watching clouds go by windows on a rainy day he liked to look at those that dont make him crazy i dont think i dont think so either and whats it matter alls you have to do is get him out of that place hes locked up in the only way i can do that if i can do thatis to convince my colleagues orrin isnt in danger of going back to the streets and getting hurt what youre telling me is helpful which i have to assume is why officer bose brought us together sandra gave bose another sidelong look you said orrin was never aggressive orrind run from an argument with his hands over his ears hes shy not violent it was always hard for him when mama came home with a man he hid out mostly times like that especially if there was any kind of disagreement or unpleasantness and im sorry i have to ask this but was your mother ever aggressive toward orrin she had her meth fits sometimes especially toward the end some scenes nothing serious you mentioned that orrin liked to tell stories does he ever write them down did he keep a journal ariel seemed surprised at the question no nothing like that his printing is neat but he dont practice it much did he have a girlfriend back in raleigh hes bashful around women so no did he worry about that resent it ariel mather shrugged okay thank you for your patience ariel i dont believe orrin needs to go into custodial care and what youve said tends to confirm that though it raised other questions sandra thought you can get him out its not that simple well have to sort out whatever happened this afternoon that led dr congreve to believe hes violentbut ill do everything i can a thought occurred to her one more question what was it that caused orrin to leave raleigh and why did he come to houston ariel hesitated her posture remained stiff as a spindle as if her sense of dignity had settled into the knobs of her spine he has moods sometimes what kind of moods well most of the time orrin seems young for his age i guess you noticed that every once in a while though a mood takes him and when orrins in a mood he dont seem young at all hell give you a look like he sees right through you make you think hes older than the moon and the stars put together like a wind blows through him from somewhere far away thats what mama used to say when orrin was like that and does that have something to do with why he came to houston the mood was on him at the time i dont know for sure he even meant to go to texas in particular he never said anything to me just took the five hundred dollars i was saving toward a new car took it from my dresser drawer when i was out at work he asked our neighbor mrs bostick to drive him to the bus station he didnt pack a bag or nothing he wasnt carrying nothing but an old pad of paper and a pen mrs bostick said she guessed he was meeting somebody at the depot orrin didnt deny it but once she left him there he mustve bought himself a ticket and got on an interstate bus the mood was on him for some days before that him all quiet and fareyed she gave sandra a calculating look i hope that dont change your opinion of him complicates it sandra thought but she shook her head no ariel mather had arrived in town early this morning bose had helped her check her into a motel before their aborted visit to state but she had barely had time to unpack her suitcase she was tired and she told bose she wanted to get a decent nights sleep but thank you for the dinner and all i still need to discuss a few things with sandra bose said he asked the waiter to call a cab for her while were waiting ariel one more question go ahead did orrin contact you after he arrived here in houston one phone call to let me know he was all right i was mad enough to light into him for leaving but that just made him hang up and i was sorry afterward i shouldve known better yelling at him never does any good a week later i had a letter to say he was working steady and he hoped i wasnt too mad at him i wouldve wrote back but he didnt put down any return address did he say anything about where he was working here in town not as i recall nothing about a warehouse a man named findley no sir does it matter probably not thank you again ariel bose said hed call her tomorrow to let her know how things were progressing she stood up and made her way to the door of the restaurant with her chin thrust forward well bose asked whats your reaction sandra shook her head firmly oh no no you dont get anything more from me until you answer a question or two i guess thats fair listen i need a ride homei came in a cab with ariel can i beg a lift from you i guess so but if you bullshit me bose i swear ill leave you by the side of the road deal he said it turned out he lived in a new development off the west belt a longish drive and out of her way but sandra didnt object it gave her time to assemble her thoughts bose was patient in the passenger seat hands in his lap quietly attentive as she pulled into traffic it was another mercilessly hot night the cars air conditioner struggled gamely she said this is obviously not standard police work how so well im no expert but your interest in orrin seemed unusual from the day you escorted him into state and i saw you slip the cab fare to arieldont you need some kind of receipt for that matter shouldnt you be interviewing her downtown downtown at police headquarters or whatever in the movies they always call it downtown oh that downtown she felt herself blushing but persisted another thing at state we talk to hpd referrals every day a lot of them are considerably less tractable than orrin but some are just as scared and just as vulnerable as a professional i have to behave like a clinician no matter who im dealing with the cops who drop these cases at state on the other hand for them its the end of a tedious necessity their interest in the individuals they remand to us is less than nil except on legal business no cop ever does followup until you walked in you acted like you cared about orrin so explain that to me before we get into the question of orrins writing or my opinion of his sister tell me what your stake in the matter is maybe i happen to like him maybe i think hes being railroaded railroaded by who im not sure and if i havent been entirely frank its because i dont want to involve you in something potentially dangerous your chivalry is noted but im already involved if we handle this badly you could be putting your job at risk sandra laughed despite herself there hasnt been a day in the last year i didnt half hope to be fired my résumé is out at hospitals all over the country this was true any takers no not yet bose looked down the highway into the simmering night well youre right what you said this isnt standard police work the spin had been a difficult time for police and security forces the world overespecially the frightening finale of it when the stars had reappeared in the night sky and the sun four billion years older than it had been five years ago crossed the meridian like a bloody banner of the apocalypse it had seemed like the end of the world a great many police personnel had abandoned their duties and joined their families for the final hours and when it became obvious that the world would not endthat the hypotheticals would filter the radiation reaching the earth to a tolerable level giving the planet at least a probationary futuremany of those deserters had stayed home despite a general amnesty lives had changed beyond recognition or restoration new bodies were recruited some with only marginal qualifications bose had joined the force two decades later at a time when many of those marginal recruits had become senior staff he had found himself in an hpd rife with internal conflicts and generational rivalries his own career such as it was had advanced at a glacial pace the problem he told sandra was an endemic corruption born out of the years when vice had spent freely and virtue went begging the incoming tide of equatorian oil had only compounded the problem on the surface houston was a clean enough city the hpd was good at keeping a lid on property crimes and petty violence and if under the citys polished exterior a river of illicit goods and undocumented cash flowed freely well it was the job of the hpd to make sure nobody paid too much attention bose had been careful not to skirt too close to the shady side he had volunteered for drudge work rather than accept dubious assignments had even turned down offers of promotion as a result he was considered unimaginative and even in a certain sense stupid but because he never passed judgment on his peers he was also considered useful an officer whose dogged attention to small matters freed up more ambitious men for more lucrative work so you kept your hands clean sandra said offering it as an observation but withholding her approval up to a point im not a saint you could have gone to some uh higher authority exposed the corruption he smiled respectfully no i couldnt in this town the money and the power hold hands the higher authorities are the people taking the biggest dip turn right at the intersection my buildings the second left at the light if you want to hear the rest of this you can come up to my place i dont entertain much but i can probably crack a bottle of wine this time his look was almost sheepish if youre interested she agreed and not just because she was curious or rather her curiosity wasnt limited to orrin mather and the hpd she was increasingly curious about jefferson bose himself clearly he wasnt a wine person he produced a dusty bottle of some offbrand shiraz probably a gift long neglected in a kitchen cupboard sandra told him beer would do fine his refrigerator was amply stocked with corona boses singlebedroom apartment was conventionally furnished and relatively neat as if it had been cleaned recently if not enthusiastically it was only three stories up but it was situated with a partial view of the houston skyline all the gaudy towers that had shot up in the aftermath of the spin like gigantic pixelboards of randomly lit windows its the money that drives the corruption bose said putting a chilled bottle into her hand and sitting opposite her in a recliner that had seen better days money and the one thing more valuable than money whats that life longevity he was talking about the trade in martian pharmaceuticals back in med school sandra had roomed with a biochemistry major who had been obsessively curious about the martian longevity treatment brought to earth by wun ngo wenshe had suspected that its lifeprolonging effects could be teased away from the neurological modifications the martians had engineered into it if only the government would free up samples for analysis that hadnt happened the drug was deemed too dangerous for general release and sandras roommate had gone on to a perfectly conventional career but her intuition about the martian drug had been correct samples had leaked out of the nih labs onto the black market the martians had believed longevity should confer both wisdom and certain moral obligations and they had designed their pharmaceuticals that way the famous fourth stage of life the adulthood after adulthood had entailed changes to the brain that modified aggressiveness and promoted sympathy for others not a bad idea sandra thought but hardly commercial the blackmarketers had hacked the biochemical combination lock and evolved a better product nowadaysassuming you had serious money and the right contactsyou could buy yourself an extra twenty or thirty years of life while avoiding that awkward surge of human sympathy all illegal of course and massively profitable just last week the fbi had shut down a distribution ring in boca raton that was processing more cash on an annual basis than most topfifty corporations and that was only a fraction of the market bose was right in the end for some people life was worth anything you had to pay for it the longevity drug isnt easy to cultivate bose was saying its as much an organism as a molecule you need genetic seed stock you need a decentsized bioreactor and you need a lot of closely watched chemicals and catalysts which means you have to buy a lot of looktheotherway including some in hpd that would be a reasonable conclusion to draw and youre aware of this he shrugged but there must be somebody you could talk toi dont know the fbi the dea i believe the federal agencies have their hands full at the moment bose said okay sandra said but what does all this have to do with orrin mather its not orrin so much as the place he used to work as soon as he got off the bus from raleigh orrin was hired by a man named findley findley operates a warehouse that holds and forwards imported goods mainly cheap plastic crap from manufacturers in turkey lebanon syria most of his hires are transients or immigrants without papers he doesnt ask for social security numbers and his guys get paid in cash he put orrin to work doing the usual liftandcarry jobs but orrin turned out to be an unusual employee by findleys standards which means he came in on time and sober he was bright enough to follow orders he never complained and he didnt care about finding a better job as long his pay was regular so after a while findley took him off day work and made him night watchman most nights between midnight and dawn orrin was locked in the warehouse with a phone and a patrol schedule and all he had to do was conduct an hourly walkthrough and call a certain number if he noticed anything unusual a certain number not the police definitely not the police because what passes through the warehouse along with a lot of diestamped toys and plastic kitchenware are shipments of precursor chemicals bound for blackmarket bioreactors orrin knew about this thats unclear maybe he had some suspicions in any case findley fired him a couple of months back possibly because orrin was getting a little too familiar with the details of the operation some of findleys blackmarket material comes in or goes out after hours so orrin would have seen a few transfers the firing was pretty traumatic for orrini guess he thought he was being punished for something he talked to you about it a little reluctantly all he says is that he didnt do anything wrong and that it wasnt time for him to leave sandra asked bose for another corona which gave her time to think about all this what he had said seemed to make everything murkier she decided to focus on the only part of this she really understood or could affect orrins assessment at state care bose came back with a bottle which she accepted but set down immediately on boses ringstained coffee table he needed new furniture she thought or at least a set of coasters you think orrin might have information that would be damaging to a criminal smuggling operation bose nodded none of this would matter if orrin had been just another one of findleys hired drifters orrin would have left town or found other work or otherwise disappeared into povertyland end of story the trouble is that orrin surfaced again when we took him into custody worse when we asked him about his employment record he piped right up about his six months at the warehouse mention of the name set off alarms in certain quarters and i guess word worked its way up so what are the smugglers afraid of that orrin will reveal some secret i said the federal agencies are too busy to take on corruption in hpd and thats true but there are ongoing investigations related to longevitydrug rings findleyand the people findley works forare nervous about orrin as a potential witness now that his name and history are in the database you see where this is going she nodded slowly his psychological condition exactly if orrins admitted to state care that constitutes a formal declaration of incompetence any testimony he might give would be fatally compromised which is where i come in she sipped her beer she seldom drank beer she thought it tasted the way old socks smell but it was gratifyingly cold and she welcomed the slight buzz that oddly clarifying wisp of intoxication except im not on orrins case anymore i cant do anything to help him i dont expect you to i probably shouldnt have told you what i did butlike you said quid pro quo and im still interested in your opinion of orrins writing so you think his document is what some kind of coded confession i honestly dont know what orrins document is and although it mentions the warehouse it does in a section you havent read but its hardly the kind of evidence you can take to court im just he seemed to struggle for a word you could say professionally curious you could say that sandra thought but youd only be telling a fraction of the truth bose i saw the way you acted when you brought him in youre more than curious you actually appear to give a shit about him as a human being i mean by the time orrin was remanded to state id got to know him a little bit hes being railroaded and he doesnt deserve it hes well you know how he is vulnerable innocent but a lot of the people sandra dealt with were both vulnerable and innocent it was commonplace endearing in a kind of spooky way bose nodded that thing his sister said back at the restaurant a wind blows through him im not exactly sure what she meant by that but it sounds about right sandra couldnt say at what point she decided to stay the night probably there was no single point of decision that wasnt how it worked in her relatively limited experience intimacy was a slow glide orchestrated not by words but by gestures eye contact the first touch as she put a hand on boses arm to make some conversational point the easy way he came and sat beside her thigh to thigh as if they had known each other for half an eternity strange she thought how familiar it began to seem and then how inevitable that she would go to bed with him there was no firsttime awkwardness about it he was as sweet in bed as she had suspected he would be she fell asleep beside him one hand draped across his hip she wasnt aware of him when he slipped away from her but she was dimly awake when he came back from the bathroom caught for a moment in the amber glow of city light through the bedroom window she saw the scar she had already felt with her fingertips a pale ridge that began below his navel and meandered like a mountain road along his rib cage and up toward his right shoulder she wanted to ask him about it but he turned away hastily when he saw her looking and the moment passed in the morning bose made french toast and coffee even though there wasnt time to linger over it he moved around the kitchen heating butter in a skillet breaking eggs with a confidence and ease she found pleasant to watch a thought had come to her during the night youre not working for the federal agencies she said and youre barely working for hpd but youre not alone in all this youre working for somebody isnt that right everybody works for somebody an ngo a charitable organization a detective agency i guess wed better talk about that he said chapter eight allisons story once wed made the transit to earth the managers put us in adjoining medical care suites and we slept for most of two days a team of nurses hovered over me at all times and at intervals i asked them about turk they said he was doing well and that i could talk to him soon they wouldnt say more than that i needed the rest for obvious reasons and it was pleasant to wake sleep dream and wake again without fearing for my life obviously there were problems i would have to face sooner or later big ones but the meds i was swallowing washed away all urgency my wounds were minor and they healed nicely eventually i woke feeling fit and hungry and for the first time impatient and i asked the bedside nursea male worker with big eyes and a fixed smilewhen i could have something more substantial than protein paste to eat after the surgery he said blandly what surgery to replace your node he said in a tone of voice that suggested he thought he was talking to a slowwitted child i know how hard it must have been for you surviving in the wild without it when the network went down it was hard for all of us like being alone in the dark he shuddered at the memory but well have you repaired before the end of the day no i said instantly excuse me i dont want surgery i dont want my node back he frowned for a moment then turned his maddening smile back on its perfectly natural to experience anxiety at a time like this i can adjust your medicationwould you like that i told him my medication was fine and that i was simply and explicitly refusing surgery as was my right under established voxish medical protocols but its not an invasive surgery its just a repair ive seen your history you were implanted at birth like everyone else were not changing you in any way treya were restoring you i argued with him at length and fiercely i used words i shouldnt have both voxish and english he was shocked at first then silent he left the room with moist eyes and a perplexed expression and i figured id won a victory or at least gained a reprieve ten minutes later they wheeled in the prep cart and the knives that was when i started to scream i was too weak to make much noise but i was loud enough to be heard in the adjoining rooms the medical workers were about to strap me down when turk came bulling through the doorway turk was wearing a patients gown cinched at the waist and he didnt look intimidatingour sojourn in the wilderness had left him skinny and brown as a nut but the med staff must have seen the ferocity in his eyes not to mention his balled fists more than that he was uptaken touched by the hypotheticals in voxish theology that made him something next door to a god i told him in a few words that the medics were trying to reinstall my limbic implant and turn me back into treya tell them to stop he said tell them to take their fucking knives away or i will personally call down the wrath of the hypotheticals on vox and all its works i translated with embellishments the medical staff hastened out of the room with eyes averted abandoning their surgical tools but this too was only a reprieve the medics were almost instantly replaced by a man in a gray jumpsuit an administrator a managera man i recognized from treyas training sessions he had been one of my teachers not one of my favorites apparently he and turk had already met stay out of this oscar turk said in english the administrators voxish name was long and decorated with honorifics but oscar was a decent approximation of the patrilineal fraction of it oscar spoke english of course his english wasnt as nuanced as minehe had learned it mainly from ancient textbooks and legal documentsbut it was functional and unlike me he was empowered to speak on behalf of the managerial class please calm down mr findley he said in his reedy voice he was a small man paleskinned yellowhaired a couple of years past young fuck you oscar your people were about to force a surgical procedure on a friend of mine i dont take that lightly the woman you describe as your friend was badly injured in the farmer rebellion you witnessed that injury didnt you in fact you tried to stop it it figured that oscar would attempt some kind of legalistic argument schooled as he was in ancient writs and warrants turk ignored him and turned to me are you all right im okay for the time being i wont be if they put my node back in thats irrational oscar said surely you must see that treya my name isnt treya of course it is your denial is a symptom of your disorder youre suffering from a pathological cognitive dissociation that cries out for repair oscar shut the fuck up turk said i need to speak to allison privately there is no allison mr findley allison is a tutelary construct and the longer we allow treya to sustain this delusion the harder it will be to cure her treya herself would have deferred to oscar without question and i could still feel that old and craven impulse but now it was hateful to me oscar i said in a quieter voice he shot me a hard look and repeated his voxish name with all its status markers i was a worker and it was an insolence to call him by his short name oscar i repeated are you hard of hearing turk asked you to shut the fuck up his pale complexion turned red i dont understand this have we hurt you mr findley have we threatened you in any way havent i served as your personal liaison in a satisfactory manner youre not my liaison turk said allison is there is no allison and this woman cant function as a liaisonshe has no connection to the network she doesnt have a working neural node she speaks english well enough like a native i said there you go but so im appointing her as my translator turk said from now on any interaction i have with vox goes through her and were both finished with doctors for the time being no knives no drugs can you arrange that oscar hesitated then he addressed me directly in voxish if you were a whole human being you would recognize your behavior as an act of treason not just against the administrative class but against the coryphaeus they were weighty words treya would have trembled thank you but i know what im doing i said in the same language oscar it was during this time that vox began its lumbering hopeless journey to antarctica getting any kind of hard information out of oscar who continued to pop up with annoying regularity was impossible but the nurses who still hovered around us bringing meals or inquiring about our health like nosy parents could occasionally be coaxed to talk through them i learned that the voxish consensus had evolved from jubilation we transited to earth the prophecies are fulfilled to dismay but the earth is a ruin and the hypotheticals continue to ignore us to a stoic rededication to the ancient cause the hypotheticals wont come to us well have to seek them out seeking them out was the hard part fleets of drone aircraft were dispatched to survey the landmasses of what had once been indonesia and southern india but all they found was an unrelieved wasteland there was nothing alive thereor at least nothing larger than a bacterium the oceans were anoxic back in champlain i had done a lot of reading about ocean toxicity all the co we were pumping into the air back thenthe fossil carbon reserves of not one but two planetshad been the trigger event though it had taken centuries for the full effect to be felt rapid warming had stratified the seas and fed huge blooms of sulfatereducing bacteria which in turn spewed clouds of poisonous hydrogen sulfide into the atmosphere the word for this process was eutrophocation it had happened before without human intervention eutrophication episodes had been blamed for some of the planets prehistoric mass extinctions voxs administrative class had studied the few surviving records of the terrestrial diaspora and concluded that we ought to proceed to the site of the last known human habitation near the southern pole on the shore of what used to be called the ross sea in the meantime robotic craft would extend the aerial survey as far as eurasia and the americas when i told turk all this he asked me how long the trip to antarctica would take turk still thought of vox more as an island chain than a seagoing vessel but although it was vastly larger than any ship turk had ever sailed or even imagined it was a ship with a surprisingly shallow draft and decent maneuverability for its colossal size a couple of months to reach the ross sea i told him i promised id take him down to see the engine decks sometime soon and it was a promise i meant to keep for reasons i wasnt yet willing to explain there was a whole lot i couldnt explain for the simple reason that we had no privacy in vox core the walls had ears also eyes not necessarily for the purpose of spying all those nanoscale eyes and ears embedded in structural surfaces fed their data to the network which sorted it for anomalies and issued alerts whenever an unusual situation arose a health crisis a technological failure a fire or even a violent argument i was guessing however that an exception had been made in our case back when i was treya i had been taught that when interacting with an uptaken like turk findley no word or gesture was too trivial to be sifted for clues about the hypotheticals or the state of existence the uptaken had experienced among them so we were almost certainly being listened to and not just by machines i couldnt allow myself to say anything i didnt want the administrators to overhear which ruled out much of what i needed to say and needed to say quickly and even if the administrators werent listening the coryphaeus surely was i had been thinking a lot about the coryphaeus but i didnt want the coryphaeus to know that i also wanted turk to have at least a basic understanding of the geography of vox core and how it operated because the knowledge might be useful later so for the next few days i tried to act like a compliant and acceptable liaison doing what treya had been trained to do even though i was no longer treya nor wanted to be i introduced turk to the book room just down the corridor the book room had been prepared years in advance as a way of educating the uptaken and it was just what the name suggested a room housing a substantial shelf of books real books as turk said admiringly when he saw them books printed on paper and bound in boards freshly minted but startlingly archaic they were the only such books in all of vox and they had been created explicitly for the use of the uptaken the books were mostly histories assembled by scholars and translated into simple english and five other ancient languages they were reasonably reliable texts according to my understanding turk was interested but intimidated by the dozens of titles and i helped him pick out a few volumes the collapse of mars and the martian diaspora on the nature and purpose of the hypothetical entities the decline of the terrestrial ecology the principles and destiny of the polity of vox cortical and limbic democracies of the middle worlds and a couple more enough to give him a rough sense of what vox was and why it had fought its battles back in the ring of worlds the titles i told him were more daunting than the texts really he said so what are uh cortical and limbic democracies ways of implementing consensus governance i explained neural augmentation and communitywide networks had made possible many different kinds of decisionmaking most of the communities of the middle worlds were cortical democracies so called because the brain areas they interfaced with were clustered in the neocortex they used nounbased and logically mediated collective reasoning to make policy decisions turk blinked at the words but kindly let me keep talking limbic democracies like vox worked differently their networks modulated more primitive areas of the brain in order to create an emotional and intuitive as opposed to a purely rational consensus to put it crudely in cortical democracies citizens reason together in limbic democracies they feel together im not sure i understand why the distinction why not a corticallimbic democracy best of both worlds such arrangements had been attempted treya had studied them in school the few corticolimbic democracies that had been created had worked well enough for a period of time and some had seemed idyllically peaceful but they were ultimately unstablethey almost always decayed into networkmediated catatonic loops a kind of mass suicide by blissful indifference not that the limbic democracies had fared much better though i didnt say so where the walls might hear me limbic democracies had their own weaknesses they were prone to collective insanity except our own of course vox was an exception to all the rules at least that was what i had been taught in school i kept my troubles to myself mainly because i didnt want to give oscar more leverage to use against me more important i didnt want to raise any doubt in turks mind that i was allison pearl that i preferred to be allison pearl and that i would remain allison pearl until the day they strapped me down and forced a network node into my brain stem but the situation wasnt as simple as that so the question i woke up with every day and went to bed with every night was i really allison pearl in the most obvious sense no how could i be allison pearl had lived and presumably died on earth ten thousand years ago back when earth was a habitable planet all that remained of her were a few gigs of diary entries that had somehow survived to the present day the diary began in allison pearls tenth year of life and ended for no apparent reason in her twentythird treya had absorbed all those diary entries and thousands of ancillary details about twentyfirstcentury life both cortically and limbically as data and as identity certainly treya had never believed herself to be allison pearl but she had carried allison pearl like a copybook deep in the meat of her brain the network had installed allison pearl in treyas psyche and the network had built and maintained rigorous barriers between allison and treya rigorous but not rigorous enough because here was a secret i had told no one even before the network went down even before the rebel farmers destroyed my node allison had been bleeding into treya and treya had never objected nor had she complained to her administrative handlers instead treya had kept the steady drip of allison pearl into her daily life a secreta guilty secret because there were qualities in allison that treya had coveted for herself treya was obedient allison was defiant treya was willing to submerge her identity in the greater identity of vox allison would sooner have died treya believed everything she was told by duly anointed authorities allison distrusted all authority on principle but even that distinction falls short of absolute truth better to say that through allison treya had begun to discover the possibilities of skepticism defiance rebellion so ask again what was i now that the door between treya and allison had been thrown wide open was i allison or was i treya being allison no neither i was a third thing i was what i had made of myself from all these incompatible parts and i was entitled to all my memories real and virtual vox had cultivated both treya and allison but vox hadnt counted on the consequences of the mixture and fuck vox anyway there it was the heresy treya had always resisted and for which the voice of allison had silently begged fuck vox fuck its quiet tyranny fuck its frozen dream religion and fuck its craven obsession with the hypotheticals fuck especially the madness that had brought vox to this ruined earth and fuck the more profound madness i believed was about to break loose aboard her fuck vox and bless allison pearl for making it possible to say so though oscar had agreed to withdraw the surgical knives he hadnt abandoned the project of convincing me to submit to surgery he conducted the campaign secondhand confronting me with people i couldnt refuse to speak to people who were or had been treyas friends and family they were my friends and family too in a real sense though i wasnt the person they had known much less the person they wanted and expected me to be and i was human enough to be hurt by their incomprehension and their grief one day oscar brought my mother treyas mother to see me my father my voxfather was an engineering worker who had been killed in the collapse of an exchange tunnel not long after i was born as a child i had been cared for by my mother and a crew of aunts all of whom loved me and whom i had loved and enough of treya remained in me that i couldnt help reaching out to the woman whose arms had so often comforted me couldnt help looking into her terrified eyes while i told her no her daughter wasnt dead only transformed freed from a harsh but invisible bondage she understood none of it dont you want to be useful she asked me dont you remember what it means to be part of a family i remembered altogether too well i ignored the question and told her i still loved her and truly i did but she wasnt consoled why should she be she had lost her daughter treya was gone and i was just some stubborn golem who had taken her place and in the moment i told her i loved her i saw from her frozen expression that she hated me in return actually hated me that the person she loved wasnt me but a shadow i had ceased to cast well maybe she was right i would never be the daughter she had known i was what i had become i was the thing i was and the name of the thing i was was allison allison allison pearl i whispered it to myself long after she had left the room i didnt mean to take these troubles to turk turk had troubles of his own he wore his stoic comewhatmay attitude proudly and i guessed he had earned it but fundamentally inescapably he was alone here a stranger in what must have seemed to him a terrifyingly strange land our rooms adjoined and some nights i woke to hear him pacing or mumbling to himself confronting fears i couldnt imagine it seemed to me that he must feel like a man trapped in a dream aware of the lunacy of it but helpless to break through to a saner reality i tried not to pin my own hopes and fears on him but i couldnt help thinking that for all our differences we were more alike than not i found myself wondering whether he might have crossed paths with allison pearl back in the impossibly distant twentyfirst century some chance encounter in a faceless american crowd surely if anyone in vox core was equipped to understand allison pearl it was turk so maybe it wasnt surprising that on one of those nights when neither of us could sleep i went into his room for comfort we talked at first the kind of talk we could have with no one but ourselves intimacies shared not because of but despite what we knew about each other i am the thing most like you in the world i said and youre the thing most like me at which point it was inevitable that we would go to bed and take some solace there and in the end i didnt care what the walls might hear or to whom they might whisper their dangerous secrets in the morning i toured him through vox core heel to head of course he couldnt see all of it or even more than a representative fraction vox core above ground was the size of a modest twentyfirstcentury city below ground in the hollow of the island it was bigger unravel all those complex spaces onto a twodimensional grid and it would have been the size of connecticut or maybe even california we avoided the damaged zones that were still being decontaminated and rode vertical transit downward we paused whenever the tube walls allowed a broad perspective so turk could see the plazas and terraces and tiers the wide agricultural levels bathed in artificial daylight the dormitory complexes set like alabaster chips in forested wildspaces then i took him to the lowest levels of vox the engineering decks the engines that drove vox were immensemore a territory than an objectbut i showed him reactor units the size of small towns bathed in an eternal wash of desalinated water i showed him a shadowy acreage of mumetal chambers in which magnetic fields directed flows of molten iron i led him past superconductive field coils around which moisture condensed like snow and was swept away in gales of forced air turk was awed which would play well with the administrators who were no doubt monitoring us there were ears in the walls even here but there were no ears where i took him next we rode a transit stem up as far as it would go then transferred to a smaller transport that slid up the spine of voxs tallest tower two more transfers and we arrived at the highest accessible public platform in vox core essentially a roof with a view back when vox had sailed the oceans of habitable worlds this platform had not been enclosed now an osmotic perimeter had been establishedi told turk it was a force field a quaint and inaccurate term but one he more or less understood it doesnt seem to be working too well he said smells a little like a pig farm out here i guessed it did the air was rank and windless though we could see clouds speeding past aloft seemingly close enough to touch i felt sick with vertigo even before we approached the rim for the first time i almost regretted the loss of my node missed its calming presence an invisible anchor i felt as if a brisk wind would carry me away vox was moving steadily south by southeast out of the indian ocean and into the south pacific the sea here was faintly purple to every horizon the sky a poisonous shade of ocher i hated the look of it turk peered into the misty distance the whole worlds like this i nodded it was the decline and death of these oceans that had spurred the great terrestrial exodus which in turn had fed the bitter rivalries and conflicts of the previously settled middle worlds and the hypotheticals did nothing to prevent it doesnt that seem strange that they would protect the planet from the expanding sun but do nothing to prevent a catastrophic human dieoff apparently theyre happy with an earth populated exclusively by bacteria no one knows why your people expected to find something different they werent my people but i didnt correct him they expected to enter into direct communion with the hypotheticals as soon as they arrived on earth its a religious idea really the people who founded vox were fanatics by any rational measure the history books wont tell you so but its true vox is a cult its beliefs were built into its network and scripted into its limbic democracy when youre networked all these doctrines feel reasonable they feel like common sense but not to you not anymore and not to the farmers the farmers are something less than citizens they were networked into compliance but not into communion they were slaves in other words i suppose you could say that they were taken as prisoners back in the middle worlds generations ago they refused to accept full citizenship so they were modified into cooperation harnessed and put to work thats why they destroyed their nodes as soon as the network crashed though the survivorsthe ones who had stayed in their environmentally sealed farmlands under the outislandswould have been reyoked by now the rebels of course were all dead including digger choi whose life turk had attempted to save saved him for all of half an hour maybe if the warplanes hadnt got him he would have died choking on the poisonous air turk pressed up against the security railing that followed the edge of the roof surveying what had become of the exterior land of vox the island was unprotected from the atmosphere and looked as if it had entered some grim and final autumn the forests were dead leaves were brown and scattered fruit rotted even the limbs of the trees looked leprous and fragile the wind of passage was dismantling the woodlands branch by branch vox i said i mean the collective vox limbic vox considered itself redeemed when we managed to pass through the arch but youre right what they found isnt what they expected and disappointment is setting in thats what we need to talk about up here where no one can hear us we need to make a plan he stood a moment gazing over the ruined lands then he said how bad do you expect it to get assuming vox fails to find a door into paradise down in antarctica it could getwell really bad the idea of merging vox with the hypotheticals is a foundational faith its the reason vox exists its the promise we were all given at birth along with our nodes no dissent from it has ever been possible nor would it have been tolerated but now youre up against an awkward truth they are im not one of them anymore i know im sorry sailing to antarctica is an act of desperation and its only postponing the inevitable okay so reality sets in sooner or laterthen what chaos anarchy blood in the streets i was voxish enough to feel a trace of shame at the answer to that question there have been other limbic cult communities in the past and when they fail well its ugly fear and frustration are amplified by the network to the point of selfdestruction people turn on their neighbors their families ultimately themselves there was no one to hear us but i lowered my voice social breakdown maybe communal suicide eventually starvation when the food supply fails and no one can opt out you cant just reconfigure the prophecies or choose to believe something elsethe contradiction is built into the coryphaeus i had seen hints of it even today as we traveled through the citya general sullenness too subtle for turk to pick up on but plain enough to me like the sound of thunder on a rising wind and theres no way to protect ourselves not if we stay here no and nowhere to go even if we had a way out christ allison he couldnt stop staring at the mottled horizon the rotting forest this was a pretty nice planet once upon a time i stood closer to him because we had come to the heart of the matter listen there are aircraft on vox that can fly from pole to pole without refueling and because youre uptaken the arch is still open to us we can leave if were careful and lucky we can get ourselves back to equatoria and in equatoria we could surrender to voxs ancient enemies the people who had nuked vox core in an attempt to prevent us from provoking the hypotheticals the cortical democracies despised and feared vox but they wouldnt refuse to accept a pair of earnest refugeesi hoped they might even help us make our way from equatoria to one of the pleasanter middle worlds where we could live out our lives in peace turk was giving me a hard look you can fly one of these vehicles no i said but you can i told him all of it then i told him the plan id worked out in the long nights when i couldnt sleep nights when treyas loneliness threatened to shut down allisons defiance nights when it was almost impossible to find a space between those two borders of self impossible even to name myself with any real conviction the plan was practical i believed or might be but it required a sacrifice turk might not be willing to make when he understood what i was asking he didnt give me an answer he said hed have to think about it i accepted that i said we could come up here in a few days and talk about it again in the meantime he said theres something else i need to do what i want to see the other survivor he said i want to see isaac dvali chapter nine sandra and bose after she left boses condo sandra had to drive to her apartment for fresh clothes so she was most of an hour late for work not that she really cared under the circumstances yesterday orrin mather had been accused of a violent outburstperhaps or probably if what bose had told her was true because congreve or someone above him had been paid in cash or longevity to keep orrin locked up sandra tried to contain her anger during the drive but succeeded only in damping it down to a low simmer she had disliked arthur congreve since the day he was appointed supervisor but it had never occurred to her that he might be as corrupt as he was unpleasant but she knew congreve had connections with municipal governmenta cousin who was a sitting councilmanand although the street cops at hpd thought he was too stingy with admissions the chief of police had made approving visits to state not once but twice since congreve had been installed she parked carelessly and hurried through the metal detector at the buildings entrance as soon as she was badged up she walked directly to the isolation wing it looked like any other part of the state care building isolation didnt imply dank sealed cells as it might have in a federal prison the isolation ward was just a little more generously supplied with locks and unbreakable furniture than the open wards designed to segregate potentially violent patients from less aggressive inmates such cases were relatively few the state system was empowered to deal with chronic homelessness not outright psychosis in a sense these were the least troublesome of the patients who passed through the system they required little debate among the staff and were usually transferred to psychiatric hospitals in short order whatever else orrin mather might be he wasnt a psychopath sandra would have bet her degree on it she wanted him out of isolation as soon as possible and she meant to begin by getting his side of the story it was sheer bad luck that nurse wattmore happened to be presiding over the entrance to the locked ward she should have buzzed sandra through without comment but she didnt sorry dr cole but i have my instructions and she proceeded to page congreve while sandra stood and helplessly fumed congreve appeared promptly his office was only a few doors down the corridor and he took sandra by the arm and steered her there he closed the door behind him and folded his arms his office was at least twenty degrees cooler than the temperature outsidethe airconditioning murmured stoically in its ventsbut the air smelled stale and greasy the empty wrappers of fastfood breakfast items littered his desk sandra started to speak but congreve held up his hand i want you to know first of all that im really disappointed by the unprofessional behavior youve been displaying lately i dont know what you mean what unprofessional behavior talking to this patient orrin mather after i assigned the case to dr fein and i have to assume thats where you were headed again this morning followup with a patient is hardly unprofessional when i conducted his intake interview i told him id be working his case i wanted to make sure he was okay with fein and that he didnt feel hed been abandoned that ceased to be your concern when i pulled you off the file pulled me off the file for no good reason im not obliged to justify that decision or any other i might happen to make not to you dr cole when the board appoints you to a managerial position you can question my choices until then you need to take care of the duties i assign to you you might be better able to do that by the way if you show up on time it was the first time she had been late in what a year and a half but she was too angry to slow down and this story about orrin assaulting an orderly excuse me were you a witness to that event do you know something you havent told me it cant be true orrin wouldnt hurt anyone the objection was feeble and she knew she had made a mistake as soon as she said it congreve rolled his eyes you determined this after a twentyminute interview that makes you a pretty remarkable diagnostician i guess were lucky to have you her cheeks were burning i talked to his sister you did when i met her outside the facility but youre telling me you consulted with the patients family on your own time then i guess you must have written up a formal report or at least a memo to me and dr fein no no sandra admitted and you fail to see a pattern of unprofessional behavior here that doesnt explain stop just stop before you make it worse congreve softened his tone look i admit your work has been satisfactory up to this point so im willing to write off recent events as stressrelated but you really need to step back and think about things in fact why dont you take the rest of the week off thats ridiculous she hadnt anticipated this im reassigning your caseload all of it go home dr cole calm down and deal with whatever it is thats distracting you from your duties take a week minimummore if you like but dont come back until youve recovered some objectivity sandra was one of the most reliable employees at state and congreve knew it but he probably also knew she had been seen at lunch with bose congreve simply wanted her out of the way until orrin was dealt with to whom had he retailed his conscience sandra wondered and what was the going price these days she wanted to ask him these questions and might have done so even at the risk of her job but she stopped herself she was only digging herself in deeper and in the end this wasnt about her or congreve it was about orrin fatally offending congreve wouldnt do orrin any good at all so she nodded curtly trying not to register the triumphant glare he gave her all right she said she tried to sound plausibly compliant if not cowed a week if he insisted out the door down the hallway thinking furiously she still had her pass and her credentials should she need to come back she paused at her own office to gather a few loose notes stepping into the corridor again she almost bounced off jack geddes the orderly come to escort you off the premises he said obviously relishing the astonishment on her face this was beyond insulting i told congreve i was leaving he asked me to make sure sandra was tempted to say something bitter in return but it would probably be lost on the orderly she shook his hand off her arm but forced a smile im not popular with management right now yeah well i know that tune i guess dr congreve says there was some kind of an incident with orrin mather yesterday you know orrin skinny kid hes in the locked ward now hell yeah i know him and it wasnt just an incident dr cole hes stronger than he looks he was making for the exit like his ass was on fire i was the one who had to wrestle him down and hold him till he could be sedated orrin was trying to escape i dont know what else youd call it dodging nurses like he was carrying the ball to the goal line so you what you tackled him maam noi didnt have to i stood in front of him and told him to calm the fuck down if anything he tackled me youre saying he initiated the violence she must have sounded skeptical geddes stopped in midstride and rolled up the loose righthand sleeve of his uniform there was a thick bandage on his forearm midway between wrist and elbow all due respect but whats that look like to you dr cole the little shit bit me so hard i needed a dozen stitches and a fucking tetanus shot locked ward yeah a locked cage would be better the heat enveloped sandra like a clenched fist as she crossed the parking lot to her car weather like this made it all too easy to imagine anaerobic bacteria blooming in the deeps of the sea as in orrins doomsday scenario out in the gulf sandra had heard there was already a deepwater anoxic zone that expanded every summer the shrimping business had dried up and gone elsewhere years since the sky was a sullen shade of blue as yesterday as the day before cauliflower clouds stalked the horizon but brought no relief when she opened the door of her car it released a gust of broiling air that smelled like molten plastic she stood a while letting the feeble breeze cool the interior when she climbed in she realized she had nowhere to go should she call bose but she was still thinking about what he had told her about himself before she left his apartment this morning i guess you need to know this about me before we go any farther he had said above all she needed some time to think so she did what she almost always did whenever she had unscheduled free time and a problem on her mind she drove out to live oaks to see her brother kyle chapter ten turks story the conversation with allison left me with more questions than i could count but the one that mattered most was how successfully could i lie i had lied to more than a few people over the course of my life for good and bad reasons there were truths about myself i didnt like to share and often enough i altered them in the telling but i didnt consider myself a naturalborn liar and that was unfortunate because i would have to become one now the lie i needed to tellthe lie i would have to enact in every waking moment and ideally in my sleepwas the pivot on which our futures were balanced vox progressed steadily toward antarctica making pretty good speed or so it seemed to me for a floating island with a population of some few million souls twice more i went with allison up to the high towers of vox core to discuss what we couldnt discuss down below and every time the view was the same the same ruined wasteland riding in the same discolored sea the days grew longerit was summer in these latitudesbut the sun hugged the horizon as if it was afraid of coming untethered from it to the best of anyones knowledge vox was the only remaining human habitation on earth i didnt discuss it with allison but maybe the awareness of that lonesome truth was part of what drew us closer together i set about teaching myself to navigate the citys passageways and gangways the voxish people were peculiar in the way they denominated public and private spaces but i learned to recognize the signs that distinguished homes from dormitories and dormitories from meeting places i even picked up a few words of the voxish language enough to make myself understood in the local markets though if i wanted to buy anythingan item of food say or one of the copper necklaces voxish men wore for decorationi needed oscar to complete the exchange in networkspace i arranged to have my hair cut short in the voxish style and before long i could pass or so allison said as a native seen from distance up close of course i was something no networked citizen would ever mistake for normal the feeling worked both ways viewed from a distance vox was a community like any other populated by men and women working at their jobs and raising their kids and doing all the other predictable things human beings do get in among those people however and you could feel the network running like a river behind their eyes enthusiasms and disappointments swayed them in unison like wind combing a field of wheat and as the days passed that invisible wind began to gust and turn uneasily i knew what it was allison wanted from me and i knew it might be our only hope of survival but the hardest thing to hide was my fear of it the fear of what i would have to do and the fear of what it would cost me oscar was never going to trust allison he considered her a traitor and wasnt bashful about saying so but oscar was the administrator in charge of us and for our plan to succeed he would have to trust one of us at least to some extent so i made it my business to cultivate that trust i began to ask his advice even when allison had already rendered an opinion i went to him with questions about the history books i was reading i was aloof and a little skeptical which was what he expected but he was eager to ingratiate himself and all it took to raise his hopes was a grateful word now and then i think he believed he might eventually be able to convert me to the cause of voxwhatever that cause was or was becoming oscars advantage in this duel was the network its omnipresent eyes and its powers of calculation my advantage was that i was neither networked nor a voxborn native which made me a little bit inscrutable so when i first demanded to see isaac dvali oscar was surprised but willing to cooperate and when i insisted on bringing allison along with me oscar gnashed his teeth but agreed it turned out isaac wasnt far away from the rooms i shared with allison he was being treated in a hospital unit a couple of corridors aft of us and oscar escorted us there ignoring the sidelong looks of the medical workers as we passed he warned me not for the first time that isaacs injuries had been grave and that i might be shocked at what i saw ive seen a few things i told him im not easy to shock spoke too soon as it turned out isaac wasnt under guard but he was attended by medical staff at all times and oscar had to consult and mollify a few of that flock before we were finally admitted to the room in which he lay surrounded by the machinery that was keeping him alive the first time i had seen isaac dvali was at his fathers compound in the equatorian desert there had been something uncanny about him even thenan adolescent boy who had been hybridized with hypothetical nanotechnology and raised in isolation from the rest of the world i had never really gotten to know him during the time we had been together in the badlandsi doubted anyone had ever really gotten to know himbut i was friendly toward him and i believed he welcomed that friendship it was isaac probably more than any of us drawn into the temporal arch who deserved a second shot at life but not this life i thought and not like this much of his body had been destroyed in the attack on vox core what was salvaged had been badly burned it was a testimony to voxish medical science and to the power of the hypothetical biotech embedded in him that isaac had survived at all allison hung back queasily as i approached isaacs nest of tubes and wires while oscar hovered at my shoulder many parts of him had to be regrown oscar was whispering his left leg and arm his lungs most of his internal organs in fact only a fraction of his brain tissue was salvageable isaacs head was encased in a gelatinous cowl that filled in the missing portions of his skull his right eye jaw and cheekbones were intact everything else was a foaming pinkish mass skin bone and brain tissue were slowly being reconstructed from within oscar said i took a step closer and isaacs single good eye rolled to follow me i guessed that meant there really was someone buried inside this living wreckagean arguably human being isaac i said its unlikely that he can hear you oscar whispered isaac its turk maybe you remember me the boy made no response his good eye remained moistly observant the other socket looked like a cup filled to brimming with scarlet jelly youre hurt pretty bad i said but theyre fixing you up takes time ill come and see you once in a while while youre getting better all right he opened his toothless mouth and sighed i could tell by allisons expression that the encounter had made her angry though i wasnt sure why she waited until we were back in the pedestrian walkway before she turned on oscar youre not just treating him she said coldly i saw the interface you networked him isaac is special you know that of all the uptaken isaac is the one who was linked to the hypotheticals even before he was taken up by the temporal arch hes the most effective intermediary between vox and the hypotheticals did you expect us to rely on words to communicate with him isaac needs to interact with the collectivity of vox not just me or you or mr findley or any other individual youre grafting your own madness into him oscar answered with a few words in his own language it was a voxish proverb allison told me later loosely translated the bee must not pass judgment on the hive as we sailed south vox sent out fleets of unmanned aircraft to map the continents of the earth at increasingly finer scales the drones flew at the upper limits of the atmosphere as much spacecraft as aircraft and their cameras and sensors were sensitive enough to penetrate the nearperpetual shroud of high haze they were designed to seek out any evidence of human activity past or present at first all they found were lifeless ruins i talked oscar into letting me see some of the images the aircraft had relayed to vox but the video was bland and uninformative many of the last human cities had been built in the boreal lands of the northern hemisphere places i still thought of as russia or scandinavia or canada but they had been abandoned now for more than a thousand years all that remained were faint suggestions of roads and foundations blemishes on the otherwise trackless uniformity of the circumpolar deserts i had read in the history books about the terrestrial exodus calling it that made it sound as if the earth had been systematically evacuated but the truth was much uglier even the vast number of refugees who flooded across the arch to equatoria had constituted only a fraction of the planets population the rest had simply died over a grueling few centuries of progressive impoverishment they died of starvation as crops failed and arable land shrank died of asphyxia as anaerobic blooms choked the oceans and poisoned the air hydrogen sulfide seeping from the seas had sterilized the coastal plains and river deltas then inexorably over decades the hinterlands had also succumbed massive fires swept through ravaged forests adding tons of liberated carbon to the thickening atmosphere decades of lightless cold were followed by decades of rising heat as the climate began to oscillate like a cracked bell the trigger had been pulled back in my day oscar said human beings had burned much of the carbon stored on earth as oil coal and natural gas and the consequences of that would have been bad enough but it was the discovery of oil deposits in the equatorian desert a bounty of light sweet crude easily extracted and imported by sea across the arch of the hypotheticals that had signed the planets death sentence maybe we could have burned all our own carbon and survived the consequences but pumping two worlds worth of co into the atmosphere had overwhelmed any conceivable coping mechanism i told oscar that made us sound pretty stupid no he said it was sad but completely understandable ten billion human beings without any cortical or limbic augmentation had simply acted to maximize their individual wellbeing they hadnt given much thought to longterm consequences but how could they they had no reliable mechanism by which they could think or act collectively blaming those people for the death of the ecosphere made as much sense as blaming water molecules for a tsunami maybe so but it was depressing all the same and i didnt hide my reaction if i wanted oscar to trust me i had to let him see my feelings some of them he said i should try to look at it through the lens of time all this worlds death all its grief was finished now and when the destiny of vox was fulfilled a new era would begin an age in which humanity would consort with its masters on an equitable basis much will be made clear mr findley miracles will become possible youll see youre lucky to be aboard vox at such a time you really believe that of course i do on the basis of a few prophecies on the basis of the calculations and inferences of the founders of vox those calculations were sound enough to carry us across the oceans of a half dozen worlds and sound enough to get us to earth a dead planet he smiled oscar had held back a nugget of information like a stage magician waiting for the right moment to pull a paper flower out of his sleeve not entirely dead we have new images from antarctica look he showed me another video segment like the rest it had been shot from high in the troposphere like the rest it was hard to interpret at first glance it appeared to show one more stretch of generic desert from a part of the world that in my day had been buried in ice i might have been looking at boulders or pebbles the scale was marked in characters i couldnt read but at the center of the image was a blip of regularity and the image stabilized and resolved as the aircraft moved closer there was something structural there for sure mistobscured squares and rectangles in dusty pastel colors some of these objects oscar said were nearly the size of vox core and they werent ruined or abandoned buildings not in the ordinary sense it was increasingly obvious as the view honed down to a narrow field that some of the structures had left long linear trails in the antarctic dust they were mobile we believe these are the work of the hypotheticals oscar said mildly i guessed he was right the structures didnt look like anything human beings would build but the image abruptly faded to a staticky blank the drone aircrafts sensors had failed oscar explained more drones had been sent to the same site but they had failed too oscar chose to interpret the failures optimistically clearly the hypotheticals still have a presence on earth just as clearly they registered the presence of the unmanned vehicles and reacted to them which meansi think the conclusion is inescapablethat theyre aware of us his smile was fixed and unworried they know were coming mr findley and i believe theyre waiting for us to arrive chapter eleven sandra and bose the institution where sandras brother kyle cole lived was called the live oaks polycare residential complex it was located on a broad expanse of land that had once been a ranch a creek ran nearby and there was in fact a grove of live oaks on the property when she first arranged to have kyle committed to this place sandra had been curious enough to run a search on the term live oakswhy live live as opposed to what but it turned out the trees were called live oaks because they stayed green in winter prosaically enough in texas she had read a grove of live oaks was called a mott she had tried out the term on the receptionist once back when she was new in the state and still bashful about her new england accent id like to take kyle out to that mott of live oaks by the creek the receptionist had given her a blank stare i mean the grove of trees sandra added blushing oh well surely mott or not it had become a ritual weather permitting most of the day staff recognized her by now sandra knew the majority of them by name another hot one today the attending nurse said helping sandra help her brother out of bed and into a wheelchair but kyle likes the warm weather i think he likes the shade of the trees that was of course a surmise kyle hadnt expressed a preference for the shade of the trees or for anything else kyle couldnt walk or control his bowels or speak a coherent sentence when he was distressed he scrunched up his face and made a hooting sound when he was happyor at least not un happyhe grimaced in a way that showed his teeth and gums an animals smile his happysounds were soft sighs formed deep in his throat ah ah ah ah today he seemed happy to see sandra ah he turned his face toward her as she wheeled him down the stonepaved pathway and across the green lawn to the live oaks the nurse had put an astros cap on him to keep the sun out of his eyes the baseball cap threatened to fall off as he craned his neck sandra straightened it for him there was a picnic table in the grove more for visitors than for the patients most of whom werent ambulatory today she and kyle had the grove to themselves the shade and a moist coolness that seemed to rise up from the creek made the heat tolerable and almost pleasant there was thank god a breeze the oak leaves trembled and seined the light kyle was five years older than sandra before what the doctors called his accident sandra had always been able to share her troubles with him he had taken his role as big brother seriously though he joked about it i dont have any advice for you sandy he used to say he was the only person she would allow to call her sandy all my advice is bad advice but he had always listened carefully and thoughtfully and that was the important thing she still liked talking to him though he couldnt understand even a syllable of what she said his eyes followed her when she spoke perhaps because he liked the sound of her voice and she wondered despite what the neurologists said whether there was still some fragment of working memory inside him an ember of awareness that might occasionally flicker with recognition im in a little bit of trouble these days she began ah kyle said a sound as gentle and meaningless as the rustling of the leaves it was the spin that had killed her father and ruined her brother sandra had considered and reconsidered the event over many years looking for an ultimate cause she would have liked to pin her hatred on some particular thing or person but in this case blame was slippery it glided over potential targets but refused to stick and ultimately behind all the trivial and quotidian facts behind the million unfathomable contingencies there was the spin the spin had changed and mutilated many lives not just her brothers not just her own in a perverse way the spin had been good for sandras mother sandras mother was an electronics engineer whose career had stalled out until the spin rendered satellite communications obsolete and created a booming market for aerostatic signalrelay devices she had been hired by a company owned by the aerostat tycoon e d lawton where she designed an airborne antenna stabilization system that became an industry standard her work was much in demand and she was often away from home the opposite was true of sandras father the initial chaos and confusion that followed the disappearance of the stars from the sky had triggered a global recession in which her fathers software business had wilted like a christmas poinsettia after new years day thator the spin itself the blunt and simple fact of ithad thrown him into a state of depression that occasionally lifted but never entirely went away he just kind of forgot how to smile sandras brother once explained and sandra ten had accepted this nonexplanation somberly easy for us sandra thought the generation that followed were so accustomed to these truths that the earth was encircled by nameless alien beings capable of manipulating even the passage of time that to these godlike beings the human race was both trivial and somehow significant you lived with it because you had always lived with it sandra herself had been born at the tag end of the spin about the time the stars scattered and strange though they had become reappeared in the sky she may have owed her own existence to a last burst of optimism or desperation on the part of her parents the affirmative act of creating new life in a world that had seemed to be crumbling into anarchy but the return of the stars had made no real difference to her father it was as if some internal process of decay had taken root within him and could not be halted in its advance no one ever said anything meaningful about this sandras mother when she was home labored to create an impression of normalcy and because neither sandra nor kyle dared to contradict her the illusion was surprisingly easy to sustain her father was often ill he spent a lot of time upstairs resting that wasnt difficult to understand was it of course not it was sad it was inconvenient but life went on it did at least until the day sandra came home from school and found her father and her brother in the garage sandra was three weeks away from her eleventh birthday when it happened she had been surprised to find the house empty kyle home from school with a cold had left his computer unfolded on the kitchen table it was playing a movie something noisy with airplanes and explosions the sort of thing he liked she switched it off and that was when she heard the car motor growling not the car her mother drove to work but the familys second car the one parked in the garage the one her father used to drive before he hid himself in the upstairs dimness she understood suicide or at any rate the idea of it she even knew that some people committed suicide by locking themselves in a closed space with an idling engine carbon monoxide poisoning she supposedit was a thought she harbored mainly in the bitter months that followedthat she even understood her fathers wish to die people could get that way it was like a sickness no one should be blamed for it but why had her father taken kyle into the garage with him and why had kyle agreed to go she opened the door that connected the garage to the kitchen the exhaust fumes made her dizzy so she turned back and went outside and lifted up the big garage door to allow clean air to flow in to flush out the poison the door slid open easily even though her father had stuffed rags into the gaps to keep the fumes from leaking away it wasnt even locked then she opened the car door on the drivers side and managed to lean across her fathers lap and turn the engine off her fathers head had lolled onto his shoulders and his skin had turned a delicate uncanny shade of blue there was a crust of dried spittle on his lips she tried unsuccessfully to wake him kyle was up front beside his father wearing a seat belt had he been expecting to go somewhere neither of them stirred when she shook them when she shouted she called and waited in front of the house for the ambulance minutes passed like hours she thought about calling her mother but her mother was at a trade show in sri lanka and sandra didnt know how to reach her it was a sunny afternoon in may beginning to feel like summer in the boston suburb where sandra lived there was no one else on the street it was as if the houses had gone to sleep as if all the neighbors had been sealed indoors like dreams the houses were dreaming the medics who arrived took sandra to the hospital with them and found a place for her to sleep sandras mother arrived back from colombo the following morning sandras father it turned out had been dead long before sandra discovered him there was nothing she could have done kyles young body had put up a fiercer resistance to the poison he was breathing a doctor explained he was alive but his brain was irreversibly damaged and he would never recover his higher functions sandras mother had died seven years after her father of a pancreatic cancer that had been diagnosed too late for meaningful treatment her will had stipulated a sum of money to be held in trust for sandras education and a far more substantial amount to pay for kyles continuing needs when sandra moved to houston she had asked the estates lawyers to find kyle a residence nearby if there was an acceptable one where she could visit him regularly the live oaks polycare residential complex was what they had chosen live oaks was devoted to caring for severely disabled patients and was rated as one of the best such facilities in the country it was expensive but no matter the estate could afford it kyle had been sedated for the flight west sandra had arranged to be present when he woke up but if waking up in a strange bed in a strange room had caused him any distress or anxiety kyle had shown no sign of it he sat in the midday warmth as if waiting for her to speak today unusually sandra wasnt sure where to begin she started by telling him about jefferson bose who he was and how much she liked him i think youd like him too hes a policeman she paused but hes something else too she lowered her voice though there was no one else in the mott to hear her you always liked stories about mars from the spin days how the human colonies turned into whole civilizations while earth was wrapped up in the spin barrier how they had a fourth stage of life where people could live longer if they took on certain obligations and duties remember that the stories wun ngo wen told the world before he was killed well mars doesnt talk to us anymore and some pretty unscrupulous people have turned those martian pharmaceuticals into something uglier something they can sell for profit on the black market but there were people around wun ngo wen people like jason lawton and his friends who took martian ethics seriously i used to hear rumors and there were always stories online about that about clandestine groups who took the longevity treatment the way the martians did keeping it pure and not selling it but sharing it the way it was made to be shared all strings attached using it wisely she was nearly whispering now kyles eyes still followed the motion of her lips i didnt used to believe those stories but now i think theyre true this morning bose had told her he wasnt just a cop he told her he had connections with people who followed the martian customs his friends hated the black market trade he said the police could be bribed but boses friends couldnt because they already had taken the longevity treatmentthe original version and what he was doing he was doing in their interests she said this very quietly to kyle now the question you probably want to ask the question as an older brother he surely would have asked is do i trust him kyle blinked meaninglessly i do she said and she felt better for confirming it aloud its what i dont know that worries me like the meaning if any of orrin mathers scifi story like the bandage on jack geddess arm and what it might imply about orrins capacity for violence like the scar bose had tried to conceal from her and which he had still not explained time passed eventually a nurse came down the pathway to the grove of live oaks moving slowly in the heat time to get this fella back to bed she announced kyles hat had fallen off though that didnt matter so much in the shade of the trees his hair was thinning prematurely sandra could see his scalp pink as a babys skin through wisps of pale blond hair she picked up the astros cap and put it on him gently ah okay she said rest easy kyle see you soon she told him sandra had studied psychiatry in order to understand the nature of despair but all she had really learned was the pharmacology of it the human mind was easier to medicate than to comprehend there were more and better antidepressant medications now than when her father had endured his long decline and that was a good thing but despair itself remained mysterious clinically and personally as much a visitation as a disease the long drive back to houston took her past a state care internment facility one of the places her patients went after they were assigned custodial status passing the state camp inevitably tweaked her conscience usually sandra avoided looking at itit was comfortingly easy to overlook the entrance was marked only with a small and dignified sign the facility itself was hidden beyond a grassy ridge yellow and sere very little of it showed from the highway though she glimpsed the tops of the guard towers but she had been up that road a couple of times and knew what lay beyond it a huge twostory cinderblock residence surrounded by makeshift expansion housing mostly sheetmetal trailers donated by fema from surplus stock encircled by wire fencing it was a community of men mostly men and women a few carefully segregated from one another and endlessly waiting because that was what you did in such a place you waited waited for your turn in an occupational rehab program waited for the slim possibility of transfer to a state care halfway house waited for letters from distant and indifferent relatives waited with slowly hemorrhaging optimism for the miraculous advent of a new life it was a town made of wire and corrugated aluminum and chronic despair medicated despairshe herself had probably written some of the prescriptions that were perennially renewed at the camp dispensary and sometimes even that wasnt enoughsandra had heard that the biggest security problem at the compound was the flow of intoxicants liquor pot opiates meth smuggled in from outside there was a bill before the texas legislature to privatize the residential camps attached to the bill was a proviso that work therapy could be construed as permission to hire out healthy inmates for roadwork or seasonal farm labor to defray the public expense of their internment if it passed sandra thought the legislation would mean the end of any tattered idealism still attached to the state care project what had been intended as a way of providing comfort and protection to the chronically indigent would have become a cosmetically acceptable source of indentured laborslavery with a haircut and a clean shirt the watchtowers disappeared in her rearview mirror hidden among the baking yellow hills she thought about how angry she had been at congreve who had taken her off orrin mathers case to prevent her from rendering an inconvenient diagnosis but how clean were her own hands how many souls had she committed to internment just because they matched a profile in the diagnostic and statistical manual saving them from the cruelty and violence of the streets yes saving them from exploitation and hiv and malnutrition and addiction and there was enough truth in that to salve her conscience but in the end saving them for what it was almost dark when she got home september now the days getting shorter though it was still hotter than high august she checked for any fresh message from bose there was one but it was only another installment of orrins notebook her phone buzzed while she was microwaving dinner she picked up without looking at the display expecting bose but the voice on the other end was unfamiliar dr cole sandra cole yes feeling wary though she couldnt say why i hope you had a rewarding visit with your brother today who is this someone with your best interests at heart she was conscious of the fear that began in her belly and traveled up her spine and seemed to lodge somehow in her heart this is not good she thought but she didnt put down the phone she waited listening chapter twelve turks story what is majestic about them oscar was saying almost incomprehensibly majestic is their physical structuretrillions upon trillions of diverse components from the microscopic to the very large distributed over an entire galaxy a human body is trivial less than microscopic by comparison and yet we matter to them in some way were a significant part of their existence he wore the abstracted smile of a man contemplating a sacred vision and they know were here and theyre coming to meet us he was talking about the hypotheticals for the first time oscar had invited me to his home before today i hadnt really envisioned oscar having either a home or a family but he had both and he wanted me to see them his home was a low pleasant wood and stone structure deep in one of the starboard tiers of vox core set around with delicate thinleafed trees the members of his family present when i visited were three women and two children the children his daughters were eight and ten years of age one of the women was his permanent partner the other two were more distant members of the familythe voxish language had a word for the relationship but oscar said it wasnt easy to translate into english we settled on cousins the family shared a meal of braised fish and vegetables during which i answered polite questions about the twentyfirst century then the cousins escorted the noisy daughters away oscars partner a mildeyed woman named brion with the customary string of titles and honorifics lingered after dinner but eventually excused herself which left oscar talking to me about the hypotheticals as the artificial daylight faded to dusk it wasnt just casual conversation i began to understand that oscar had invited me here to pose a difficult question or make some onerous demand even if they know about us i said whats that mean he touched a control surface in the table calling up a twodimensional image that floated in the air between us it showed a recent aerial view of the hypothetical machines as they inched their way across the antarctic desert three featureless boxes accompanied by a half dozen smaller rectangles objects as bluntly simple as drawings in a high school geometry text over the course of the last week he said they changed direction the path theyre now following intersects precisely with our current location the pride he took in this apparent confirmation of voxish prophecy wasnt just his own i had seen the same knowing smile on other faces today these machines or devices similar to them have crossed and recrossed all the continents of earth now that we know what to look for we can recognize and analyze their tracks evidence suggests they may even have traveled across the ocean floorsthats not impossible our scholars believe theyre mapping the topography of the earth to a very close approximation why would they want to do that any answer would be speculative but think of it mr findley these machines are the local incarnation of a system of intelligence that literally spans the galaxy and theyre coming for us if so they werent in any hurry the hypothetical machines were traveling at two or three kilometers per hour over flat land and they were still more than a thousand kilometers away out in the windswept wilkes basin with the transarctic mountains between us and them for that reason oscar said weve decided to send an expedition to meet them he seemed to expect me to share his delight at this news as if his enthusiasm was contagiousas it would have been i guessed had i been wired into the network when i didnt respond he continued our unmanned aircraft consistently fail to function if they come within a certain distance of the machines the same may be true of manned vehicles therefore we propose to travel to a point outside that radius and proceed on foot why oscar what do you expect to happen if nothing else we can conduct a passive reconnaissance or some sort of interaction with the machines might take place one of the cousins brought us glasses of juice and left us alone again the evening breeze moved through the open architecture of the house a window looked aft and i could see rain falling over distant regions of the tier gossamer banners of it far away in any case oscar said cautiously we think it would be desirable to have one of the uptaken on the expedition there were only two uptaken in vox core and i was one of them the other of course was isaac dvali i had been following his progress isaacs skull had been successfully reconstructed and lately he had learned to walk a few paces and pronounce a few tentative words but he was far too fragile to risk on an expedition to the antarctic hinterland do i have a choice in this of course you do at this point im simply asking you to consider it in fact i knew i would have to accept doing this for oscar would buttress his belief in my possible conversion to voxish principles and it was necessary for oscar to believe in that possibility if allisons plan was to have any chance of succeeding if there still was a plan if we hadnt already surrendered to our own lies the truth was that i had no home in the world but vox and vox as oscar insisted was eager to adopt me if i was in a mood to accept it i tried to behave like a man for whom that offer held some attraction maybe on some level it did now that i knew it better vox had ceased to be a frightening abstraction i had learned how to dress so that i wouldnt stand out in a crowd and i understood at least the most basic social customs i continued to study the books i had been given trying to pry comprehensible stories out of the legalistic prose i knew that vox had originated as a planned polity in the global ocean of a planet called ester a middle world in the chain of habitable planets i had learned to name the founders of voxs limbic democracy and to enumerate its five hundred years of wars and alliances victories and defeats i could recite a little of the vast collage of theory and speculation that constituted the voxish prophecies some of us who had disappeared into equatorias temporal arch ten thousand years ago were named in those prophecies eerily enough our second coming had been calculated to the day and hour in other words i had begun to create a voxish identity for myself in every way i could short of having a node installed at the base of my neck meanwhile allison was moving in the opposite direction away from her past and deeper into her impersona the price she paid was social isolation and a chronic brittle loneliness and that served a purpose too she wanted her overseers to believe she was losing touch with reality after i left oscar i made my way back to the quarters i shared with her i found her sitting at a table shoulders hunched doing what she had been doing daily and obsessively for weeks now writing she wrote on sheets of paper with a pencil paper hadnt been hard to come by since vox manufactured small amounts of it for various purposes vox didnt use conventional pens or pencils however but once i explained the concept to oscar he had agreed to have a machine shop produce a few samplesrods of graphite in carbonfiber tubes more like what we used to call mechanical pencils the original allison pearl had been an obsessive writer which was one reason her diaries had been so useful to the voxish scholars who recreated her i put my hand on allisons shoulder to let her know i was home leaning over her i caught a glimpse of her cursive script big letters shakily produced she had been given allison pearls urge to write but not the physical skill itself vox was anchored relatively close to the mainland of antarctica in a deep basin where the ross ice shelf had once been allison had visited one of the high towers today and she was writing about what shed seen the mountains are the queen maud range in the ancient atlases gray bleak teeth under an ugly sky dead as everything else on this ruined planet green clouds dropping yellow rain on the windward slopes its like a judgment on humanity and tho i know humans have moved on from this place it still looks like a monument to our mistakes how we lived lives with consequences we could never truly predict or understand she cupped her hand over the paper and looked up at me oscar wants me to go inland i said her eyes flared but she kept silent i told her about the proposed expedition we talked about that a while the way we talked about everything these days calculating the effect our words might have on an unseen audience she didnt like the idea but she didnt argue about it eventually she went back to her writing i picked up one of my books the collapse of mars and the martian diaspora and took it to bed with me remembering what oscar had said about the incomprehensible majesty of the hypotheticals the hypotheticals had created a string of worlds linked by arches one end anchored on earth and the other on mars the ten vastly distant habitable planets between them comprising a continuous extended landscape something the book called a distributed interstellar topology mars had never been an easy place for human beings to live despite our engineering of it and a doorway to greener kinder worlds had been a gift too great for the martians to refuse but without their careful husbandry mars had reverted to its essential nature as a cold dry planetone more hostile desert in a universe that seemed full of them the martians like the earthlings had lost a habitable homeworld i remembered stories about the martian ambassador wun ngo wen who had arrived on earth during the spin his mars had sounded like a saner place than earth the martians had already tapped hypothetical technology in a modest way using it to create their famous longevity treatment but according to the book they had eventually repudiated that and every other form of hypothetical technology most of the early bionormative philosophers had been martians the book said not that they opposed biotechnology in itselfthe first cortical democracies had been martian inventionsbut they insisted on restricting themselves to human biotech which could be fully understood and controlled that was a shortsighted and oppressive doctrine the book suggested i had put down the book by the time allison came to bed we still slept together though we hadnt made love for weeks it was our unguarded moments that put us most at risk there was no telling what dangerous inferences the network might draw from our sighs and gasps the script we had written for ourselves would play out more plausibly without passionate interludes but i missed her and not just physically i woke that night and found her mumbling a slurry of english and voxish words asleep but not at rest her eyelids trembling and her face wet with tears and when i touched her cheek she moaned and turned away the day before the expedition was scheduled to leave i visited isaac dvali in the medical suite oscar insisted on coming with me he took a professional interest in my interactions with isaac your presence always has a measurable effect on him he told me his pulse rate increases when youre with him the electrical activity in his brain becomes more intense and more coherent maybe he just likes company no one else has this effect on him could be he recognizes me im sure he does oscar said in one way or another isaacs condition had improved considerably and most of the lifesupport machines that had been attached to him had been taken away a crowd of physicians and nurses still hovered out of earshot but he ignored them and looked directly at me he could do that now the reconstruction of his ruined head and body was almost complete the flesh on the left side of his skull was still translucent and when he opened his mouth i could see the hinge of his jaw moving like a crab in a milky tide pool but his new left eye had lost its bloodshot opacity and it focused in tandem with the other i took a step toward the chair where he was reclining hey isaac i said his jaw did its crabdance under a veil of capillaries tuh he managed to say tuhtuh its me its turk turk he nearly shouted it one of the voxish physicians whispered to oscar who translated isaacs voluntary motor functions are much better now but his impulse control is still very poor shut up isaac screeched isaac had been touched hard by the hypotheticals which made him the next best thing to a living god i tried to imagine how oscar felt being chastised by a deity with poor impulse control hey im here i said right here isaac but the effort at speech had already wearied him his eyelids went to halfmast his arms trembled against the restraints that bound him to his chair i looked over my shoulder and said does he really need to be tied down more consultation with the voxish physicians then oscar said in a barely audible whisper yes im afraid so for his own safety at this stage of his recovery he could easily hurt himself you mind if i stay a while longer i had addressed the question to isaac but it was oscar who fetched me a chair when i sat down isaacs eyes veered nervously until they found me again an expression that might have been anxiety or relief played over his pale face you dont have to say anything i told him he trembled against his restraints he responds positively to the sound of your voice one of the physicians suggested so i talked i talked to isaac for most of an hour registering his occasional grunts as encouragement since i wasnt sure how much he understood about vox or how hed got here that was what i talked about i told him how we had been taken up by the temporal arch in the equatorian desert and how we had come to vox after a passage of ten thousand years we were back on earth now i saidvox had some business to attend to herebut earth had suffered considerably in all the centuries wed been gone i got the feeling oscar didnt like me saying any of this probably he had hoped to introduce isaac to vox in his own way and in his own words but the doctors seemed pleased with isaacs physical reaction and oscar wasnt willing to provoke another outburst it was isaac himself who ultimately shut the session down his eyes wandered and he began to look sleepy i took that as a cue i dont want to tire you out i said ill be away for a little while but ill come and see you again soon promise i stood up that was when isaac began to shakenot a gentle tremor but a fullblown convulsion his head whipped from side to side and his eyes bulged against their paperthin lids the team of doctors hurried toward him as i backed away turk he shouted spittle frothing on his lips then he stiffened his eyes rolled up until only the whites showed but his lips and tongue and jaw began to move forming precise english words majestic he whispered billions of diverse components distributed over an entire galaxy they know were here theyre coming to meet us the same words oscar had used i glanced at oscar his face was nearly as pale as isaacs turk isaac shouted again one of the physicians pressed a silvery tube against isaacs neck his body slumped back into the chair his eyes closed and the chief medic gave me a look that needed no interpretation leave now allison came with me to the aircraft docks the day the survey expedition was due to leave the docks were situated on a high platform above the city protected from the toxic air by a transparent osmotic filter a crowd of soldiers milled around us their gear stacked on the deck waiting to be loaded ochercolored clouds swept past somber in the raking light of the sun allison hugged me and said goodbye come back she said and then recklessly she whispered into my ear soon uttering even that single word was a risk she must have hoped the network wouldnt hear her or if it did that the word would sound like a lovers appeal to a man who was beginning to edge out of her grasp but that wasnt what she meant what she meant was we have to act soon or well lose our best shot at escape she meant we could be exposed at any time i will i whispered back meaning i know chapter thirteen sandra and bose it was past ten by the time sandra finally managed to get hold of bose when she explained what had happened he told her to sit tight hed be there as soon as he could less than half an hour passed before he buzzed her from the security gate in the lobby she let him in and listened until she heard the sound of the elevator opening in the hall she waited for his knock before she unhooked the latch and opened the door he was in his offduty gear jeans and a white tshirt he apologized for not returning her calls sooner she asked if he wanted coffee she had put on a fresh pot he shook his head just tell me what the guy said best you can remember it the voice had been gruff and a little nasal an older mans voice it was the insinuating familiarity of it that had first made her afraid someone with your best interests at heart the caller had said no not likely is this about kyle is he okay no more or less okay than ever the caller said brain damage right which is why hes stored in that vegetable locker for the rest of his life tell me who you are or im going to hang up thats your prerogative dr cole but again im trying to help you so dont be in a hurry about it i know you were visiting your brother today and i know a couple of other things about you i know you work at state care i know you took an interest in a patient there orrin mather and i know about jefferson bose you took an interest in officer bose too she gripped the phone but didnt answer not that im saying youre fucking him necessarily but youve been spending a lot of time with the guy considering you only met him a couple of days ago how well do you really know him you might want to ask yourself that just hang up she thought or maybe she ought to listenit might be important to be able to tell bose what the caller wanted she felt invaded but she tried to muster her thoughts if youre trying to threaten me pay attention i want to help you and you need a little help you have no idea what you wandered into here how much did bose tell you about himself dr cole did he tell you hes the only honest cop on the houston payroll tell you hes interested in busting a lifedrug ring well let me paint you another picture of jefferson bose something maybe a little less flattering a man with a failing police career and shitty prospects for promotion a man whos been trying unsuccessfully to interest the federal bureau of investigation in his theory about controlled chemicals coming into the country through a local importer a man who has fuckall evidence to support that theory and is reduced to trying to depose a mentally retarded night watchman let me add a man whos not above seducing a female state care worker in order to get that deposition youve been taken advantage of here and you have to start facing up to the truth go to hell okay you dont believe me fair enough why should you we could argue all night but i said i wanted to help you or to help you help your brother kyle if you prefer now i have to give officer bose his duehes not completely full of shit there are folks in houston who are involved with the lifedrug trade thats a fact and yes the trade is illegal but ask yourselfmaybe you have asked yourselfis it such a bad thing what theyre doing a treatment that can add thirty or forty years to a persons life whats so sinful about that what gives the government the right to keep it from us because its bad for their what social planning if youre trying to make a point im asking you to think outside the box dr cole youre young youre healthy you dont need the martian treatmentthats fine you might feel different when that pretty skin starts to sag when you come to the time of life when theres nothing to look forward to but a hospital bed or a grave okay not yet and probably not for a long time but things happen suppose you get a bad diagnosisnot years from now but next weekstage four cancer nothing they can do for you with ordinary medicine well the life drug isnt just for what they call longevity you live longer because its inside you patrolling your body for bad cells tumors all that filth itll cure your cancer you still want to keep that drug locked up condemn yourself to death for the sake of what they call genomic security pardon me if i call that bullshit i dont see what this has to do with anything im saying okay youre not in a position right now where you need this treatment for yourself and maybe youre such a staunch advocate of whateverthefuck principle is involved you never will want it at least for yourself but i want to remind you again its a cure its a cure for things theres no other cure for diseases of the body also of the brain she managed to say a little breathlessly this is absurd on the contrary ive seen it happen youre talking about a criminal act im talking about a bottle the size of your index finger with a colorless liquid inside consider what it could do for kyle you take your brother out of live oaks and you administer this drug hell run a fever for a while but after a couple of weeks hes good as new all that damaged brain tissue completely restored or close enough that you can help him get his life back think about your responsibility as a doctor and as a sister even with the best therapy money can buy kyles wasting awayhes half dead already hes dying by inches you know that so what do you do you let him go or do you do this one thing this simple thing this thing other people are doing every day for far more selfish reasons ask yourself its a practical proposition the bottle im talking about im holding it in my hand right now i can get it to you anonymously and safely no one will know anything about it but you and me all that has to happen is you stop interfering with dr congreves business tomorrow morning you get up you drive to state you apologize to congreve and you sign a document recusing yourself from orrins case for conflict of interest despite the heat despite the sweat trickling down her cheek sandra felt cold the window curtains rose and fell in a fitful breeze at the other end of the room the video screen flickered in mute hysteria i wont sacrifice orrin mather who said anything about sacrifice so orrin goes into state care is that so awful a clean place to live and some daily supervision no more sleeping on the streetit sounds like a decent outcome to me taking the long view or dont you have any faith in the system you work for if states such a bad deal maybe you should reconsider your choice of career maybe she should maybe she had maybe she shouldnt even be listening to this how do i know i can believe you the reason you can believe me is that i took the trouble to make this call please understand im not threatening you in any way im simply attempting to do business with you admittedly there are no guarantees but isnt it worth gambling when your brothers future is at stake youre just some voice on the phone all right im going to hang up now i dont need you to say yes or no dr cole i just want you to think about the situation if you contribute to a satisfactory outcome in this matter youll be rewarded leave it at that but i she began uselessly the caller was gone she explained it all to bose surprisingly calmlyor maybe not so surprisingly given the two glasses of wine shed poured and gulped while she was waiting for him to arrive her mother who used to take a drink or two in stressful moments had called the effect dutch courage sandra glanced at the label on the wine bottle napa valley courage bastard bose said yes he must have had you followed and hes well connected enough that he was able to find out who you were visiting atwhats it called live oaks polycare residential complex where your brother lives kyle yes you didnt tell me you had a brother well it didnti wasnt hiding it from you he gave her a speculative look i didnt think you were did you notice anything while you were out there an unfamiliar face maybe a car on the road no nothing and nothing distinctive about the voice he sounded like he might be an older guy a little phlegmy otherwise no she had checked to see if her phone had recorded the callers number but of course it hadnt im not even sure why this person thinks im worth threatening or bribing congreve already bumped me from orrins case any medical decision is out of my hands unless they can compromise you youre still a dangerous loose end you could testify about congreves behavior if the matter came up in court you could go to authorities with what you already know but without orrins testimony at this point i dont think these folks are worried about what he might say in court i think theyre worried about what he saw in the warehouse and where that knowledge might lead a federal investigation if hes allowed to talk freely about it getting orrin declared incompetent is just the first step i expect they want him drugged and permanently out of sight or worse dead sandra whispered they cant do that once hes in internment bose said gently things can happen well yes she had seen the statistics in the past year there had been half a dozen violent assaults at the local internment camp not to mention deaths from drug overdoses or deliberate suicide on a percapita basis the state camps were relatively safefar safer statistically than living on the street but yes things could happen maybe things could even be arranged to happen so how do we stop them bose smiled slow down i mean tell me what i can do let me give it some thought we dont have a lot of time bose orrins final review was scheduled for friday and congreve could call it sooner if he felt pressured i know but its past midnight and we both need to get some sleep ill stay here tonightif thats okay with you of course it is i can sleep on the couch if you like dont you dare in the morning over breakfast sitting at her kitchen table and watching bose plow through the eggs she had scrambled for him sandra thought about what the anonymous caller had said about kyle the longevity drug she said would it really help someone like my brother last night in the dark of her bedroom she had told bose about kyle and her father bose had put his arms around her while she told the story when she finished he hadnt said anything falsely consolinghadnt said anything at all he had just kissed her forehead gently and that was enough it might repair the physical damage but it wouldnt restore him to what he was before it wouldnt bring back his memories or his skills or even his original personality she remembered scans of kyles brain the neurologist at live oaks had shown her huge patches of necrotic tissue like the wings of a deadly black moth even if those areas were magically repaired they would still be blank and empty after the treatment kyle might be trainable he might even learn to speak but he would never recover completely or if he did he wouldnt be kyle did that matter and bose said the treatment would change him in another way once the biotech infiltrates your cells its there for good some people find that idea abhorrent because its derived from hypothetical technology presumably according to orrins notebook sandra said the martians eventually abolished the procedure yeah wellon that subject orrins guess is as good as anybodys we still dont know where he came up with all that stuff no bose said but i guess we dont have to right all we have to do is keep him safe bose was silent for a while sandra had come to respect these silences the cadences of his thought she opened the kitchen window wanting fresh air but the breeze that blew through was hot and faintly metallic bose said im worried about how dangerous this has become for you thank you so am i but i still want to help orrin im sorry about all this getting you involved in it short of doing what the caller suggested i think youre pretty much out of a job at this point i expect so and youre not the only one i was called into the precinct captains office yesterday he said i have a choice i can keep my distance from whatevers going on at state care or i can turn in my gun and badge i take it youre not planning to keep your distance ill worry about my career tomorrow we need to get orrin out of that building then he and his sister can lay low until all this is resolved one way or another okay great how do we do that another evaluative silence you absolutely sure you want to get deeper into this just tell me what to do bose well it depends he scrutinized her are you willing to go back there and apologize make it look like youre cooperating thats your plan part of it all right suppose i do go back what then you give me a call as soon as congreve leaves for the night ill come by when i hear from you then well see if we can pry orrin out of the locked ward chapter fourteen turks story the vanguard expedition as oscar insisted on calling it consisted of fifty people mostly soldiers but including a half dozen managerclass civilians and twice that many scientific and technical personnel plus all their gear and an aircraft big enough to accommodate us allison had told me one of these vehicles could be flown by a single pilot with a nodal link the link made it possible to gain access to the control interfacesthe real pilot was the ship itself quasiautonomous subsystems that enacted the operators intentions touch menus and visual displays popped up on any available surface exterior views were distributed throughout the cabin on virtual windows one of them on a wall opposite the bench where oscar and i were seated the view was uniformly drab until we crossed onto the mainland and approached the queen maud range there was still a trace of glaciation on the highest peaks of these mountains the ice was clean distilled by evaporation from the cesspool of the sea and in the shadowed slopes it gave back a crisp blue radiance coming down the windward slope into the interior desert we ran into heavy cloud and intermittent snow i asked oscar whether it was safe to fly under these conditions he looked at me as if id asked a childs question yes of course he was visibly anxious for a different reason generations had lived and died in the expectation that vox would one day meet and merge with the hypotheticals but it was oscars generation that was confronting the fulfillment of that prophecy by joining this expedition he had put himself at the cutting edge of the encounter that was a spectacular piece of luck from oscars point of viewwhether good or bad remained to be seen wind and squalls persisted all the way to our landing point maps from my day would have been a poor guide to antarctica as it existed now the great ice sheets had disappeared centuries ago and the ross sea and the weddel sea had joined to separate east antarctica from the huge islands off its western coast oscar said the place where we landed was in what geological surveys had once called the wilkes basin roughly seventy degrees south latitude it was a flat pebbly wasteland we suited up as soon as the aircraft touched ground we wore thick insulated outer garments to keep us warm and tightfitting masks that fed us canned air the ships airlock opened onto a landscape that was bleak but not actually ugly all of antarctica was a desert but deserts are often beautiful i thought of the equatorian outback or the deserts of utah and arizona or the old pictures of mars before it was terraformed prespin the terrain here was nearly martian in its stony lifelessness the climate was cold oscar said but not cold enough to sustain a permanent icecap and relatively dry a latesummer snowfall like this would likely melt off before the day passed the snow came down in intermittent flurries drifting into hollows and blurring the outlines of the low parallel ridges that stretched into the distance the sun was a dim incandescence behind the clouds close to the horizon we could expect another few hours of daylight but we were fully equipped to operate in darkness the soldiers loaded portable highintensity lights and a host of other gear onto selfpowered carts with big articulated wheels then they fell into formation and advanced the civilians following behind we navigated by compass the hypothetical machines were still invisibly distant we had landed well outside the perimeter that had been defined by the loss of the drone vehicles how the attempt to cross that perimeter would affect us and our gear was an open question of course we trust the hypotheticals oscar said but they have autonomic functions just like any other living thing events can happen without conscious volition especially given the hugely different scales of time and space on which they operate but none of that seemed as real or substantial as the tug of the wind the monotonous crunch of gravel under our feet or the faint stink of hydrogen sulfide that infiltrated our masks we had marched for most of an hour when one of the technical crew consulting an instrument called a halt this is the perimeter oscar whispered the point of proximity beyond which all pilotless drones had mysteriously failed three of the soldiers marched ahead while the rest of us waited nervously the snow had thinned and there were open patches of sky above us but daylight was fading fast the science crew aimed a couple of their lights into the gloom the point men halted at a fixed distance then waved us on we followed from a prudent distance announced by sweeping beams of lightwe would be hard to miss i thought if the hypotheticals happened to be looking but we were well inside the perimeter now and nothing had happened the temperature dropped with the fall of night we cinched the hoods of our survival gear tight around our face masks the wind remained brisk but the squalling snow stopped suddenly and in the clear air we could make out the shapes of the hypothetical machines ahead of us startlingly close the technicians hurried to aim their mobile lamps we had been calling these structures the hypothetical machines but from the ground they looked less like machines than huge geometric solids the nearest of them was a perfectly rectangular cube half a mile on a side and moving at a slow but barely perceptible speed now that we were close to it i believed i could feel that ponderous motion under my feet a gentle seismic tremor we approached the cube in silence the soldiers on point were dwarfed by it the technicians began to angle up their lamps playing the beams against the nearest vertical face a featureless surface the texture of sandstone because of its regularity it was hard not to think of this thing as an absurdly large building but it was a building without windows or doors as enigmatic as a sealed pyramid for a while we did nothing but stare at it oscar said it must already have detected our presence but if it did it failed to react in any obvious way then the technical crew got down to business they erected tripods and secured their lamps on them they unpacked sensors and recording devices and anchored them in the pebbly cold soil a steadily increasing number of fiercely bright beams divided the desert into a quilt of light and dark on the plain beyond the cube scattered over a couple of kilometers were a half dozen objects of similar size and different but equally simple shapeshuge cylinders octagons truncated spheres conical sections some were sandstonecolored like the cube others were black cobalt blue obsidian black cadmium yellow any one of them could have enclosed a small city and all of them were creeping at the same patient speed toward the distant mountains and the sea so immense oscar said breathlessly these objects but such an insignificant fraction of the whole body of the hypotheticals the stark light cut shadows into his mask and made him look like a timid animal peering out of a hole it would be easy to commit the impertinence of fear way too easy out here on the polar desert of the planet that had given birth to the first human beings and had become an unmarked grave for billions more while the scientific crew activated sensors and surveying devices i walked without oscars permission but he scurried after me to within a few hundred yards of the base of the cube it was old it wasnt weathered or cracked and for all i knew it might have been manufactured a day or an hour ago but it felt oldage seemed to radiate from it like cold air from an icefield inches ahead of it the thin layer of newfallen snow was disappearing from the desert floor sublimating into the night air the hypotheticals are endlessly patient mr findley theyre older than most of the stars in the sky to be so close to their work this is a sacred moment we all wore earpieces to facilitate communication i had turned down the volume on minethe few simple voxish words i had learned werent much use herebut we both heard a burst of excited chatter erupt from the technical crew two beams of highintensity light swept upward the beams diffused into what appeared to be a pale cloud at the top of the cube snow or mist i thought but noelsewhere the sky was clear the cloud appeared to be boiling off the top of the cube itselfand the other more distant objects were generating similar clouds pale mists that sifted down gently despite a wind that should have dispersed them i took an instinctive step backward then look oscar said in a hushed voice something had landed on the arm of his protective suit oscar regarded it with a kind of terrified reverence a snowflake i thought at first but on closer inspection it was more like a tiny crystalline butterflytwo pale and perfectly translucent wings beating over a body the size of a grain of rice oscar lifted his arm so we could get a better look the winged crystal had no eyes or segments or any other division in its body it was just a curl of something like quartz with legs if you could call them that as fine as eyelashes which it used to cling to the fabric of oscars suit its wings beat against the pressure of the wind it looked as harmless as a piece of costume jewelry the cloud descending the walls of the cube was composed of countless numbers of these thingsmillions maybe billions of them then out along the periphery of the lights a soldier began to scream the soldiers reacted quickly and professionally they grabbed the portable lights and began waving the civilians back the way we had come they did this despite the fact that hundreds or thousands of these tiny crystalline butterflies were swarming them obscuring their vision and covering their clothing the butterflies were settling on me and oscar too but not as aggressively when i flicked my arm they fell away and dropped to the ground inert and when i brushed them away from oscar they scattered from my hand nevertheless we ran everyone was running now the lamps the soldiers carried cast wheeling hectic beams ahead of us through my earpiece i could hear barked commands and more screams while the cloud of crystalline devices swirled around us like silent snow other members of the expedition began to fall away behind us i saw this in serial glances looking back over my shoulder anyone who dropped to the ground was instantly swarmed covered in a glassy drift becoming a pale mound that heaved at first but quickly settled i dont have a better word for it i began to understand that these men and women were dying the technicians died first the soldiers wore heavier protective clothing but even they were slowly being overwhelmed the lamps when they dropped them raked light at static angles across the plain twice i had to stop and brush oscar free of the butterflies i was too terrified to wonder why i was apparently immune to them oscar clearly wasnt his protective clothing was ragged now torn in places by their small but razorsharp legs and some of those ragged patches were speckled with blood i worried about his mask and oxygen supply and i tried to make sure i cleared the most vulnerable parts first for a while we ran arminarm which seemed to keep the swarms at bay all the panicked chatter and terrified screaming that had filled my earpiece slowly began to fade and the final silence when it came was even more terrifying than the screams i couldnt say how long or how far we ran we ran until we couldnt run any more until there was no sound but the roar of my own labored breath then i felt a sudden resistance oscars arm tugging me backward and i thought they got him hes dead weight but he wasnt when i turned to face him i found his suit was clean there were no butterflies on him his face through the moist blur of his mask was shocked but relatively calm stop he gasped were out of range were beyond the perimeter now please stop i took a long look back we had come a fair distance the abandoned lamps were still working the hypothetical machines plainly visible in a skewed crosshatching of artificial light nothing human was moving the wind blew grains of snow around our feet and the stars glittered overhead we stood shivering waiting for whatever might come out of the darkness after usanother attack a straggling survivor but there was no one nothing then in quick succession the distant lamps began to blink off we reached the aircraft guided by signalfinders built into our suits it was a long walk but we were too shaken to talk much oscar eventually managed to establish voice contact with vox core and he exchanged curt messages with managers and military personnel remote telemetry had broadcast most of what happened and vox was already attempting to analyze the data probably he said at one point our presence triggered a defensive reflex of some kind maybe so but i wasnt voxish and i didnt have to believe in the benevolence of the hypotheticalsi didnt have to make excuses for a senseless slaughter our aircraft rested on the antarctic plain like some incongruous deposition from a vanished glacier i asked oscar whether he would be able to pilot it back to vox yes really i just need to tell it to carry us home you sure youre bleeding oscar he glanced down at his ravaged clothing not badly he said once we passed the airlock he stripped off his gear his upper body had sustained a number of small cuts none of them deep or lifethreatening he told me where to find a medical kit and i smeared his wounds with something that stopped the bleeding a few of the tiny crystalline butterfliesdead or dormantwere still clinging to his discarded survival gear oscar emptied a ration box tweezed one of the dead butterflies between his thumb and forefinger and dropped it inside a sample for analysis he said then we dumped the rest of our tattered clothes out the airlock they didnt touch you oscar said once we were aloft and the aircraft was following a programmed route to vox what had been a crowded crew cabin on the flight out now seemed grimly and cavernously empty the air our bodies even the fresh clothing we put on all reeked of hydrogen sulfide no because they recognized you his voice had been reduced to a shocked querulousness i dont know what that means oscar obviously they recognized you because you were uptaken i dont understand what happened any more than you do but im not isaaci dont have any hypothetical biotech inside me mr findley he said are you still denying it even now a human body doesnt pass through a temporal arch the way it might pass through one of the spatial arches we know this from many years of study you werent preserved like a frozen vegetable in all likelihood you were recreated from stored information the reconstruction may seem flawless to human eyes and human instruments but they know you for one of their own i was too exhausted to argue oscar was clinging to one of the few expectations this encounter had actually borne out that the hypotheticals had recognized me and singled me out for salvation he believed he had survived because i was beside him helping him he imagined he had been saved in other words by a truculent and stupid demigod chapter fifteen sandra and bose sandra arrived at the state care intake facility at noon the parking lot was silvered with heat mirages and the air was thick and oppressive worse if that was possible than yesterday the guard manning the desk at the entrancehis name was teddysat basking in the breeze from a small rotary fan but he stood up hastily when he recognized sandra dr cole hi hey listen im sorry but i have instructions not to let you pass thats okay teddy give dr congreve a call and tell him im here and that id like to speak to him i guess i can do thatyes maam teddy murmured into a handset waited murmured again then he turned to sandra and smiled all right again sorry about that dr congreve says you can go to his office he wants me to tell you you should go there directly do not pass go do not collect two hundred dollars pardon me nothing thanks teddy youre welcome have a nice day dr cole congreve was wearing a triumphant look when sandra stepped into his office she reminded herself that she was here to play a role the same way she had played desdemona in her high school production of othello my noble father i do perceive here a divided duty not that she was much of an actress sorry to bother you dr congreve im surprised to see you dr cole i thought you understood you were to take the rest of the week off i do understand but i wanted to apologize for my behavior and i thought i should do it in person really thats a sudden change of heart i know it seems that way but ive had time to think it over time to do a little soulsearching you could say because i do value my career here at state and looking back i believe i acted improperly in what way well by overstepping my authority to begin with i took a proprietary interest in orrin mather and i guess i resented it when you gave the case to another physician i explained to you why i thought that was a good idea yes sir and i understand now welli appreciate you saying so it cant be easy for you whats so special about this particular patient can you tell me that steepling his hands regarding her thoughtfully assuming a grave judiciousness i dont suppose he is special he just seemed particularly i dont know fragile vulnerable all our patients are vulnerable thats why theyre here thats why were in the business of helping them i know and its why we cant afford the luxury of identifying too closely with them the best gift we can give the men and women under our care is absolute objectivity thats what i meant when i called your behavior unprofessional do you see what im driving at yes sir i do and do you understand why i suggested you take some time off usually when a physician begins to project his own anxieties onto his patients its because hes tired or distraught really im fine now dr congreve id like to believe that is there anything happening in your personal life that might be interfering with your work nothing i cant handle are you sure of that because if you want or need to talk about it im willing to listen god forbid thank you no its just she sighed honestly its the weather as much as anything my airconditionings broken and i havent had a decent nights sleep for days and yes the work is sometimes a little overwhelming all the staff are feeling it well im pleased you decided to come to me with this do you honestly feel fit enough to go back to work yes sir absolutely i wont say we cant use you how about we ease up on the caseload for the next couple of weeks maybe you can tutor dr feinim sure he could benefit from your experience id like that not on the mather case of course she nodded in fact weve run into some complications in that regard ill need a formal letter from you acknowledging that you voluntarily turned over the mather file to dr fein are you willing to do that she pretended to be surprised is that really necessary its a formality but yes if you think it would be helpful then of course ill submit a letter well then all right dr cole take the rest of the day off and come in tomorrow he smiled on time yes sir and well forget about this unpleasantness not likely thank you actually if its all right i was hoping i could spend the rest of today in my office i dont want to do consults but there are four or five case reports i need to write up congreve gave her a careful look i guess that would be all right thank you youre welcome and i have to say i appreciate your attitude as long as that doesnt change we should get along fine i hope so she said sandra went to her office feeling slightly unclean and opened up her desktop interface how long until congreve went home he was usually out of the building by six but a consultation or a board meeting could keep him later in the meantime she systematically went through her files pulling and deleting anything personal it was funny how separate she already felt from state as if her years here had faded into a single blurred image a picture on an antique postcard when that was doneand it didnt take longshe took a printed copy of orrins document out of her bag and began to read as usual the document raised more questions than it answered at half past three she stood up stretched and headed to the staff washroom she was surprised to find jack geddes sitting in a chair in the hallway opposite her door humming to himself hey jack she said are you guarding the medical staff now just keeping an eye on things his grin was lopsided and insincere dr congreves orders the grin lapsed yeah but i see dont worry ill be right back none of my business what you do dr cole but his eyes followed her to the washroom door and watched her when she returned back in her office she took out a pad of paper and a pen and wrote the word questions at the top then she paused nibbled the pen top collected her thoughts re orrin mather document did orrin write this or is it someone elses work if someone else who it occurred to her that she might be able to find out whether the document was a blatant act of plagiarism she called up a search function on her desktop and entered a couple of text strings from the document no meaningful matches which proved only that the text if it existed outside of orrins notebooks hadnt been posted to the weba positive result would have been significant a negative result proved nothing is this a work of fiction or a delusional construct she couldnt answer that without access to orrin bose had said there was something about the findley warehouse later on in the document which suggested that orrin had contributed at least a few words of his own to the story which led to the next question is there a real turk findley and if so is he connected to the findley who operates the warehouse she searched a houstonarea phone directory and found a whole raft of findleys but nothing between tomas and tyrell no t findleys either is there a real allison pearl according to orrins document allison pearl had lived in champlain new york feeling more than a little foolish sandra accessed a champlain directory and searched it it listed five pearls the majority were singletons none of them a or allison two were couples listed under the male partners name mr and mrs harvey pearl and mr and mrs franklin w pearl she opened her phone and closed it again twice before she worked up the courage to tap in one of the numbers idiotic she thought she might as well try to place a call to huck finn or harry potter harvey pearl answered on the fourth ring he was friendly but bemused nope no allison here sandra apologized hastily and hung up she could feel herself blushing one more call she told herself then she could give up and forget about it mrs franklin pearl answered this time a younger and friendliersounding voice sandra asked meekly whether she could speak to allison ummay i ask whos calling sandras pulse quickened well i dont even know if i have the right number im trying to find an old friend allison pearl and last i heard she was in champlain so mrs pearl laughed well this is champlain and you got the name right but i doubt allisons your old friend not unless you met her in grade school excuse me allisons ten years old hon she doesnt have any grownup friends oh i see im sorry she must be a popular woman though the allison youre looking for we had another call for her a while back a man who said he was with the houston police oh did he give his name yes but i dont recall it i told him the same as im telling yousorry but its not our allison good luck finding the one youre hunting for though thank you sandra said a staff conferencesandra wasnt invitedkept congreve in the building well past his usual departure time he knocked at her office on his way out a few minutes after seven still here dr cole im just finishing up did you prepare the letter i asked for itll be on your desk in the morning fine she glanced out the door as he left jack geddes was still sitting in the hallway chair tipped back humming to himself she listened until congreves footsteps had faded down the corridor the state facility had begun to take on its afterhours aspect most of the day staff had already left the openward patients were back from the commissary some of them watching tv in the common room she heard a couple of orderlies laughing together down by the main entrance she closed the door and went back to her desk then she opened her phone and tapped in boses number chapter sixteen turks story the medics kept oscar and me in a weeklong quarantine scanning us for any sign of contamination they failed to find anything unusual in our bodies or our psyches though that wasnt conclusivehypothetical devices were perfectly capable of eluding detection but we measured consistently clean and the sample we had brought back with us the crystalline butterfly in its sealed container remained dead or dormant news of what happened out in the wilkes basin quickly spread through vox collective grief for the lost soldiers and scientists was written in the faces of the medics who examined us and in oscars face too i asked him what it was like to feel an emotion amplified by the entire population of a city its painful he admitted but its better than being alone what was unbearable was what we felt after the attack that shut down the coryphaeusso many dead and no way to share that grief it was agonizing horrible beyond belief coryphaeus was the word scholars had chosen to translate a concept for which there was no english equivalent in the ancient dictionaries it was defined as a noun from classical greek the leader of a chorus a choirmaster in vox it referred to the nest of feedback loops and functional algorithms that regulated the input and output of the communitys neural nodes it was the emotional heart of the networkallison had called it the parliament of love and conscience solitary grief like guilt like love was an inescapable part of the human condition or at least it once had been we had endured it for most of our tenure as a species i guessed it wasnt a bad thing to be able to share that burden in a way that lessened the pain and maybe there was something admirable in the willingness of the people of vox to shoulder their countrymens burden of tears but the price of that anodyne was reckoned in personal autonomy it was reckoned in privacy i tried to give oscar the impression that i was sympathetic and even curious that too was part of the plan as soon as we were released from quarantine i hurried back to the quarters i shared with allison she ran to me as the door slid open and came shivering into my arms we couldnt say any of the things we wanted and needed to say we settled for a few selfconscious endearments after a while we fixed a meal in the kitchen dispensary and allison accessed clumsily with a manual interface a video stream that was the local equivalent of a newscast the final images from the vanguard expedition were playing on a loop slowed down so that events happened as if in an underwater ballet the glassy butterflies dropped out of the darkness and settled like lethal snowflakes on the soldiers and technicians the human figures froze in astonishment then jerked and danced like unstrung marionettes as they were systematically swarmed and killed the loop ran for two cycles before i asked allison to turn it off after the disaster a drone aircraft had been sent to survey the site from a safe distance but by daybreak there was no sign that anything unusual had happenedno human bodies no trace of the analytical gear or of the crystalline insects that had destroyed it nothing but the immense and indifferent hypothetical machines patiently grinding across the antarctic wasteland soon allison had whispered to me at the aircraft docks which meant i had to cultivate oscars confidence despite what had happened in the wilkes basin i arranged to meet him on a platform overlooking the nuked sector of vox corei wanted to see how the reconstruction work was going i left early for the appointment and took a roundabout route the better i had come to know vox core the less monolithic it seemed the five elements of voxish urban design oscar had explained this were terraces zones enclosures plains and tiers each of these terms having a precise technical definitionas i walked and rode that morning i passed through three terraces and an enclosure and caught a glimpse of a plain from a bridge that spanned two tiers vox core ran on a seasonless diurnal cycle sixteen hours of artificial daylight and eight hours of night but every sector had its own unique and shifting quality of light i crossed a terrace in which the light was as diffuse as rainy daylight and i walked through an enclosure illuminated by a pointsource as bright as the noonday sun come nightfall the busy slopes would glitter like separate cities while the wooded or grassy plains slipped into silent darkness the last time i had come to the ruined sector of the city it had been an ugly and impenetrable mass of debris now most of that debris had been collected and recycled or dumped into the sea lingering radiation had been chelated oscars word by some technology i didnt understand and the reconstruction was proceeding briskly the main crater had been retained as a memorial but it was already scalloped with new slopes and elegantly landscaped terraces i met oscar at a workers commissary overlooking the site the food we were given was good but the portions were small supplies were low due to the loss of farming manpower after the transit to earth we talked a while about allison i told him i was worried about her that her bouts of depression were becoming more frequent and more severe i mentioned her crying jags her intermittent crippling anxiety this isnt unexpected oscar said he gazed from our table across a low wall and into the crater below and aft of us robotic construction machines were cutting foamedgranite pillars for a new terrace the fact is she simply cant become what she wants to bewhat some part of her mind insists she is and the conflict is compromising her health and her sanity all she wants to be is allison pearl allison pearl is nothing but an illusion all inference synthesis and ancillary data treyas belief that she is allison is a symptom of the separation trauma that happened when her link to the network was broken i know youre sympathetic to her and i understand the source of that sympathy shes a connection to your past thats what she was meant to be thats why we engineered the allison pearl impersona in the first place but shes not a time traveler from the twentyfirst century mr findley i know that but but her hostility to vox seems pretty authentic he shrugged shes entitled to her grievances grafting the impersona into her neocortex was a controversial act from the beginning though of course no one expected a prolonged network failure to compound the effect but she cant solve the problem by hiding from it allison pearl simply isnt a stable configuration what treya needs more than anything is to have her limbic node restored i nodded as if i conceded the point in the crater machines shaped like segmented snakes dismantled the spars of a damaged enclosure i asked oscar whether it made sense to reconstruct the city when the hypothetical machines were headed for us presumably for the purpose of rapturing us all into heavenly communion no one knows what union with the hypotheticals might mean in practical terms undoubtedly well all be changedspiritually intellectually physically but we might still need a city to live in you dont find that frightening as an individual i might be frightened collectively were braver than that im sorry but its hard for me to imagine what thats likethe node the network the coryphaeus ive described how they function subjectively i mean what it feels like if youre talking about the implant the surgery is entirely painless oscar not the surgery what does it feel like living with wires inside your head ah well theyre not wires theyre spindles of artificial nervous tissue and opsin proteinsno holding up his hand to cut off my objection i do understand what youre asking all i can tell you is that it feels like nothing at all of course my own node was installed at birth but i can describe what it was like when the network failed if you think that would be helpful i nodded the terrace trembled with the distant construction work the air smelled faintly of granite dust losing the network was like losing a sense like a subtle blindness one of the nodes functions is to facilitate communication even in a simple conversation the limbic interface helps us perceive and interpret nuances we might otherwise miss at least when both parties are so equipped excuse me if this sounds insulting but to us a nodeless person can appear insensitive almost to the point of imbecility uhhuh is that how i seem to you he smiled ive learned to make allowances that was oscars sense of humorabout as deep as it went at some point though a kind of emotional consensus emerges right and thats what i cant quite picture maybe the word emotion is misleading its subtler than that conscious judgment is beyond the reach of the coryphaeus but consider how much of human cognition is un conscious for instance mr findley both you and i often make decisions on the basis of moral intuition we call that intuition conscience conscience doesnt arise out of deliberate systematic reasoning which is not to say its unreasonable or illogical suppose you see a man drowning in a river and you swim out to save himdo you think about it first do you calculate the risks against the benefits obviously not you act out of an instinctive identification with the drowning man you feel his distress as if it were your own and you act to relieve that distress despite your fears or if you fail to act you might feel guilt or remorse this isnt a trivial phenomenon acts of conscience have overturned governments and toppled empireseven in your time and we didnt need nodes or networks to do it no but at the same time individual conscience is notoriously unreliable an individual might talk himself out of doing the right thing or he might be genuinely uncertain about what the right thing is youre no more infallible than i am oscar but when i sum my conscience with a thousand or a million others errors become less likely and selfdeception almost impossible thats what the coryphaeus does for us he had given me a textbook argument for limbic democracy and he was utterly sincere about it but he hadnt really answered my question i dont want to know what its good for i want to know how it feels he thought for a moment take the recent food rationing historically rationing has always produced black markets hoarding even violent resistanceyes but you wont find any of that in vox not because were saints but because our collective conscience is muscular enough to prevent it the sum of our better instinctswhich is just another name for the coryphaeusknows the rationing is necessary and fair and so as individuals we feel it as necessary and fair it still sounds like coercion does it tell me did you ever break into a neighbors house and steal his property no and is that because you were coerced or because you knew it would be wrong only you can answer that question but i have to assume its because you felt it would be a shameful act that you would make yourself abhorrent in your own eyes and in the eyes of others by committing it well thats how i feel about cheating on my rations and im secure in the knowledge that my neighbors feel exactly the same way i had been abhorrent in my own eyes more often than he could have guessed but i raised a slightly different question what if the consensus is wrong conscience isnt infallible even if you count hands perhaps not infallible certainly less likely to be wrong im new here oscar and its not my place to criticize but i saw a lot of farmers killed in the rebellion you folks didnt bother taking prisoners either you left the survivors out to die is your collective conscience okay with that that decision was taken when the network had ceased to function had the coryphaeus been active we might have behaved differently what about keeping farmers as bonded serfs youve been doing that for centuries according to the history books i wont debate the historical reasons for doing what was done ill grant you its an uneasy compromise and youre right of course were not morally infallible we dont claim to be but compare our history with that of any other nation or culture death for death injustice for injusticecompare im not sure thats a claim you want to make given that were sitting next to a bomb crater that was the result of a cortical republic enacting its own radical bionormative ideology reason breeds more monsters than conscience mr findley maybe so i let a few moments pass about allison i said that is treya if she replaced her node would the suffering stop it might take time for her to adjust oscar said giving me an evaluative stare but the conflicts that are troubling her would quickly be resolved white plumes of dust lofted up from the crater drawn toward filters in the artificial sky there was the sound of distant hammering it occurred to me that i was constructing a deception as systematically as those machines were constructing new tiers and terraces and i had come to the central pillar of that deception i want to help her i said oscar nodded encouragingly i said this isnt easy for me but ive come to a couple of conclusions since what happened out in the wasteland yes i didnt choose to come to vox and to be honest knowing what i know now i might have preferred to travel up the ring maybe see what those middle worlds are like i understand oscar said cautiously but i cant do that i cant undo whats been done and i cant change the future this is where im going to live and die his eyes narrowed and if im going to live here i want to live with allison but i dont want to watch her suffer theres only one way to relieve her suffering she has to accept the implant yes can you convince her to do that i dont know but im willing to try his expression was cautious opaque calculating the look of a gambler contemplating a bet he said we gave her the allison impersona so she could bond with you youre the reason shes clinging to it you could be the reason she abandons it down in the crater a chorus line of machines began welding iron beams sparks showering from their fingers like falling stars maybe if i went first i said i mean if i volunteered for the surgery oscars eyes widened then slowly he began to smile chapter seventeen sandra and bose bose phoned as he was pulling into the state care parking lot sandra tucked everything she wanted to keep from her officea few gigs of files a photo of kyle from before he was hurtinto her bag then went to reception to meet him jack geddes was still keeping vigil in the hallway he stood up from his chair and said you leaving now dr cole good night jack she said which was not an answer but he watched her head for the main lobby and waved as she turned the corner no doubt happy to be released from surveillance duty boses uniform and badge got him past the guard who was posted at reception the next hurdle was the night nurse in charge of the locked ward sandra led the way she knew the night nurse by reputation only her name was meredith somethingsandra couldnt remember and the womans nametag just said meredith she appeared to be in her midfifties with a dontmesswithme expression that sat so naturally on her face sandra suspected it might be congenital meredith stepped out from behind her desk when she saw bose and sandra approaching effectively blocking the door to the ward before she could say anything bose handed her a standard releasetonextofkin form which he must have filled out himself meredith gave the document a frowning study just unlock the door please maam bose said its late and id like to get this prisoner back to his family prisoner he may be but hes not your prisoner not right now anyhow and yes its latewhat brings you around this hour of the night sandra took the initiative i dont believe weve met im dr cole youre right its an unusual time to transfer up a patient but just bear with us please ill sign the patient out meredith appeared to hesitate according to staff gossip the night nurses ran their wards like private fiefdoms clearly meredith didnt appreciate this intrusion into her kingdom okay dr cole but this orrin mathers on a special protocol and i dont see anything on his chart about you being his physician of record what i do see is a notation from dr congreve that you were pulled off the case a couple days ago do you see anything on that chart about preventing a staff physician or a police officer from entering this ward because im starting to get impatient meredith meredith glared but reached for the switch that would unlock the ward door then she drew her hand back a patient transfer needs authorization from the attending physician im just asking you to open the door meredith dr congreve might not like it if you keep us waiting any longer i wont like it and i may not be dr congreve but i can sure as hell let him know you thought it was a good idea to stand here and give us attitude meredith made a lemonsucking face but threw the switch im gonna have to talk to dr congreve about this your choice sandra said the door ratcheted open sandra followed bose along the corridor toward orrins room the lights had been dimmed making the greentiled hallway seem long and subterranean nice work bose said glancing back but shes already on the phone the next problem was obvious as soon as sandra used her pass card to open the door to orrins room orrin lay on the bed as if hed been dropped on it sandra shook him gently orrin she said hey orrin his eyes drifted open but the lids stayed at halfmast what he said softly what now what now he was heavily medicated orrin its me its dr cole he gave her a groggy look fucking night staff sandra thought were they doubledosing everybody on the ward to keep them quiet or just orrin its dark outside dr cole i know it is but you have to get up get up and come with us okay officer bose orrin said still lying there inertly his hospital gown rucked up over his skinny butt hi hi there orrin listen to me dr coles right we have to get you out of here take you to see your sister ariel is that okay with you it took a few seconds for the question to register then orrin offered a loopy grin thats just exactly what i want officer bose thank you im pretty tired though i know bose bent down and put his arm around orrins shoulders and helped him to his feet orrin wobbled but managed to remain standing easier with a wheelchair sandra said she ducked out of the roomthe corridor was still empty nurse meredith still at her station but talking vigorously into her phoneand grabbed one of the folding wheelchairs from the supply cubby state care of texas houston area unit was stenciled across the leather backpiece the chair rattled as she wheeled it into orrins room startlingly loud in the stillness of the ward bose helped orrin into the chair as soon as he was seated orrins chin nodded toward his chest and his eyelids slid shut again maybe it was better that way sandra thought she took the handles of the chair while bose led the way to the exit but meredith was blocking the ward door again and now she had companyjack geddes hold on right there meredith said i got dr congreve on the phone and he says you have no right to remove this patient so you just wheel mr mather back to his room and you can take up the matter with management in the morning bose ignored meredith and directed his remarks to geddes who had bulled up to him with his chest thrust forward this is a police matter im removing mr mather on my authority you dont have any authority meredith said you can get out of my way bose told geddes or i can arrest you for interference but make up your mind sir i wouldnt be here at this hour if this wasnt urgent business sandra imagined congreve taking the call in his car turning around heading back to state how long ago had he left half an hour fortyfive minutes had he gone straight home or stopped on the way she tried not to betray her anxiety by looking at her watch geddes had locked eyes with bose a classic staredown sandra thought but then the orderly sighed and turned to nurse meredith this man showed you his badge his papers yes but then i cant do nothing about it maam geddes stepped aside bose preternaturally calm asked meredith do you need my signature if you insist on taking him you better had sign nurse meredith thrust a clipboard at him at the bottom you too dr cole be hell to pay when dr congreve gets here its on you thats all i can say bose signed sandra added her own slightly shaky signature then she wheeled orrin down the hallway at a brisk clip following boses long stride orrin had gone back to sleep miraculously she could hear his soft rasping snores over the rattle of the wheels as soon as they were past the main door into the parking lot sandras face began to prickle with sweat a reef of clouds had hidden all the stars the paperwork you gave them sandra said was that legitimate hardly its a standard form i just scribbled in a few of the boxes thats not entirely legal is it he smiled another bridge burned theyre going down fast she took a last look back at state she would never be allowed inside this building again she was unemployed she was free and she was so frightened she felt like laughing out loud they headed toward the motel where ariel mather was staying orrin slept in the backseat his body lax against the seat belt his hospital gown spindled around his thighs well need to get him some fresh clothes sandra said i believe ariel brought him some clothes from raleigh just in case a car passed by speeding in the opposite directionsandra thought it might be congreves car though she couldnt be sure she spent a few moments relishing the thought of congreve getting the news from jack geddes or nurse meredith i brought his notebooks too bose said orrinll be glad to have them back i read what you sent me but theres more right a little more you still want my opinion of it he gave her a curious look anything you have to say im interested at one point you thought the document constituted some kind of evidence yeah you may not have read the relevant parts yet but thats not the real question is it the real question is how much of it is true he laughed but she saw his grip tighten on the steering wheel come on sandra true you know what i mean you really think orrins channeling spirits from the year twelve thousand i willing to bet youve given it some thought there are corroborative details in there stuff you could have tracked down stuff even i could track down allison pearl for instance born and grew up in champlain new york a truly incurious man might not wonder whether such a person really exists but youre not an incurious man ill take that as a compliment as it happens theres no allison pearl in the champlain directory he wasnt smiling anymore you checked only a handful of pearls altogether no allison but theres a couple with a daughter by that name you called them yes did they tell you i called them too yes but thank you for mentioning it because orrin or whoever wrote that document might not have picked those names out of the airturk findley allison pearl i asked mrs pearl whether she knows orrin or ariel mather or anyone fitting their description a question that hadnt occurred to sandra does she no she never heard of them but that doesnt rule out a connection orrin could have come across the name allison pearl somewhere maybe from a neighbor who happens to be a distant relativei dont know or it could just be a coincidence does that seem likely compared to what the idea that orrin can travel in time as far as i can tell the only trip he ever took was raleigh to houston on a greyhound bus so well never know he shrugged chapter eighteen allisons story often in the weeks after the first encounter between vox and the hypothetical machines i caught myself quietly repeating my own name allison pearl allison pearl anchoring myself to the syllables the sound of them the feeling of them in my throat and on my tongue as allison i had once read a book about the human brain from that book i had learned the term neural plasticity which means the ability of the brain to modify itself in response to changes in its environment neural plasticity was what made it possible for me to be allison pearl it was also what made it possible for a living brain to be wired to a limbic implant the brain adapts thats what brains do when turk told me he had volunteered for surgery i pretended to be surprised the implant had been an essential part of our plan from the beginning but for the benefit of the networks hidden sensors i was obliged to feel betrayed i was obliged to argue with him so i argued so i wept it was a convincing performance it was convincing because it was ninetenths sincere i didnt doubt his courage but no plan is foolproof i was terrified of what he might become shit happens as the original allison once wrote in her diary no truer words etc for instance the day turk had his node installedprobably about the time he was being wheeled into surgeryisaac dvali came to see me and he laid my secrets bare i knew from the newsfeeds that isaacs recovery had proceeded at an astonishing rate everyone in vox core was paying breathless attention to him now far more than turk isaac had become what the citys founders had hoped and believed one of the uptaken ought to be a living connection to the hypotheticalswhich meant the citys promised transcendence remained at least plausible without isaac vox was nothing but a congregation of fanatics whose faith had stranded them on a dead and deadly planet with isaac it was still possible to believe vox was a community of likeminded pioneers poised at the vanguard of human destiny only days after the disaster in the wilkes basin isaac had mastered the ability to speak fluent voxish his motor skills improved to the point where he could walk unassisted his body went from frail to remarkably robust and the reconstructed portions of his skull began to look almost normal the croaking screaming creature turk had known was gone the newly and unsettlingly articulate isaac had been released from medical care though he still lived and slept in the rooms where he had been treated lately he had conducted vague but ingratiating interviews with scholars and managers the contents of which were publicly broadcast he praised vox for its dedication and endurance he expressed his admiration for the wisdom of the founding prophecies for days now he had been traveling around the city like a tourist sometimes mobbed by curious children whose equally curious parents hung back shyly and didnt dare speak i had followed all this on the newsfeeds vox was listing toward insanity and the abject worship of isaac dvali was just the latest symptom i told myself to expect more of the same expect the unexpected allison had written in her diary not an original sentiment but always apt and i believed i was well braced for surprises but i was shocked beyond words when isaac showed up at my door pale as a mushroom and brighteyed as an infant smiling and calling me by name not treya but amazingly allison i was afraid of him of course i didnt know what he wanted and i was instantly terrified of the attention he would attractmust already have attractedjust by being here somewhere in the nearby corridors and walks his minders were surely hovering the hidden ears and eyes of the network were pricked and focused but all he said was may i come in and i nodded mutely and let the door slide shut behind him somehow i found the courage to ask him to sit down he remained standing i wont stay long he spoke in english it was the language he had been born to i reminded myself under all the layers of synthesis and reconstruction there was still at least some fragment of the isaac dvali he once had been a boy raised in the equatorian desert by people whose urge to make contact with the hypotheticals had been almost voxish in its intensity he was like me like turk a divided and incomplete soul he was also at least potentially a very dangerous one apart from his pale skin his eyes were his most striking feature when he looked at me my first instinct was to wince he told me not to be frightened and i said thats not so easy you came to my suite when i was sick he said you remember that he nodded smiling ive learned a lot about you since then about me from the network i know who and what you are and i think it would be useful if we can talk to each other i wont hurt you and i wont tell anyone about your plan to escape for months i had been training myself in the art of inscrutability as a way of keeping that one simple secret now the charade had collapsed and i was too shocked to move no one can hear us isaac said youre wrong i managed to say his smile was insistent maddening the network sensors in this room are disabled theyll stay that way as long as im here you can do that because of what i am because of what the surgeons put inside me i can influence the network and even the coryphaeus was that possible the coryphaeus was the sum and master of the voxish collectivity a nested hierarchy of quantum processors distributed throughout vox core even a nuclear attack had only temporarily silenced it it had never occurred to me that the coryphaeus could be influenced but there had never been anyone like isaac before either he had been deeply infused with hypothetical biotechnology since birth and his neural implant hadnt simply been added to his brain his brain had been regrown around it its true he said at least for now you can speak as freely as you like my heart was pounding but since isaac apparently knew about our planand since he had announced it out loudi could only hope he was telling the truth you can really shut down the sensors yes or make sure anything they observe is left unanalyzed but if you already know about your escape he said i flinched again you were extremely clever about hiding it pulse respiration cortisol traces in your sweat and urine all those markers have been at elevated levels for weeks but the effect was indistinguishable from emotional stress stochastic and heuretic indicatorsthe things you did or didnt say or dotook the coryphaeus much longer to analyze but you would have been found out eventually that buddha smile again if i hadnt intervened i took a breath and said then how did you know the coryphaeus was already beginning to draw inferences i extrapolated from that the details arent clear to me but i guess you intend to steal an aircraft and take it through the arch to equatoria close enough i whispered and i hope you succeed does that meanwhat are you saying do you want to come with us his smile faded thats not possible when i was reconstructed important neurological functions were delegated to remote processors inside the network only part of me lives in this body you understand that dont you that a person can have more than one nature yes i cant come with you but i may be able to help help how turk cant pilot an aircraft until his node is functional enough for him to gain access to the vehicles controls but once the node is fully functional he wont be willing to leave i assume you understand how narrow that window of opportunity is obviously but right now turk sees himself as facing a choice between escape and bondage once the node begins to influence his brain it may seem more like a choice between escape and forgiveness forgiveness for what i wondered but didnt ask the point is i can warn you when hes close to that line and i can help by diverting the attention of the coryphaeus at the critical time we can talk about it in more detail later on but i want you to know you have a friend and an ally i hope youll think of me that way he sounded so much like a precocious child who wanted to be liked that i almost forgot to be afraid of him but when he stood up and moved toward the door i nearly panicked wait the network surveillance in this room is it turned off permanently no im sorry there are limits to what i can do unless im physically present you should assume the network is listening i forced myself to stand close to him the skin on the right side of his face was seashellpink and almost poreless imperfect because it was too perfect his eyes were softly radiant one more question what is it are youyou know what they say you are im not sure what you mean what the prophecies say you are can you really talk to the hypotheticals no he said not yet less than an hour later oscar showed up at the door obviously distraught he knew isaac had been here and he was maddeningly curious about what isaac might have said but he couldnt access a network record of it he demanded an explanation i had known oscar reasonably well back when i was treya training for liaison duties oscar had always had a serene confidence in the purity and purpose of his work there was a voxish saying he rises and falls with the tide describing someone who tracks the needs of vox core and caters to them uncomplainingly that was oscar but lately his serenity had begun to fray at the edges the fact that isaac had chosen to meet privately with a nodeless apostateand to enforce that privacy even against the networks routine surveillancehad sabotaged his finely honed sense of order i told him isaac had wanted to reminisce about the twentyfirst century anything you might know about the past he can easily access for himself maybe he was curious about me i dont know maybe he felt like speaking english for a little while what could you possibly have to say that would interest a being like him even in english that was insulting so i used an expression oscar might not have encountered in his formal training fuck you i said and closed the door no word came from turkhe had warned me they might keep him overnight after the surgeryand i decided i couldnt sit alone any longer partly because i was afraid my elevated heartbeat or hormonal chemistry might give the network another clue to my state of mind especially if isaac wasnt paying attention and blocking the sensors i needed distraction so i left the suite and rode transit to the nearest large public space a terrace overlooking a market zone to watch the parade of lights that marked the festival of ido vox core was a city of rituals and festivals as treya i had always loved them the part of me that was allison was surprised that a polity as tightlaced as vox should be so fond of celebrations but vox was a limbic democracy sharing public emotion was what we did best vox had been founded on a planet called ester five worlds away from old earth we still kept the esterish year of days and the esterish division of a day into twentyfour hours a custom as ancient as earth itself though esters days and hours were slightly longer vox had journeyed through all five of those worlds sailing the isotropic sea that linked every ring world with the exception of mars we marked many of our days with celebrations celebrations of the founding of the prophecies of the anniversaries of historical battles and so on the festival of ido commemorated our victory over bionormative forces at the arch of terivinethe battle in which we had taken the prisoners who eventually formed the nucleus of the farmer caste it was a martial holiday with fireworks and drums and torch parades most years the celebration was joyous bountiful this year the feasts were rationed and there was a note of hysteria in the festivities everyone knew it might be the last ido before the remaking of the world obviously i couldnt participate even if i had wanted to everyone in vox core knew me from the newsfeeds i was a traitor to my own past a dissonant note in the story of the uptaken and because i was nodeless my behavior would seem opaque and untrustworthy i wasnt in any danger from the crowdsat least not yetbut i would be ostracized and ignored if i tried to join them so i found a place where i could be alone a wooded patch overlooking the market zone a half mile or so downslope as ambient light dimmed toward night the market square filled with celebrants they carried luminous rods of various sizes and colors and they gathered behind a leader who conducted them through the maze of market stalls in a sinuous moving line the effect was spectacular in the dark and from a distance a glowing multicolored snake twining around and through itself swaying to the beat of the drums i felt sad i felt perversely nostalgic i wasnt treya anymore and i didnt want to be treya but i missed the pleasure treya had once taken in events like this that is my pleasure she me mine hers deceptively simple words not as easy to parse as they had once seemed even nodeless i could tell when a fresh rush of excitement swept through the crowd i had to look across a gap of treetops to one of the festivals huge video displays to see what had happened the display showed a group of snakedancers unfurling a banner on the banner was a portrait of isaac dvali literally glowing in the dark cheering and applause echoed up the terrace like the sound of a hard rain falling but it wasnt really isaac they were cheering for they were cheering for what isaac represented the fulfillment of prophecy the imminent end of days it was the voice of the doomed coryphaeus worshipping itself through the body of vox how do you measure a universal madness i took as signs the contagious irrationalities the bland indifference to real problems shortages of grain and animal protein for instance the public obsession with the hypotheticals that followed the massacre in the antarctic desert images of the hypothetical machines were everywhere now and a belief had begun to emerge that the soldiers and scientists killed in the vanguard expedition werent really dead but had been uptaken presumably when the machines eventually arrived at vox the rest of us would be similarly raptured into communion with the hypotheticals or killed the terms were commutable prophecy had always been a little vague on that point voxs founders had believed the end of vox would take the form of what they called ajientei for which the nearest english equivalent might be enlargementthe diffusion of human consciousness over galactic space and geologic time the scale on which the hypotheticals were presumed to operate in any case our scholars had estimated that at their current rate of progress the hypothetical machines wouldnt reach vox for months or even years in fact certain pious elderly citizens were petitioning to be flown to the machines so they could be uptaken before they died they neednt have worried only hours after the festival of ido our unmanned aircraft delivered unsettling news from the wilkes basin the hypothetical machines had begun to move more quickly than before in fact they were acceleratingdoubling their speed every few hours that didnt amount to much at the moment but if the acceleration continued they would arrive sooner than expected much sooner the scholars said a matter of weeks possibly days vox rang like a bell with the news chapter nineteen sandra and bose were not safe yet bose said when they pulled into a parking space outside ariel mathers motel room sandra had no trouble believing him she had seen how vigilantly he watched his mirrors as he drove away from state the plan he said was to check ariel mather out of her room and put her and orrin in a different motel for the night in the morning boses friends would drive them to a safe place out of town sandra stayed in the car with orrin while bose knocked at the door of ariels room moments later he was back followed by ariel with her single scuffed plastic suitcase ariel wore denim jeans frayed at the cuffs and a black tshirt with university of north carolina printed on it sandra doubted ariel had been any closer to the university of north carolina than the thrift shop where she bought her clothes there are people out there who might still think of orrin as a threat bose explained to her as she crouched into the backseat so were taking you to another motel just overnight tomorrow you can get out of houston and away from all this that all right with you ms mather yeah ariel said abstractedly i dont have any better idea whats the matter with orrin orrin you all right wake up he was sedated sandra said hell be fine in a few hours in the meantime it might be better just to let him sleep it off if thats what he wants to do they drugged him just a sleeping pill huh honestly i dont know how you can stand to work in a place that drugs up innocent people for no reason i guess i cant stand it sandra said i dont work there anymore bose drove side streets until he was sure they werent being followed then stopped at an anonymous twostory motel near the airport by this time orrin was functional enough to climb out of the car and stagger to his room on the arm of his sister sandra waited in the motels small lobby while bose carried ariels suitcase getting late now and shed had almost no sleep herself but she was alert and slightly buzzed still processing the adrenaline she had generated back at state care ariels rough tenderness toward orrin made her think of her own brother passing the night in an institution far kinder than state and vastly more expensive she thought about the man on the phone who had tried to bribe her by offering the longevity drug to which boses anonymous friends also had accessthe original martian drug not the hacked commercial version would such people also be willing to help kyle if so what would they ask in return it isnt some kind of elaborate secret society bose had saidwas it really only yesterday the original group consisted of people jason lawton happened to know jason lawton the scientist to whom wun ngo wen had entrusted his inventory of pharmaceuticals not people who took the treatment necessarily though some did but people who were willing to make themselves custodians of it to distribute it ethically and until the laws are changed secretly the circle expanded over the years its not foolproof and its not airtight but we try to take care of each other we she had noticed bose came back to the lobby alone he said its not a good idea for you to be home by yourself i figured id take a room here for the night he smiled ill make it a double if you want to save money so thats what an economic proposition no he said not quite the airconditioning was anemic but some things were worth sweating for after they made love lying in the dim and intermittent light cast by passing headlights on the blinds of their room sandra ran her finger along the line of boses scar belly to shoulder when he realized what she was doing he flinched but thenmaybe by sheer force of willrelaxed she said what happened if you dont mind me asking he was silent long enough that she guessed he did mind then he sat up bracing himself against the backboard of the bed i was seventeen he said i was in madras visiting my father this was after my parents split up my father was an engineering consultant for a company that installed shallowwater wind generators the company rented him a bungalow with a sea view but it was in a dicey neighborhood the security was bad thieves broke in one night they killed my father me i was stupid enough to try to defend him he covered her hand with his they were carrying knives if the scar was a knife wound they must nearly have gutted him thats terrible im so sorry a neighbor heard the scuffle and called the police i lost a lot of bloodit was kind of touch and go for a while my mom flew over and took charge pulled some strings made sure i got the right kind of medical care sandra wondered if that was why he ended up at hpd outrage at the crime a sense of the police as belated saviors southern india after the spin i heard it was pretty bad over there for a few years not much worse than houston bose said but he was uncomfortable talking about it and she dropped the subject and let herself drift toward sleep it was strange to wake up next to him in an unfamiliar bed the morning already gone dieselscented air seeping in through the poorly sealed motel windows she sat up and yawned bose was still asleep lying on his back and breathing in a rhythm as regular as waves breaking on a beach the salty delicate odor of their lovemaking still clung to the sheets she would have liked to lie here indefinitelyand she guessed she could she was functionally if not officially unemployed she had nowhere to gobut some calvinist impulse caused her to pick up her watch from the bedside table noon a little past the day half wasted shocking she left the bed without disturbing bose and used the shower her only clothes were the jeans and shirt shed worn yesterday and they werent especially fresh but they would have to do when she came out of the bathroom he was awake and grinning at her breakfast he said its a little late for breakfast lunch then i called ariels room orrins still groggy but hes feeling better theyre going to the motel coffee shop maybe you and i can sneak away for something a little nicer then come back here were booked for another night but i can arrange a ride for orrin and ariel before dark yes sandra thought and then once the mather sibs were safely out of town what then the heat wave still hadnt broken but the news was predicting storms tonight sandra hoped that was true the sky was dusty and hot and on the southern horizon the clouds were beginning to build their afternoon cathedrals into higher cooler air boses idea of somewhere a little nicer to eat lunch turned out to be a chain restaurant off the highway sandra ordered a sandwich and ignored the cowboymotif decor and the aggressively cheerful waitstaff by the time they were served the noon crowd had come and gone and the warehousesized dining room was comfortably quiet bose polished off a huge plate of steak and eggs in what sandra imagined was a kind of postcoital protein binge over coffee she said i guess well never know about orrins notebooks i mean where all that stuff came from and what it means to him there are a lot of things well never know hell go into hiding and well do whatever it is we do next did you check your phone today turn in your badge and go home voice and text they probably would have sent a candygram if they knew how to reach me you have any plans long or shortterm long i guess ive been thinking about seattle its chilly and it rains a lot just pick up and go just like that i dont know any other way he put down his coffee cup come with me she stared at him christ bose you just open up your mouth and say these things obviously i dont know much about your line of work but my friends are your friends come to seattle and maybe we can help you find something thats justi cant you have any reason to stay in houston of course i do but really did she no real friends no prospect of employment theres kyle for one your brother okay but is it possible he could be transferred to a facility in washington state that would involve a lot of paperwork oh paperwork i mean i guess it could be done but he waved a hand apologetically im sorryit was a selfish question it just seems like were in the same boat here no fault of your own you were doing all right before i walked into your life no but he didnt know that well i appreciate the thought she added almost in spite of herself ill think about it because now she could think about it she was unemployed and falling freely she could risk everything without risking much at all why is this so easy for you im jealous maybe ive been thinking about it longer than you have but no it wasnt that it was something more profoundly a part of boses nature a degree of inner calm that was almost eerie she said youre not like other people whats that mean you know what it means you just dont want to talk about it well he said fishing his wallet out of his pocket we can talk about it after we get orrin out of town sandra needed a change of clothes so she persuaded bose to swing by her apartment long enough for her to run inside and throw a few things into a suitcase she packed items from her wardrobe of course but she also took her passport her gig drives her personal papers she didnt know when she would be back maybe soon maybe never she took a last look around before she left the apartment seemed already untenanted as if it had sensed her intentions and dismissed her downstairs she found bose waiting patiently playing some kind of tinny shitkicker music on the cars audio system she tossed her bag into the backseat and climbed in beside him i didnt know you liked country music its not country music it sounds like an alley cat fucking a fiddle show some respect this is classic western swing bob wills and the texas playboys recorded with a tin can and a string by the sound of it this is whats keeping you in texas no but its just about the only thing that makes me sorry to leave he was tapping the steering wheel in merry rhythm when his phone buzzed a handsfree app displayed the callers number in the lowerleft corner of the cars windshield answer bose said which prompted the car to cut the music and open the phone connection bose here its me a shrill voice said its ariel matheris that you officer bose yeah ariel whats wrong its orrin is he all right i dont know if hes all righti dont where he is he went out to the coke machine and now hes gone okay bose said wait for us right where you are were on our way sandra saw the change that came over him the way his lips went taut and his eyes narrowed youre not like other people she had said and it still seemed true as if bose had a deep reservoir of calm inside himbut it wasnt calm now sandra thought now it was filled with a fierce resolve chapter twenty turks story what i saw after the surgery as i was coming up from anesthesia not quite awake and not entirely asleep was a vision of a man on firea burning man dancing in a pool of flame staring at me through ripples of superheated air the vision had all the qualities of a nightmare but it wasnt a dream it was a memory the medical team had shown me the limbic implant before they installed it i believe they interpreted my horror as preoperative anxiety the node was a flexible black disk a few centimeters wide and less than a centimeter thick it was covered with nubs the size of pinheads from which fibers of artificial nervous tissue would grow once the node established a suitable blood supply from the surrounding capillaries almost as soon as it was installed the implant would power up its link to the network within days its artificial nerves would have bonded to the spinal medulla and begun to infiltrate the targeted areas of my brain the medics asked me if i understood all this i told them i did then the prick of an anesthetic injection a cold swab at the back of my neck oblivion while the surgeon wielded his knife the burning man had been a night watchman at my fathers warehouse in houston he was a stranger to me the killing was unpremeditated and in a court of law the charge might have been reduced from murder to manslaughter but i never went before a court twice in my life i had told some version of that story to another persononce when i was drunk once when i was sober once to a stranger once to a woman with whom i had fallen in love in both cases the story i told was incomplete and partially fabricated even my best attempts at confession inevitably foundered on lies the people i had confessed to were all ten thousand years gone but the dead man was locked in my conscience where he had never stopped burning and now i had given the keys to my conscience to the coryphaeus and i didnt know what that might mean the first change i noticed after the surgery wasnt in myself but in other people especially their faces i felt some of the side effects i had been warned abouttransient dizziness loss of appetitebut the symptoms werent severe and they passed quickly what scared me wasnt what i felt but what i might not be feeling what i might have lost without knowing i had lost it i questioned every unguarded impulse and i kept to myself for days hardly speaking even to allison who in any case had begun treating me with a kind of mournful disdain which i hoped was only theatrical both of us knew what had to be done both of us knew i wasnt yet ready to attempt it the medics had prescribed exercises in what they called interactive volitional skills meaning the ability to manipulate nodeenabled control surfacesthings as simple as turning on a graphic display by a combination of touch and will these were the same skills i would need to pilot us away from vox so i pushed myself up a fairly steep learning curve oscar stopped in from time to time to monitor my progress and on one of these visits he brought me a selection of tutelary devices intended for voxish children network toys that changed color or made music when i told them to except mostly they didnt the node was still infiltrating key parts of my brain still learning to enhance or suppress activity at selected sites not all the necessary feedback loops had formed or stabilized oscar counseled patience it wasnt until i stopped focusing on control surfaces and ventured out into the public spaces of vox core that i saw the difference the node had made i had walked these corridors and passed through these tiers and terraces dozens of times but suddenly it was as if i had never really seen them the faces of the people i passed were almost luminous in their expressiveness and complexity i found i could read the moods of strangers as accurately as if i had known them all my life the doctors had told me this would happen but since their explanations had been couched in phrases like amygdalic linkage and mirror neuron profusion and chiasmic inductionoscars translationsi had never really grasped the significance of it now the effect was almost overwhelming i decided to travel up to one of the citys high places away from the crowds taking vertical transit in vox was like riding an elevator the size of a subway car it put me eyetoeye with other passengers i sat opposite a woman holding a young child in her lap she noticed me and smiled it was the smile you might give any amiable stranger except that in some sense we werent strangerswe were bound by the network and wordless intimacies scrolled between us her restless eyes and the alternating ease and tension of her body told me she was anxious about the futureit had recently been announced that the hypothetical machines were accelerating toward usbut she was humbly willing to submit to whatever fate the prophets had mandated for her it was when she looked at her infant son that her uneasiness grew more focused and concentrated the boy was five or six months old and his own limbic implant was still a prominent pink bump at the base of his skull he radiated simple needs and absolute dependency and she was reluctant to entrust him to the care of the hypotheticals no matter how benevolent she believed them to be whenever she held her son in her arms she was tempted by the sin of fear i felt the soothing euphoria of the coryphaeus running through both of them counterpoint to the text of their bodies and gestures that was unnerving and of course they sensed my reaction as keenly as i sensed theirs the mother frowned and averted her eyes as if she had seen something distasteful the child squirmed and arched against her body i hurried away at the next stop the next time i felt restless i went out at night when the corridors were dimly lit and mostly empty i had been working with network interfaces all day and although i was tired i knew i wouldnt be able to sleep news had come from our fleet of drone aircraft that the hypothetical machines were crossing the transarctic mountains faster than expected out in the wilkes basin the machines had looked like cumbersomely solid objects but when they encountered rough ground they deformed in order to negotiate large obstacles in extreme terrain they actually seemed to flow like a viscous liquid moving edgelessly up narrow passes and steep chaotic inclines estimates of the time it would take the machines to reach vox were revised downward yet again the few people i encountered that night were bristling with conflicting emotionstheir faces glowed like torches to my eyesand i hurried past them i had begun to understand what allison meant about collective insanity it wasnt just euphoria the coryphaeus was sharing fear smoldered in the voxish collective like a fire in a coal seam too strong to be entirely suppressed i passed a maintenance worker whose anxiety literally radiated from his face a spiky halo of awe and dread i felt it myself a pressure as faint and persistent as the beating of my heart the longing for a better and larger existence set against the suspicion that what was approaching from the antarctic desert might be nothing but a quick and nasty death allison was awake when i got back and she wasnt alone isaac dvali was with her i knew about isaacs miraculous recovery and the endorsement of the voxish prophecies that had made him a public hero his image was everywhere in vox core but he was here without his minders he was smiling at allison and she was smiling at me we can talk she said which made no sense i stared at isaac to my eyes he looked gilded like a painting of a medieval saint more subtly i could see hints of the trauma that had shaped him sparks in an aurahe was a mosaic of colored glass coruscating with unexpected energies i asked him what he wanted let me explain he said chapter twentyone sandra and bose ariel mather paced the floor of her motel room shaking with anxiety at first she had insisted on going out to look for orrin right now but bose had convinced her to stay in the room at least long enough to explain what had happened sandra sat on the unmade bed listening carefully and not saying much letting the crisis unspool around her you went to lunch bose prompted yeah over to the coffee shop we had hamburgers does that information help you in some way how was orrin feeling this morning pretty good i spose considering he was drugged last night okay he was in a good mood what did you talk about mostly about what happened since he left raleigh how he came to houston and got hired by that man findley i asked him why he wanted to leave home in the first placewas it something i did wrong was he unhappy there he said no and he was sorry i worried so much about him he said he just felt like there was business in houston he had to take care of what business i asked him that but he was cagy and i didnt push because i figured it was all over with now we were going homeso i thought what else did you talk about the weather this damn heat it gets hot in raleigh but texas i dont know why anybody lives here honestly nothing much else than that while we ate orrin kept his notebooks in his lap you know those ratty notebooks of his the ones you gave him back yesterday did he say anything about them he showed me a couple of pages this morning but he was real shy about it there are words in there i didnt think he knew words i dont know i asked him did he write this sort of he says i asked him how you can sort of write somethingwas he holding the pen that made these words or was he not he was he says somebody with him at the time no he says then you wrote them i said whatever they mean he said it was just a story but i dont know about that the way he clings to those pages why does that have something to do with him running off i dont know bose said what happened after lunch he asked me for some walkingaround money walking around thats what we called it back in raleigh he worked odd jobs to help with the rent but he didnt usually have any money of his own so i used to give him a little cash on saturdays so he could walk down to the store and buy something or maybe go to the municipal pool or get himself lunch at mcdonalds he didnt like to be away from home without money in his pocket ariel stopped pacing and shook her head i gave him forty dollars to keep him happy i didnt think hed take it and run whats forty dollars in a city like this after lunch we went back to the room to wait for you two then he says ariel im going to the lobby and get change for the coke machine i said i would give him coins he said no i already gave him money he wanted to change a bill twenty minutes and hes not back so i went to look for him he wasnt down at the soda machine and when i went to the lobby he wasnt there either the clerk told me he saw orrin waiting for a city bus at the highway stop going which direction bose asked youll have to ask the clerk was orrin alone or was he with somebody clerk didnt say anything about anybody else sandra waited until bose had wrung out of ariel all the information she was capable of giving then she said i have a couple of questions if its all right bose seemed surprised ariel sighed impatiently but nodded last time we talked you said orrin was gentle that he would never hurt anyone do you remember that ariels lips went taut of course i remember but when he tried to leave state he fought with the orderly who tried to restrain him thats a lie it may be but the orderly was wearing a bandage the next day he claims orrin bit him i wouldnt take anything those people say seriously i thought you mentioned you quit that job i did i dont work there anymore i just want to get clear on this ariel paced a few moments more then she said nobodys perfect dr cole i told you orrins gentle and thats the truth maybe i exaggerated last time we talked but you were working for the people who locked him upi didnt want to say anything to make it worse exaggerated how orrin had a few encounters when he was growing up hes slow to anger dr cole and he hates fights but that doesnt mean he never got in one the neighbor children used to bother him called him names and all that mostly orrin would run away but every once in a while hed lose his patience sandra and bose exchanged glances bose said how often did this happen ariel oh i dont know maybe once or twice a year when he was younger was it ever serious did he get hurt did he hurt anyone else no whatever you can tell us might help us find him i dont see how pause well once he hit the lewisson boy hard enough he had to get stitches over his eye other times it was just scuffles maybe a black eye or two sometimes orrin got the worst of it sometimes not she added he always felt bad about it afterward okay thank you bose said anything else orrin talked about this morning that you can recall anything at all even if it seems unimportant no just the weather like i said he was interested in the weather report coming over the radio in the coffee shop theyre calling for heavy rain tonight that excited him i guess its tonight he said tonights the night any idea what he meant by that well he always did like storms you know the thunder and all bose convinced ariel to stay in her room otherwise ill end up looking for the both of you and ariel had calmed down enough to see the sense in it youll call me though right soon as you know anything ill call you whether we know anything or not back in the motel lobby bose talked to the desk clerk for a few minutes orrin had been waiting for the downtown bus the clerk said no he hadnt actually seen orrin get on just noticed him waiting out there skinny guy in torn jeans and a yellow tshirt standing in the sun by the side of the road begging for heat stroke in this weather if you ask me those buses only come along every fortyfive minutes so what do we do sandra asked when bose had finished depends maybe you want to stay here with ariel or maybe i dont i can think of a couple of places we might look youre saying you know where he went i have an idea or two bose said chapter twentytwo allisons story isaac dvali explained how hed turned off the network surveillance turk sat warily still watching isaac watching me its true i said when isaac finished and i told him the rest of it that id talked to isaac days ago that isaac knew about our plan and that at least for the moment the network couldnt hear a word we said i wasnt sure he believed me until he stood up and came across the room and we looked at each other our first honest look since we had begun planning our escape then we were in each others arms trying to say all the things we wanted to say and managing only a happysad incoherency but words didnt matter it was enough to be able to hold him without making a lie of it then my hand touched the node at the back of his neck a patch of papery skin a fleshy bump he flinched and we drew apart he turned to isaac thank you for doing this youre welcome but its a little confusing i knew isaac dvali back in the equatorian desert you look like him allowing for what happened and i know they rebuilt you from isaacs body but a lot of you must be pure vox and to be honest you dont sound much like the isaac i knew im not the isaac you knew there isnt a word for what i am turk was looking at him with networked attention reading the invisible signs what im saying is i dont understand why youre here i dont know what you want isaacs smile disappeared and a cold light came into his eyes a light even i could see it doesnt matter what i want it never did i didnt ask to be injected with hypothetical biotechnology when i was in my mothers womb i didnt ask to be cycled through the temporal arch i didnt ask to be brought back to life when i was decently dead what i wanted was never germane it isnt now my neural functions are shared with processors embedded in the network im chained to vox i cant exist without it and vox is about to be consumed by something incomprehensible he made a visible effort to control himself the hypotheticals dont care about anything as trivially brief as a human life its the coryphaeus that interests them when the hypothetical machines reach vox theyll absorb the coryphaeus and dismantle vox core nothing human will survive i said how do you know that i cant talk to the hypotheticalsim not what oscar thinks i ambut i can hear them ticking out in the dark not their thoughtstheir appetites his face went slack and he closed his eyeslistening maybe then he shook his head and looked at turk you were there when i was in pain not because you thought i was a god not because you could use me not like the doctors hovering over me like crows over carrion thats little enough turk said if you can save yourselves i want to help thats also little enough what about you i asked a trace of a smile returned to his face but it was bitter if i cant leave i might be able to hide ive been trying to create a protected space inside the network not for my body but for my self i mean to try but the hypotheticals are very powerful and the coryphaeus the coryphaeus is insane the coryphaeus is insane as treya i hadnt given the coryphaeus much thought few of us did the coryphaeus was an abstraction a name for the processors that quietly and invisibly mediated between network and node our teachers had shown us a diagram to explain it and that was as much as we had ever wanted or needed to know the system was stable selfprotecting selfperpetuating and it had worked flawlessly for five centuries what could it mean then to say that the coryphaeus had gone mad the problem was the voxish prophecies our founders had written them into the coryphaeus as unalterable axiomsembedded truths permanently exempt from debate or revision that hadnt mattered when the rapture of the hypotheticals was a distant goal toward which we moved in gradual increments but now we had come to the blunt end of the question prophecy had collided with reality and the obvious inferencethat the prophecies might have been mistakenwas a possibility the coryphaeus was forbidden to consider that conflict was being played out in the surveillance and infrastructure systems that bound together our lives and our technology it was being played out in the limbic interfaces and private emotions of everyone who wore a node what makes it especially dangerous isaac said is that we cant predict the result the most likely outcome is an asymptotic trend toward selfdestructive behavior in both the organic and inanimate aspects of the system he added its already happening more quickly than i anticipated i asked him what he meant then wished i hadnt the end of vox is days away that means theres no need for a surplus food supply or surplus people if theyre not a willing part of the process he looked away as if he couldnt bear to meet our eyes the coryphaeus is killing the last of the farmers i refused to believe it until i had seen evidence as soon as isaac left i rode vertical transit to one of the high towers and found a panoramic window it was night but the sky was unusually clear and the moon was bright on the northern horizon the farmers had lived in the hollow spaces under the outlying islands of the vox archipelago they had numbered about thirty thousand souls before the rebellionfewer but at least half that many after now none the outislands were sinking the coryphaeus had cut them loose from the central island and opened their ancient accessways to the sea any farmers who survived the initial flooding perhaps by climbing to the highest tiers of their enclosures were dying as i watched the ross sea drew the islands down in great upwellings of violetcolored froth geysers of water erupted from severed transit tunnels and ports cliffs of saltencrusted granite heaved up dripping from the poisonous sea then turned and settled beneath it forever leaving oily residue and the tangled branches of dead forests i stood there for most of an hour too shocked even to weep chapter twentythree sandra and bose bose took her past the place where orrin had once rented a room it was a fivestory walkup in a part of town you drove through with your doors locked windows like eyes shut against the sullen indifference of the heatstricken street a doorway littered with broken syringes up in one of those rooms sandra thought in the long afternoons before the night shift began orrin must have patiently filled his notebooks page by page day after day you think he came back here no bose said but i dont know how well orrin knows the rest of the city he has forty dollars in his pocket and i doubt he ever hailed a cab in his life hes taking transit and he might have decided to stick to the route he knows route to where to the findley warehouse bose said so they followed the bus routes orrin once would have taken to work hot streets clotted with traffic under a sky dark with thunderheads the afternoon light was fading by the time bose turned off into a neighborhood of singlestory industrial buildings set back in lifeless yellow lawns the buildings housed small manufacturers and regional distributors none of which seemed especially prosperous bose parked in the lot of a corner gas station with a coffeeanddoughnut shop attached to it sandra said are we close to the warehouse close enough bose suggested coffee the restaurant if she could dignify it with that name held a dozen small tables all vacant the windowsills were dusty and the green linoleum was peeling where the floor met the walls but at least the place was airconditioned better get something to eat bose said we might be here a while she ended up carrying a muffin and coffee to a corner table from this angle she could see the street the long row of anonymous buildings on the far side the threatening sky was one of these buildings the findley warehouse bose shook his head the findley warehouse is around the corner and a couple of long blocks down but the nearest bus stop is just across the streetsee it a rusty transit sign bolted to a light standard a concrete bench tagged with ancient graffiti yes if orrin comes by bus thats where hell get off so were just going to sit here and wait for him youre going to sit here im going to scout around the neighborhood in case he got here ahead of us though i doubt that i dont really expect him until after dark youre basing this on what intuition did you finish reading orrins document not all of it not yet you have it with you a printout in my bag why dont you read the rest of it and well talk about it when i get back she read it while bose did his drivearound and she was within a few pages of the end when he pulled back into the lot he parked behind the restaurants dumpster where the car would be hard to see from the streetan act of prudence or paranoia she thought find anything she asked when he came through the door nope he ordered another coffee and a sandwich and she heard him ask the woman behind the counter you mind if we sit here a while more sit as long as you like she said we do most of our business at lunch its mainly drivethrough after three make yourselves comfortable long as you buy a little something now and then theres a tip in it for you if you keep a fresh pot brewing were not allowed to accept tips for counter service ill never tell bose said the woman smiled looks like the rains starting good time to be indoors sandra saw the first fat drops strike the restaurant window moments later water was washing down the glass in quavery sheets rain bounced from the steaming asphalt of the parking lot and the scent of moist tepid air seeped under the door bose peeled a layer of plastic wrap off his sandwich you finished orrins story just about you understand why i think hes headed here she nodded tentatively orrinor whoever wrote thisobviously knows a few things about the findley family whether theyre true or not is a different question im more concerned with whats going on in orrins head than whats true remember what he told ariel tonights the night he has unfinished business or at least he thinks he does right what he doesnt know is that findley and his people are on high alert there are private security cars parked all around the perimeter of the warehouse private security what like brinks no not like brinks these guys arent bonded and they dont advertise sandra shivered and told herself it was because of the sudden damp in the air outside in the flooding rain a city bus pulled up a puddle had formed around a blocked storm drain and the buss wheels splashed the three indifferent bluecollar guys who were waiting for it they got on nobody got off the bus pulled away orrin could get hurt she said we see him we take him back to ariel and make sure they both get out of town thats the plan if he gets past us theres really nothing we can do the wind picked up there was one tree on the entire streeta spindly sapling on the lawn that hedged the sidewalkand it bent before the storm like an arthritic pensioner the restaurants plateglass windows rattled sandra found her thoughts returning to the scar on boses body and the story of his fathers death in india those thieves who broke into your fathers place in madras she said he gave her a startled look what about them what were they after why do you want to know im curious im entitled to be sandra thought silence then maybe you guessed they were after the drugs what kind of drugs the kind of drugs you seem to think they were after martian drugs because your father wasnt just an engineer he was involved with fourths he despised the people who were only interested in longevity he hated the word he used to say it wasnt longevity that mattered it was maturity your mother knew about this my mother was the one who recruited him i see so the scar what about it i didnt get out of med school without a course in anatomy unless the knife that cut you had a blade under an inch long it would have damaged major organs not usually a survivable wound especially if you had to wait for help she was so accustomed to boses perpetual calm that she was startled when he wouldnt meet her eyes after a time he said it was my mothers decision sandra had come to this surmise last night but it was still slightly shocking to hear him admit it to give you the martian treatment you mean as a last resort for the purpose of saving my life it was a hugely controversial decision among the people who knew about it but i didnt have a choicei was comatose when it happened cellular technology engineered by the martians from samples of hypothetical debris grown in bioreactors and injected into his damaged body repairing it working in him even now she recalled something hed said just a couple of mornings ago once the biotech infiltrates your cells its there for good some people find that idea abhorrent this body she had touched not wholly human thats why you care so much about findleys import business findley and the people he works for are corrupting and debasing something that might be vital to the future of all of us theyre more than ordinary criminals theyre the kind of people wholl commit murdernot for the sake of a few extra years of life which might be understandable but for the privilege of retailing it like the people who killed your father exactly like a fresh pulse of rain rattled the window the streetlights had come on serial halos of yellow light bose reached over the table to touch her hand but she drew it away without thinking chapter twentyfour turks story isaac dvali visited us once more before our planned escape as before he screened us from the networks embedded sensors but i wondered whether there wasnt one surveillance device still operationalnamely my own node if the coryphaeus wanted to know what was happening couldnt it just look through my eyes dont make the mistake of thinking of the coryphaeus as a personality isaac said it isnt and it cant do what youre suggesting still its in my head not to spy on you vigilance is a network function the coryphaeus will try to influence your emotions and your unconscious beliefs but it hasnt established full connectivity yet for now it cant act except through the agency of other people if it wants to speak to you it will have to use someone elses voice you think it might do that speak to me i think it will do anything in its power to keep you from leaving we finalized our plans simple as they were allison and i would travel separately to the high tier that housed the military aircraft we would need one of the larger vehicles to get to the indian ocean and past the arch without refueling there wouldnt be a posted guard at the aircraft baysthere was little need for guard details in a tightly networked communitybut civilians or technicians who happened to be present might try to interfere with us especially if the coryphaeus figured out what we were up to once we were aboard i would attempt to pilot our ship out of the docking bays if we got that far it should be possible to isolate the vehicle and my node from any signals originating from vox core during this time isaac would be shielding us from the attention of the coryphaeus whether he had enough influence to leverage our escape was an open question but it might at least improve the odds isaac stood up to leave he hesitated at the door of the suite fragile child and luminous monster in equal parts and asked almost wistfully whether we had any more questions i said no allison shook her head please be careful he said giving me a studying look the deeper the node embeds itself the better the coryphaeus knows you on some level its already negotiating with you sooner or later it will offer you something you want and you might find it hard to say no in the remaining hours i practiced operating oscars network toys reassuring myself that i could get the appropriate response from them at least nine times out of ten i could already interact fairly confidently with the ordinary networked control surfaces video feeds temperature controls etc in the suite a military aircraft was a vastly more complicated device but it didnt need more from its pilot than a reliable communication of intent i figured i was just about good enough to give it that i slept a few hours while allison kept an eye on the video feeds the murder of the farmers had made her somber and deeply wary newsfeeds reported minor outbreaks of violence throughout vox core a woman had committed suicide by leaping from the high wall of a housing tier a man had stabbed his infant daughter with a kitchen knife waves of conflicting emotions were propagating almost too quickly for the coryphaeus to identify and extinguish them and there was worse news allison shook me awake you have to look at this she said i followed her out of the bedroom what she wanted to show me was fresh video from an overflight of the hypothetical machines as the sequence began the hypothetical machines were crawling through a dry glacial valley toward the shore of the ross sea no doubt they were closer to us than they had been the day before but otherwise there seemed to be nothing unusual about the image the angle of vision altered subtly as the drone continued to circle beyond the safe limit i wondered what i ought to be looking forand then it was obvious suddenly simultaneously all the hypothetical structures began to deform and dissolve almost at once there was nothing on the ground where the machines had been but a dense gray fog the camera zoomed in until fog filled the entire screen not fog anymore but a granular swarm of small objects i used my network skills to overlay a scale gauge in metric units it told me the objects were all uniformly sized each one a little more than a centimeter on its longest axis which only confirmed what i already knew these were the same crystalline butterflies that had swarmed the vanguard expedition in the wilkes basinnow in vastly greater numbers the hypothetical machines must have converted their entire mass into this form the swarm moved like a nebulous arrowhead toward the sea thats how theyll come for us allison said she gave me a look that meant we need to leave now we had decided to travel separately to the aircraft docks allison had worked out a route that avoided heavily populated neighborhoods and she left the suite before corridor illumination had ramped up to full daylight the plan was that i would wait a few minutes before i followed keeping some physical distance between us and lulling any suspicions the coryphaeus might have begun to harbor but soon after allison left there was an alert from the door i opened it to find oscar outside smiling nervously he said may i come in and i had to say yes back on earthearth the way it had been when i was growing upi had heard about species of fish that lit up under the sea bioluminescence it was called there was something like that in the way i saw oscars face through my networkenhanced perception a soft glow of euphoria tempered by flashes of fatigue and suppressed doubt and under all that an indigo pulse of suspicion regular as a heartbeat i was of course just as transparent to him it was moodreading not mindreading but he could still catch me in a lie i hoped any emotional turmoil i couldnt hide would look like a natural reaction to the crisis oscar said is treya here no i dont know when shell be back im sorry i want to issue an invitationto both of you please come to my home mr findley come and bring treya my family is there he was radiating a bright but shallow sincerity the way a woodstove radiates heat five hundred years of history is reaching a climax you shouldnt be alone when it happens thank you oscar but no he gave me a penetrating stare its too bad you didnt make the decision to join the network sooner youre very close but i think you still fail to understand how lucky you are how lucky we all are to be alive at this moment of history i do understand i said and i appreciate the offer but id rather face it alone that was a lie worse it was a mistake he knew it was a lie his suspicion flared he said may i talk to you just for a little while so i had to ask him to come in to sit down while he gathered his thoughts i reminded myself that i couldnt fool him or the coryphaeus with an outright falsehoodit had been stupid to try the best i could do was to tell the truth selectively some of us in the managerial class have raised questions about you he said at last when you submitted to surgery those voices were largely silenced and now that were only hours away from final events the question is moot but over time ive come to think of myself as your friend he believed what he was saying and as your friend its been a pleasure to watch you moving toward a real alignment with vox youre almost there its perfectly obvious but you persist in hesitating almost as if you were frightened of us he cocked his head are you frightened of us the truth yes i said vox isnt just a polity its a state of being you feel that dont you he was drawing a distinction between understanding and feeling between the fact and my experience of it i do feel it i said also true i felt it because of what was happening inside my head the medics had explained this to me there was a part of the brain called the medial prefrontal cortex not strictly part of the limbic system it modulated moral judgment and it was the last area the node would infiltrate and manipulate i said it feels like well like standing on the porch of a house on a winter night there are people inside and in a way theyre family oscar liked that he beamed and smiled but i cant shake the thought that if i cross that door i wont be welcome because theyll know me for what i am what are you different foreign ugly hateful different in your history but not in any way that matters youre wrong about that oscar am i you cant be sure until you let us know you i dont want to be known whatever it is youre hiding from us i promise it wont make a difference to vox what im saying oscar is that im not an innocent man none of us is innocent im a murderer i said all true the burning man in his aura of blue fire i killed him because i was angry because i was humiliated or maybe just because a storm had blown through houston on the heels of a record heat wave maybe theres no point asking why in the dark as oily rain sheeted off rooftops and plunged down gutters i walked along an empty back street carrying a jug of methyl hydrate in a plastic bag in my right pocket i had a box of matches also wrapped in plastic and for insurance a butane lighter the store clerk had told me was waterproof i was eighteen years old i had taken public transit from the suburb where i lived with my parents changing buses three times there had been nobody on the last bus but a few sullen nightshift workers and i hoped i looked like one more sodden and unlucky minimumwager the bus wound through an industrial park as grim as a prison compound i got off and stood a moment under a bus stop sign alone the bus lumbered around a corner belching diesel fumes then the street was empty the warehouse where my father ran his criminal enterprise was a couple of blocks away i didnt know much about the business except that it had been the subject of arguments between my mother and my father as far back as i could remember i had spent some of my childhood in istanbul where we lived for six yearsthat was why my friends called me turk in istanbul as in houston we had lived in a comfortable part of town while my father worked in much less desirable neighborhoods my mother was a louisiana baptist by heritage and she had never gotten accustomed to the mosques the burqaseven though istanbul was a cosmopolitan city and we lived in a westernized district for a while i thought that was why they argued so often but the arguments continued after we moved back to the states and although they tried to keep it from me i eventually understood that it wasnt the long hours or the foreign interludes of my fathers work that upset my mother it was the nature of the work itself her shame and discomfort were expressed in small ways she wouldnt answer the phone unless the call came from a known number we seldom visited relatives on either side of the family nor were we visited by them as the years passed my mother grew quiet sullen withdrawn once i hit adolescence i began to spend more time out of the houseas much as possible better the street than these drawn curtains and whispered conversations maybe that makes it sound worse than it was we were at least superficially comfortable we had money i went to a decent school furtive though my fathers business might be he was successful at it i overheard argumentative phone calls in which he inevitably prevailed sometimes men in neatly pressed suits came to see him and they spoke to him softly and deferentially i had occasionally wondered whether my father might be a criminal but the idea seemed ludicrous on the face of it i guessed he might be operating on the far side of some trivial law maybe dodging taxes or import duties but i had learned from television and the internet that such behavior could be lovable and even looked at in the right light heroic the spin years had taught us that when the rules break down its root hog or die and in those days you did what you had to do to keep a family together and food on the table i loved my father i told myself so and i believed it it was only later that i collided with his disdain for conventional ethics his pathological need to be obeyed the sluicing rain was useful cover my fathers business was housed in a building older than the spin a twentiethcentury building with brick walls and small high windows of green leaded glass it fronted on this dreary street but the real work was conducted from the rear where the loading bays were my father had taken me here twice before against my mothers objections to give me a sanitized tour of the warehousehe may have hoped to bring me into the business at some point in the future and i had scouted the area myself just two days ago working out a plan i cut down a narrow passage between two adjoining buildings to the laneway at the back long ago a railway spur had serviced these warehouses the spur line had been paved over but the asphalt had scabbed away in places to reveal the old steel rails glittering in the smoky orange light of the street lamps the rain was coming down pretty hard but i could hear the slosh of flammable liquid in the jug i was carrying last year i had fallen in love with a girl named latisha philipsfallen in love the way a seventeenyearold falls in love stupidly wholeheartedly latisha was an inch taller than i was and so sweetly goodlooking that i woke up most mornings afraid shed figure out she could do better than turk findley she was smart too if scholarship programs hadnt been cut to the bone during the postspin austerity drives she might have qualified for an ivy league college she wanted to be a marine biologist she wanted to save the oceans from acidification she attended local protests against the sulfuraerosol launches her family was neither rich nor poor they lived in a neighborhood adjoining the gated community where my father owned a house i believe they rented i didnt mention latisha to my parents because i knew my father would disapprove of her there had been hardscrabble findleys in texas and louisiana since before those states joined the union and part of my fathers legacy was a racism so offensive he had long since learned to conceal it in polite company istanbul had been a particular strain for him but he found plenty to complain about in houston when he was at home he dropped his veneer of tolerance like a pair of tight shoes the world was being mongrelized he said and he knew exactly who was to blame i didnt know whether my mother shared these views if so she never spoke about them like me she had learned to ignore my fathers rants even as she pretended to listen to them his racism was almost antiquarian poisonous butso i thoughttoothless nevertheless i wasnt eager to introduce him to latisha who happened to be black i had already met her family her father was a pharmacist her mother had moved to houston from the dominican republic twenty years ago and currently worked at walmart they had always treated me with a cautious but sincere cordiality i followed the old railbed until i was opposite the loading bays at my fathers warehouse i found a dark space between two concrete abutments and hunkered down where i couldnt be seen not that there was much chance of anyone coming by the warehouse was closed and although my father occasionally stayed late to take care of unscheduled business this wasnt one of those nights he had come home for dinner and settled into the sofa with a drink in his hand and a twentyfourhour news channel to glower at the rain fell continuously and i was drenched and shivering although it had been a stiflingly hot daythe rain fell from some colder higher place than these cloistered back alleys i watched the warehouse attentively for half an hour from my earlier scouting trips i had concluded that there would be no one here after midnight but the night watchman a skinny drifter my father had hired from the bus depot downtown by watching the windows i had even established his regular routine an hourly fifteenminute walkthrough of the upper and lower floors the rest of his time spent in a small room with a single frosted and wirereinforced window i guessed he had a video monitor in there by the way the light flickered i had known my father would be a problem but i was serious about latisha we had even talked about marriage or elopement some arrangement that would leave my father out of the loop until it was too late for him to interfere no fixed date because latisha at least deserved a shot at whatever higher education she could afford to get but our plans were real or at least i had thought so real enough that i had confided in my mother over the kitchen table she had listened carefully and wordlessly then she sat back in her chair and said i dont know whats good and whats bad anymore if i ever did but if you do this its probably best you get out of the house she added plaintively i would like to meet latisha one day when that becomes possible until then i wont say anything to your father im sure she meant not to but over the summer something must have aroused his suspicion i didnt know what an undeleted text message a phone conversation overheard he hadnt questioned me but he had questioned my mother and she caved in and told him what she knew my father believed in direct action i didnt know he had done anything at all until my calls and texts to latisha started bouncing i went to her house but her parents wouldnt let me talk to her they said she had decided to break off the relationship maybe so but i refused to believe it until i had spoken to her herself i kept an eye on the house but there was little sign of latisha apart from a couple of trips out in the company of her mother i got a note to her through a girl she knew enclosing a more secure ip addressi had changed it without telling my parents that night i waited for a return message but when it came it was abrupt and unapologetic sorry turk yr father talked to my father made an offer my college tuition paid provided we break up shitty deal but now my folks insist on it only chance for a good school so forth not too proud to milk a bigot for his money etc i would tell them go to hell but really what kind of life could we have broke and young even tho i love you how long til we start to hate each other for what love cost us dont blame anyone but me i know i have a choice im probably making the wrong one but its my life i have to think of the future crying now pls dont write anymore it was from this low brick building that my father had extracted the cash that paid for our house our backyard pool the clothes on my back and the sedition and betrayal of my best hopes out of this warehouse and whatever business he conducted here had come my mothers chronic unhappiness and my own wholesale humiliation that was why it had occurred to me with the force of revelation that the building ought to be burned down for the purpose of revenge yes but also as a purification by fire i had read that on the battlefield wounds were sometimes cauterized to stop uncontrollable bleeding and i was bleeding and this building was my wound rainwater gurgled down a storm drain by my feet stranding scraps of paper cigarette butts a discarded condom as pale and flaccid as a jellyfish the night watchman worked his rounds i could see the sway of his flashlight on the high windows as he moved from room to room when he was as i calculated at the far end of the building i crossed to the loading bays and mounted a few steps to the steel door painted military green that was the buildings back entrance mounted beside the door was a twostep lock you used a physical key to uncover a numerical touchpad i had taken the key from the top drawer of the desk in my fathers home office and i remembered the entry code from the last time he had brought me here because it had struck me as ludicrously obvious the year of his birth whatever part of latishas tuition my father had arranged to pay he probably considered it a bargain my father was never ostentatious about his wealth but i had lived in his house long enough to overhear the occasional veiled reference to offshore holdings and irs audits aborted by expensive lawyers he could have sent me to yale twice over if i had shown any aptitude for schoolwork none of this money had been applied to the premises of the warehouse however the corridor inside had been overpainted with cheap yellow enamel the floor was ocher linoleum the ceiling lights were flyspecked fluorescent tubes a door to the right opened into the storage and forwarding area stairs to the left led to secondfloor offices my plan was to douse the hallway start the fire pull the alarm by the exit to give the watchman some warning and run whether the fire would be quickly controlled or whether it would spread whether the damage would be significant or just another financial nuisance for my father whether i would be caught and punished for it or whether i would buy a ticket out of town and change my namei didnt know it didnt matter my rage mattered my humiliation mattered so i took the jug of methyl hydrate out of the plastic bag id wrapped it in i put it on the floor i unscrewed the cap and tipped it over the floor had sagged over the years the liquid puddled and spread toward the interior of the building the reek of it was eyewateringly sharp it filled the crevices in the linoleum and crept steadily down the hallway pooling here and there there seemed to be much more of it than a twogallon jug could possibly have contained i took the matchbook out of my pocket and peeled off the wrapping that had protected it from the rain the matchbook was dry but my hand was wet and i ruined two matches before i managed to strike one into a steady flame i wondered if the fumes in the corridor might themselves be flammable whether i was about to be immolated by my own act of revenge i decided i didnt care i was in the act of tossing the match when the door to the right opened and the night watchman stepped through maybe there was a surveillance camera in the hallway though i hadnt seen one or maybe i had tripped a warning light in the watchmans cubby just by coming through the door or maybe he had left his post for the purpose of taking a piss all i knew was that he was suddenly standing in the hallway a couple of yards away staring at me he was a skinny guy in jeans and a sweatstained opencollar shirt he had a big angular head and his hair was shaved close he couldnt have been much older than i was his eyes bugged out in surprise a small river of flammable liquid forked around his old brown shoes he opened his mouth to say something but i had already tossed the match it tumbled through the air leaving a coiled trail of smoke i had time to take a single startled step backward the night watchman just gawked i dont think he understood what was about to happen the flames were blue and they ran along the surface of the liquid and around the rims of the watchmans shoes then some critical boundary between vapor and air ignited there was a vast exhalation of hot air and i was pushed off my feet i turned and scuttled out the door into the gouting rain now the doorway was a curtain of flame and smoke but through it i could see the watchman burning he tried to run and that might have saved his life but his feet went out from under him he did a kind of dance before he toppled into the flaming liquid the dry flooring burned like tinder he looked like he was screaming but i couldnt hear anything over the rush and bite of the flames i thought of allison making her way to the aircraft docks maybe she was there already waiting waiting for me while the rest of vox waited for a ticket to heaven you dont have to carry that weight alone oscar said he sounded as indulgent and unshockable as the pastor at first baptist where my mother used to take me when i was a child well share it with you mr findley the coryphaeus will share it with you once your interface is complete the limbic implant was doing its work i was sorely tempted to accept his offer of salvation same as i had been at first baptist back when my sins were trivial things lay your burden down young man lay it at your saviors feet even as a child i had understood why so many weeping souls made the journey to the altar the coryphaeus knew me word and deed inside and out my sins were its sins oscar watched me closely but youre still not ready to take that last step unconditional forgiveness from a polity of your peers you want it but you wont accept it a forgiveness that would last as long as it took the hypotheticals to show up or had i been wrong about that too maybe vox really would be redeemed maybe vox would live forever there was a presence in my head that insisted it would i said im not sure every sin deserves to be forgiven the man you killed has been dead ten thousand years clinging to a single tragic misjudgment is a vain and wasteful act not talking about my sin necessarily oh whose then it was more than murder oscar the death of all those farmers it was an act of genocide whatever oscar saw in my face it made him flinch he glittered with sudden uncertainty the farmers would never have been taken up by the hypotheticals their death was always inevitable they were only here because vox enslaved them and brought them here necessity brought them here someone made the decision we all made the decision and you all forgave yourselves for it the coryphaeus forgave us the coryphaeus is our conscience i dont mean to offend you oscar but doesnt it seem to you that a conscience that can rationalize genocide might be defective he stared at me radiating violet spikes of anger and resentment then he shrugged you havent lived with your node long enough before long youll understand thats what frightens me i thought none of this matters now he said come with me i wanted to all the years of my adult life i had lived in the harsh light of the burning man i longed to let the coryphaeus shoulder my sins and if the price i paid was oblivion or death maybe that was nothing but belated justice at least i would die clean did i deserve to die clean id rather be with allison i said when the time comes then why isnt she here i know you feel responsible for her but shes an aberration an empty vessel even her affection for you is artificial youre networked nowyou must have seen that in her i didnt want to tell him what i had seen in her go on oscar i said go be with your family he started to object then closed his mouth and nodded in resignation maybe he saw how deeply i envied him and maybe he was too kind to mention it he stood up all right goodbye mr findley he said the door closed behind him i waited until i was sure he had cleared the corridor i told myself it was time to go but it would be so much easier to rest i thought to let what would happen happen it was a foolishness a terrible vanity this idea of escape an insult to the millions who had already lived and died in vox core and to the millions more whose bright hopes were burning behind my eyes i took a last look around i thought about allison waiting for me then i headed for the aircraft docks chapter twentyfive sandra and bose before bose could say anything elsebefore sandra could even begin to consider what he had told heranother bus pulled up at the stop across the street she turned her head to watch under the orange glare of a streetlight the shinywet bus looked like a floating hallucination nobody got on two men got off just a couple of shift workers carrying dinner pails the bus pulled away and the men hurried off wherever they were goingnot in the direction of the findley warehouse its getting late sandra said she wasnt ready to think about what bose had admitted about himself and bose seemed willing to back away from the subject what if he doesnt show up i think he will bose said because of what he wrote whatever else they might be i think orrin believes his notebooks are prophetic the passage about turk findley setting fire to the warehousein orrins mind thats not something that did happen its something that might happen he wants to change the outcome obviously he knows a few things about the findley familyif any of its true the basics werent hard to confirm findley spent a few years in istanbul he has an eighteenyearold son the high school his son graduated from also has a latisha philips registered the same year did you talk to her no what would i say shes not implicated in any of this or the son whose nickname sandra presumed was turk hard to do that without tipping off findley so maybe we can assume orrin talked to the boy or overheard something and drew his own conclusions and he incorporated that into his story logically yeah hes not psychic well he predicted the storm sandra said the rain eased off every once in a while but it always came roaring back as if half the gulf of mexico had levitated over the city and yielded to gravity but he was wrong about other details orrins document says the warehouse was empty except for the night watchman its not not tonight also one of the reasons orrin was so upset when he was fired is that he thought he was supposed to be the watchman on duty when turk set fire to the place he was predicting his own death in a sense but not because he wants to die orrin doesnt strike me as remotely suicidal i think he came here to prevent the thing he was predicting whether hes the victim of it or not bose sketched out the scenario for her orrin working at the findley warehouse somehow uncovers a plan on the part of the bosss son to commit an act of arson and he incorporates that knowledge into his ongoing notebook fantasies the notebooks are the work of a troubled young man who happens to be smarter than anyone including his sister imagines he is but whose grip on reality is tentative at best unexpectedly fired from his job and then locked up at state orrin panics he believes the time of the planned arson is close and he thinks he can stop it if he can get free which was why he bit jack geddes during his clumsy attempt to break out sandra thought once bose and sandra cut him loose he borrows car fare from ariel and sets out to prevent turk findley from committing an unforgiveable act sandra thought about it seems like your timeline is a little off orrin was fired before he could have known anything about turks romantic problems we dont know who his source is maybe it was secondhand maybe he stayed in touch with someone at the warehouse the pertinent passages in the document are the most recent ones and we dont know for sure when they were written why would he even care whether turk findley sets fire to his fathers business orrin already lost his job therework that paid less than minimum wage and barely covered the rent on a flophouse room i dont know bose admitted a few days ago i was hoping you could tell me she didnt have an answer for him then or now what if the explanation is even stranger than that i dont know something just weird then were still sitting here bose said doing what were doing the woman behind the restaurant counter the one who had invited bose to make himself comfortable left for the day sandra caught a glimpse of her as she drove off in a tenyearold blue honda she was replaced by a teenage boy with facial eczema and a nervous tic the night manager poked his head out of his office a couple of times eyeing them until bose got up and said something reassuring he bought a couple of doughnuts which neither of them touched the next bus arrived on schedule the rain was still gushing down overflowing the gutters and rinsing the street of its sheen of oil four people got off this time they all looked like shift workers to sandra none of them was orrin mather three of them ran to the left hurrying toward shelter one turned right and began walking at a casual pace as if the rain didnt concern him she turned away from the window but found bose still staring intently through the glass what is it the young guy the one by himself young yes a skinny young guy wearing a black poncho and carrying something bulky in a plastic bag shit bose said she leapt to the same absurd but unavoidable conclusion you think its findleys son you think thats turk findley the boy reached the corner and then turned south toward the warehouse what do we do bose stood up abruptly stay here keep your phone handy call me if you see orrin or anything else i need to know about otherwise sit tight until you hear from me bose she said love you he said maddeningly and for the first time he was out the door before she could close her mouth she watched through the window as he cut through the restaurant parking lot keeping to a fence line parallel to the street and ignoring the rain that instantly soaked him the counter clerk must have noticed her startled expression maam he asked helpfully you want a coffee or something crazy she said aloud maam not you chapter twentysix allisons story i waited for turk among the aircraft on the docking level high above the city i had taken a twisty route to get here up the quiet starboard terraces and along the shaded parkland corridors treya had loved as a child every garden and gateway along the way was freighted with memory her memory it was hard not to grieve vox was dying and there was nothing i could do about itnothing i could do for lost friends or the family that had ostracized me or the city i had once loved nothing except carry my memories and misgivings to a safer place worlds away the aircraft bay was an open terrace protected from the toxic atmosphere by an electrostatic roof voxish aircraft were aligned across this vast flat acreage as if they had been planted there silvery crops in a mechanical garden the maintenance and flight crews had all gone home to be with their families my footsteps sounded like water dripping in a vacant room i found an inconspicuous place at the base of a light tower and sat down and waited an uncomfortable amount of time passed i began to think turk might not show up that he might have been prevented from showing up that he might have chosen not to show up the node had finally infiltrated the parts of his brain that governed love loyalty needs and desires and with every passing moment the neural webwork grew more subtle and efficient the coryphaeus was singing a soft sweet refrain in the echo chamber of his medial prefrontal cortex what if he didnt come but it was an easy question to answer i would die here in all likelihood the hypothetical machines would dismantle and consume vox core the way they had dismantled and consumed the vanguard expedition out on the antarctic plain and that would be the end of it i felt an uncontrollable upwelling of fear not the predictable fear of dying but the special and very voxish fear of dying alone then i heard a door slide open in one of the transport pods some distance away i hid myself and waited until i was sure it was turk he walked out of the vertical transport stiffly maybe reluctantly his expression was hollow and haggard i called his name and ran to him because vox was a peaceful and crimefree community it had little use for internal security beyond the routine vigilance of the network but for much of its history vox had been at war with external powers chiefly the bionormative communities of the middle and elder worlds our aircraft were weapons of war and they were secured as weapons of war i chose us a large but lightly armed craft of the kind used to transport weapons or troops the entry hatch was a networkenabled interface like the ones turk had lately taught himself to use when i was treya i could have opened it effortlessly just by putting my hand against the control surface and working the options in my head but i had lost that ability when i lost my node as allison i was locked out of all but the simplest voxish appliances and applications the problem was that turk was a novice and he was obviously having a hard time focusing his intentions he may at this point have been uncertain about what he really wanted a long breathless moment passed then the hatch slid open we stepped into the vehicle as the interior lights winked on i quickly checked to see that the aircraft had its full complement of supplies including food and water to last us through the arch to equatoria the stasis lockers were stocked and complete there were no warning lights or sounds which meant we were good to go turk took a seat in the forward compartment of the aircraft it was possible to fly the vehicle from any of its control surfaces and you didnt need visuals to know where you were going but turk had been a pilot in his past life flying by eye and hand the first thing he did after he established an interface was to create a window display in the front wall as if he were sitting in an oldfashioned cockpit suddenly i could see the wide expanse of the hangar deck in front of usit made me feel defenseless i would have preferred a blank wall but if it helped turk so be it i took a seat beside him and watched the deck for any sign that wed been noticed which came immediately yellow lights blinked on over the transit pods company was coming i was surprised it hadnt come sooner but that might have been isaac running interference for us we have to leave i said now the ships controls couldnt be overridden from outside the vehicle at least i didnt think so but if a second vehicle came after us we could theoretically be intercepted or shot down the aircraft didnt move having a hard time keeping the menu in front of me turk whispered visualizing a display i couldnt see sweat beaded on his forehead its just like the training interfaces all we need is to go up outside the nearest transit pod slid open and disgorged a company of soldiers now turk or else we stay he gave me a helpless look i said i dont want to die here he nodded he closed his eyes and swallowed hard abruptly the deck fell away beneath us our aircraft pushed through the electrostatic barrier into murky daylight suddenly vox was a dark patch on the surface of the ross sea far below us the scuttled islands of the farmers surrounding it like a sunken reef we rose at a vertiginous speed until the sea was lost in mist rose until we soared above a deck of clouds that ran to every horizon turk confirmed our destination with the aircrafts onboard protocols and managed to lock out any signals coming from vox which also isolated his node from the activity of the coryphaeushe shuddered once then shook his head as if to clear it he instructed the vehicle to alert us in the event of pursuit there was none probably thanks to isaac and sat back drained and pale from the control surfaces the clouds below us looked as forbidding as a range of wild mountains he looked at me with his eyes narrowed i remembered that feelingthe way treya had felt when the network shut down as if all the color and sense had been drained from the world promise me something he said what the thing they attached to my spineonce we get where were going promise youll cut it out of me solemnly i promised i would once we get where were going we hadnt been able to talk much about that back at vox core i had spent a lot of time viewing material from the voxish archives using only manual interfaces a slow and frustrating process and reading the histories that had been prepared for turk vox had been persecuted for centuries by jealous cortical democracies or so i had been taught but without the cheerleading of the coryphaeus those familiar stories seemed ambiguous and even disturbing the founders of vox had been the activist wing of a radical belief system ostracized by the bionormative majorities of the middle worlds for their experiments with banned hypothetical biotechnology in response the founders had chosen to create their own closed polity a limbic democracy with a builtin metaphysics vox must have seemed at least at first just a slightly more eccentric example of the many artificial island communities that grew and thrived in the oceans of ester a watery middle world the founders had abandoned experiments with hypothetical biotech in favor of their belief in an eventual humanhypothetical union which was why they made saints of everyone who had ever been touched by the hypotheticalsbeginning with jason lawton at the dawn of the spin era and including countless longevity cultists ancient martian fourths and the reckless or unlucky souls who had been taken up by temporal arches the bionormative majority was the recurring villain in voxish history ester had banned limbic neural collectives soon after the tragedies of hyum and loi and vox had been forced to raise anchor and set off on its centurieslong pilgrimage to old earth but today on most planets up the ringester and cloud harbor especiallythe cortical democracies were still thriving once we get where were going meant in the long term one of those prosperous peaceful middle worlds i thought about that after sunset as we traveled north turk ate listlessly alternating his gaze between the barren moon above and the toxic clouds below his mind had wandered to old griefs he said we fucked up this planet pretty good didnt we depends on what you mean by we people in general i guess my generation in particular the view from the forward cabin was ample testimony to human failure the clouds were oddly beautiful but the moonlight that reflected from them was tinted a poisonous green maybe so i said but thats not the end of the story what was the population of earth when you left it six seven billion people something like that but we dont just live on earth anymore we live on all the worlds of the ring you know how many people are alive in the ring of worlds right now almost fifty billion and thats not a toxic bloom like the population on old earth thats fifty billion people living in a sustainable relationship with their environmentfifty billion reasonably happy human beings were not a failed species were a success story thats what vox was running from a success story well vox vox wasnt running away from the middle worlds it was running toward the hypotheticals it wasnt the hypotheticals who nuked vox core the middle worlds arent paradise people are still peoplegreedy and shortsighted often enough but theyve learned how to make better decisions by putting wires in their heads his hand stroked the lump at the back of his skull perhaps unconsciously not exactly i said but it wasnt the concept of cortical democracy he was struggling with turkdid something happen after i left you before you came up to the aircraft docks no nothing important i didnt need to be networked to know that for a lie do you want to tell me about it not now he said maybe when we get where were going we were still a couple of hours away from the indian ocean when the aircrafts alarm sounded i had been asleep turk had insisted on standing watch in the forward compartmenthe didnt trust the ship to pilot itself without supervisionbut i was too exhausted to keep him company so i had crawled into a crew cot and closed my eyes and when i opened them again the alarm was chiming i hurried forward turk had already synced himself up with the ships interface and by the frustrated look on his face i could tell he was having trouble working the controls the wall was still a window the moon had set the sky was dark except for the high tip of the arch close to zenith now reflecting a reddish glow that in another couple of hours would be our sunrise i put my hand on his shoulder he looked up and said ive got a warning display but i dont know how to read it okay can you put it into the wall so i can see it too he managed to do that the display appeared superimposed on the night sky it was a radar signature with tracking details turk said its seeing something but i cant read range or trajectory were we being chased but no the object the ship had detected was high and to the northeast i said the ship pinged us because there shouldnt be anything in that airspace whatever it is it looks like its not on a controlled course its ballistic it was falling in other words probably a natural phenomenon some piece of ancient debris tumbling out of orbit but then the alarm chimed and chimed again and two more targets popped up on the display by the end of an hour we had detected five such falling objects all traveling east to west and roughly parallel to the equator they were impacting close enough to our charted course that turk instructed the aircraft to hold and circle until we could figure out what was going on there was a lull of twenty minutes or so then the alarm chimed yet again according to the vector display it had detected an even bigger target this time maybe big enough to be visible to the naked eye turk instructed the ship to aim its window at the appropriate quadrant of the sky we looked out into darkness a few stars beginning to dim behind the first light of the dawn there turk said the object streaked across the horizon a couple of degrees above the cloud deck it was as bright as burning phosphorous and it left a luminous trail that quickly faded the glare of it tracked across the cloudscape and made hectic moving shadows once it had passed out of sight darkness fell again but only briefly the next burst of light came from beyond the horizon that was the impact ask the ship to calculate its trajectory backward i said see where it came from easier said than done with only a rough estimate of the objects size and mass to work with but the ship calculated a cone of possible trajectories and matched it against the other objects it had monitored then superimposed the likely paths the result was inconclusive but turk saw what i saw the most likely trajectories all intersected at the arch of the hypotheticals whats that mean turk asked i didnt know but the sun was coming up and the nearest leg of the arch would soon be visible from where we hovered turk aimed the window so we could see it the arch of the hypotheticals had been and would forever be the largest artificial structure ever to contact the surface of the earth its apex was higher than the atmosphere and the base of it was embedded deep in the planets mantle it straddled the indian ocean like a wedding band dropped edgeup into a shallow pond the fraction of it we could see from where we circled above the clouds looked like a silver thread laced into the yellow fabric of the dawn focus on the peak of it i told turk and amplify the image he struggled with the interface but eventually succeeded because he had configured the display as a window we seemed to zoom suddenly and dangerously close to the upper reaches of the arch the image wavered distorted by the intervening atmosphere then the onedimensional thread acquired width and became a ribbon in reality it was many miles wide the most detailed telescopic images of the arch beginning back in turks day had never revealed even the slightest imperfection in its surface until now now the ribbon was visibly flawed the smoothly curving edge of it was ragged and sawtoothed amplify it another timesten i said though we were approaching the limits of the aircrafts optical functions another vertiginous leap forward the image writhed and twisted until the ship applied corrective algorithms and i gasped the arch was worse than merely imperfect visible cracks ran across it there were gaps where immense pieces of it had calved away that was what had been coming out the sky pieces of the arch the size of small islands some of them moving at only a little less than orbital velocity burning on reentry and spending their enormous kinetic energy in the earths dead oceans or on its lifeless continents it should have been impossible but it happened again as we watched a dark crack widened and expanded and intersected another and suddenly a piece of the arch separated and began to fall it moved with the elephantine grace of its own inertia and i guessed it might circle the planet a couple more times before it began its final burn and tumble i looked at turk he looked at me we didnt have to say anything we both knew what it meant it meant the door to equatoria had been closed forever it meant our plan had failed it meant we had nowhere to go chapter twentyseven sandra and bose bose followed a line of hedges down the street keeping low and hoping the rain would help disguise his presence the kid with the plastic bagturk presumablystrode down the sidewalk out in the open and half a block ahead another couple of yards and hed be within sight of one of the guard cars bose had identified earlier an anonymouslooking gray vehicle with two sullen and undoubtedly wellarmed men inside it bose recognized the moment the kid spotted the car by the hitch in his step a momentary hesitation youd never notice if you werent looking for it the kid gave no other indication he kept walking head down rain running off his poncho he walked straight past the car the guards inside watched as he passed their heads turning in unison as if they were attached to a string a left turn would have taken the kid down another block to the front entrance of the findley warehouse but he kept on going sensibly bose took the opportunity to cut through the weedy lot in back of an industrial building which shielded him from the guard car but also cut off his view of turk the rain was coming down so hard it felt like brusque hands trying to get his attention his shoes were already saturated at the next corner he caught sight of the kid again still kept walking in the same direction well past the warehouse now just keep on going he thought catch another bus make my life easier but the kid turned left he was circling the warehouse from a distance bose realized looking for a way past the cordon bose tried to put himself inside the kids head on the assumption that this really was turk findley more or less as described in orrins notebook it wasnt easy bose had worshipped his own father patricideeven symbolic patricidewas a foreign concept to him but he understood rage and impotence well enough it was what he had felt when the thieves had broken down the door and come into his fathers home in madras boses father had sent him to hide under the desk in his room and bose had stayed there dutifully his heart beating madly in his chest his lungs starved for air because he kept trying to hold his breath ill deal with this his father had said and bose had believed him he didnt come out until he heard his fathers first and final scream which was followed soon enough by his own his father hadnt taken the fourth treatment himself though he had facilitated the treatment for many others he had still been in the broad midstream of his life not yet ready to assume the duties and obligations of longevity boses mother had been less scrupulous she arranged the treatment as a lifesaving intervention for bose himself bose was far too young for it but martian ethics made an exception for lifeordeath cases typically she had administered the treatment first and asked for her colleagues approval only later bose had never been as grateful as he knew he should have been often when the memories of the madras attack came back to torment him he thought it wouldnt have been so bad if she had just let him die the kid in the rain kept walking at a steady pace he passed a second guard car the perimeter was even better defended than it had been when bose did his first drivearound hours earlier so what was going on at the warehouse that required all this security he guessed findley had been alarmed by the news that orrin had escaped from state care probably he was afraid some federal agency might issue a warrant for the premises but what he was doing to counter that threat remained an open question bose hoped turk would simply give up and go home failing that bose might have to intercept him and warn him away too much time was passing and he still had orrin mather to worry about he sped up a little avoiding streetlights and keeping to the dumpsteranddelivery lanes whenever possible the next time he came within sight of turk the kid was only a dozen yards away standing still he was south of the findley warehouse by a couple of blocks and there were no guards in sight bose ducked back as the kid surveyed the street in both directions seeing nothing but locked doors shabby sidewalks the endlessly falling rain the kid was nervous shifting the heavy plastic bag he carried from hand to hand bose was about to step out either to confront him or to scare him off when the kid suddenly turned left cradling the bag in his arms and ran between two darkened buildings shit bose thought he followed quickly but cautiously hoping the kid wouldnt be spotted and get them both killed but the kid was quick and at least in the tactical sense smart he knew the neighborhood was riddled with alleys and laneways many of them poorly lit and he managed to make his way undetected to the street on which the warehouse had its front entrance that street was well watched but turk sidled up between two empty parked cars dashed across the open space in a particularly heavy gust of rain and made it unseen to the mouth of another alley it wasnt the front of the warehouse turk wanted access to bose surmised it was the back lane with the loading bays just like in orrins story bose followed along the same route feeling absurdly conspicuous he reminded himself that his only objective was to keep the kid from making a huge mistake and getting himself or someone else hurt the problem was any attempt he made to approach turk at this point might startle him into unpredictable action nevertheless he had to make contact he was weaponless but he brought some skills of his own to the situation unlike the hacked pharmaceuticals the longevitysellers traded in the martian treatment suppressed and enhanced certain neurological functions it suppressed spontaneous aggression which meant bose was what people called slow to anger it enhanced empathy and it suppressed fear it also improved visual acuity and reaction time which had helped gain bose his police academy reputation as a firstrate sharpshooter turk moved up the laneway to the place where it intersected the alley behind the warehouse he crouched down almost invisible in his black poncho darting his head out to see what was happening bose used the opportunity to move up behind him now or never hey he said keeping his voice low but just loud enough to be heard over the rattle of the rain the kid jerked out of his crouch and whirled around bose held his hands out palms up im unarmed he said taking a couple of steps closer and im not one of them who are you then the kid managed he had the jug of methyl hydrate in it in his right hand holding it so he could swing it like a mace i used to be a cop bose said youre turk findley right the owners son the kid said nothing but his unsurprised silence served as confirmation all i want bose said is for us both to turn around and get out of here whatever youre thinking of doing its not practical not tonight rain guttered down from the kids sodden black hair into the collar of his poncho he looked at bose through the downpour then he said in a small flat voice behind you what theyre behind you the kid crouched down hastily so did bose he risked a look back there were two men coming up the alley wraithlike in the rain they hadnt seen bose or turk yetthe angle of the wall had hidden thembut unless they turned around they surely would turk seemed reassured by boses reaction this way he said bose had no choice but to follow him around the corner into the back lane where they would almost certainly be spotted but no there was a narrow gap between a green steel dumpster and the ledge of a loading bay just big enough for the two of them to squeeze into bose tried to get a good look around during the brief moment he was exposed the bays of the findley warehouse were half a block to his left three cars were parked in the alley and a white unmarked van had pulled up to one of the bays the loading bay door had been rolled up spilling a rectangle of light into the darkness bose tried to fix the scene in his mind calculating relative distances and possible avenues of escape then he hunkered down next to turk who was shaking like a wet dog the two guards came up the alley and into the open bose caught a glimpse of their yellow rain jackets as they passed the dumpster heading back to the open loading dock the presence of the van explained what was going on at the warehouse bose thought findley had gotten nervous and was cleansing the building of contraband there were boxes stacked floor to ceiling in the back of the vanprobably chemicals from lebanon or syria bound for blackmarket bioreactors bose decided he needed a better look he went from a crouch to a kneeling position and then down onto his belly the asphalt under him was wet but still warm from the heat of the day it smelled like some kind of oildrenched animal he snaked forward and peered past the rim of the dumpster all he had for camouflage was his dark hair and dark skin he got a good look at the man supervising the loading a middleaged man with a haggard expression and a flashlight in his hand bose recognized him as the elder findley your fathers here he whispered after a pause the kid said you know my father i know him when i see him are you going to arrest him i wish i could but im not a cop anymore i cant arrest anybody then what are you doing here helping out a friend what are you doing here no answer bose was about to suggest that they attempt to head back the way they had comedangerous though that might bewhen a fourth car pulled up by the van the driver got out and climbed onto the concrete loading bay and approached findley who gave him a what now look the driver said something inaudible pointing back down the alley suddenly findley clapped his hands and began to shout loud enough to be heard over the rattle of the rain telling the loading crew to finish up and pull in the security perimeter bose checked his watch the next bus was past due it would have arrived minutes ago orrin he thought his best guess was that one of findleys security men had spotted orrin mather and brought the matter to the bosss attention the elder findley climbed into a car with one of his security guys the car rolled down the laneway its wheels splashing bose and turk where they crouched in the shadows bose saw turk blinking at the ripples left by the car in the pavements skin of rainwater aware that his father had passed within a few feet of him much of the rage that had carried him here seemed to have collapsed into confusion more footsteps down the alley behind them the lookouts had been called in we need to get out of here bose said he added we might need a distraction the kid turned up a neartearful face what are you talking about what distraction bose said you happen to be carrying anything flammable chapter twentyeight allisons story our aircraft could have flown days more without exhausting its supply of fuel but there was no point in circling aimlessly turk found a small steep island off the southern flank of what had once been the indonesian archipelago and landed us there the island was far enough south to be out of range of the falling fragments of the arch and high enough to protect us from any resulting tsunami the aircraft came to ground on a fairly gentle slope the land around us was as blank and poisoned as any other part of the planet but we could see the ocean to the southwest of us we could have left the ship and gone outsidethere were masks and protective gear in the storage lockersbut there was no reason to do so and it might have been dangerous to attempt it galeforce winds were blowing steadily maybe as a result of the monstrous impacts farther north we discussed the possibility that the arch might still be functional that even in its fractured condition it might still be able to detect turk and allow us passage to equatoria that was almost certainly wishful thinking however and it would have been insanely risky to try an approach as soon as we had landed the ship detected two more fragments inbound from orbit we couldnt see them through the cloud deck but the impacts created a shock wave that rattled the vessels hull even these many hundreds of miles away an hour later the sea receded from the shore of the island revealing ancient dead corals and black sand then came rushing back in a surge that would have been catastrophic had there been any living thing in the path of it we could go back to vox i pointed out the aircraft would do that anyway automatically once its fuel supply was nearly exhausted there might be nothing left of vox turk said the hypothetical machines would have reached it by now maybe probably but we didnt know what had caused the arch to failmaybe the same thing was happening to the hypothetical machines maybe they were disintegrating at the shore of the ross sea if vox was intact it would still be capable of harvesting enough protein from the oceans bacterial blooms to support a small population in that case theyll be fighting each other for food turk said and if all the hypothetical mechanisms are breaking down thats still not good news he was right of course the one hypothetical technology we all took for granted was the intangible barrier that protected earth from her swollen aging sun if that failed the oceans would boil the atmosphere would cook off into space and vox would end up as a dispersed cloud of superheated molecules but i was still in favor of heading for vox core when the time came it was where as treya i had been born it would be a suitable place to die that night we witnessed the biggest impact yet the ship alerted us to a large incoming object and turk adjusted the window so we could monitor the northwest quadrant of the sky despite the heavy cloud cover we could see the fireball as a moving blur of red light followed by a sunset glow on the horizon a substantial shock wave was inevitable so we instructed the ship to anchor itself to the island by means of hightensile cables fired into the bedrock the shock arrived as a solid wall of wind and hot rain our aircraft was pressuretight and well anchored but i could hear it straining against its cablesan agonized groaning as if the earth itself were in pain i went to bed when the winds had calmed some and that night i dreamed of champlainallisons champlain in my dream i walked allisons streets and i shopped at the mall where allison had shopped and i made conversation with allisons mother and allisons father all this seemed intimately real but it took place in a world drained of color and texture allisons mother served chicken pot pie and baked beans for dinner and i was allison and i loved chicken pot pie but the meal she put in front of me was indistinct a diagram of itself and it tasted of nothing at all because these werent really memories they were details extracted from a dead womans diaries i had learned a lot about myself and the world i lived in by masquerading as allison but in truth i had never stopped being treya oscar had been right about that allison was simply the tool i had used to pry treya away from the tyranny of vox for whatever that was now worth i climbed out of my cot and went forward turk was still awake keeping a pointless vigil the wind continued to rage but had lost some of its ferocity according to our sensors the rain beating against the hull was as hot as steam i told turk about my dream and what it meant i told him i was tired of pretending to be allison i didnt have a name worth wearing i told him i was going to die on an empty planet and nobody would know who i was or had been he said i know who you are we sat together on a bench opposite the windowwall he put his arms around me and held me until i was calm that was when he told me what had happened back at vox core before we escaped he said he had talked to oscar and through oscar to the coryphaeus he had confessed a truth about himself what truth i thought i knew the answer i thought he meant the truth he had been evading ever since we had plucked him out of the equatorian desert the terrible and obvious truth about himself but he told me a different story he told me how hed killed someone back when he was a young man on the living earth he spoke stiffly and with a grim restraint his face turned away and his fists clenched i listened carefully and let him finish maybe he didnt want me to say anything in response maybe silence would have served him better but there was no real future ahead of us now and i didnt want to die with an important truth unspoken after he had composed himself i said can i tell you a story in return i dont see why not this is an allison story i said it happened back on old earth otherwise its not much like your story at all but its something that weighed on her conscience for a long time he nodded waited i said allisons father was a soldier as a young man he served overseas in the years before the spin he was forty years old when allison was born fifty the year she turned ten on her tenth birthday he gave her a presenta painting in a cheap wooden frame she was disappointed when she unwrapped itwhat had made him think she wanted an amateur oilcolor portrait of a woman holding a baby then he told her almost bashfully that hed painted it himself hed done it a few years ago working nights in his study he said the woman in the picture was allisons mother and the child was allison herself allison was surprised because her father had never seemed artistiche made a living managing a shoe store in a strip mall and shed never heard him mention literature or art but having a baby daughter he explained was the best thing that had ever happened to him and he had wanted to remember that feeling so hed made the painting to remind himself of it now he wanted allison to have it so allison decided it was a pretty good gift after all maybe the best shed ever gotten eight years later he was diagnosed with lung cancerno big surprise hed been a packaday smoker since he was twelve years old and for a few months he tried to behave as if nothing was wrong but he got steadily weaker and eventually he was spending most of the day in bed when it got to be too hard for allisons mother to look after himwhen he couldnt eat when he couldnt get up even to use the bathroomhe had to go to the hospital and by then allison understood he wouldnt be coming home he was in for what they called palliative care basically the doctors were helping him die they gave him drugs for the pain more every day but he was pretty clearheaded up until the last week although he cried a lotthe doctors said he was emotionally labile and one day when allison was visiting he asked her to bring him that painting so he could look at it and call back the old memories but she couldnt do it she didnt have the painting anymore at first she had hung it on the wall above the headboard of her bed but at some point it had begun to embarrass herit seemed crude and sentimental and she didnt want her friends to see it so she put it in her closet out of sight if her father noticed he never said a word then one day when she was cleaning out her old stuffher baby things dolls and toys she was never going to touch againshe put the painting in a box along with everything else and carried it down to the goodwill store as a donation but she couldnt bring herself to admit that not when her father was gaunt and yellow and breathing with the help of an oxygen tank so she nodded and said shed bring the painting next time she came to the hospital back home she went through her closet as if she expected to find the painting still there knowing all the time it was gone she even went to the thrift shop and asked about it but the painting must have been sold or recycled long since so when she came to the hospital the next day her father was disappointed and she made some excuse and promised shed remember to bring it tomorrow a lie that only compounded her shame and she came back to the hospital room every day day after day and every day he was weaker and more frightened and every day he asked about the painting and every day she promised shed bring it to him of course he died without seeing it there was no sound but the groaning of the ships hull fragments of the arch were coming in more often now their radar tracks rolling across the display like bright blue raindrops turk was quiet for a long time finally he said thats allisons griefthe original allison she lived and died with it you dont need to carry it for her no more than you need to carry the burden of that old killing you dont see any difference he was still avoiding the truth and he had missed the point of my story so i tried to lead him to it more bluntly think about that temporal arch back in the equatorian desert its not like the arches that connect the worldsthe temporal arches were never meant for human beings theyre a device the hypotheticals use to preserve information over time preserve it by duplicating it the hypotheticals took you and they remembered you and eventually they recreated you and that means the real turk findley is as dead and longgone as the real allison pearl youre a convincing replica but you were born in a desert with another mans memoriesyoure no more responsible for that mans sins than i am for allisons turk stared at me for a moment he looked violently angry and for a moment i was afraid of him then he stood and walked into the aft section of the aircraft down among the shadows leaving me alone with the roaring of the storm debris impacts began to diminish over the following days and after a week the ships radar registered nothing above the atmosphere but a scattering of dust and fragments all that remained of the arch on earth were two fractured stumps projecting from the indian ocean the tallest rising five thousand feet above sea level the earth was entirely isolated nowas alone in the universe as it had been in the long millennia before the spin turk and i didnt talk about what we had said to each other that difficult night instead we took solace from simple words and simple warmth we may have been false and inauthentic things but at least we understood each other each of us made a presence for the others vacancy we tried to pretend time wasnt passing but it was the ships stores began to run low and when it was impossible to delay any longer turk unmoored us from our rocky island and took us up above the highest clouds up where we could see the stars i didnt want to stop there i wanted to go where our airship couldnt take us i wanted to range out among those distant suns and worlds i wanted to take giant steps from star to star the way the hypotheticals did of course i couldnt we couldnt even go home we had no home all we had was vox if there was still a vox so we flew south dawn to starboard and the ruins of history behind us and nothing ahead but strangeness and faint hope chapter twentynine sandra and bose the minutes tracked past like boxcars in an endless train as sandra sat at the restaurant window waiting for bose fifteen minutes then thirty then forty were doing this insane thing she thought and now its going wrong outside the storm eased and then gathered strength again it was the price paid for all those weeks of remorseless dry heat a terrible karmic balance being struck across the street a bus pulled up it idled briefly then cleared its throat and ambled off into the sheeting dark at first sandra thought no one had gotten off then she saw the figure standing outside the halo of the streetlight dressed stupidly for the weather a yellow shortsleeved shirt that stuck to his skin like a coat of paint a skinny kid all ribs it was orrin of course she stood up without thinking and ran from the restaurant the counter clerk calling after her in alarm maam maam dr cole orrin said when she reached him he didnt seem surprised to see her his expression was mournful i got lost he confessed i should have been here before now i guess you know i mean to stop turk findley from doing what he means to do his lip trembled but i think im too late no orrin listen its all right the rain had gone through her clothes as if they didnt exist and she hugged herself to keep from shivering i understand turk got here a little while ago but officer bose went after him orrin blinked officer bose is with him officer bose wont let him set that fire you mean that its the absolute truth he ought to be back any minute orrins shoulders slumped with relief i thank you for coming here he said his voice barely audible over the hammering of the rain i really do i suppose you read what i wrote in my notebooks sandra nodded its not happening the way it did but i guess thats to be expected how do you mean its not just one thing he said solemnly its the sum of all paths sandra wanted to ask what he was talking about but not while they were standing exposed at the bus stop come across the street with me orrin well wait for bose over there he wont be long i would like a cup of coffee orrin said sandra turned but drew back before she could step off the curb a car pulled up blocking her path the passengerside window rolled down and sandra could see two men inside the passenger was a middleaged man smiling tightly the driver had a gun held loosely across his thigh hello dr cole the passenger said hello orrin sandra recognized the voice she felt numb she wanted to run but she couldnt take her eyes from the car she felt rooted in place hello mr findley orrin said sadly im sorry to see you here orrin thats not good news for either of us why dont you and dr cole get in back so we can talk the driver kept his engine idling but didnt drive away sandra prayed he wouldnt as long as she was within sight of this ugly road the bus stop the coffee shop across the street with its yellow lighted windows it was possible to believe she might still get away unhurt but if the car began to move it would carry her out of the familiar world into that unlit land where unspeakable things happen she knew about the unlit land often enough at state she had interviewed candidates who had been routinely beaten abused abandoned or degraded they were refugees from the land of unspeakable things and through their eyes she had begun to sense the vastness and emptiness of its geography findley looked at her from the front seat his face lined and pockmarked his eyes deceptively mild first things first he said one of you is missing what happened to officer bose dr cole she doubted she could have answered even had she wanted to all the moisture in her mouth had dried up the world was drenched in rain and she couldnt even spit come on findley said impatiently she managed i dont know please hes not with me i dont know where he is findley sighed you should have accepted the offer i made you dr cole it was perfectly authentic a second life for your brother in exchange for nothing important there was no downside to it it was generous you were stupid he paused over there across the street parked in back thats boses car so where is he dr cole she closed her mouth firmly and shook her head the driverthe gunmanturned in his seat to look at her he didnt look like a criminal sandra thought his face wasnt unpleasant he looked like a high school english teacher tired after a long day he showed her the gun she didnt know anything about guns and she couldnt say what kind it was it was as if he was saying here is the source of my power over you as if he wanted her to acknowledge and understand it then he struck her in the face with the grip clenched in his fist the blow glanced off her cheekbone and loosened a tooth the pain was literally sickening she wanted to vomit her eyes clenched shut and she felt tears leaking out of them dont do that orrin said findley turned to face him look at all this trouble you caused orrin and why what did i ever do to you but take you off the street and give you respectable work none of this is my fault mr findley whose fault is it then tell me your own i guess orrin said the gunman jacked his seat back so he could reach orrin but findley raised a hand to stop him sandra watched through slit eyes one hand clamped over her bleeding mouth everything looked watery as if the rain had come inside the car how do you figure that findley asked your own son hates you orrin said calmly findley reddened my son what do you know about my family you shouldnt have done what you did about his friend latisha i dont believe hell ever forgive you for that who have you been talking to orrin closed his mouth and looked away sandra cringed waiting for the inevitable blow but the gunman was looking past her down the street he said here it comes now mr findley sandra risked a look what was coming was a plain white van sandra couldnt begin to guess at its significance but findley was pleased to see it he waved at the driver of the van as it passed all right then he said we might as well get moving into the land of unspeakable things one more chance to tell me about bose findley said sandra glanced at the gunman who smiled horribly orrin watched the van pull ahead mr findley what do you imagine you have to say orrin mr findley i believe that trucks on fire yellow flame guttered out of the vans loosely chained rear doors smoke too though rain and mist concealed it the driver of the van apparently hadnt yet noticed then something inside ignited with a visceral thump the rear doors flew open feeding air to a sudden inferno the van swerved and came up hard against the curb two men tumbled out of the cab looked back in horror then ran into the darkness findley and the gunman were still staring when boses car barrelled out of the coffee shop parking lot findley saw it first go drive for fucks sake he shouted but bose braked directly in front of the car blocking it the gunman put the car into reverse but succeeded only in ramming his rear bumper into the concrete bus bench his last recourse was the weapon in his hand he raised the pistol looking for a target findley was still shouting pointlessly sandra saw orrin lunge forward and grab the gunmans right arm orrin who wouldnt so much as step on a bug sandra thought unless he was provoked he had wrenched the gun to a vertical angle when it went off the bullet cut a flanged hole in the roof of the car allowing in a fine spray of rain findley jerked open the passengerside door and threw himself out landing and rolling on the wet street sandra realized she should do the same but she couldnt bring herself to move she had become a still point around which the universe was revolving her body was leaden and her ears were ringing she wanted to help orrin who had one knee braced against the back of the drivers seat and was struggling to leverage the gunmans arm backward the pistol looped around like a rattlesnake looking for something to bite orrin grunted and redoubled his effort clutching the gunmans arm and pumping with both feet the pistol went off again then bose pulled open the driversside door he moved with a speed that took sandra by surprise his fourth reflexes maybe he reached in and gripped the gunmans arm just as orrin fell back exhausted letting it loose bose took the gun away and tucked it into his belt he pulled out the gunman who crouched in a pool of ponded rainwater like a cornered animal clutching his wrist teeth bared looking at bose and at the gun then he turned and ran bose let him go the burning van was the brightest light on the block casting long and hectic shadows down the slick street sandra looked over at orrin who was slumped against the seat he turned up his face wincing with pain im all right dr cole he said but he wasnt the second shot from the pistol had cut across his shoulder furrowing a wound sandra looked at it professionally as if she had been transported from this madness back to her internship the med school basics apply pressure the wound was bleeding but not too badly she guided him out of findleys car and into boses when she straightened up bose put a hand on her arm to keep her still and examined her face where the gunman had hurt her she said it looks worse than it is then contradicted herself by spitting a wad of blood onto the wet sidewalk we need to get away from here bose said findley stood in the road staring at a figure across the street the figure was his son turk sandra imagined she could see waves of surmise and dismay working their way into findleys shocked consciousness he knows what you are she saidsternly and loudly though the words were slurred by her loose tooth and swelling cheek he knows all about it mr findley findley turned to her his face a mask of rage and confusion sandra ignored him she was watching the boy now the kid turk the kid yanked the hood of his poncho up over his head and turned away from his father in a gesture that was eloquent with contempt he was bound away from here sandra realized she could read that in his body the way he hunched his shoulders and straightened his spine it wasnt the way it had happened in orrins story but it was the same somehow the boy was heading for his own unspeakable land though perhaps not the one orrin mather had imagined for him findley saw his son begin that long walk away from him wait he called out weakly but turk ignored him he walked past the window of the coffee shop casting a reflection on the rainslick firebright asphalt he turned a corner into darkness findley stared into the falling rain until there was nothing to see sandra slid into the backseat of boses car looking for something she could use to bandage orrins wound bose gave her a roll of cotton from the firstaid kit he kept in the glove compartment orrin had bled a lotblood and rain had soaked the loose weave of his shirtbut a few sutures would close the wound sandra could do it herself she supposed if bose decided they couldnt risk an emergency ward hold this here she told orrin putting his free hand on the cotton wad can you do that he nodded thank you he said his voice unnaturally calm bose drove past the burning van a few barren blocks to the highway the highway was almost empty of traffic and the storm was as dense as fog a rainslashed darkness he drove at a steady pace toward the city he couldnt see chapter thirty turks story we flew to vox under a crazed sky external temperature readings rose so high that the ships sensors began to sound intermittent alarms dawn was viciously bright and the sun when it rose looked bloated and threatening but it wasnt the sun that had changed it was the protective barrier surrounding the earth during the first uneasy years after the end of the spin people had speculated about what would happen if the hypotheticals withdrew their protection the answer was so appalling as to be unthinkable and whatever their purposes however obscure their motives the hypotheticals had seemed intent on preserving human life so we had accepted the illusion of normalcy and even begun to believe in it which was presumably what they wanted us to do but i remembered what the astrophysicists had said during the spin the sun had aged almost four billion years the sun was a star and stars expand as they grow old often enough swallowing the planets that surround them without the continuing intervention of the hypotheticals the atmosphere of the earth would be scoured away the seas would evaporate like puddles on a july afternoon and the rocky mantle itself would begin to melt now at last that protection had been withdrawn the influx of radiation was already driving the weather we flew south to antarctica at sixty thousand feet dodging thunderheads that boiled into the stratosphere like black fluid mountains and as we approached voxas we dipped down into the buffeting winds and streaming rainour aircraft informed us that it was pushing the limits of its performance envelope a little more of this and it wouldnt be able to fly cut it out of me i said to allison we were in the forward cabin watching the end of the world she gave me a queasy look i mean it i said you told me this vehicle would fly back to vox by itself if i wasnt controlling it yes but then cut the node out of me she thought about what i was asking her im not sure i can she said i mean cleanly then do it messy i said you promised me as much she gave me a defiant stare then dropped her head and nodded the man i had killed was not in any absolute sense an innocent man nor was my father whose crimes were exposed by the killing the man i had killed i learned was a drifter by the name of orrin mather who had robbed a half dozen liquor stores between raleigh and biloxi before he was hired by my father in all of these robberies he had threatened to use a weapon a secondhand caliber pistol and in three of them he had actually fired the gun none of his victims died but he left one paralyzed from the waist down all these facts emerged during my fathers trial my father may not have known the man he hired was a criminal but it surely wouldnt have surprised him it was his habit to recruit employees from among the casual and undocumented laborers who gathered around the houston bus depot he paid them in cash and asked only that they keep their mouths shut if he happened to learn about a mans criminal record or uncertain immigration status he used the knowledge to extort the mans loyalty generally he started such men as lifters and carriers in the warehouse moving them into more sensitive positions if they demonstrated an acceptable combination of sobriety and servility that had been orrin mathers career path i was never arrested for my crime the fire was selfevidently an act of arson but there were no witnesses the subsequent investigation uncovered a cache of highly controlled substances in the warehouse chemical compounds imported from the middle east and marked for delivery to a longevitydrug ring operating out of new mexico by the time my father was remanded for trial i was on the road by the time he was sentenced i was an ordinary seaman in the recently revived us merchant marine doing deck duty on a freighter bound for venezuela my father was found guilty on three counts including conspiracy to distribute and he ultimately served five years of a tenyear sentence i learned all that from the newscasts i had no further contact with my family if allison was correct those things had happened not to me but to someone elseto the original and authentic turk findley the longextinct template from which i had been reconstructed and maybe that was true maybe i even wanted it to be true but if i wasnt the man who had started that fire if i wasnt the man whose life had been shaped by it if i wasnt the man who had carried his burden of guilt from an old world to a new one if i wasnt the man who had secondguessed every opportunity and repented every pleasure if i wasnt the man who had allowed a shamefaced sense of obligation to take him deep into the oil lands of equatoriaif i wasnt that man what was i allison brought a med kit to the forward compartment and performed the surgery in view of the sky without moving my head i could see clouds the color of steel wool roiling against the aircrafts leading edge stay still she warned me she cut deep and fast the blood covered her hands and clotted in my hair and even after she packed the wound with gels the pain was sickening but she killed the limbic implant and extracted every part of it she could safely reach our aircraft homed in on vox fighting turbulence so severe i could feel the deck bucking under me according to its builtin protocols it had been trying to contact vox core for landing instructions i asked allison whether there had been any response briefly she said someones alive down there isaac she said the clouds opened and we could see vox core a few hundred feet below us there had been visible damagethe exposed surfaces of walls and towers looked eroded almost meltedbut most of the city was intact our aircraft banked unsteadily toward the nearest tower and landed on an open bay along with a gust of toxic air allison helped me to the hatch as soon as the air outside was clean enough to breathe isaac had come up to meet us he had left a trail of footprints on the deck which was covered with floury white dust the dust he said was what was left of the hypothetical machines they had come to consume vox to dismantle it to catalog it molecule by molecule and isaac had hacked their procedural protocols broadcasting disruptive codes from deep in the coryphaeus but not soon enough they took flesh first of all he said there was no one left alive no one but us three bloodstained witnesses to the worlds end we went down into the ancient city to wait chapter thirtyone sandra sandra told her brother kyle about the facility outside of seattle she thought hed like itit was a lot like live oaks she said good doctors big rooms lots of green lawn and even a little bit of forest that green wet west coast forest seldom as hot as houston though even houston was tolerably cool this morning she had wheeled kyle from his room at the residential complex to the mott of live oaks by the creek the sky was blue there was a breeze the oaks bent together conspiratorially kyle was looking skinny the doctors had said they were adjusting his feeding regimen to deal with a minor but persistent digestive problem but today his mood was benign he registered his appreciation of the weather or her presence or the sound of her voice or nothing at all with a gentle ah the managers of kyles trust fund had given tentative approval to her plan to relocate him and they were negotiating terms with the seattle facility as for herself bose had been patient and encouraging but it was still a radically new life she was about to embark on certainly she couldnt go back to the old one nor could bose the investigation of the fire at the findley warehouse had been appended to a federal investigation of the lifedrug ring findley had serviced the fbi had cited bose as a person of interest which meant he had to stay out of sight for a while but that wasnt a problem boses community of friends knew how to shield one of their own he had asked her to join him without preconditions longterm or shortterm as a friend or a loveror whatever she was comfortable with his friends he said would help her find work she had met some of those friends of his the ones who administered the martian longevity treatment as the martians had intendedthe middleaged couple who had driven orrin and ariel out of houston to begin with and others when she visited seattle they seemed like decentenough people earnest in their beliefs the only hope of salvaging this overheated and heedless world they believed was to find a new way of being human the fourth treatment was a step in that direction or so they claimed and sandra wasnt sure they were wrong though they might be naïve and there was bose himself a fourth by default and at the wrong age some of the qualities she loved in bose might have come out of that treatmenthis easy calm his generosity his sense of justice but most of bose was justbose she was certain of it it was bose she had fallen in love with not his blood chemistry or his neurology but he had told her bluntly there was no hope of getting the fourth treatment for kyle bose had received it because it was the only way of saving his life kyle didnt qualify mainly because the treatment wouldnt really cure him as bose had said it would only render him an infant in a healthy mans body perhaps permanently and that was an outcome boses friends after all their colloquies and ethical debates couldnt countenance kyle slumped in the wheelchair with his head inclined his eyes tracking the swaying oaks i got a letter from orrin mather yesterday boses friends had been characteristically generous about helping orrin and ariel during the investigation that followed the fire finding them a home where neither the law nor the criminals were likely to come looking orrins working parttime at a commercial nursery his shoulder healed up nicely he says he says he hopes things are going well for me and officer bose which i guess they are and he says he doesnt mind about me reading his notebooks i would of given you permission orrin had written if you had asked and sandra accepted the implied rebuke he says what i read was everything he ever wrote except for a few pages he finished after he got to laramie he enclosed them with his letter looki brought them with me you can keep these pages orrin had written i dont need them anymore i believe im finished with all that business maybe you will understand it better than i do it is all bewildering to me to be honest i would rather just get on with things she listened to the creek as it rippled through the grove today the creek was running shallow as clean and bright as glass she guessed this water would eventually wend its way into the gulfor evaporate perhaps to fall as rain in some cornfield in iowa as snow in some wintery northern town the sum of all paths sandra thought then she took up the pages orrin had sent her and began to read them aloud chapter thirtytwo isaacs story orrins story the sum of all paths my name is isaac dvali and this is what happened after the end of the world in the end vox was mine its people whom i had hated were dead which i regretted and there was no one left alive but turk findley and the impersona of allison pearl do you blame me for hating vox the people of vox had resurrected me when all i wanted was to die they had believed i was something more than human when in fact i was something less all i had ever received at their hands was pain and incomprehension i had been among the hypotheticals my captors insisted the hypotheticals had touched me but that wasnt true because the hypotheticals as vox imagined them simply didnt exist my father had made me so that i could hear the hypotheticals talking to themselves the whispers they sent between stars and planets and what i had learned was that the hypotheticals were a process an ecology not an organism i could have told my captors so but it was a truth they would have rejected and it would have changed nothing the hypotheticals were already billions of years old when they first intervened in human history they had originated with the first sentient biological civilizations to arise in the galaxy long before the earth and its sun condensed from interstellar dust like the first shoots rising from a wheat field in the spring those forerunner civilizations were fragile vulnerable and alone none of them survived the exhaustion and ecological collapse of their host planets but before they died they launched fleets of selfreplicating machines into interstellar space the machines were designed to explore nearby stars and broadcast home whatever data they acquired and they did that patiently and faithfully long after their creators had ceased to exist they moved from star to star competing for scarce heavy elements exchanging behavioral templates and fractions of operating code changing and evolving over time they were in a sense intelligent but they were never and would never become selfaware what had been released into the desert vacuum and starry oases of the galaxy was the inexorable logic of reproduction and natural selection what followed was parasitism predation symbiosis interdependencychaos complexity life i hated the people of voxwhom i could hate collectively because they behaved collectivelyfor their deeply embedded limbic superstitions and for calling me back from the indifference of death into the pain of my physical body but i could not hate turk findley or the woman who had come to call herself allison pearl turk and allison were broken and imperfect thingslike me like me they had been created or summoned by the will of vox and like me they proved to be something more and less than vox had anticipated i had first met turk in the equatorian desert before he or i had passed through the temporal arch out of ignorance or spite and not quite by accident turk had once killed a man and he had built a life on the foundation of that guilt his best acts were acts of atonement his failures he accepted as a kind of punishment he craved a forgiveness he could never earn and he was horrified when the coryphaeus offered him that forgiveness accepting it would have dishonored the man turk had killed who was named orrin mather and the people of vox by submerging all such feelings in their closed limbic collectivity had made themselves monstrous in turks eyes allison was a different case she was a native of vox whose artificial persona had allowed her a rare glimpse beyond the boundaries and limitations of her life by adopting that persona as her own she had successfully liberated herself from the coryphaeus the liberation had come at the expense of her family her friends and her faith it was a bargain i understood very well i wanted these two people to survive that was why i abetted their escape even then i had doubted they could successfully cross the failing arch but i made it possible for them to live a little longer depending on how you measure time for more than a millennium the hypothetical machines had been scouring the surface of the earth dismantling and interpreting and remembering the ruins of the civilization we had built on the planet that gave us birth there was no conscious will behind this act of scavenging no thought no agency it was simply behavior that had evolved over time like photosynthesis the devices turk had confronted on the antarctic plain had accumulated a rich storehouse of data earths tangible resourcesrare elements that had been refined by human activity and concentrated in the wreckage of our citieshad already been extracted and transferred to orbit and beyond where the spacefaring elements of the hypothetical ecology had feasted on them the hypotheticals were very nearly finished with the earth but their sensors orbital arrays of devices no bigger than grains of dust complexly networked had detected vox as soon as it crossed the arch and directed groundbased scavengers toward it what the voxish prophecies had imagined as an apotheosis was just a moppingup exercise the last berry plucked from a barren dying bush the hypotheticals arrived not long after turk and allison had fled as a cloud of insectsized disassemblers they were sharptoothed and efficient they exuded complex catalysts that unzipped chemical bonds they came through the melting walls like smoke followed by the toxic external atmosphere gusts of poison blew down the corridors and walkways of vox core this was a mercy in a waymost of the citizens succumbed to asphyxiation before they could be devoured alive could i have saved them i hated the people of vox for compounding my suffering by resurrecting me but i wouldnt have wished such a fate on them in fact i did what i could to protect themwhich was nothing i was lucky to be able to save myself of course i was protected in the most basic sense like turk i had passed through the temporal arch for ten thousand years i had been a memory in the archival functions of the hypotheticals and they had recreated me in the equatorian desert because that was the business of the temporal arches to faithfully reconstruct certain informationdense structures so that the data they contained could be used to correct errors that might have crept into local systems it was a homeostatic mechanism nothing more the disassemblers wouldnt touch my body because i had been tagged as useful but that protection would be worthless if vox dissolved into its component molecules i needed to be able to exercise conscious control over what the machines were doing my best opportunity lay with the coryphaeus the processors that constituted the coryphaeus were heavily protected even the nuclear detonation that had brought down the network had not destroyed these devices only damaged their interface with the physical world the disassemblers would surely devour them but not until most of vox core had been pulled apart much of my consciousness was already embedded in these processors the same inhibitions that prevented the disassemblers from dismantling my body might extend to the coryphaeuss hardware or could be made toor so i hoped the network began to fail as the citizens of vox died in significant numbers and i exploited that terrible opportunity i used dormant processors to analyze the signaling protocols of the hypothetical machines i linked those protocols and signaling mechanisms into the deeply nested feedback cycles of the coryphaeus allowing me some measure of control and as vox was sterilized of human life the coryphaeus became a chorus of one i became the coryphaeus once i had decoded the procedural logic of the disassemblers it became possible to feed them false recognition signals they promptly abandoned the deconstruction of vox core i used subtler and more potent instructions to reduce them to dormancy they lost all organizing cohesion and fell from the air like dust but it was too late for the inhabitants and nearly too late for the upper levels of vox core which had been eroded to a skeletal framework of girders and fractured cladding i was able to reseal the inner portions of the city and repair the relatively minor damage to the engine decks using a combination of robotic devices and coopted disassembler flocks i allowed the disassemblers to dispose of all human remains leaving nothing half consumed by the time i restored the citys lights the corridors and tiers and plains of the city were as empty as if they had never been inhabited the aircirculation system eventually seined away any remaining dust but that wasnt all i could do i discovered as i waited for turk and allison to returnas i hoped they wouldi began to explore the newly porous borderland between the coryphaeus and the hypotheticals before long i was tapping into systems larger than the earth itself all hypothetical devices were interconnected in nested hierarchies that reached from tiny disassemblers to archival machine flocks in translunar orbit energymining mechanisms in the heliosphere of the sun signal transducers in the outer solar system transducers circling nearby stars all these i could now perceive and influence i devised filters to compress this flood of information into intelligible packets making the secrets of the hypotheticals small enough that i could contain them and making myself larger in the process my physical body began to seem redundant and i thought about allowing it to die but i would need it i thought to interact with turk and allison if and when they came back what they found here would be difficult for them to accept and what i planned to do next would be difficult to explain over the course of their multibillionyear evolution the hypotheticals had learned to exploit a capability they had never acquired for themselves agency agencythat is volitional action aimed at achieving conscious endshad arisen only sporadically in the galaxy mostly in the climax ecologies of biologically active planets orbiting hospitable stars species capable of agency seldom lasted longer than it took them to overload and overwhelm their planetary ecologies they were as the stars measure time an unstable and ephemeral phenomenon but it was just such a species that had created the selfreproducing machines that were the first progenitors of the hypotheticals and these blooms of organic sentience were unfailingly useful they generated unusual information they concentrated valuable resources in their ruins often they launched new waves of replicators which could be harvested or absorbed into larger networks in time the hypotheticals began to actively cultivate organic civilizations there was no agency in this only a blind acquisitiveness the hypotheticals evolved in ways that maximized their exploitation of sentient organisms early in the history of the galaxy an organic civilization had constructed twin arches in order to colonize the marginally habitable planet of a neighboring starthe species suffered decline and extinction soon after but its technology was analyzed and adopted by the hypotheticals in the same way the hypotheticals had learned to extract energy from stellar cores and gravity gradients to manipulate atomic and molecular bonds to order and stabilize the exchange of information over distances of hundreds of light years eventually the hypotheticals had developed a means of extending the useful life of such species if a fecund mother planet was suspended inside a temporal distortion while a system of arches was put in placeas the earth had been suspended during the spinthat planets resource base could be expanded tenfold its organic civilization would spill into new worlds and flourish on them cycling through epochs of decline and expansion reliably generating new and exploitable technologies such organic species remained mortal and eventually died of course all biological species did but the harvest of ruins increased exponentially allison and turk arrived at vox core in the storms that followed the collapse of the arch and the dismantling of the systems that had for so many years protected earth from its ancient dying sun i welcomed them back and explained what had happened i told them i could defend them even from the destruction of this superannuated planeti had grown that powerful and in a very short span of time but they were shocked by the deaths that had taken place for days they wandered the empty corridors of the city the rooms they once shared had been carved away in the initial attack of the disassemblers they could have chosen any of tens of thousands of abandoned suites and rooms in which to make a home but allison told me she was unnerved by everything the dead had left behind them the unsorted possessions the place settings abandoned on tables the nurseries without children the city was full of ghosts she said so i built them a new residence in a forested tier deep to starboard using the citys fleet of robotic constructors i chose a location far from the public corridors accessible by footpath the tiers artificial sunlight was bright and convincing its ambient temperature consistently pleasant its average humidity low the recycling system stirred up gentle breezes every morning and evening and rain fell every fifth day they agreed to live there until they found a better home i believed there might be a better home for them though not on vox and certainly not on earth but most of my attention was occupied with the business of keeping vox core intact in an increasingly harsh environment at the equator of the earth the oceans had begun to boil cyclonic winds scoured the lifeless continents and the atmosphere grew thick with superheated water vapor monstrous surge tides threatened to force what remained of vox into the rocky antarctic shelf and it would only get worse i needed to manipulate very powerful hypothetical technology which meant extending and elaborating my control of it i was able to call down from orbit a small fleet of nanoscale devicesversions of the disassemblers that had first swarmed usto encase and protect vox core scalding waves crashed over the rocky part of the island and broke against the citys jagged towers but the city itself remained stable temperate and undisturbed preserving this equilibrium required gigajoules of energy drawn directly from the heart of the sun it was still little more than a stopgap before long we would need to leave the planet altogether i believed i could accomplish that though it would necessitate an even greater disconnection between my mortal body and my mind often during this time walking through the passageways of vox core i was startled by the sight of my reflection in a glassy surfaceby the reminder that i was still a collation of blood and bone and tissue bearing the scars of my forcible reconstruction and the subtler scars of less visible injuries my father had made me what i was because he had believed in the power of the hypotheticals to liberate humanity from death the voxish religion had fostered a similar belief a programmed limbic rebellion against the tyranny of the grave and now the stone had rolled away revealing only the weakling prophet of a mindless god how disappointed my father would have been i can control the passage of time i told turk and allison locally i mean although they were my friends they were afraid of me and of what i was becoming i didnt blame them for that i had come to visit them in their home in the forest the house i had built for them was as pleasant as i had planned it to be the trees beyond the windows were tall and graceful the air that whispered through the portcullis smelled of living things they asked me to sit down at their table allison offered me fruit from a bowl and turk poured me a glass of water i was too thin allison said it was true that lately i had been forgetting to eat i told them about the world outside the bloated sun was scouring away the earths atmosphere before long the crust of the planet itself would begin to melt and vox would be afloat on a sea of molten magma but you can keep us alive turk said repeating what i had told him weeks ago right i believe i can but i dont see the point in staying here where is there to go the solar system wasnt entirely inhospitable despite the swollen sun the jovian and saturnian moons were relatively warm and stable vox could have sailed indefinitely on the bluegray seas of europa for instance under an atmosphere no more toxic than earths mars allison said suddenly if youre serious i mean if we can really travel between planetstheres an arch on mars no not anymore the hypotheticals had protected mars as long as there was a human presence there but the last native martians had died centuries ago and their ruins had been thoroughly scavenged in recent decades the arch had been allowed to decay and collapse i extracted this knowledge from the hypotheticals pool of data which had become my second memory mars was a closed door but youre saying vox core can function as a kind of spaceship allison persisted how far can it go how fast it can go almost any distance but only at a very small fraction of the speed of light she didnt have to explain what she was thinking the planets that comprised the ring of worlds were linked by arches but separated by vast physical distances some of these distances had been calculated by astronomers even in turks time the nearest human world was more than a hundred lightyears from earth reaching it would take several lifetimes but i can modify the passage of time so that it would seem like much less a few hundred days subjectively but it wont be the same ring of worlds when we get there allison said no thousands of years will have passed its impossible to predict what you might find she looked out at the forest beams of artificial sunlight raked through the trees like bright vague fingers the tiers high ceiling was the color of cobalt no birds or insects lived here there was no sound but the rustling of leaves after a while she turned back to turk he nodded once all right she said take us home i let my physical body sleep while i defined a sphere to contain vox core and part of the island beneath it that sphere constituted our border with the exterior universe spacetime curved around us in a complex new geometry vox core soared away from the dying earth as if it had been fired from a gun though we didnt feel it i further modified the local curvature of space to create the illusion of gravity after a few hours we had passed beyond the orbits of uranus and neptune turk and allison had expressed curiosity about the journey i would have liked to show them where we wereshow them directly i mean without mediationbut it was impossible to look at the exterior universe from inside voxto human eyes it would have appeared as a literally blinding cascade of blueshifted energy even the longest electromagnetic waves compressed to lethal potency but i could sample that cascade at intervals and downshift it to visible wavelengths to create a series of representative images i compiled these images and displayed them to allison and turk in their forest home the result was spectacular but not soothing the sun was a sullen ember against the darkness of space the earth already invisible at the edge of the heliosphere stars rolled past as vox core slowly rotateda remnant motion i hadnt bothered to correct lonesome allison remarked in a small voice to an outside observer we would have looked like something paradoxical an event horizon without a black hole a lightless bubble from which nothing escaped but a few wisps of radiation in fact the barrier that enclosed us was more complex than any natural event horizon there were no words in any human vocabulary to describe how it functioned though i told turk when he asked that it was both a barrier and a conduit through it i maintained my contact with the hypotheticals and as we counted years for seconds i began to feel the long rhythms of the galactic ecologythe voids of abandoned or dying stars the bright world rings only one of which was the familiar human one thriving under hypothetical cultivation the intense activity that surrounded newly formed stars and emerging biologically active planets but there was no soul or agency in any of this only the mindless pulse of replication and selection unspeakably beautiful but as empty as a desert the ecology of the hypotheticals would churn on inexorably until it had depleted every heavy element exhausted every source of energy within its reach when the last star blinked into darkness the hypothetical machines would mine the gravity wells of ancient singularities when those singularities evaporated and the universe grew dark and blank well then i supposed the hypotheticals would die too and unlike human beings they would die without complaint no one would mourn them and nothing would inherit the ruins they left behind it became ever more difficult to remember to tend to the needs of my organic body i lived in the quantum processors at the heart of vox core and increasingly i lived in the cloud of hypothetical devices that surrounded and followed us as we fell between the stars i allowed myself to wonder what would happen when turk and allison eventually left me where i would go what i would become allison had preserved or perhaps inherited her namesakes penchant for writing i discovered she was setting down a narrative of everything she had experienced between the equatorian desert and the holocaust of the vox archipelago the words painstakingly handprinted on crisp white paper when i asked her who she was writing it for she shrugged i dont know myself i guess or maybe its more like a message in a bottle and wasnt that what vox core had become a bottle adrift and far from shore its glass baked green by sun and starlight bearing messages of bone and blood i encouraged her to keep writing and i memorized each page she showed me that is i committed it to every repository of memory available to me not just my mortal brain but the processors of the coryphaeus and the archival clouds of the hypothetical entities surrounding us one day these words might be all that remained of her i suggested to turk that he might write his own story but he didnt see the point of it so i settled for conversation we talked often for hours whenever i sent my mortal body to visit their forest home i knew everything the coryphaeus had once known about him including what turk had said to oscar about the man he had killed and he was able to speak freely i made it my business to learn about orrin mather he said he was born with some kind of brain damage he lived most of his life with an older sister in north carolina he got into a lot of fights drank some eventually left home and made his way west he held up a few stores when he ran out of cash and put a man in the hospital once he wasnt a saintfar from it but i didnt know any of that when i did what i did really he was just somebody who got dealt a bad hand at birth other circumstances he might have been something else which was true of all of us of course i told turk that if he wrote down what he remembered about orrin mather and vox core i would keep the words safe along with allisons as long as vox and the hypothetical ecology survived you think thatll make any kind of difference not to anyone but us turk said he would think it over these people allison and turk were my friends they were the only real friends i had ever had and i was sorry i would have to leave them i wanted something of theirs to carry with me the hypothetical ecology was a forest lush and mindless but that didnt mean it was uninhabited you might say it was haunted i had had hints of this before i wasnt the first human being to access the memory of the hypotheticals though my case was certainly unique the martians had attempted such connections sporadically in the years before the bionormative movement suppressed all such experiments the first human being on earth to make the link was jason lawton he had survived his own death by colonizing the computation space of the hypotheticalsstill survived there perhaps but his capacity to act his agency had been very limited it occurs to me that this is almost the definition of a ghost and many of the nonhuman civilizations that had come before us had found their own ways into the forest they remained there still long after their physical civilizations had declined and vanished they were difficult for me to detect since their activity was disguised to prevent the hypothetical host networks from identifying and deleting them they existed as clusters of operative informationvirtual worldsrunning inside the datagathering protocols of the galactic ecosystem i sensed their presence but could discern little else about them the content of these clusters was fractally distributed and impenetrably complex but there was genuine agency therenot just consciousness but deliberative action that affected external systems so i was not alonethough these alien virtualities were so well defended that i couldnt contrive a way to contact them and so ancient and inhuman that i probably wouldnt have understood anything they might have had to say most of a year had passed since our initial conversation when turk handed me without comment a sheaf of papers on which he had written the history of his experiences in vox core my name is turk findley it began and this is the story of the life i lived long after everything i knew and loved was dead and gone i thanked him gravely and said nothing further about it we were approaching one of the stars that hosted a planet in the ring of worlds i decelerated vox core dumping kinetic energy into this new systems energy mines thus raising the temperature of its sun by some imperceptible fraction of a degree and began to ramp down the time differential between vox and the external universe as we passed the orbit of the stars outermost planet i showed turk and allison an image i had captured the host star just beginning to show a discernible disc seen past the rim of a cold gas giant orbiting far outside the habitable zone deep in this stellar system but still too far away to be visible as anything but a pinprick of reflected light was the planet its human occupants called or had once called cloud harbor in a dozen languages none of them english it was a watery world laced with island chains where the tectonic plates of the planets mantle ground against one another it had once hosted a benign and relatively peaceful human society occupying both the available dry land and a number of artificial archipelagos most of cloud harbors polities had been cortical democracies with a few settlements of radically bionormative martians but thousands of years had passed since then we had to assume that any or all of this might have changed allison asked me in a small voice whether i could tell anything about the planet as it was now in fact i had been trolling for stray signals there had been none or none that i could identify but that might only mean that the resident civilization had adopted highly lossless modes of communication certainly the hypotheticals were still active here the icy planetesimals in the far reaches of the system swarmed with busily breeding machine entities i was with allison and turk as the time differential between vox core and the external environment counted down to i had created a viewscreen which filled an entire wall of the largest room of their homein effect a window to the world beyond vox it had been blank suddenly it filled with stars cloud harbor swam into view an amplified image we were still lightminutes away its beautiful allison said she had never seen a world like this from spacethe people of vox had never been very interested in space travel but cloud harbor would have been beautiful even to a jaded eye it was a swirled crescent of cobalt and turquoise its icy white moon standing half a degree off the sunlit horizon a lot like the way earth used to be turk said he looked at me for a response when i didnt speak he said isaac are you all right but i couldnt answer no i wasnt all right my body was numb my mind was full of inexplicable lights and motion i tried to stand and toppled over before my senses faded i heard the wail of a distant sirenit was the old autonomic defense system built into the citys deep infrastructure warning of an invasion i couldnt see the people of cloud harbor had seen us coming the warped spacetime around our temporal bubble bleeding energy as it decelerated into the system had broadcast easily detected bursts of cherenkov radiation so they had come to meet us they thought we might be hostile they knew we werent an ordinary hypothetical machinethey had learned a great deal about the nature of the hypotheticals in the centuries since vox left earth as soon as we dropped our temporal barrier they isolated vox core from local energy sources and infiltrated our processors with finely tuned suppressor protocols the effect was that the coryphaeus went to sleep and since much of my awareness was embedded in the coryphaeus i promptly lost consciousness i was eventually able to reconstruct what followed spacecraft with human passengers swarmed through the disabled barriers and docked with vox core unopposed they entered the city and tracked down turk and allison who were able to explainonce linguistic difficulties had been sorted outwho they were and where they were from they insisted that i was not dangerous and demanded that i be released from what amounted to an induced coma the troops of cloud harbor declined to do that until they were certain i was harmless it was an inauspicious meeting but by the time i came to myself again it had become a more or less friendly one i woke in my mortal body in a comfortable bed in a medical suite in vox core my mental functions had been fully restored a woman who claimed to represent the combined polities of cloud harbor entered the room introduced herself and apologized for the way i had been treated she was tall and darkskinned her eyes were large and widely set i asked her about turk and allison theyre waiting outside she said they want to see you theyve come a long way looking for a home do you have one to offer them she smiled i believe we can make them welcome if youre curious about our world ive made public records from every polity available to your external memory judge for yourself what kind of people we are i accessed the records in an eyeblink and was reasonably satisfied though i didnt tell her so she said youve come a great distance yourself isaac dvali we can make a place for you too thank you i said but no she frowned youre a unique individual too unique to leave this city i repeated what she already knew that i shared too much of my consciousness with the processors of the coryphaeus to allow me to leavemy body would be little more than a drooling piece of meat if it was extracted from vox core we can address that problem she said confidently humanity had learned a few things about the nature of the hypotheticals she explained the polities of cloud harbor had already begun to establish virtual colonies inside the computational space of the local hypothetical networks colonists were generally the elderly and infirm who were eager to leave their physical bodies behindi could do the same she said im happy enough here alone alone yes do you understand what youre sentencing yourself to solitary confinementfor eternity or until your sense of self erodes and becomes chaotic i can take precautions against that i could tell she didnt believe me what do you mean to do then tumble through the galaxy until the end of time like a bottle on the sea long ago i said my father owned a library of books one of the authors i read there was a man named rabelais when he learned he was dying rabelais said je men vais chercher un grand peutêtre it means i go to seek a great perhaps but all he found was death i smiled peutêtre she smiled in return though i think she felt sorry for me i said goodbye to allison and turk allison begged me to take up the offer the ambassador had made and stay here embodied or not she wept when i refused but i was adamant i didnt want another incarnation i hadnt sought or wanted this one turk stayed a while after allison left the room he said i sometimes wonder whether something singled us out for all thisfor everything that happened to us it all seems so strange doesnt it not like other peoples lives not much like i agreed but i didnt think we had been singled out it all could have happened countless other ways theres nothing special about us you think youll find something at the end of it something that makes it all make sense i dont know peutêtre we all fall we all land somewhere you have a long trip ahead of you it wont seem long to me im traveling light you carry what you carry turk findley said i enclosed the city in its bubble of slowtime and borrowed sunlight for acceleration vox core soared beyond the orbit of the systems outermost planet out into the interstellar vacuum and far from cloud harbor from my vantage point this took only a moment the citys clocks ticked seconds for centuries i had no destination occasional brushes with massive stars skewed my trajectory in unpredictable vectors a drunkards walk through the galaxy apart from avoiding obstacles i did nothing to intervene in the physical body of isaac dvali i often wandered the tiers and passageways of vox core the city persisted in its daily rhythms regulating its atmosphere tending its empty parks and gardens on these walks i occasionally passed robotic maintenance machines as they rolled down public passageways steel monks hurrying to their matins they resembled people but they lacked moral agency and i resisted the unreasonable urge to speak to them it was a pointless anachronism to preserve the cycle of day and night but my mortal body preferred it days i basked in artificial sunlight evenings i read ancient books reproduced from the voxish archives or reread the memoirs turk and allison had left me nights while my body slept i expanded my sense of self to include all of vox core i modeled the aging galaxy and my place in it i tapped trickles of information from the ever more complex skein of the hypothetical ecology stars that had been young only moments ago exhausted their nuclear fuel and decayed into simmering embers brown dwarfs neutron stars singularities in their bottomless graves compared to the passage of time in the exterior universe my consciousness was vast and slow this would have been the true viewpoint of the hypotheticals i imagined had the hypotheticals possessed a unitary consciousness signals propagating at the speed of light passed between stars as quickly as one neuron communicated with the next in isaac dvalis mortal brain i began to become aware of the galaxy as a whole form not just a collation of stellar oases separated by lightyears of emptiness hypothetical networks ran through it like fungal hyphae through a rotten tree in my night vision i saw this activity as threads of multicolored light revealing a complex and otherwise invisible galactic structure thriving worldrings stood out like the closed chains of carbon atoms in an organic molecule ancient dead rings shimmered like pale ghosts as the hypothetical machines associated with them died for lack of resources or scattered to nearby stellar nurseries the living galaxy pulsed with exhaustion and renewal new technologies and energy sources were discovered exploited shared and as the universe aged and expanded other galaxies already immensely distant fled toward the limits of perceptibility but even these faint far structures had begun to reveal a hidden life of their own emissions of stray signals suggesting they had evolved their own hypotheticallike networks they sang like unintelligible voices in the darkness fading it was inevitable that i would have to abandon my mortal body and live exclusively in the processors of the coryphaeus and in the cloud of hypothetical nanotechnology surrounding vox core but i still wanted to be able to move about the city in a physical way soas i allowed the body of isaac dvali to lie in a selfinduced coma dying of starvationi fashioned a more durable substitute a robotic body equipped with equivalent senses in which i could instantiate my consciousness when this project was complete i gathered the remains of my organic self in my inorganic arms and carried the corpse to a recycling station feeding its useful proteins into the closed biochemical loops of vox core i felt no remorse or grief and why should i i was what i had become the fragile meat in which the message of myself had first traveled to the stars the old somatic galaxy in its border of skin i gladly fed to the citys forests vox core wasnt an entirely selfsufficient system i was forced to harvest trace elements from stellar nebulae in order to replenish what couldnt be recycled of course in the long run vox core was as mortal as all baryonic matter even inside its temporal fortress it was only a question of time i courted the end of all things vox core fell into a long elliptical orbit of the galactic core i began to divide my awareness into saccades moments of perception separated by long periods of inactivity so that experiential time passed more quickly even inside the temporal bubble surrounding vox core entropyin the form of broken chemical bonds irreparable system failures radioactive decaygnawed at the citys vitals blight and drought decimated the forests and rubble began to obstruct the public walkways maintenance robots expired for lack of maintenance atmospheric regulatorsthe citys lungsgasped and finally failed the air of vox core would have been toxic had there been anyone alive to breathe it the quantum processors of the coryphaeus continued to function protected by multiple redundancies but that too was only temporary the universe grew colder the galaxys stellar nurseries the concentrations of dust and gas that gave birth to stars had grown too thin to be fecund old stars guttered and died and were not replaced the hypothetical ecology retreated from this encroaching darkness to the galaxys dense core harvesting the gravitational gradients of massive dark holes for energy and something else happened to the hypothetical ecology as it sheltered in the galaxys stillbeating heart its informationprocessing mechanisms were coopted and dominated by sentient species seeking to outlive their organic mortality these rogue virtualities grew encountered one another and in some cases merged the human species was the source of one such sentient bloom though its virtual descendents could hardly be called human in the classic sense pools of postmortal sentience began to cooperate in a collective decisionmaking processa kind of cortical democracy on a scale of lightyears the dying galaxy began to generate unitary thought none of these thoughts could be rendered in conventional language though my larger self understood them at least approximately i took a last walk in my robotic body through the ruins of vox core its towers fractured and askew its vast tiers dark or tremblingly halflit vox had sailed the seas of several worlds and was sailing now on the largest sea of all but soon i would have to abandon it i had already begun relocating my memories and identity to the cloud of hypothetical nanodevices which was linked in turn to the remaining hypothetical networks all powered by the dynamos of ancient singularities and even that last redoubt of order and meaning was doomed soon enough the same phantom energy that had inflated the universe would unravel matter itself leaving nothing but a dust of unbound subatomic particles then i thought the darkness would be absolute and i could sleep but for now vox core sailed on vacuum invaded its faltering defenses empty it succumbed to emptiness in the absence of induced gravity its contents began to spill through breached walls into space beyond it outside of it my somatic boundaries expanded disconcertingly the hypothetical network grew denser and more complex as its virtual polities applied immense calculating power to the problem of survival gravitational anomalies suggested the existence of megastructures larger than the event horizon of the universe itselfshallow gradients of ghostly energy that might serve as a medium to carry organized intelligence out of the entropic desert but how and at what cost i didnt participate in these debates my own consciousness though now totally incorporeal was too limited to fully comprehend them in any case the arguments could never have been rendered in wordsthe preamble to a single thought would have required thousands of volumes a legion of interpreters a vocabulary that had never existed the threedimensional macrostructure of the universe began its ultimate collapse collapsing it revealed new horizons hidden dimensions of spacetime unfurled as new particles and forces crystallized from quantum foam the ultimate darkness i had hoped for never arrived the entity that had been the hypothetical networkto which i was inextricably boundexpanded suddenly and exponentially but i cant describe the realm we entered we were forced to invent new senses to perceive it new modes of thought to comprehend it we emerged into a vast fractal space of many dimensions and discovered we were not alone there multidimensional structures hosted entities that had subsumed the fourdimensional spacetime that once contained us as old as we were these entities were older as large as we had become they were larger we passed among them unnoticed or ignored from this new point of view the universe i had inhabited became an object i could perceive in its entirety it was a hypersphere embedded in a cloud of alternative statesthe sum of all possible quantum trajectories from the big bang to the decay of matter realityhistory as we had known or inferred itwas only the most likely of these possible trajectories there were countless others real in a different sense a vast but finite set of paths not taken a ghostly forest of quantum alternatives the shores of an unknown sea putting a message in a bottle and setting it adrift is a quixotic act sublimely human what would you write if you wanted to write such a message an equation a confession a poem this is my confession this is my poem deep in that cloud of unlived histories were unlived lives infinitesimally small buried in eons of time and lightcenturies of space unreal only because they had never been enacted or observed i understood that it was within my power to touch them and thus to realize them what followed if i made such an intervention would be a new and unpredictable tributary of time not obliterating the old history but lying alongside it the price would be my own awareness i could never enter that fourdimensional spacetime any intervention i made would create a new history from that point forward at the expense of my continued existence what is inevitable is not death but change change is the only abiding reality the metaverse evolves fractally and forever saints become sinners sinners become saints dust becomes men men become gods gods become dust i wished i could say these things to turk findley i could have intervened in my own potential history but i felt no urge or need to do so i wanted my last act to be a gift even if i couldnt calculate its ultimate consequences deep in the mirrored corridor of unenacted events in a motel room on the outskirts of raleigh north carolina a woman performs a sexual act in exchange for a brown plastic vial containing what she believes to be a gram of methamphetamine her partner is an unemployed pneumatic drill operator on his way to california where he has been offered a job in his cousins construction business he doesnt wear a condom when he penetrates the woman and he drives away shortly after the act is consummated the taste of meth he gave her when he rented the room was authentic but the vial he leaves on the dresser contains only powdered sugar orrin mathers existence is compromised from the moment of his inglorious conception his anorexic mother delivers him prematurely his infant body suffers the agonies of drug withdrawal he survives but his mothers malnutrition and multiple addictions have taken a toll orrin will never be able to make and enact plans as easily as others do he will often be surprisedusually unpleasantlyby the consequences of his actions i cannot make him a more perfect human being that isnt within my power all i can give him are words and by writing these words into the cerebellum of a child i dissolve myself and make a shadow world real he lies sleeping on a mattress on the floor of a rented trailer home his sister ariel sits on a plastic chair a few feet away eating cereal without milk from a chipped bowl watching television with the sound turned down orrin dreams he is walking on a beach though he has only seen beaches in movies in his dream he sees something rolling in the surfa bottle its green glass faded by years of sunlight and salt water he picks it up the bottle is tightly sealed but it opens somehow at his touch papers tumble out and unfold themselves in his hand orrin hasnt yet learned to read but magically he can read these words he reads them all page after page what he reads here he will never forget my name is turk findley he reads and my name is allison pearl and my name is isaac dvali my name is isaac dvali and i cant write this anymore my name is orrin mather thats what my name is my name is orrin mather and i work in a greenhouse in laramie wyoming in the greenhouse at this nursery where i work there are paths between the plants and the seedling tables thats so you can get from one place to another also so you can work on the plants without stepping on them those paths all connect with one another you can go this way or you can go that it all has the same beginning and the same ending though you can only ever stand in one place at once i believe i was born with these dreams or memories about turk findley and allison pearl and isaac dvali they troubled me much when i was younger they came to me like visions they blew through me like a wind as my sister ariel liked to say thats why i went to houston on the bus so suddenly thats why i wrote down my dreams in my notebooks things in houston didnt happen the way i expected as you know dr cole and i expect youll be the only one to read these pages unless you show them to officer bose which is all right with me if you do so i suppose i took a different path from how i dreamed it i never robbed any stores for instance i guess i could have god knows i was hungry and angry enough from time to time but whenever i felt like hurting someone i thought about turk findley and the burning man which was me and how terrible it would be to carry around the weight of another mans death i work in the greenhouse mainly at night but they keep the big lights on all the time its like a house where its always noon on a sunny day i like the wetness in the air and the smell of growing things even the sharp smell of the chemical fertilizer do you remember those flowers outside my room at state care dr cole bird of paradise you said they were called they look like one thing but theyre really another but they didnt choose to look like that theyre just what time and nature made of them we dont grow that kind of flower in the greenhouse where i work but i remember how pretty they were they really do look like birds dont they i dont believe i will write to you again dr cole please dont take that the wrong way its only that i want to put these troublesome things behind me the people officer bose introduced me to have been real kind they found me this job and a place for ariel and me to live they are good people even if what they do is outside of the law they are not criminals exactly they just think they can invent a better way of living maybe they will succeed at their work if they do then maybe the world wont turn barren and poisonous like in the dreams i wrote down i hope that is the case i dont know of course but you can trust these people dr cole and i know you trust officer bose he helped me when he didnt have to hes a good man i believe i thank him and i thank you for the same reason well that is all i have to say i have to go to work pretty soon dont expect to hear from me again ariel sends her kind regards and asks me to tell you that houston is too damn hot orrin mather laramie wyoming acknowledgments this book couldnt have been written without the help and patience of friends and family members too numerous to mention needless to say i thank them all thanks also to glenn harper who generously answered a technical question about the relative size of a human being visàvis the planck length and the limits of the observable universethe answer didnt make it into the final text of vortex at least not explicitly but it helped clarify my thinking about the nature of the hypotheticals and their intervention in human history on the subject of oceanic eutrophication and the fate of the earth i drew on under a green sky and the medea hypothesis by the reliably pessimistic peter ward and i commend both books to the attention of curious readers this is a work of fiction all of the characters organizations and events portrayed in this novel are either products of the authors imagination or are used fictitiously vortex copyright by robert charles wilson all rights reserved edited by teresa nielsen hayden a
