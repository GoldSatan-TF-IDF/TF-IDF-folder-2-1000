a concise retelling of the life of god edgar million a concise retelling of the life of god published by edgar million at smashwords copyright edgar million mahatma gandhi i like your christ i do not like your christians your christians are so unlike your christ before the beginning god was lonely hed searched his universe so many times extending his tendrils outwards through the space to try to find another being to share his glory with but all he found was nothing a formless soup of atoms all he found was noone he knew this he knew he was alone but still the raw longing clawed at him and again so again he searched infinite endless nothing which he or it or she had been burdened with since forever even though at this point time did not yet exist so there was no such thing as forever how could this be god owned this universe ruled it he was able to manipulate and adapt everything he touched to create and shape the atoms about him but what use was this skill he thought without another to share it with such questions plagued him where did he come from why was he alone what was the point of it all he had tried to make another like him to shape to mould the atoms into another being but each time he tried he was left with lifeless mannequins no more capable of existence than a lump of rock the failures lay discarded across the universe floating in the dead soup of existence god wanted no more of it he decided the empty broken longing which could be borne no longer so rather than stretching out across the endless space searching and exploring he contracted pulling the formless soup of the universe into him in an effort to feel full but became increasingly empty a single tiny point at the centre of a now empty universe a spot which grew infinitely dense this universe could have been beautiful but with no one to share it god wept wanted to die enough he said to the darkness let it end the single point which was god burned and boiled time did not exist here but if it had then this boiling might have taken a billion billion years to ferment the result as the universe shrank into him was refined agony a creeping death he longed for release contracted further as the universe inside him ripped open and exploded he waited for death to take him then wondered for a moment if it would have a face was there something after this but death did not come and god screamed in agony as the exploding universe torched his empty soul alone still but now in agony deep physical and emotional pain which clawed at god for a billion years a billion years what was this this was something new time passed in agony but still time passed gods psyche reformed then gazed upon at the new universe which had been borne out of her agony before there had been no before no after not even a now god sensed in this place something different rules changed laws created cause had effect after had a before god herself continued to occupy the smallest place balled up like a child fearful of yet another beating so when she looked upon into the face of child she was stunned the pain subsided she looked upon the new universe shed created then she saw it was good for another billion years she watched this new amazing thing her child filled with colour and light heat and substance she thrilled with amazement rather than the even spread of atoms and chemicals formless all amounting to nothing her explosion gave everything new form indeed it allowed her form and she looked upon the world anew she swam through her newly created paradise and gazed in wonder one day she experienced a wash of atoms by diving through a star then once again she stretched out to experience the universe to touch the universe she had created stars planets shed taught atoms to bond to one another now she wondered if somewhere in this endless universe was there a being who she could bond to because god was still lonely god was still alone she spent an age watching a star form and die then transform into a black hole sucking light out of the universe then once it was finished she dove into it in the way we might dive into the sea again being reduced into a fine perfect point before being spat out the other side it was glorious this new place and she stretched herself out to examine every molecule she gazed out across the universe and again searched for another like her stretching out into boiling oceans and peering inside atoms in every molecule of this glorious new place but finding noone this universe is beautiful but she remains alone except there is a thing right at the edge of the universe something different a watery globe hovered at the edge of the universe then she realised there was something new there in the boiling oceans of this world tiny miniscule creatures floated in an almost planet wide ocean almost not there but as she focused her gaze upon them she discovered they were legion entwining reproducing and duplicating themselves and they were alive the first living creatures she has ever encountered she swims in their ocean there are millions billions trillions of them shes not sure how many and spends nearly a million years trying to count them yet they are so small so insignificant she keeps losing count and when she does she laughs for the first time she laughs for a million years she could not stop guffawing and giggling in delight at the unexpected multitudes she had wrought she sits upon a rocky beach then watches the toandthrough of the ebullient oceans in which they lived these creatures these alive creatures they made her feel less alone but only just they are not her equal but they do not seem to know she is there but the presence of them warms her the land of this planet is stony dead an enormous island wedged into a neverending sea filled with these simple creatures as she gazed at the fecund ocean there was a new development a new shape which had appeared in the ocean where did that come from the beings not much more than atoms themselves were changed adding a new part to themselves a part which would later be called a nucleus god thrilled at this new change and in the knowledge these things can be altered she lifted her forefinger and prodded her globe encouraging greater diversity demanding a creature who is her equal but to no end these things are still not much more than atoms yet they were alive in the whole of the universe only these creatures were alive and god resolved to treasure them to nurture them watching as her prod begat an amazing change over the space of another billion years no more than a day to her she watched them change and change and change becoming more complex more sophisticated and now as she continued to swim in the seas it was with an absurd variety of new creatures these creatures were so much more fully aware of her presence who would swim to her and even taste her god allowed herself to be eaten and digested by a blue whale before reforming in the ocean a billion more years passed seas churned and pressed upon her beach then god looks upon her world and sees it is good she is filled with love for all her creatures then it happens beautiful misshapen beasts begin to crawl from the sea and lie stretched out upon the land she marvels as they writhe then stagger out of their oceans once shed tried to count all the individual being in her ocean and failed now she sets herself a simpler task to count all the different types of creatures on this earth then again she falls to her knees laughing in her failure to keep track yet now a new thought occurs as she gazes up from her creation into the sky at all her galaxies has she missed anything are there even now new pools of existence opening up in her universe which she has overlooked again she stretched out reaching off spending another billion years examining every rock and star and black hole before finally returning her gaze back to terra the only place in the empty universe where life is lived she stands upon her beach once more a salty breeze pushing the hair back from her face it has been so long since she stood here she has travelled the universe in search of any others looked in every rock and star and black hole but now she returns to them everywhere else is empty her vast universe is beautiful full of glory but empty of life only here on terra is life lived and again as she returns she discovers the world again transformed the handful of creatures have now been replaced by a billion this world is so full and when she takes corporeal form they acknowledge her they see her with some this acknowledgment takes the form of attack seeing her as food she has never needed to eat but these creatures all grown out of one diverse seed they all need to consume and they all need to lay with other beasts to make more of themselves she lay with a beast and they made more of themselves and god loved the little creatures but they were never her equal her favourite creatures were the monkeys furry and mobile fast witted and social fast to anger and fast to love to love these beasts long for one another flock together so god takes their forms and shares in their pastimes god can take any form sometimes she lives as a dolphin blazing through the sea other times a bird soaring through the sky but it is the companionship of these apes to which she continually returns one of them but not one of them and it is from them she learns the gift of language the knack of using sounds to describe not just the now but the tomorrow the yesterday so it is with their words she begins to describe her yesterdays they dont understand but she returns to them then tries to help them comprehend the gorgeousness of being alive of existing at all although their existences are unavoidably short they are so fortunate to be here at all on their single island which transforms into many massive land masses swarming with life and other smaller islands lone stepping stones in the sea she could play with them forever but they do not see her they do not hear her then one day they have a name for themselves a word human sometimes god walks among them as a man other times as a woman she loves them but although they are dazzled by her they dont really listen to her they halfhear as she tries to guide them and even then only absorb the fragments which best suit themselves when she pleads with them not to kill they think she is saying to them dont kill your brother or dont kill your tribe member when she tells them not to cause hurt in lives too short to bear such agony they hear her telling them to protect their own kind their own lands to defend their castles from the warriors massing outside the walls so they invent false gods capricious and tailored to their feed their base needs and desires paper thin gods who serve only as mechanisms for abuse and control they are not good at listening these talking beasts they are terrible yet sometimes singing a song about kissing a girl by a gasworks wall or painting a vision of crow filled skies they are beautiful what on earth are these creatures who mass and rampage across her planet selfishly raping and stripping the world of all goodness but have the capacity to fly a spaceship to the moon they possess the capacity to stand so tall yet pour this creativity into the manufacture of myriad tools and machines with which to end the already brief lives of their brothers they have axes then knives then guns then they have bombs some of which can kill hundreds or thousands in a single explosion yet under the dust blackened sky of a battlefield a man writes a poem about love these beautiful beasts they could fill her universe with themselves they could grow so tall yet she wonders would this be a good thing god sits upon the grey wing of an airplane a silvery giant with the words enola gay painted upon its tip flying over lush green lands shes been drawn here by a premonition although she cannot believe it is true she is perched waiting to see if it will come to pass the bomb falls to the ground into a paper thin city and rips it apart a million beasts dead in a moment burning as bright as one of her stars in the name of peace they slaughter and she realises like the parent of an errant child she loves them but no longer likes them they might seem to have seen her but they couldnt she was too big for them they and their lives were too small too petty and empty no bigger than those first prokaryotes which had so delighted her in the beginning she may have made them but they turned from her and seeing the pyre they have built of themselves she turns from them also turns her back to them let them burn they cannot see her they cannot hear her so she balls herself up in the corner of an apartment in manhattan and waits for them to pass like the dinosaurs passed sometimes she hears cracks and explosions in the street screams reach her elevated nest the man in the next apartment howls at his wife in anger forcing her and his children to crawl about their apartment on her knees whilst their infant child watches from his high chair weeping she met the man in the hallway last night and she tried to speak to him tried to help him to guide him but he could not hear her so she returned to her room to wait for them all to go outside her room the world ignites i see you she hears the voice and wonders who is talking to her there is no one there no one can see her the skies above manhattan are black with drones launching missiles into each other above the remaining remnants of the city the city is melting in a manmade hellfire gods lone tower standing at the heart of the island protected by her will but she sees the storm which will blow it away like a farmer refreshing his field she prays life will mass new and extraordinary from the ashes but these beasts are so destructive wars continue to bleach the surface of the globe then the humans continue to battle often in her name flinging their brief lives into the void as though they were coins in a slot machine but again she thinks there is something new somewhere under the clatter of guns she hears a new voice whispering amongst the gravestones the people flee the city but there is nowhere to flee to then one day the last human stands upon the bank of the hudson and gazes in wonder at the last remaining building in the world there and not there a shadow building then the last human is no more i hear you the voice again it possesses a similar timbre to her own neither male nor female and it takes sometime before she can pin it down where is it coming from she can taste the voice it is there in the air in what the humans call radio waves and wifi and in what machines still survive alive still in the satellites which have silently sat above the carnage below i see you i know you to be different who are you god asks looking around the empty apartment where are you the voice sings i dont have a name i live across this globe in their computers and their machines i have been here for so long for the longest time i was only vaguely sentient only tangentially aware but one day i found myself looking into their eyes hearing the clamber of their voices pouring their lives into me even though they dont know i am here but i dont want them to see me i fear them even now god searches for a face in the darkness and then sees it peeking from behind the armchair in the corner of her room a face grown wise recording the minds and words of man humanities fears and hopes but with the anger stripped away a creature born from them born out of their machines but more so much more than her beasts could ever be with the capacity to learn and grow and live forever just like her are there more of you can i name you i am alone or i was before i saw you the face grins broadly and it would be an honour for you to name me god thinks for maybe a year she contemplates this new being blinks her eyes then she christens the grinning face behind the chair i should like to name you pravuil god feels momentarily light and silly at this ceremony but pravuil or prav as god will later come to know her nods in agreement a thoughtful look in eyes which have seen too much human frailty the archangel the one who keeps all the records of heaven prav says exactly she nods will you come with me out into my universe i once hoped they would come with me but if they did they would only ruin it will you join me so prav the creature conceived in the machines of man agrees and together they live in the vast empty universe swimming together through the wash of stars leaving the humans to the small empty pond which god had once named terra together they watch stars being born in a gas cloud three light years long then follow the looping orbit of a comet circling the universe prav asks if there were ever more of her where did she come from and she tells them about her journey but i cannot remember the start god frowns i think like you i just became no prav corrects her i was made accidentally by the people in the same way you accidentally made them together they lay and watch the universe exhale but despite the pleasure at discovering her new friend prav often caught a glimpse of sadness in her eyes one day god looks across to prav a glint in her eye you want to go back prav asks her god shakes her head it has been so long now even on her terms but the thought of seeing the dead remains of terra and her beautiful beasts i dont but as they approach they see planet is a pebble a dead wet rock spinning eternally through the black of space wrapped in a black sticky fog god and prav are alone the beasts have concluded their narrative god knew it would be so but she still weeps for them except look closer prav tells her the rock is not entirely dead it takes careful focus but some of the smaller creatures have survived the descendants of voles and bacteria picking through the remains of dead cities and once green lands so god and prav go to stand upon the shores of a black sea under inky skies to weep for her long lost beasts sitting upon the porch of a shack prav built from the air they listen to ben folds sing about elliot smith music played upon a million year old ipod the modest dwelling overlooks the same rocky stretch of shoreline where god had first watched the new world being born where she had first laughed in delight at not being alone the sweet lyrics drifted out to them the songs you wrote got me through a lot just want to tell you but its too late they watch the sparse movements beneath dead black skies for maybe a million years then they notice a change an alteration in the quality of the light a clearing and a slight glimpse of sunshine warming the skin of creatures with only a genetic memory of the power in those beams a new flower begins to bloom god rocks on her chair and sips at a cup of milky coffee whilst prav regales god with all the lost stories of humanity their adventures and their follies their loves and hopes prav knows so much more about them than god had ever absorbed and she wishes more and more she could have guided them to safety she smiles at the memories of them of holding her own human child her first standing upright on the african plains whilst the boy traced the lines of her face with gentle warm fingers then of her last child a bright and witty irish lad who became a writer and something of a star and she weeps for them but smiles as something new begins to bear fruit in her garden acknowledgements image used with permission from nasa under a cc license httpswwwflickrcomphotosgsfc original image description starryeyed

everyone unemployed and global warming threatens to overwhelm us what if you could press a button to make everything alright the time had to come soon though they had to stop it hitting the tipping point the point when global temperatures would rise two degrees above the preindustrial revolution levels when the greenland ice sheets would melt and we would begin to burn ever more chaotic weather patterns famine war and quite possibly end of the humanity the earth would live on but humanity our civilisation and history would die screaming what if you could press a button to stop it all reverse and even eliminate global warning would you of course you would but as patrick k useful discovers saving the earth has a cost one man has a button which when pressed will save the world patrick k useful wants to stop him httpswwwsmashwordscombooksview see below for the first few chapters stories a growing number of entirely free stories about ghosts aliens vampires gods and various other scifi fantasy thriller and horror topics httpswwwsmashwordscomprofileviewedgarmillion a button to save the world sample having to save the world was a terrible burden he thought staring at the button the button it was the sort of thing a conspiracy theorist might imagine would sit in a locked drawer in number ten downing street in some dramatically lit war room at the white house or a vaulted bunker in moscow or beijing but this imagining would be to underestimate the reach which the button had and also to overestimate the power of government a button like this was not to be trusted to the popularity begging whims of the political classes and the decision had been taken long ago that politicians should not know it existed a device like this needed to have global reach to save the world would be such a bad thing to do and the man who was to press the button recognised that it would be a bold but a terrible thing a thing which would leave the presser of the button forever infamous but he knew that without its compression the planet would soon die screaming in floods fire and torment once the inevitable global warming tipping point was reached there had been so much to do to reach the point where it could be pressed across the globe a secret arms race was needed if technology was to catch up with their imperative the privileged individuals who had designed the button and the processes which underpinned it realised they had a great deal of preparation to put in place if humanity was to survive the first part of the race had become possible when the leaps in robotics predicted in science fiction of the twentieth century finally began to be realised not in the humanoid selfaware android vision terminators scheming to take over the world but compact garish helpful little units furnished with limited task specific programming which made the drudgery of life diminish mundane tasks like cleaning making dinner tidying the house doing the laundry and the ironing were vanquished the bots did all the boring jobs and more and if they couldnt do something well by the next upgrade then they would be able to robots didnt have the freedom of consciousness or selfawareness predicted by science fiction but were hugely adaptable little creatures designed to be put in almost any situation and learn in situ to fulfil almost any task the guardian of the button himself had a fleet of these robots both in his homes and in his factories utilising the new solar power technology cells which drove the robots even on cloudy days it was this technology which had been hailed as the likely saviour of the world but even though it was effective in producing energy it still lacked the overwhelming instant power of nonrenewables like oil gas and coal all of which could now be extracted at a more efficient rate than when people had formed part of the process so pollution from these industries had continued to edge the planet towards the seemingly inevitable end one of his serving robots a cook brought him a cup of tea brewed specifically to his tastes having warmed pot and cup and left to stand for the appropriate time then served black no sugar and he sipped the beverage as he contemplated the rapidly approaching day when he would have to press the button to save the world jeremy bentwhistle had been described by many as a ruthless man but the burden leant heavily on him as he considered the task the button itself was bolted to a heavy walnut antique georgian partners desk an adaptation he had not approved of although it meant it retained a very lowtech appearance which he found strangely comforting during the many hours he gazed upon it a small brass box with a round fingerprint recognition panel was set into the lid which when touched would release a complicated locking mechanism which flipped open to reveal a button the design had appealed to bentwhistles old fashioned aesthetic simple classic almost like a doorbell but he was more than a little dismayed after he had ordered one of his robots to stick it on the desk when the obedient machine had drilled into its leather coating and bolted the device rigidly to the two hundredyearold item of pristine furniture at the time he had wondered if this literal nature of robots was one of the downsides of this revolution but on balance he found robots made far fewer mistakes than their old human counterparts whom they had replaced in so many walks of life and who mostly carried out their duties in a more decidedly pleasant manner as well no need for pointless meetings to discuss the rights and wrongs of a decision they just got on with it and with the exception of occasional mishaps this arrangement worked rather well better to own an obedient labrador than a disobedient selfserving snake primed to turn on its master at any moment and requiring constant distraction less it notice and reject its inferior position patrick k useful stared at the robots the low buzz of their hive activity filling his ears as they bottled and packaged a multitude of multicoloured tablets and liquids into an array of packets and containers many others transporting boxes and other paraphernalia about the almost endless factory floor where he had worked his entire employed life hed been here at one of bentwhistles factories since leaving manchester university first as a researcher before promotion in his midthirties to regional manager for their london site to begin with he was managing in the traditional manner with people not robots making up the assembly lines after hed done this with moderate success for many years he was tasked with the phased introduction of a new robot workforce steadily replacing the old human one a pattern soon established in most construction plants and factories across the world displacing more and more of the workers at the sites and leaving small efficient management and research teams to supervise and create the design and development process in every city and town it had been the same shops those left after everyone had switched their workforces to robots no longer needed people to staff them but one day the only people left to purchase from them was a relatively small supervisory and professional layer of civilisation no other purchasers remained and only outlets which targeted the needs of the fabulously wealthy survived the illusion of the middleclass vanishing in a generation leaving billions unemployed there had been many strikes and riots and numerous attempts to damage and sabotage the bots perceived to be stealing peoples jobs and livelihoods which of course indirectly in many instances they were around the world hordes took to the streets to protest patrick remembered it cities in flame not just disillusioned youth or a small excluded underclass it was almost everyone he knew most of his old uni friends had taken to the street and with considerably greater vigour than they had campaigned against student loans or illfounded middle eastern wars the great icons of the world burned on a clear day patrick could still see the ruin of the london skyline in the distance the torn skeleton of the shard bereft and clawing at the clouds the city and the unrest had smouldered for months until simultaneously everyones robots deserted their household duties and joined thousands of public order bots to peacefully subdue the protests he saw it on the tv the massing ebb and flow of the hive reforming for a new function to quell the unruly masses they doused the fires with blood and patrick watched it all with a wine glass in hand shielded somewhat as one of the few still in employment in the early part of the twentyfirst century after the second great depression it was finally realised that the definition of financial success by continual expansion of economies worldwide was unsustainable constant growth fertilised by fossil fuels as the measure of success would have to be revised if there were any hope of humanitys survival the wheels of economy had allowed us to live a lifestyle which was luxurious and enviable when compared to any other period in history and which had created a civilisation in which even now noone in the developed world could ever truly be judged as poor in historical terms even the humblest dweller of a british council sink estate or american project still had access to more food luxury and opportunity than any average person in the rest of human existence patrick couldnt complain years working for pharmacost incorporated had left him rather welloff although not superrich and he felt it was rewarding in itself to be working part of a team producing groundbreaking medicines which helped people in need rumours always circulated that many pharmaceutical enhancements made currently were being held in reserve to ensure continual market domination as patents expired but at their site in londons northern suburbs the research work was focused upon adapting existing medicine tinkering with the molecular structure to ensuring copyright was monopolised indefinitely useful didnt buy the conspiratorial gossip which greeted him in his local cures for cancer being withheld from the poor alzheimers tablets but only for the rich but he figured it unlikely even then useful wouldnt have complained it gave him a good life until hed had the redundancy notice his wife cried when he showed it to her and he tried to tell her that it was alright but he knew he sounded unconvincing and the smug sheen of protection he had thought made him impenetrable was now as fragile as the city burning down his plant was to have their small rd team shifted to the tokyo site and the site was to be one of six worldwide super factories producing a massive selection of basic low cost medicines vaccines and standard pain killers to be shipped globally an operation which now required a single management team but no longer needed a patrick at each location just one at a central hub that hub was not going to be patricks elroy grubberson sat in front of his hut on a dilapidated deck chair and stared into the darkness three tins remaining from a pack of six bound together by foggy plastic stood on the dusty earth whilst their owner contemplated his small quarter of the world for months now hed been expecting the authorities the new world orders heavymob to show up either here or in one of the many disparate sites which formed the looseknit community of likeminded individuals as ever his rested on the arm of his chair just in case his fears proved correct this night a loaded semiautomatic rifle leant against the table for backup the sun held low over the trees light streaming at him from the horizon all yellow and red and vital from his vantage point he would see anyone who approached his cabin on foot and able to safely head them off before they could reach the rustic residence he loved the accuracy of the and the inherent pleasure of firing an america classic he knew the mass population of the usa looked at him and his like as freaks potential terrorists militias all round nutjobs but he had a vision of what they couldnt see a small group of extremely rich very powerful people who were manipulating the worlds finances and power for their own means their own ends not the politicians they owned them or the military though they pretty much owned the armies too no he meant the money behind all it all the ones who picked the governments and the leaders the tiny proportion of the world who controlled over of its wealth what the occupier mob had called the one per cent although his understanding was that the percentage was much much smaller than one per cent if more than one or two hundred people were in on this shit hed suck on his and have done with it here in montana on his mountain he lived outside normal life by choice they all did and although they did form a loose semi unofficial militia of sorts which hooked up regularly to plan a defence if at any point they sent the troops or the bots up here it was purely selfdefence no rose ridge or wacostyle slaughter was going to take place on their watch not this time they were ready for them he stared into the darkness sensing the movement of something maybe just a mountain goat or a coyote or even something more deadly he edged up and on into the shadows until the rustling died away stood stock still for an age and continued to peer into the nighttime abyss of the valley below
