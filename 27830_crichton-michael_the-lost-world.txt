michael crichton the lost world to carolyn conger what really interests me is whether god had any choice in the creation of the world albert einstein deep in the chaotic regime slight changes in structure almost always cause vast changes in behavior complex controllable behavior seems precluded stuart kauffman sequelae are inherently unpredictable ian malcolm introduction extinction at the kt boundary the late twentieth century has witnessed a remarkable growth in scientific interest in the subject of extinction it is hardly a new subject baron georges cuvier had first demonstrated that species became extinct back in not long after the american revolution thus the fact of extinction had been accepted by scientists for nearly threequarters of a century before darwin put forth his theory of evolution and after darwin the many controversies that swirled around his theory did not often concern issues of extinction on the contrary extinction was generally considered as unremarkable as a car running out of gas extinction was simply proof of failure to adapt how species adapted was intensely studied and fiercely debated but the fact that some species failed was hardly given a second thought what was there to say about it however beginning in the s two developments began to focus attention on extinction in a new way the first was the recognition that human beings were now very numerous and were altering the planet at a very rapid rateeliminating traditional habitats clearing the rain forest polluting air and water perhaps even changing global climate in the process many animal species were becoming extinct some scientists cried out in alarm others were quietly uneasy how fragile was the earths ecosystem was the human species engaged in behavior that would eventually lead to its own extinction no one was sure since nobody had ever bothered to study extinction in an organized way there was little information about rates of extinction in other geological eras so scientists began to look closely at extinction in the past hoping to answer anxieties about the present the second development concerned new knowledge about the death of the dinosaurs it had long been known that all dinosaur species had become extinct in a relatively short time at the end of the cretaceous era approximately sixtyfive million years ago exactly how quickly those extinctions occurred was a subject of longstanding debate some paleontologists believed they had been catastrophically swift others felt the dinosaurs had died out more gradually over a period of ten thousand to ten million years hardly a rapid event then in physicist luis alvarez and three coworkers discovered high concentrations of the element iridium in rocks from the end of the cretaceous and the start of the tertiary the socalled kt boundary the cretaceous was shorthanded as k to avoid confusion with the cambrian and other geological periods iridium is rare on earth but abundant in meteors alvarezs team argued that the presence of so much iridium in rocks at the kt boundary suggested that a giant meteorite many miles in diameter had collided with the earth at that time they theorized that the resulting dust and debris had darkened the skies inhibited photosynthesis killed plants and animals and ended the reign of the dinosaurs this dramatic theory captured the media and public imagination it began a controversy which continued for many years where was the crater from this meteor various candidates were proposed there were five major periods of extinction in the pasthad meteors caused them all was there a twentysixmillionyear cycle of catastrophe was the planet even now awaiting another devastating impact after more than a decade these questions remained unanswered the debate raged on until august when at a weekly seminar of the santa fe institute an iconoclastic mathematician named ian malcolm announced that none of these questions mattered and that the debate over a meteoric impact was a frivolous and irrelevant speculation consider the numbers malcolm said leaning on the podium staring forward at his audience on our planet there are currently fifty million species of plants and animals we think that is a remarkable diversity yet it is nothing compared to what has existed before we estimate that there have been fifty billion species on this planet since life began that means that for every thousand species that ever existed on the planet only one remains today thus percent of all species that ever lived are extinct and mass killings account for only five percent of that total the overwhelming majority of species died one at a time the truth malcolm said was that life on earth was marked by a continuous steady rate of extinction by and large the average lifespan of a species was four million years for mammals it was a million years then the species vanished so the real pattern was one of species rising flourishing and dying out in a few million years on average one species a day had become extinct throughout the history of life on the earth but why he asked what leads to the rise and decline of earths species in a fourmillionyear life cycle one answer is that we do not recognize how continuously active our planet is just in the last fifty thousand years a geological blink of an eye the rain forests have severely contracted then expanded again rain forests arent an ageless feature of the planet theyre actually rather new as recently as ten thousand years ago when there were human hunters on the american continent an ice pack extended as far down as new york city many animals became extinct during that time so most of earths history shows animals living and dying against a very active background that probably explains percent of extinctions if the seas dry up or become more salty then of course ocean plankton will all die but complex animals like dinosaurs are another matter because complex animals have insulated themselves literally and figuratively against such changes why do complex animals die out why dont they adjust physically they seem to have the capacity to survive there appears to be no reason why they should die and yet they do what i wish to propose is that complex animals become extinct not because of a change in their physical adaptation to their environment but because of their behavior i would suggest that the latest thinking ill chaos theory or nonlinear dynamics provides tantalizing hints to how this happens it suggests to us that behavior of complex animals can change very rapidly and not always for the better it suggests that behavior can cease to be responsive to the environment and lead to decline and death it suggests that animals may stop adapting is this what happened to the dinosaurs is this the true cause of their disappearance we may never know but it is no accident that human beings are so interested in dinosaur extinction the decline of the dinosaurs allowed mammals including us to flourish and that leads us to wonder whether the disappearance of the dinosaurs is going to be repeated sooner or later by us as well whether at the deepest level the fault lies not in blind fatein some fiery meteor from the skies but in our own behavior at the moment we have no answer and then he smiled but i have a few suggestions he said prologue life at the edge of chaos the santa fe institute was housed in a series of buildings on canyon road which had formerly been a convent and the institutes seminars were held in a room which had served as a chapel now standing at the podium with a shaft of sunlight shining down on him ian malcolm paused dramatically before continuing his lecture malcolm was forty years old and a familiar figure at the institute he had been one of the early pioneers in chaos theory but his promising career had been disrupted by a severe injury during a trip to costa rica malcolm had in fact been reported dead in several newscasts i was sorry to cut short the celebrations in mathematics departments around the country he later said but it turned out i was only slightly dead the surgeons have done wonders as they will be the first to tell you so now i am back in my next iteration you might say dressed entirely in black leaning on a cane malcolm gave the impression of severity he was known within the institute for his unconventional analysis and his tendency to pessimism his talk that august entitled life at the edge of chaos was typical of his thinking in it malcolm presented his analysis of chaos theory as it applied to evolution he could not have wished for a more knowledgeable audience the santa fe institute had been formed in the mids by a group of scientists interested in the implications of chaos theory the scientists came from many fieldsphysics economics biology computer science what they had in common was a belief that the complexity of the world concealed an underlying order which had previously eluded science and which would be revealed by chaos theory now known as complexity theory in the words of one complexity theory was the science of the twentyfirst century the institute had explored the behavior of a great variety of complex systems corporations in the marketplace neurons in the human brain enzyme cascades within a single cell the group behavior of migratory birds systems so complex that it had not been possible to study them before the advent of the computer the research was new and the findings were surprising it did not take long before the scientists began to notice that complex systems showed certain common behaviors they started to think of these behaviors as characteristic of all complex systems they realized that these behaviors could not be explained by analyzing the components of the systems the timehonored scientific approach of reductionism taking the watch apart to see how it worked didnt get you anywhere with complex systems because the interesting behavior seemed to arise from the spontaneous interaction of the components the behavior wasnt planned or directed it just happened such behavior was therefore called selforganizing of the selforganizing behaviors ian malcolm said two are of particular interest to the study of evolution one is adaptation we see it everywhere corporations adapt to the marketplace brain cells adapt to signal traffic the immune system adapts to infection animals adapt to their food supply we have come to think that the ability to adapt is characteristic of complex systemsand may be one reason why evolution seems to lead toward more complex organisms he shifted at the podium transferring his weight onto his cane but even more important he said is the way complex systems seem to strike a balance between the need for order and the imperative to change complex systems tend to locate themselves at a place we call the edge of chaoswe imagine the edge of chaos as a place where there is enough innovation to keep a living system vibrant and enough stability to keep it from collapsing into anarchy it is a zone of conflict and upheaval where the old and the new are constantly at war finding the balance point must be a delicate matter if a living system drifts too close it risks falling over into incoherence and dissolution but if the system moves too far away from the edge it becomes rigid frozen totalitarian both conditions lead to extinction too much change is as destructive as too little only at the edge of chaos can complex systems flourish he paused and by implication extinction is the inevitable result of one or the other strategy too much change or too little in the audience heads were nodding this was familiar thinking to most of the researchers present indeed the concept of the edge of chaos was very nearly dogma at the santa fe institute unfortunately malcolm continued the gap between this theoretical construct and the fact of extinction is vast we have no way to know if our thinking is correct the fossil record can tell us that an animal became extinct at a certain time but not why computer simtulations are of limited value nor can we perform experiments on living organisms thus we are obliged to admit that extinction untestable unsuited for experiment may not be a scientific subject at all and this may explain why the subject has been embroiled in the most intense religious and political controversy i would remind you that there is no religious debate about avogadros number or plancks constant or the functions of the pancreas but about extinction there has been perpetual controversy for two hundred years and i wonder how it is to be solved if yes what is it at the back of the room a hand had gone up waving impatiently malcolm frowned visibly annoyed the tradition at the institute was that questions were held until the presentation ended it was poor form to interrupt a speaker you had a question malcolm asked from the back of the room a young man in his early thirties stood actually the man said an observation the speaker was dark and thin dressed in khaki shirt and shorts precise in his movements and manner malcolm recognized him as a paleontologist from berkeley named levine who was spending the summer at the institute malcolm had never spoken to him but he knew his reputation levine was generally agreed to be the best paleobiologist of his generation perhaps the best in the world but most people at the institute disliked him finding him pompous and arrogant i agree levine continued that the fossil record is not helpful in addressing extinction particularly if your thesis is that behavior is the cause of extinction because bones dont tell us much about behavior but i disagree that your behavioral thesis is untestable in point of fact it implies an outcome although perhaps you havent yet thought of it the room was silent at the podium malcolm frowned the eminent mathematician was not accustomed to being told he had not thought through his ideas whats your point he said levine appeared indifferent to the tension in the room just this he said during the cretaceous dinosauria were widely distributed across the planet we have found their remains on every continent and in every climatic zone even in the antarctic now if their extinction was really the result of their behavior and not the consequence of a catastrophe or a disease or a change in plant life or any of the other broadscale explanations that have been proposed then it seems to me highly unlikely that they all changed their behavior at the same time everywhere and that in turn means that there may well be some remnants of these animals still alive on the earth why couldnt you look for them you could malcolm said coldly if that amused you and if you had no more compelling use for your time no no levine said earnestly im quite serious what if the dinosaurs did not become extinct what if they still exist somewhere in an isolated spot on the planet youre talking about a lost world malcolm said and heads in the room nodded knowingly scientists at the institute had developed a shorthand for referring to common evolutionary scenarios they spoke of the field of bullets the gamblers ruin the game of life the lost world the red queen and black noise these were welldefined ways of thinking about evolution but they were all no levine said stubbornly i am speaking literally then youre badly deluded malcolm said with a dismissive wave of his hand he turned away from the audience and walked slowly to the blackboard now if we consider the implications of the edge of chaos we may begin by asking ourselves what is the minimal unit of life most contemporary definitions of life would include the presence of dna but there are two examples which suggest to us that this definition is too narrow if you consider viruses and socalled prions it is clear that life may in fact exist without dna at the back of the room levine stared for a moment then reluctantiv he sat down and began to make notes the lost world hypothesis the lecture ended malcolm hobbled across the open courtyard of the institute shortly after noon walking beside him was sarah harding a young field biologist visiting from africa malcolm had known her for several years since he had been asked to serve as an outside reader for her doctoral thesis at berkeley crossing the courtyard in the hot summer sun they made an unlikely pair malcolm dressed in black stooped and ascetic leaning on his cane harding compact and muscular looking young and energetic in shorts and a tee shirt her short black hair pushed up on her forehead with sunglasses her field of study was african predators lions and hyenias she was scheduled to return to nairobi the next day the two had been close since malcolms surgery harding had been on a sabbatical year in austin and had helped nurse malcolm back to health after his many operations for a while it seemed as if a romance had blossomed and that malcolm a confirmed bachelor would settle down but then harding had gone back to africa and malcolm had gone to santa fe whatever their former relationship had been they were now just friends they discussed the questions that had come at the end of his lecture from malcolms point of view there had been only the predictable objections that mass extinctions were important that human beings owed their existence to the cretaceous extinction which had wiped out the dinosaurs and allowed the mammals to take over as one questioner had pompously phrased it the cretaceous allowed our own sentient awareness to arise on the planet malcoms reply was immediate what makes you think human beings are sentient and aware theres no evidence for it human beings never think for themselves they find it too uncomfortable for the most part members of our species simply repeat what they are told and become upset if they are exposed to any different view the characteristic human trait is not awareness but conformity and the characteristic result is religious warfare other animals fight for territory or food but uniquely in the animal kingdom human beings fight for their beliefs the reason is that beliefs guide behavior which has evolutionary importance among human beings but at a time when our behavior may well lead us to extinction i see no reason to assume we have any awareness at all we are stubborn selfdestructive conformists any other view of our species is just a selfcongratulatory delusion next question now walking across the courtyard sarah harding laughed they didnt care for that i admit its discouraging he said but it cant be helped he shook his head these are some of the best scientists in the country and stillno interesting ideas by the way whats the story on that guy who interrupted me richard levine she laughed irritating isnt he he has a worldwide reputation for being a pain in the ass malcolm grunted id say hes wealthy is the problem harding said you know about the becky dolls no malcolm said giving her a glance well every little girl in america does theres a series becky and sally and frances and several more theyre americana dolls levine is the heir of the company so hes a smartass rich kid impetuous does whatever he wants malcolm nodded you have time for lunch sure i would be dr malcolm wait up please dr malcolm malcom turned hurrying across the courtyard toward them was the gangling figure of richard levine ah shit malcolm said dr malcolm levine said coming up i was surprised that you didnt take my proposal more seriously how could i malcolm said its absurd yes but ms harding and i were just going to lunch malcolm said gesturing to sarah yes but i think you should reconsider levine said pressing on because i believe my argument is valid it is entirely possible even likely that dinosaurs still exist you must know there are persistent rumors about animals in costa rica where i believe you have spent time yes and in the case of costa rica i can tell you also in the congo levine said continuing for years there have been reports by pygmies of a large sauropod perhaps even an apatosaur in the dense forest around bokambu and also in the high jungles of irian jaya there is supposedly an animal the size of a rhino which perhaps is a remnant ceratopsian fantasy malcolm said pure fantasy nothing has ever been seen no photographs no hard evidence perhaps not levine said but absence of proof is not proof of absence i believe there may well be a locus of these animals survivals from a past time malcolm shrugged anything is possible he said but in point of fact survival is possible levine insisted i keep getting calls about new animals in costa rica remnants fragments malcolm paused recently not for a while umm malcolm said i thought so the last call was nine months ago levine said i was in siberia looking at that frozen baby mammoth and i couldnt get back in time but im told it was some kind of very large atypical lizard found dead in the jungle of costa rica and what happened to it the remains were burned so nothing is left thats right no photographs no proof apparently not so its just a story malcolm said perhaps but i believe it is worth mounting an expedition to find out about these reported survivals malcolm stared at him an expedition to find a hypothetical lost world who is going to pay for it i am levine said i have already begun the preliminary planning but that could cost i dont care what it costs levine said the fact is survival is possible it has occurred in a variety of species from other genera and it may be that there are survivals from the cretaceous as well fantasy malcolm said again shaking his head levine paused and stared at malcolm dr malcolm he said i must say im very surprised at your attitude youve just presented a thesis and i am offering you a chance to prove it i would have thought youd jump at the opportunity my jumping days are over malcolm said but instead of taking me up on this you im not interested in dinosaurs malcolm said but everyone is interested in dinosaurs not me he turned on his cane and started to walk off by the way levine said what were you doing in costa rica i heard you were there for almost a year i was lying in a hospital bed they couldnt move me out of intensive care for six months i couldnt even get on a plane yes levine said i know you got hurt but what were you doing there in the first place werent you looking for dinosaurs malcolm squinted at him in the bright sun and leaned on his cane no he said i wasnt they were all three sitting at a small painted table in the corner of the guadalupe cafe on the other side of the river sarah harding drank corona from the bottle and watched the two men opposite her levine looked pleased to be with them as if he had won some victory to be sitting at the table malcolm looked weary like a parent who has spent too much time with a hyperactive child you want to know what ive heard levine said ive heard that a couple of years back a company named ingen genetically engineered some dinosaurs and put them on an island in costa rica but something went wrong a lot of people were killed and the dinosaurs were destroyed and now nobody will talk about it because of some legal angle nondisclosure agreements or something and the costa rican government doesnt want to hurt tourism so nobody will talk thats what ive heard malcolm stared at him and you believe that not at first i didnt levine said but the thing is i keep hearing it the rumors keep floating around supposedly you and alan grant and a bunch of other people were there did you ask grant about it i asked him last year at a conference in peking he said it was absurd malcolm nodded slowly is that what you say levine asked drinking his beer i mean you know grant dont you no i never met him levine was watching malcolm closely so its not true malcolm sighed are you familiar with the concept of a technomyth it was developed by geller at princeton basic thesis is that weve lost all the old myths orpheus and eurydice and perseus and medusa so we fill the gap with modern technomyths geller listed a dozen or so one is that an aliens living at a hangar at wrightpatterson air force base another is that somebody invented a carburetor that gets a hundred and fifty miles to the gallon but the automobile companies bought the patent and are sitting on it then theres the story that the russians trained children in esp at a secret base in siberia and these kids can kill people anywhere in the world with their thoughts the story that the lines in nazca peru are an alien spaceport that the cia released the aids virus to kill homosexuals that nikola tesla discovers an incredible energy source but his notes are lost that in istanbul theres a tenthcentury drawing that shows the earth from space that the stanford research institute found a guy whose body glows in the dark get the picture youre saying ingens dinosaurs are a myth levine said of course they are they have to be do you think its possible to genetically engineer a dinosaur the experts all tell me its not and theyre right malcolm said he glanced at harding as if for confirmation she said nothing just drank her beer in fact harding knew something more about these dinosaur rumors once after surgery malcolm had been delirious mumbling nonsense from the anaesthesia and pain medication and he had been seemingly fearful twisting in the bed repeating the names of several kinds of dinosaurs harding had asked the nurse about it she said he was like that after every operation the hospital staff assumed it was a druginduced fantasy yet it seemed to harding that malcolm was reliving some terrifying actual experience the feeling was heightened by the slangy familiar way malcolm referred to the dinosaurs he called them raptors and compys and trikes and he seemed especially fearful of the raptors later when he was back home she had asked him about his delirium he had just shrugged it off making a bad joke at least i didnt mention other women did i and then he made some comment about having been a dinosaur nut as a kid and how illness made you regress his whole attitude was elaborately indifferent as if it were all unimportant she had the distinct feeling he was being evasive but she wasnt inclined to push it those were the days when she was in love with him her attitude indulgent now he was looking at her in a questioning way as if to ask if she was going to contradict him harding just raised an eyebrow and stared back he must have his reasons she could wait him out levine leaned forward across the table toward malcolm and said so the ingen story is entirely untrue entirely untrue malcolm said nodding gravely entirely untrue malcolm had been denying the speculation for three years by now he was getting good at it his weariness was no longer affected but genuine in fact he had been a consultant to international genetic technologies of palo alto in the summer of and he had made a trip to costa rica for them which had turned out disastrously in the aftermath everyone involved had moved quickly to quash the story ingen wanted to limit its liability the costa rican government wanted to preserve its reputation as a tourist paradise and the individual scientists had been bound by nondisclosure agreements abetted later by generous grants to continue their silence in malcolms case two years of medical bills had been paid by the company meanwhile ingens island facility in costa rica had been destroyed there were no longer any living creatures on the island the company had hired the eminent stanford professor george baselton a biologist and essayist whose frequent television appearances had made him a popular authority on scientific subjects baselton claimed to have visited the island and had been tireless in denying rumors that extinct animals had ever existed there his derisive snort sabertoothed tigers indeed was particularly effective as time passed interest in the story waned ingen was long since bankrupt the principal investors in europe and asia had taken their losses although the companys physical assets the buildings and lab equipment would be sold piecemeal the core technology that had been developed would they decided never be sold in short the ingen chapter was closed there was nothing more to say so theres no truth to it levine said biting into his greencorn tamale to tell you the truth dr malcolm that makes me feel better why malcolm said because it means that the remnants that keep turning up in costa rica must be real real dinosaurs ive got a friend from yale down there a field biologist and he says hes seen them i believe him malcolm shrugged i doubt he said that any more animals will turn up in costa rica its true there havent been any for almost a year now but if more show up im going down there and in the interim i am going to outfit an expedition ive been giving a lot of thought to how it should be done i think the special vehicles could be built and ready in a year ive already talked to doc thorne about it then ill assemble a team perhaps including dr harding here or a similarly accomplished naturalist and some graduate students malcolm listened shaking his head you think im wasting my time levine said i do yes but suppose just suppose that animals start to show up again never happen but suppose they did levine said would you be interested in helping me to plan an expedition malcolm finished his meal and pushed the plate aside he stared at levine yes he said finally if animals started showing up again i would be interested in helping you great levine said thats all i wanted to know outside in the bright sunlight on guadalupe street malcolm walked with sarah toward malcolms battered ford sedan levine climbed into a brightred ferrari waved cheerfully and roared off you think it will ever happen sarah harding said that these ah animals will start showing up again no malcolm said i am quite sure they never will you sound hopeful he shook his head and got awkwardly in the car swinging his bad leg tinder the steering wheel harding climbed in beside him he glanced at her and turned the key in the ignition they drove back to the institute the following day she went back to africa during the next eighteen months she had a rough sense of levines progress since from time to time he called her with some question about field protocols or vehicle tires or the best anaesthetic to use on animals in the wild sometimes she got a call from doc thorne who was building the vehicles he usually sounded harassed from malcolm she heard nothing at all although he sent her a card on her birthday it arrived a month late he had scrawled at the bottom have a happy birthday be glad youre nowhere near him hes driving me crazy first configuration in the conservative region far from the chaotic edge individual elements coalesce slowly showing no clear pattern ian malcolm aberrant forms in the fading afternoon light the helicopter skimmed low along the coast following the line where the dense jungle met the beach the last of the fishing villages had flashed by beneath them ten minutes ago now there was only impenetrable costa rican jungle mangrove swamps and mile after mile of deserted sand sitting beside the pilot marty guitierrez stared out the window as the coastline swept past there werent even any roads in this area at least none that guitierrez could see guitierrez was a quiet bearded american of thirtysix a field biologist who had lived for the last eight years in costa rica he had originally come to study toucan speciation in the rain forest but stayedon as a consultant to the reserva biologica de carara the national park in the north he clicked the radio mike and said to the pilot how much farther five minutes senior guitierrez guitierrez turned and said it wont be long now but the tall man folded up in the back seat of the helicopter didnt answer or even acknowledge that he had been spoken to he merely sat with his hand on his chin and stared frowning out the window richard levine wore sunfaded field khakis and an australian slouch hat pushed low over his head a battered pair of binoculars hung around his neck but despite his rugged appearance levine conveyed an air of scholarly absorption behind his wireframe spectacles his features were sharp his expression intense and critical as he looked out the window what is this place its called rojas so were far south yes only about fifty miles from the border with panama levine stared at the jungle i dont see any roads he said how was the thing found couple of campers guitierrez said they came in by boat landed on the beach when was that yesterday they took one look at the thing and ran like hell levine nodded with his long limbs folded up his hands tucked under his chin he looked like a praying mantis that had been his nickname in graduate school in part because of his appearance and in part because of his tendency to bite off the head of anyone who disagreed with him guitierrez said been to costa rica before no first time levine said and then he gave an irritable wave of his hand as if he didnt want to be bothered with small talk guitierrez smiled after all these years levine had not changed at all he was still one of the most brilliant and irritating men in science the two had been fellow graduate students at yale until levine quit the doctoral program to get his degree in comparative zoology instead levine announced he had no interest in the kind of contemporary field research that so attracted guitierrez with characteristic contempt he had once described guitierrezs work as collecting parrot crap from around the world the truth was that levine brilliant and fastidious was drawn to the past to the world that no longer existed and he studied this world with obsessive intensity he was famous for his photographic memory his arrogance his sharp tongue and the unconcealed pleasure he took in pointing out the errors of colleagues as a colleague once said levine never forgets a bone and he never lets you forget it either field researchers disliked levine and he returned the sentiment he was at heart a man of detail a cataloguer of animal life and he was happiest poring over museum collections reassigning species rearranging display skeletons he disliked the dust and inconvenience of life in the field given his choice levine would never leave the museum but it was his fate to live in the greatest period of discovery in the history of paleontology the number of known species of dinosaurs had doubled in the last twenty years and new species were now being described at the rate of one every seven weeks thus levines worldwide reputation forced him to continually travel around the world inspecting new finds and rendering his expert opinion to researchers who were annoyed to admit that they needed it whered you come from gtiitierrez asked him mongolia levine said i was at the flaming cliffs in the gobi desert three hours out of ulan bator oh whats there john roxtons got a dig he found an incomplete skeleton he thought might be a new species of velociraptor and wanted me to have a look and levine shrugged roxton never really did know anatomy hes an enthusiastic fundraiser but if he actually uncovers something hes incompetent to proceed you told him that why not its the truth and the skeleton the skeleton wasnt a raptor at all levine said metatarsals all wrong pubis too ventral ischium lacking a proper obturator and the long bones much too light as for the skull he rolled his eyes the palatals too thick antorbital fenestrae too rostra distal carida too small oh it goes on and on and the trenchant unguals hardly present so there we are i dont know what roxton could have been thinking i suspect he actually has a subspecies of stenonychosaurus though i havent decided for sure stenonychosaurus guitierrez said small triassic carnivore two meters from pes to acetabtiltim in point of fact a rather ordinary theropod and roxtons find wasnt a particularly interesting example although there was one curious detail the material included an integtimental artifact an imprint of the dinosaurs skin that in itself is not rare there are perhaps a dozen good skin impressions obtained so far mostly among the hadrosauridae but nothing like this because it was clear to me that this animals skin had some very unusual characteristics not previously suspected in dinosaurs senores the pilot said interrupting them juan fernandez bay is ahead levine said circle it first can we levine looked out the window his expression intense again the conversation forgotten they were flying over jungle that extended up into the hills for miles as far as they could see the helicopter banked circling the beach there it is now guitierrez said pointing out the window the beach was a clean curving white crescent entirely deserted in the afternoon light to the south they saw a single dark mass in the sand from the air it looked like a rock or perhaps a large clump of seaweed the shape was amorphous about five feet across there were lots of footprints around it whos been here levine said with a sigh public health service people came out earlier today did they do anything he said they touch it disturb it in any way i cant say guitierrez said the public health service levine repeated shaking his head what do they know you should never have let them near it marty hey guitierrez said i dont run this country i did the best i could they wanted to destroy it before you even got here at least i managed to keep it intact until you arrived although i dont know how long theyll wait then wed better get started levine said he pressed the button on his mike why are we still circling were losing light get down on the beach now i want to see this thing firsthand richard levine ran across the sand toward the dark shape his binoculars bouncing on his chest even from a distance he could smell the stench of decay and already he was logging his preliminary impressions the carcass lay halfburied in the sand surrounded by a thick cloud of flies the skin was bloated with gas which made identification difficult he paused a few yards from the creature and took out his camera immediately the pilot of the helicopter came up alongside him pushing his hand down no permitado what i am sorry senor no pictures arc allowed why the hell not levine said he turned to guitierrez who was trotting down the beach toward them marty why no pictures this could be an important no pictures the pilot said again and he pulled the camera out of levines hand marty this is crazy just go ahead and make your examination guitierrcz said and then he began speaking in spanish to the pilot who answered sharply and angrily waving his hands levine watched a moment then turned away the hell with this he thought they could argue forever he hurried forward breathing through his mouth the odor became much stronger as he approached it although the carcass was large he noticed there were no birds rats or other scavengers feeding on it there were only flies flies so dense they covered the skin and obscured the outline of the dead animal even so it was clear that this had been a substantial creature roughly the size of a cow or horse before the bloat began to enlarge it further the dry skin had cracked in the sun and was now peeling upward exposing the layer of runny yellow subdermal fat beneath oof it stunk levine winced he forced himself closer directing all his attention to the animal although it was the size of a cow it was clearly not a mammal the skin was hairless the original skin color appeared to have been green with a suggestion of darker striations running through it the epidermal surface was pebbled in polygonal tubercles of varying sizes the pattern reminiscent of the skin of a lizard this texture varied in different parts of the animal the pebbling larger and less distinct on the underbelly there were prominent skin folds at the neck shoulder and hip joints again like a lizard but the carcass was large levine estimated the animal had originally weighed about a hundred kilograms roughly two hundred and twenty pounds no lizards grew that large anywhere in the world except the komodo dragons of indonesia varanus komodoensis were ninefootlong monitor lizards crocodilesize carnivores that ate goats and pigs and on occasion human beings as well but there were no monitor lizards anywhere in the new world of course it was conceivable that this was one of the iguanidae iguanas were found all over south america and the marine iguanas grew quite large even so this would be a recordsize animal levine moved slowly around the carcass toward the front of the animal no he thought it wasnt a lizard the carcass lay on its side its left rib cage toward the sky nearly half of it was buried the row of protruberances that marked the dorsal spinous processes of the backbone were just a few inches above the sand the long neck was curved the head hidden beneath the bulk of the body like a ducks head under feathers levine saw one forelimb which seemed small and weak the distal appendage was buried in sand he would dig that out and have a look at it but he wanted to take pictures before he disturbed the specimen in situ in fact the more levine saw of this carcass the more carefully he thought he should proceed because one thing was clear this was a very rare and possibly unknown animal levine felt simultaneously excited and cautious if this discovery was as significant as he was beginning to think it was then it was essential that it be properly documented up the beach guitierrez was still shouting at the pilot who kept shaking his head stubbornly these bananarepublic bureaucrats levine thought why shouldnt he take pictures it couldnt harm anything and it was vital to document the changing state of the creature he heard a thumping and looked up to see a second helicopter circling the bay its dark shadow sliding across the sand this helicopter was ambulancewhite with red lettering on the side in the glare of the setting sun he couldnt read it he turned back to the carcass noticing now that the hind leg of the animal was powerfully muscled very different from the foreleg it suggested that this creature walked upright balanced on strong hind legs many lizards were known to stand upright of course but none so large as this in point of fact as levine looked at the general shape of the carcass he felt increasingly certain that this was not a lizard he worked quickly now for the light was fading and he had much to do with every specimen there were always two major questions to answer both equally important first what was the animal second why had it died standing by the thigh he saw the epidermis was split open no doubt from the gaseous subcutaneous buildup but as levine looked more closely he saw that the split was in fact a sharp gash and that it ran deep through the femorotibialis exposing red muscle and pale bone beneath he ignored the stench and the white maggots that wriggled across the open tissues of the gash because he realized that sorry about all this guitierrez said coming over but the pilot just refuses the pilot was nervously following guitierrez standing beside him watching carefully marty levine said i really need to take pictures here im afraid you cant guitierrez said with a shrtig its important marty sorry i tried my best farther down the beach the white helicopter landed its whine diminishing men in uniforms began getting out marty what do you think this animal is well i can only guess guitierrez said from the general dimensions id call it a previously unidentified iguana its extremely large of course and obviously not native to costa rica my guess is this animal came from the galdpagos or one of the no marty levine said its not an iguana before you say anything more guitierrez said glancing at the pilot i think you ought to know that several previously unknown species of lizard have shown up in this area nobodys quite sure why perhaps its due to the cutting of the rain forest or some other reason but new species are appearing several years ago i began to see unidentified species of marty its not a damn lizard guitierrez blinked his eyes what are you saying of course its a lizard i dont think so levine said guitierrez said youre probably just thrown off because of its size the fact is here in costa rica we occasionally encounter these aberrant forms marty levine said coldly i am never thrown off well of course i didnt mean that and i am telling you this is not a lizard levine said im sorry guitierrez said shaking his head but i cant agree back at the white helicopter the men were huddled together putting on white surgical masks im not asking you to agree levine said he turned back to the carcass the diagnosis is settled easily enough all we need do is excavate the head or for that matter any of the limbs for example this thigh here which i believe he broke off and leaned closer he peered at the back of the thigh what is it guiltierrez said give me your knife why guitierrez said just give it to me guitierrez fished out his pocketknife put the handle in levines outstretched hand levine peered steadily at the carcass i think you will find this interesting what right along the posterior dermal line there is a suddenly they heard shouting on the beach and looked up to see the men from the white helicopter running down the beach toward them they carried tanks on their backs and were shouting in spanish what are they saying levine asked frowning guitierrez sighed theyre saying to get back tell them were busy levine said and bent over the carcass again but the men kept shouting and suddenly there was a roaring sound and levine looked up to see flamethrowers igniting big red jets of flame roaring out in the evening light he ran around the carcass toward the men shouting no no but the men paid no attention he shouted no this is a priceless the first of the uniformed men grabbed levine and threw him roughly to the sand what the hell are you doing levine yelled scrambling to his feet but even as he said it he saw it was too late the first of the flames had reached the carcass blackening the skin igniting the pockets of methane with a blue whump the smoke from the carcass began to rise thickly into the sky stop it stop it levine turned to guitierrez make them stop it but guitierrez was not moving he was staring at the carcass consumed by flames the torso crackled and the fat sputtered and then as the skin burned away the black flat ribs of the skeleton were revealed and then the whole torso turned and suddenly the neck of the animal swung up surrounded by flames moving as the skin contracted and inside the flames levine saw a long pointed snout and rows of sharp predatory teeth and hollow eye sockets the whole thing burning like some medieval dragon rising in flames up into the sky san jose levine sat in the bar of the san jose airport nursing a beer waiting for his plane back to the states guitierrez sat beside him at a small table not saying much an awkward silence had fallen for the last few minutes guitierrez stared at levines backpack on the floor by his feet it was specially constructed of darkgreen goretex with extra pockets on the outside for all the electronic gear pretty nice pack guitierrez said whered you get that anyway looks like a thorne pack levine sipped his beer it is nice guitierrez said looking at it whatve you got there in the top flap a satellite phone and a gps boy what wont they think of next pretty slick must have cost you a marty levine said in an exasperated tone cut the crap are you going to tell me or not tell you what i want to know what the hells going on here richard look im sorry if you no levine said cutting him off that was a very important specimen on that beach marty and it was destroyed i dont understand why you let it happen guitierrez sighed he looked around at the tourists at the other tables and said this has to be in confidence okay all right its a big problem here what is there have been uhaberrant formsturning up on the coast ever so often its been going on for several years now aberrant forms levine repeated shaking his head in disbelief thats the official term for these specimens guitierrez said no one in the government is willing to be more precise it started about five years ago a number of animals were discovered up in the mountains near a remote agricultural station that was growing test varieties of soy beans soy beans levine repeated guitierrez nodded apparently these animals are attracted to beans and certain grasses the assumption is that they have a great need for the amino acid lysine in their diets but nobody is really sure perhaps they just have a taste for certain crops marty levine said i dont care if they have a taste for beer and pretzels the only important question is where did the animals come from nobody knows guitierrez said levine let that pass for the moment what happened to those other animals they were all destroyed and to my knowledge no others were found for years afterward but now it seems to be starting again in the last year we have found the remains of four more animals including the one you saw today and what was done the ah aberrant forms are always destroyed just as you saw from the beginning the governments taken every possible step to make sure nobody finds out about it a few years back some north american journalists began reporting there was something wrong on one island isla nublar menendez invited a bunch of journalists down for a special tour of the island and proceeded to fly them to the wrong island they never knew the difference stuff like that i mean the governments very serious about this why theyre worried worried why should they be worried about guitierrez held up his hand shifted in his chair moved closer disease richard disease yeah costa rica has one of the best healthcare systems in the world guitierrez said the epidemiologists have been tracking some weird type of encephalitis that seems to be on the increase particularly along the coast encephalitis of what origin viral guitierrez shook his head no causative agent has been found marty im telling you richard nobody knows its not a virus because antibody titres dont go up and whitecell differentials dont change its not bacterial because nothing has ever been cultered its a complete mystery all the epidemiologists know is that it seems to affect primarily rural farmers people who are around animals and livestock and its a true encephalitissplitting headaches mental confusion fever delirium mortality so far it seems to be selflimited lasts about three weeks but even so its got the government worried this country is dependent on tourism richard nobody wants talk of unknown diseases so they think the encephalitis is related to these ah aberrant forms he shrugged lizards carry lots of viral diseases guitierrez said theyre a known vector so its not unreasonable there might be a connection but you said this isnt a viral disease whatever it is they think its related levine said all the more reason to find out where these lizards are coming from surely they must have searched searched guiiticrrez said with a laugh of course theyve searched theyve gone over every square inch of this country again and again theyve sent out dozens of search parties ive led several myself theyve done aerial surveys theyve had overflights of the jungle theyve had overflights of the offshore islands that in itself is a big job there are quite a few islands you know particularly along the west coast hell theyve even searched the ones that are privately owned are there privately owned islands levine asked a few three or four like isla nublar it was leased to an american company ingen for years but you said that island was searched thoroughly searched nothing there and the others well lets see guitierrez said ticking them off on his fingers theres isla talamanca on the east coast theyve got a club med there theres sorna on the west coast its leased to a german mining company and theres morazan up north its actually owned by a wealthy costa rican family and there may be another island ive forgotten about and the searches found what nothing guitierrez said theyve found nothing at all so the assumption is that the animals are coming from some location deep in the jungle and thats why we havent been able to find it so far levine grunted in that case lots of luck i know guitierrez said rain forest is an incredibly good environment for concealment a search party could pass within ten yards of a large animal and never see it and even the most advanced remote sensing technology doesnt help much because there are multiple layers to penetrateclouds tree canopy lowerlevel flora theres just no way around it almost anything could be hiding in the rain forest anyway he said the governments frustrated and of course the government is not the only interested party levine looked up sharply oh yes for some reason theres been a lot of interest in these animals what sort of interest levine said as casually as he could last fall the government issued a permit to a team of botanists from berkeley to do an aerial survey of the jungle canopy in the central highlands the survey had been going on for a month when a dispute arose a bill for aviation fuel or something like that anyway a bureaucrat in san jose called berkeley to complain and berkeley said theyd never heard of this survey team meantime the team fled the country so nobody knows who they really were no then last winter a couple of swiss geologists showed up to collect gas samples from offshore islands as part of a study they said of volcanic activity in central america the offshore islands are all volcanic and most of them are still active to some degree so it seemed like a reasonable request but it turned out the geologists really worked for an american genetics company called biosyn and they were looking for uh large animals on the islands why would a biotech company be interested levine said it makes no sense maybe not to you and me guitierrez said but biosyns got a particularly unsavory reputation their head of research is a guy named lewis dodgson oh yeah levine said i know hes the guy who ran that rabies vaccine test in chile a few years back the one where they exposed farmers to rabies but didnt tell them they were doing it thats him he also started testmarketing a genetically engineered potato in supermarkets without telling anybody they were altered gave kids lowgrade diarrhea couple of them ended up in the hospital after that the company had to hire george baselton to fix their image seems like everybody hires baselton levine said guitierrez shrugged the bigname university professors consult these days its part of the deal and baselton is regis professor of biology the company needed him to clean up their mess because dodgson has a habit of breaking the law dodgson has people on his payroll all around the world steals other companies research the whole bit they say biosyns the only genetics company with more lawyers than scientists and why were they interested in costa rica levine asked guitierrez shrugged i dont know but the whole attitude toward research has changed richard its very noticeable here costa rica has one of the richest ecologies in the world half a million species in twelve distinct environmental habitats five percent of all the species on the planet are represented here this country has been a biological research center for years and i can tell you things have changed in the old days the people who came here were dedicated scientists with a passion to learn about something for its own sakehowler monkeys or polistine wasps or the sombrilla plant these people had chosen their field because they cared about it they certainly werent going to get rich but now everything in the biosphere is potentially valuable nobody knows where the next drug is coming from so drug companies fund all sorts of research maybe a bird egg has a protein that makes it waterproof maybe a spider produces a peptide that inhibits blood clotting maybe the waxy surface of a fern contains a painkiller it happens often enough that attitudes toward research have changed people arent studying the natural world any more theyre mining it its a looter mentality anything new or unknown is automatically of interest because it might have value it might be worth a fortune guitierrez drained his beer the world he said is turned upside down and the fact is that a lot of people want to know what these aberrant animals represent and where they come from the loudspeaker called levines flight both men stood up from the table guiitierrez said youll keep all this to yourself i mean what you saw today to be quite honest levine said i dont know what i saw today it could have been anything guitierrez grinned safe flight richard take care marty departure his backpack slung over his shoulder levine walked toward the departure lounge he turned to wave goodbye to guitierrez but his friend was already heading out the door raising his arm to wave for a taxi levine shrugged turned back directly ahead was the customs desk travelers lined up to have their passports stamped he was booked on a night flight to san francisco with a long stopover in mexico city not many people were queuing up he probably had time to call his office and leave word for his secretary linda that he would be on the flight and perhaps he thought he should also call malcolm looking around he saw a row of phones marked ict telefonos intfrnational along the wall to his right but there were only a few and all were in use he had better use the satellite phone in his backpack he thought as he swung the pack off his shoulder and perhaps it would be he paused frowning he looked back at the wall four people were using the phones the first was a blonde woman in shorts and a halter top bouncing a young sunburned child in her arms as she talked next to her stood a bearded man in a safari jacket who glanced repeatedly at his gold rolex watch then there was a grayhaired grandmotherly woman talking in spanish while her two fullgrown sons stood by nodding emphatically and the last person was the helicopter pilot he had removed his uniform jacket and was standing in short sleeves and tie he was turned away facing the wall shoulders hunched levine moved closer and heard the pilot speaking in english levine set his pack down and beiit over it pretending to adjust the straps while he listened the pilot was still turned away from him he heard the pilot say no no professor it is not that way no then there was a pause no the pilot said i am telling to you no i am sorry professor baselton but this is not known it is an island but which onewe must wait again for more no he leaves tonight no i think he does not know anything and no pictures no i understand adios levine ducked his head as the pilot walked briskly toward the lacsa desk at the other end of the airport what the hell he thought it is an island but which one how did they know it was an island levine himself was still not sure of that and he had been working intensively on these finds day and night trying to put it together where they had come from why it was happening he walked around the corner out of sight and pulled out the little satellite phone he dialed it quickly calling a number in san francisco the call went through rapidly clicking as it linked with the satellite it began to ring there was a beep an electronic voice said please enter your access code levine punched in a sixdigit number there was another beep the electronic voice said leave your message im calling levine said with the results of the trip single specimen not in good shape location bb on your map thats far south which fits all of our hypotheses i wasnt able to make a precise identification before they burned the specimen but my guess is that it was an ornitholestes as you know this animal is not on the list a highly sigificant finding he glanced around but no one was near him no one was paying attention furthermore the lateral femur was cut in a deep gash this is extremely disturbing he hesitated not wanting to say too much and i am sending back a sample that requires close examination i also think some other people are interested anyway whatever is going on down here is new ian there havent been any specimens for over a year and now theyre showing up again something new is happening and we dont understand it at all or do we levine thought he pressed the disconnect turned the phone off and replaced it in the other pocket of his backpack maybe he thought we know more than we realize he looked thoughtfully toward the departure gate it was time to catch his flight palo alto at am ed james pulled into the nearly deserted parking lot of the marie callenders on carter road the black bmw was already there parked near the entrance through the windows he could see dodgson sitting inside at a booth his bland features frowning dodgson was never in a good mood right now he was talking to the heavyset man alongside him and glancing at his watch the heavyset man was baselton the professor who appeared on television james always felt relieved whenever baselton was there dodgson gave him the creeps but it was hard to imagine baselton involved in anything shady james turned off the ignition and twisted the rearview mirror so he could see as he buttoned his shirt collar and pulled up his tie he glimpsed his face in the mirrora disheveled tired man with a twoday stubble of beard what the hell he thought why shouldnt he look tired it was the middle of the fucking night dodgson always scheduled his meetings in the middle of the night and always at this same damn marie callender restaurant james never understood why the coffee was awful but then there was a lot he didnt understand he picked up the manila envelope and got out of the car slamming the door he headed for the entrance shaking his head dodgson had been paying him five hundred dollars a day for weeks now to follow a bunch of scientists around at first james had assumed it was some sort of industrial espionage but none of the scientists worked for industry they held university appointments in pretty dull fields like that paleobotanist sattler whose specialty was prehistoric pollen grains james had sat through one of her lectures at berkeley and had barely been able to stay awake slide after slide of little pale spheres that looked like cotton balls while she nattered on about polysaccharide bonding angles and the campanianmaastrichtlan boundary jesus it was boring certainly not worth five hundred dollars a day he thought he went inside blinking in the light and walked over to the booth he sat down nodded to dodgson and baselton and raised his hand to order coffee from the waitress dodgson glared at him i havent got all night he said lets get started right james said lowering his hand fine sure he opened the envelope began pulling out sheets and photos handing them across the table to dodgson as he talked alan grant paleontologist at montana state at the moment hes on leave of absence and is now in paris lecturing on the latest dinosaur finds apparently he has some new ideas about tyrannosaurs being scavengers and never mind dodgson said go on ellen sattler reiman james said pushing across a photo botanist used to be involved with grant now married to a physicist at berkeley and has a young son and daughter she lectures halftime at the university spends the rest of her time at home because go on go on well most of the rest are deceased donald gennaro lawyerdied of dysentery on a business trip dennis nedry integrated computer systemsalso deceased john hammond who started international genetic technologiesdied while visiting the companys research facility in costa rica hammond had his grandchildren with him at the time the kids live with their mother back east and anybody contact them anybody from ingen no no contact the boys started college and the girl is in prep school and ingen filed for chapter protection after hammond died its been in the courts ever since the hard assets are finally being sold off during the last two weeks as a matter of fact baselton spoke for the first time is site b involved in that sale james looked blank site b yes has anybody talked to you about site b no ive never heard of it before what is it if you hear anything about site b baselton said we want to know sitting beside baselton in the booth dodgson thumbed through the pictures and data sheets then tossed them aside impatiently he looked up at james what else have you got thats all dr dodgson thats all dodgson said what about malcolm and what about levine are they still friends james consulted his notes im not sure baselton frowned not sure he said what do you mean youre not sure malcolm met levine at the santa fe institute james said they spent time together there a couple of years ago but malcolm hasnt gone back to santa fe recently hes taken a visiting lectureship at berkeley in the biology department he teaches mathematical models of evolution and he seems to have lost contact with levine they have a falling out maybe i was told they argued about levines expedition what expedition dodgson said leaning forward levines been planning some kind of expedition for a year or so hes ordered special vehicles from a company called mobile field systems its a small operation in woodside run by a guy named jack thorne thorne outfits jeeps and trucks for scientists doing field research scientists in africa and sichuan and chile all swear by them malcolm knows about this expedition he must hes gone to thornes place occasionally every month or so and of course levines been going there almost every day thats how he got thrown in jail thrown in jail baselton said yeah james said glancing at his notes lets see february tenth levine was arrested for driving a hundred and twenty in a fifteen zone right in front of woodside junior high the judge impounded his ferrari yanked his license and gave him community service basically ordered him to teach a class at the school baselton smiled richard levine teaching junior high id love to see that hes been pretty conscientious of course hes spending time in woodside anyway with thorne that is until he left the country when did he leave the country dodgson said two days ago he went to costa rica short trip he was due back early this morning and where is he now i dont know and im afraid uh its going to be hard to find out why is that james hesitated coughed because he was on the passenger manifest of the flight from costa rica but he wasnt on the plane when it landed my contact in costa rica says he checked out of his hotel in san jose before the flight and never went back didnt take any other flight out of the city so uh for the moment im afraid that richard levine has disappeared there was a long silence dodgson sat back in the booth hissing between his teeth he looked at baselton who shook his head dodgson very carefully picked up all the sheets of paper tapped them on the table making a neat stack he slipped them back into the manila envelope and handed the envelope to james now listen you stupid son of a bitch dodgson said theres only one thing i want from you now its very simple are you listening james swallowed im listening dodgson leaned across the table find him he said berkeley in his cluttered office malcolm looked up from his desk as his assistant beverly came into the room she was followed by a man from dhl carrying a small box im sorry to disturb you dr malcolm but you have to sign these formsits that sample from costa rica malcolm stood and walked around the desk he didnt use his cane in recent weeks he had been working steadily to walk without the cane he still had occasional pain in his leg but he was determined to make progress even his physical therapist a perpetually cheery woman named cindy had commented on it gee after all these years suddenly youre motivated dr malcolm she had said whats going on oh you know malcolm had said to her cant rely on a cane forever the truth was rather different confronted by levines relentless enthusiasm for the lostworld hypothesis his excited telephone calls at all hours of the day and night malcolm had begun to reconsider his own views and he had come to believe that it was quite possible even probable that extinct animals existed in a remote previously unsuspected location malcolm had his own reasons for thinking so which he had only hinted at to levine but the possibility of another island location was what led him to walk unaided he wanted to prepare for a future visit to this island and so he had begun to make the effort day after day he and levine had narrowed their search down to a string of islands along the costa rican coast and levine was as always very intense in his excitement but to malcolm it remained hypothetical he refused to get excited until there was hard evidence photographs or actual tissue samples to demonstrate the existence of new animals and so far malcolm had seen nothing at all he was not sure whether he was disappointed or relieved but in any case levines sample had arrived malcolm took the clipboard from the delivery man and quickly signed the top form delivery of excluded materials samples biological research the delivery man said you have to check the boxes sir malcolm looked at the list of questions running down the page with a check box beside each was the specimen alive was the specimen cultures of bacteria fungi viruses or protozoa was the specimen registered tinder an established research protocol was the specimen contagious was the specimen taken from a farm or animalhusbandry site was the specimen plant matter propagative seeds or bulbs was the specimen insect or insectrelated he checked off no to everything and the next page too sir the delivery man said he was looking around the office at the stacks of papers heaped untidily about the maps on the walls with the colored pins stuck in them you do medical research here malcolm flipped the page scrawled his signature on the next form no and one more sir the third form was a release of liability to the carrier malcolm signed it as well the delivery man said have a good day and left immediately malcolm sagged resting his weight on the edge of the desk he winced still hurt beverly said she took the specimen to the side table pushed some papers away and began to unwrap it im okay he looked over at the cane resting beside his chair behind the desk then he took a breath and crossed the room slowly beverly had the wrapping off the package revealing a small stainlesssteel cylinder the size of his fist a triplebladed biohazard sign was taped across the screwtop lid attached to the cylinder was a second small canister with a metal valve it contained the refrigerant gas malcolm swung the light over the cylinder and said lets see what be was so excited about he broke the taped seal and unscrewed the lid there was a hiss of gas and a faint white puff of condensation the exterior of the cylinder frosted over peering in he saw a plastic baggie and a sheet of paper he upended the cylinder dumping the contents onto the table the baggie contained a ragged piece of greenish flesh about two inches square with a small green plastic tag attached to it he held it up to the light examined it with a magnifying glass then set it down again he looked at the green skin the pebbled texture maybe he thought maybe beverly he said call elizabeth gelman over at the zoo tell her i have something i want her to look at and tell her its confidential beverly nodded and went out of the room to phone alone malcolm unrolled the strip of paper that had come with the sample it was a piece of paper torn from a yellow legal pad in block printing it said i was right and you were wrong malcolm frowned that son of a bitch he thought beverly after you call elizabeth get richard levine at his office i need to talk to him right away the lost world richard levine pressed his face to the warm rock cliff and paused to catch his breath five hundred feet below the ocean surged waves thundering brilliant white against the black rocks the boat that had brought him was already heading east again a small white speck on the horizon it had to return for there was no safe harbor anywhere on this desolate inhospitable island for now they were on their own levine took a deep breath and looked down at diego twenty feet below him on the cliff face diego was burdened with the backpack that contained all their equipment but he was young and strong he smiled cheerfully and nodded his head upward have courage it is not far now senor i hope so levine said when he had examined the cliff through binoculars from the boat this had seemed like a good place to make the ascent but in fact the cliff face was nearly vertical and incredibly dangerous because the volcanic rock was crumbling and friable levine raised his arms fingers extending upward reaching for the next handhold he clung to the rock small pebbles broke free and his hand slipped down he gripped again then pulled himself upward he was breathing hard from exertion and fear just twenty meters more senor diego said encouragingly you can do it im sure i can levine muttered considering the alternative as he neared the top of the cliff the wind blew harder whistling in his ears tugging at his clothes it felt as if it was trying to stick him away from the rock looking up he saw the dense foliage that grew right to the edge of the cliff face almost there he thought almost and then with a final heave he pushed himself over the top and collapsed rolling in soft wet ferns still gasping he looked back and saw diego come over lightly easily lie squatted on the mossy grass and smiled levine turned away staring at the huge ferns overhead releasing the accumulated tension of the climb in long shuddering breaths his legs burned fiercely but no matter he was here finally he looked at the jungle around him it was primary forest undisturbed by the hand of man exactly as the satellite images had shown levine had been forced to rely on satellite photographs because there were no maps available of private islands such as this one this island existed as a kind of lost world isolated in the midst of the pacific ocean levine listened to the sound of the wind the rustle of the palm fronds that dripped water onto his face and then he heard another sound distant like the cry of a bird but deeper more resonant as he listened he heard it again a sharp sizzle nearby made him look over diego had struck a match was raising it to light a cigarette quickly levine sat up pushed the younger mans hand away and shook his head no diego frowned puzzled levine put his finger to his lips he pointed in the direction of the bird sound diego shrugged his expression indifferent he was unimpressed he saw no reason for concern that was because he didnt understand what they were up against levine thought as he unzipped the darkgreen backpack and began to assemble the big lindstradt rifle the rifle had been specially manufactured for him in sweden and represented the latest in animalcontrol technology he screwed the barrel into the stock locked in the fluger clip checked the gas charge and handed the rifle to diego diego took it with another shrug meanwhile levine removed the black anodized lindstradt pistol in its holster and buckled it around his waist he removed the pistol checked the safety twice and put the pistol back in the holster levine got to his feet gestured for diego to follow him diego zipped up the backpack and shouldered it again the two men started down the sloping hillside away from the cliff almost immediately their clothes were soaked from the wet foliage they had no views they were surrounded on all sides by dense jungle and could see only a few yards ahead the fronds of the ferns were enormous as long and broad as a mans body the plants twenty feet tall with rough spiky stalks and high above the ferns a great canopy of trees blocked most of the sunlight they moved in darkness silently on damp spongy earth levine paused often to consult his wrist compass they were heading west down a steep slope toward the interior of the island he knew that the island was the remains of an ancient volcanic crater eroded and decomposed by centuries of weathering the interior terrain consisted of a series of ridges that led down to the floor of the crater but particularly here on the eastern side the landscape was steep rugged and treacherous the sense of isolation of having returned to a primordial world was palpable levines heart pounded as he continued down the slope across a marshy stream and then up again at the top of the next ridge there was a break in the foliage and he felt a welcome breeze from his vantage point he was able to see to the far side of the island a rim of hard black cliff miles away between here and the cliffs they saw nothing but gently undulating jungle standing beside him diego said fantastico levine quickly shushed him but senor he protested pointing to the view we are alone here levine shook his head annoyed he had gone over all this with diego during the boat ride over once on the island no speaking no hair pomade no cologne no cigarettes all food sealed tightly in plastic bags everything packed with great care nothing to produce a smell or make a sound he had warned diego again and again of the importance of all these precautions but now it was obvious that diego had paid no attention he didnt understand levine poked diego angrily and shook his head again diego smiled senor please there are only birds here at that moment they heard a deep rumbling sound an unearthly cry that arose from somewhere in the forest below them after a moment the cry was answered from another part of the forest diegos eyes widened levine mouthed birds diego was silent he bit his lip and stared out at the forest to the south they saw a place where the tops of the trees began to move a whole section of forest that suddenly seemed to come alive as if brushed by wind but the rest of the forest was not moving it was not the wind diego crossed himself quickly they heard more cries lasting nearly a minute and then silence descended again levine moved off the ridge and headed down the jungle slope going deeper into the interior he was moving forward quickly looking at the ground watching for snakes when he heard a low whistle behind him he turned and saw diego pointing to the left levine doubled back pushed through the fronds and followed diego as he moved south in a few moments they came upon two parallel tracks in the dirt long since overgrown with grass and ferns but clearly recognizable as an old jeep trail leading off into the jungle of course they would follow it he knew their progress would be much faster on a road levine gestured and diego took off the backpack it was levines turn he shouldered the weight adjusted the straps in silence they started down the road in places the jeep track was hardly recognizable so thickly had the jungle grown back clearly no one had used this road for many years and the jungle was always ready to return behind him diego grunted swore softly levine turned and saw diego lifting his foot gingerly he had stepped to midankle in a pile of green animaldroppings levine went back diego scraped his boot clean on the stem of a fern the droppings appeared to be composed of pale flecks of hay mixed with green the material was light and crumbly dried old there was no smell levine searched the ground carefully until he found the remainder of the original spoor the droppings were well formed twelve centimeters in diameter definitely left behind by some large herbivore diego was silent but his eyes were wide levine shook his head continued on as long as they saw signs of herbivore he wasnt going to worry at least not too much even so his fingers touched the butt of his pistol as if for reassurance they came to a stream muddy banks on both sides here levine paused he saw clear threetoed footprints in the mud some of them quite large the palm of his own hand fingers spread wide fitted easily inside one of the prints with room to spare when he looked up diego was crossing himself again he held the rifle in his other hand they waited at the stream listening to the gentle gurgle of the water something shiny glinted in the stream catching his eye he bent over and plucked it out it was a piece of glass tubing roughly the size of a pencil one end was broken off there were graduated markings along the side he realized it was a pipette of the kind used in laboratories everywhere in the world levine held it up to the light turning it in his fingers it was odd he thought a pipette like this implied levine turned and caught a glimpse of movement out of the corner of his eye something small and brown scurrying across the mud of the riverbank something about the size of a rat diego grunted in surprise then it was gone disappearing in foliage levine moved forward and crouched in the maid by the stream he peered at the footprints left by the tiny animal the footprints were threetoed like the tracks of a bird he saw more threetoed tracks including some bigger ones which were several inches across levine had seen such prints before in trackways such as the purgatoire river in colorado where the ancient shoreline was now fossilized the dinosaur tracks frozen in stone but these prints were in fresh mud and they had been made by living animals sitting on his haunches levine heard a soft squeak coming from somewhere to his right looking over he saw the ferns moving slightly he stayed very still waiting after a moment a small animal peeked out from among the fronds it appeared to be the size of a mouse it had smooth hairless skin and large eyes mounted high on its tiny head it was greenishbrown in color and it made a continuous irritable squeaking sound at levine as if to drive him away levine stayed motionless hardly daring to breathe he recognized this creature of course it was a mussaurtis a tiny prosauropod from the late triassic skeletal remains were found only in south america it was one of the smallest dinosaurs known a dinosaur he thought even though he had expected i to see them on this island it was still startling to be confronted by a living breathing member of the dinosauria especially one so small he could not take his eyes off it he was entranced after all these years after all the dusty skeletons an actual living dinosaur the little mussaur ventured farther out from the protection of the fronds now levine could see that it was longer than he had thought at first it was actually about ten centimeters long with a surprisingly thick tail all told it looked very much like a lizard it sat upright squatting on its hind legs on the frond he saw the rib cage moving as the animal breathed it waved its tiny forearms in the air at levine and squeaked repeatedly slowly very slowly levine extended his hand the creature squeaked again but did not run if anything it seemed curious cocking its head the way very small animals do as levines hand came closer finally levines fingers touched the tip of the frond the mussaur stood on its hind legs balancing with its outstretched tail showing no sign of fear it stepped lightly onto levines hand and stood in the creases of his palm he hardly felt the weight it was so light the mussaur walked around sniffed levines fingers levine smiled charmed then suddenly the little creature hissed in annoyance and jumped off his hand disappearing into the palms levine blinked unable to understand why then he smelled a foul odor and heard a heavy rustling in the bushes on the other side there was a soft grunting sound more rustling for a brief moment levine remembered that carnivores in the wild hunted near streambeds attacking animals when they were vulnerable bending over to drink but the recognition came too late he heard a terrifying highpitched cry and when he turned he saw that diego was screaming as his body was hauled away into the bushes diego struggled the bushes shook fiercely levine caught a glimpse of a single large foot its middle toe bearing a short curving claw then the foot pulled back the bushes continued to shake suddenly the forest erupted in frightening animal roars all around him he glimpsed a large animal charging him richard levine turned and fled feeling the adrenaline surge of pure panic not knowing where to go knowing only that it was hopeless he felt a heavy weight suddenly tear at his backpack forcing him to his knees in the mud and he realized in that moment that despite all his planning despite all his clever deductions things had gone terribly wrong and he was about to die school when we consider mass extinction from a meteor impact richard levine said we must ask several questions first are there any impact craters on our planet larger than nineteen miles in diameterwhich is the smallest size necessary to cause a worldwide extinction event and second do any craters match in time a known extinction it turns out there are a dozen craters this large around the world of which five coincide with known extinctions kelly curtis yawned in the darkness of her seventhgrade classroom sitting at her desk she propped her chin on her elbows and tried to stay awake she already knew this stuff the tv set in front of the class showed a vast cornfield seen in an aerial view the curving outlines faintly visible she recognized it as the crater in manson in the darkness dr levines recorded voice said this is the crater in manson iowa dating from sixtyfive million years ago just when dinosaurs became extinct but was this the meteor that killed the dinosaurs no kelly thought yawning probably the yucatan peninsula manson was too small we now think this crater is too small dr levine said aloud we believe it was too small by an order of magnitude and the current candidate is the crater near merida in the yucatan it seems difficult to imagine but the impact emptied the entire gulf of mexico causing twothousandfoothigh tidal waves to wash over the land it must have been incredible but there are disputes about this crater too particularly concerning the meaning of the cenote ring structure and the differential death rates of phytoplankton in ocean deposits that may sound complicated but dont worry about it for now well go into it in more detail next time so thats it for today the lights came up their teacher mrs menzies stepped to the front of the class and turned off the computer which had been running the display and the lecture well she said im glad dr levine gave us this recording he told me he might not be back in time for todays lecture but hell be with us again for sure when we return from spring break next week kelly you and arby are working for dr levine is that what he told you kelly glanced over at arby who was slouched low in his seat frowning yes mrs menzies kelly said good all right everyone the assignment for the holidays is all of chapter seven there were groans from the class including all of the exercises at the end of part one as well as part two be sure to bring that with you completed when we return have a good spring break well see you back here in a week the bell rang the class got up chairs scraping the room suddenly noisy arby drifted over to kelly he looked up at her mournfully arby was a head shorter than kelly he was the shortest person in the class he was also the youngest kelly was thirteen like the other seventhgraders but arby was only eleven he had already been skipped two grades because he was so smart and there were rumors he would be skipped again arby was a genius particularly with computers arby put his pen in the pocket of his white buttondown shirt and pushed his hornrim glasses up on his nose r b benton was black both his parents were doctors in san jose and they always made sure he was dressed very neatly like a college kid or something which kelly reflected he would probably be in a couple of years the way he was going standing next to arby kelly always felt awkward and gawky kelly had to wear her sisters old clothes which her mother had bought from kmart about a million years ago she even had to wear emilys old reeboks which were so scuffed and dirty that they never came clean even after kelly ran them through the washing machine kelly washed and ironed all her own clothes her mother never had time her mother was never even home most of the time kelly looked enviously at arbys neatly pressed khakis his polished penny loafers and sighed still even though she was jealous arby was her only real friend the only person who thought it was okay that she was smart kelly worried that hed be skipped to ninth grade and she wouldnt see him any more beside her arby still frowned he looked up at her and said why isnt dr levine here i dont know she said maybe something happened like what i dont know something but he promised he would be here arby said to take us on the field trip it was all arranged we got permission and everything so we can still go but he should be here arby insisted stubbornly kelly had seen this behavior before arby was accustomed to adults being reliable his parents were both very reliable kelly wasnt troubled by such ideas never mind arb she said lets just go see dr thorne ourselves you think so sure why not arby hesitated maybe i should call my mom first why kelly said you know shell tell you that you have to go home come on arb lets just go he hesitated still troubled arby might be smart but any change in plan always bothered him kelly knew from experience he would grumble and argue if she pushed for them to go alone she had to wait while he made up his own mind okay he said finally lets go see thorne kelly grinned meet you in front she said in five minutes as she went down the stairs from the second floor the singsong chant began again kelly is a brainer kelly is a brainer she held her head high it was that stupid allison stone and her stupid friends standing at the bottom of the stairs taunting her kelly is a brainer she swept past the girls ignoring them nearby she saw miss enders the hall mointor paying no attention as usual even though mr canosa the assistant principal had recently made a special homeroom announcement about teasing kids behind her the girls called kelly is a brainershes the queenof the screenand its gonna turn her green they collapsed in laughter up ahead she saw arby waiting by the door a bundle of gray cables in his hand she hurried forward when she got to him he said forget it theyre stupid jerkoffs right i dont care anyway i know just forget it behind them the girls were giggling kelly and arbygoing to a partytake a bath in their math they went outside into the sunlight the sounds of the girls thankfully drowned in the noise of everyone going home yellow school buses were in the parking lot kids were streaming down the steps to their parents cars which were lined up all around the block there was a lot of activity arby ducked a frisbee that whooshed over his head and glanced toward the street there he is again well dont look at him kelly said im not im not remember what dr levine said jeez kel i remember okay across the street was parked the plain gray taurus sedan that they had seen off and on for the past two months behind the wheel pretending to read a newspaper was that same man with the scraggly growth of beard this bearded man had been following dr levine ever since he started to teach the class at woodside kelly believed that man was the reason why dr levine asked her and arby to be his assistants in the first place levine had told them their job would be to help him by carrying equipment xeroxing class assignments collecting homework and routine things like that they thought it would be a big honor to work for dr levine or anyway interesting to work for an actual professional scientist so they had agreed to do it but it turned out there never was anything to be done for the class dr levine did all that himself instead he sent them on lots of little errands and he had told them to be careful to avoid this bearded man ill the car that wasnt hard the man never paid any attention to them because they were kids dr levine had explained the bearded man was following him because of something to do with his arrest but kelly didnt believe that her own mother had been arrested twice for drunk driving and there was never anybody following her so kelly didnt know why this man was following levine but clearly levine was doing some secret research and he didnt want anybody to find out about it she knew one thing dr levine didnt care much about this class he was reaching he usually gave the lecture off the top of his head other times he would walk in the front door of the school hand them a taped lecture and walk out the back they never knew where he went on those days the errands he sent them on were mysterious too once they went to stanford and picked up five small squares of plastic from a professor there the plastic was light and sort of foamy another time they went downtown to an electronics store and picked up a triangular device that the man behind the counter gave them very nervously as if it might be illegal or something another time they picked up a metal tube that looked like it contained cigars they couldnt help opening it but they were uneasy to find four sealed plastic ampoules of strawcolored liquid the ampoules were marked extreme danger lethal toxicity and had the threebladed international symbol for biohazard but mostly their assignments were mundane he often sent them to libraries at stanford to xerox papers on all sorts of subjects japanese swordmaking xray crystallography mexican vampire bats central american volcanoes oceanic currents of el nino the mating behavior of mountain sheep seacucumber toxicity flying buttresses of gothic cathedrals dr levine never explained why he was interested in these subjects often he would send them back day after day to search for more material and then suddenly he would drop the subject and never refer to it again and they would be on to something else of course they could figure some of it out a lot of the questions had to do with the vehicles that dr thorne was building for dr levines expedition but most of the time the subjects were completely mysterious occasionally kelly wondered what the bearded man would make of all this she wondered whether he knew something they did not but actually the bearded man seemed kind of lazy he never seemed to figure out that kelly and arby were doing errands for dr levine right now the bearded man glanced over at the entrance to the school ignoring them they walked to the end of the street and sat on the bench to wait for the bus tag the baby snow leopard spit the bottle out and rolled over onto its back paws in the air it made a soft mewing sound she wants to be petted elizabeth gelman said malcolm reached out his hand to stroke the belly the cub spun around and sunk its tiny teeth into his fingers malcolm yelled she does that sometimes gelman said dorje bad girl is that any way to treat our distinguished visitor she reached out took malcolms hand it didnt break the skin but we should clean it anyway they were in the white research laboratory of the san francisco zoo at three oclock in the afternoon elizabeth gelman the youthful head of research was supposed to report on her findings but they had to delay for the afternoon feeding in the nursery malcolm had watched them feed a baby gorilla which spit up like a human baby and a koala and then the very cute snowleopard cub sorry about that gelman said she took him to a side basin and soaped his hand but i thought it was better that you come here now when the regular staff is all at the weekly conference why is that because theres a lot of interest in the material you gave us ian a lot she dried his hand with a towel inspected it again i think youll survive what have you found malcolm said to her you have to admit it is very provocative by the way is it from costa rica keeping his voice neutral malcolm said why do you say that because there are all these rumors about unknown animals showing up in costa rica and this is definitely an unknown animal ian she led him out of the nursery and into a small conference room he dropped into a chair resting his cane on the table she lowered the lights and clicked on a slide protector okay heres a closeup of your original material before we be an our examination as you see it consists of a fragment of animal tissue in a state of very advanced necrosis the tissue measures four centimeters by six centimeters attached to it is a green plastic tag measuring two centimeters square tissue cut by a knife but not a very sharp one malcolm nodded whatd you use ian your pocketknife something like that all right lets deal with the tissue sample first the slide changed malcolm saw a microscopic view this is a gross histologic section through the superficial epidermis those patchy ragged gaps are where the postmortem necrotic change has eroded the skin surface but what is interesting is the arrangement of epidermal cells youll notice the density of chromatophores or pigmentbearing cells in the cut section you see the difference between melanophores here and allophores here the overall pattern is suggestive of a lacerta or amblythynchtis you mean a lizard malcolm said yes she said it looks like a lizardthough the picture is not entirely consistent she tapped the left side of the screen you see this one cell here which has this slight rim in section we believe thats muscle the chromatophore could open and close meaning that this animal could change color like a chameleon and over here you see this large oval shape with a pale center thats the pore of a femoral scent gland there is a waxy substance in the center which we are still analyzing but our presumption is that this animal was male since only male lizards have femoral glands i see malcolm said she changed the slide malcolm saw what looked like a closeup of a sponge going deeper here we see the structure of the subcutaneous layers highly distorted because of gas bubbles from the clostridia infection that bloated the animal but you can get a sense of the vessels see one here and another here which are surrounded by smooth muscle fibers this is not characteristic of lizards in fact the whole appearance of this slide is wrong for lizards or reptiles of any sort you mean it looks warmblooded right gelman said not really mammalian but perhaps avian this could be oh i dont know a dead pelican something like that uhhuh except no pelican has a skin like that i see malcolm said and there s no feathers uhhuh now gelman said we were able to extract a minute quantity of blood from the intraarterial spaces not much but enough to conduct a microscopic examination here it is the slide changed again he saw a jumble of cells mostly red cells and an occasional misshapen white cell it was confusing to look at this isnt my area elizabeth he said well ill just give you the highlights she said first of all nucleated red cells thats characteristic of birds not mammals second rather atypical hemoglobin differing in several base pairs from other lizards third aberrant whitecell structure we dont have enough material to make a determination but we suspect this animal has a highly unusual immune system whatever that means malcolm said with a shrug we dont know and the sample doesnt give us enough to find out by the way can you get more i might be able to he said where from site b malcolm looked puzzled site b well thats whats embossed on the tag she changed the slide i must say ian this tag is very interesting here at the zoo we tag animals all the time and were familiar with all the ordinary commercial brands sold around the world nobodys seen this tag before here it is magnified ten times the actual object is roughly the size of your thumbnail uniform plastic outer surface attaches to the animal by a teflon coated stainlesssteel clip on the other side its a rather small clip of the kind used to tag infants the animal you saw was adult presumably so the tag was probably in place for a while ever since the animal was young gelman said which makes sense considering the degree of weathering youll notice the pitting on the surface thats very unusual this plastic is duralon the stuff they use to make football helmets its extremely tough and this pitting cant have occurred through simple wear then what its almost certainly a chemical reaction such as exposure to acid perhaps in aerosol form like volcanic fumes malcolm said that could do it particularly in view of what else weve learned youll notice that the tag is rather thick actually its nine millimeters across and its hollow hollow malcolm said frowning yes it contains an inner cavity we didnt want to open it so we x rayed it here the slide changed malcolm saw a jumble of white lines and boxes inside the tag there appears to be substantial corrosion again perhaps from acid fumes but theres no question what this once was its a radio tag ian which means that this unusual animal this warmblooded lizard or whatever it was was tagged and raised by somebody from birth and thats the part thats got people around here upset somebodys raising these things do you know how that happened i havent the faintest idea malcolm said elizabeth gelman sighed youre a lying son of a bitch he held out his hand may i have my sample back she said ian after all ive done for you the sample i think you owe me an explanation and i promise youll have one in about two weeks ill buy dinner she tossed a silverfoil package on the table he picked it up and slipped it in his pocket thanks liz he got up to go i hate to run but ive got to make a call right away he started for the door and she said by the way how did it die ian this animal he paused why do you ask because when we teased up the skin cells we found a few foreign cells under the outer epidermal layer cells belonging to another animal meaning what well its the typical picture you see when two lizards fight they rub against each other cells get pushed under the superficial layer yes he said there were signs of a fight on the carcass the annimal had been wounded and you should also know there were signs of chronic vasoconstriction in the arterial vessels this animal was under stress ian and not just from the fight that wounded it that would have disappeared in early postmortem changes im talking about chronic continuous stress wherever this creature lived its environment was extremely stressful and dangerous i see so how come a tagged animal has such a stressful life at the entrance to the zoo he looked around to see if he was being followed then stopped at a pay phone and dialed levine the machine picked up levine wasnt there typical malcolm thought whenever you needed him he wasnt there probably off trying to get his ferrari out of impound again malcolm hung up and headed toward his car thorne thorne mobile field systems was stenciled in black lettering on a large rolling metal garage door at the far end of the industrial park there was a regular door to the left arby pushed the buzzer on a small box with a grille a gruff voice said go away its us dr thorne arby and kelly oh okay there was a click as the door unlocked and they walked inside they found themselves in a large open shed workmen were making modifications on several vehicles the air smelled of acetylene engine oil and fresh paint directly ahead kelly saw a darkgreen ford explorer with its roof cut open two assistants stood on ladders fitting a large flat panel of black solar cells over the top of the car the hood of the explorer was up and the v engine had been pulled out workmen were now lowering a small new engine in its place it looked like a rounded shoebox with the dull shine of aluminum alloy others were bringing the wide flat rectangle of the hughes converter that would be mounted on top of the motor over to the right she saw the two rv trailers that thornes team had been working on for the last few weeks they werent the usual trailers you saw people driving for the weekends one was enormous and sleek almost as big as a bus and outfitted with living and sleeping quarters for four people as well as all sorts of special scientific equipment it was called challenger and it had an unusual feature once you parked it the walls could slide outward expanding the inside dimensions the challenger trailer was made to connect up through a special accordion passageway to the second trailer which was somewhat smaller and was pulled by the first this second rv contained laboratory equipment and some very hightech refinements though kelly wasnt sure exactly what right now the second trailer was nearly hidden by the huge stream of sparks that spit out from a welder on the roof despite all the activity the trailer looked mostly finishedalthough she could see people working inside and all the upholstery the chairs and seats were lying around on the ground outside thorne himself was standing in the middle of the room shouting at the welder on the roof of the camper come on come on weve got to be finished today eddie lets go he turned shouted again no no no look at the plans henry you cant place that strut laterally it has to be crosswise for strength look at the plans doc thorne was a grayhaired barrelchested man of fiftyfive except for his wireframe glasses he looked as if he might be a retired prizefighter it was hard for kelly to imagine thorne as a university professor he was immensely strong and in continuous movement damn it henry henry henry are you listening to me thorne swore again and shook his fist in the air he turned to the kids these guys he said theyre supposed to be helping me from the explorer there was a whitehot crack like lightning the two men leaning into the hood jumped away as a cloud of acrid smoke rose above the car whatd i tell you thorne shouted ground it ground it before you do anything weve got serious voltages here guys youre going to get fried if youre not careful he looked back at the kids and shook his head they just dont get it he said that iud is serious defense iud internal ursine deterrentthats what levine calls it its his idea of a joke thorne said actually i developed this system a few years back for park rangers in yellowstone where bears break into trailers flip a switch and you run ten thousand volts across the outer skin of the trailer whamo takes the fight out of the biggest bear but that kind of voltagell blow these guys right off the trailer and then what i get a workmenscompensation suit for their stupidity he shook his head so wheres levine we dont know arby said what do you mean didnt he teach your class today no he didnt come thorne swore again well i need him today to go over the final revisions before we do our field testing he was supposed to be back today back from where kelly said oh he went on one of his field trips thorne said very excited about it before he went i outfitted him myself loaned him my latest field pack everything he could ever want in just fortyseven pounds he liked it left last monday four days ago for where how should i know thorne said he wouldnt tell me and i gave up asking you know theyre all the same now every scientist i deal with is secretive but you cant blame them theyre all afraid of being ripped off or sued the modern world last year i built equipment for an expedition to the amazon we waterproofed it which youd want in the amazon rain forest soakingwet electronics just dont work and the principal scientist was charged with misappropriating funds for waterproofing some university bureaucrat said it was an unnecessary expense im telling you its insane just insane henry did you hear anything i said to you put it crosswise thorne strode across the room waving his arms the kids followed behind him but now look at this thorne said for months weve been modfying his field vehicles and finally were ready he wants them light i build them light he wants them strong i build them stronglight and strong both why not its just impossible what hes asking for but with enough titanium and honeycarbon composite were doing it anyway he wants it off petroleum base and off the grid and we do that too so finally hes got what he wanted an immensely strong portable laboratory to go where theres no gasoline and no electricity and now that its finished i cant believe it he really didnt show up for your class no kelly said so hes disappeared thorne said wonderful perfect what about our field test we were going to take these vehicles out for a week and put them through their paces i know kelly said we got permission from our parents and everything so we could go too and now hes not here thorne fumed i suppose i should have expected it these rich kids they do whatever they want a guy like levine gives spoiled a bad name from the ceiling a large metal cage came crashing down landing next to them on the floor thorne jumped aside eddie damn will you watch it sorry doc said eddie carr high up in the rafters but specs are it cant deform at twelve thousand psi we had to test it thats fine eddie but dont test it when were linder it thorne bent to examine the cage which was circular constructed of inchthick titaniumalloy bars it had survived the fall without harm and it was light thorne lifted it upright with one hand it was about six feet high and four feet in diameter it looked like an oversized bird cage it had a swinging door fitted with a heavy lock whats that for arby asked actually thorne said its part of that he pointed i across the room where a workman was putting together a stack of telescoping aluminum struts high observation platform made to be assembled in the field scaffolding sets up into a rigid structure about fifteen feet high fitted with a little shelter on top also collapsible a platform to observe what arby said thorne said he didnt tell you no kelly said no arby said well he didnt tell me either thorne said shaking his head all i know is he wants everything immensely strong light and strong light and strong impossible he sighed god save me from academics i thought you were an academic kelly said former academic thorne said briskly now i actually make things i dont just talk colleagues who knew jack thorne agreed that retirement marked the happiest period in his life as a professor of applied engineering and a specialist in exotic materials he had always demonstrated a practical focus and a love of students his most famous course at stanford structural engineering a was known among the students as thorny problems because thorne continually provoked his class to solve appliedengineering challenges he set for them some of these had long since entered into student folklore there was for example the toilet paper disaster thorne asked the students to drop a carton of eggs from hoover tower without injury as padding they could only use the cardboard tubes at the center of toilet paper rolls there were spattered eggs all over the plaza below then another year thorne asked the students to build a chair to support a twobundredpound man using only paper qtips and thread and another time he hung the answer sheet for the final exam from the classroom ceiling and invited his students to pull it down using whatever they could make with a cardboard shoebox containing a pound of licorice and some toothpicks when he was not in class thorne often served as an expert witness in legal cases involving materials engineering he specialized in explosions crashed airplanes collapsed buildings and other disasters these forays into the real world sharpened his view that scientists needed the widest possible education he used to say how can you design for people if you dont know history and psychology you cant because your mathematical formulas may be perfect but the people will screw it up and if that happens it means you screwed it up he peppered his lectures with quotations from plato chaka zulu emerson and changtzu but as a professor who was popular with his studentsand who advocated general educationthorne found himself swimming against the tide the academic world was marching toward ever more specialized knowledge expressed in ever more dense jargon in this climate being liked by your students was a sign of shallowness and interest in realworld problems was proof of intellectual poverty and a distressing indifference to theory but in the end it was his fondness for changtzu that pushed him out the door in a departmental meeting one of his colleagues got up and announced that some mythical chinese bullshitter means fuckall for engineering thorne took early retirement a month later and soon after started his own company he enjoyed his work thoroughly but he missed contact with the students which was why he liked levines two youthful assistants these kids were smart they were enthusiastic and they were young enough so that the schools hadnt destroyed all their interest in learning they could still actually use their brains which in thornes view was a sure sign they hadnt yet completed a formal education jerry thorne bellowed to one of the welders on the rvs balance the struts on both sides remember the crash tests thorne pointed to a video monitor set on the floor which showed a computer image of the rv crashing into a barrier first it crashed endon then it crashed sideways then it rolled and crashed again each time the vehicle survived with very little damage the computer program had been developed by the auto companies and then discarded thorne acquired it and modified it of course the auto companies discarded it its a good idea dont want any good ideas coming out of a big company might lead to a good product he sighed using this computer weve crashed these vehicles ten thousand times designing crashing modeling crashing again no theories just actual testing the way it ought to be thornes dislike of theory was legendary in his view a theory was nothing more than a substitute for experience put forth by someone who didnt know what he was talking about and now look jerry jerry whyd we do all these simulations if you guys arent going to follow the plans is everybody braindead around here sorry doc dont be sorry be right well were massively overbuilt anyway oh is that your decision youre the designer now just follow the plans arby trotted alongside thorne im worried about dr levine he said really im not but hes always been reliable and very well organized thats true thorne said hes also completely impulsive and does whatever he feels like maybe so arby said but i dont think hed be missing without a good reason im afraid he might be in trouble only last week he had us go with him to visit professor malcolm in berkeley who had this map of the world in his office and it showed malcolm thorne snorted spare me peas in a pod those two each more impractical than the other but id better get hold of levine now he turned on his heel and walked toward his office arby said you going to use the satphone thorne paused the what the satphone arby said didnt dr levine take a satphone with him how could he thorne said you know the smallest satellite phones are the size of a suitcase yeah but they dont have to be arby said you could have made one very small could i how despite himself thorne was amused by this kid you had to like him with that vlsi com board that we picked up arby said the triangular one it had two motorola bsn chip arrays and theyre restricted technology developed for the cia because they allow you to make a thorne said interrupting him where did you learn all this ive warned you about hacking systems dont worry im careful arby said but its true about the com board isnt it you could use it to make a onepound satphone so did you thorne stared at him for a long time maybe he said finally what of it arby grinned cool he said thornes small office was located in a corner of the shed inside the walls were plastered with blueprints order forms on clipboards and threedimensional cutaway computer drawings electronic components equipment catalogs and stacks of faxes were scattered across his desk thorne rummaged through them and finally came up with a small gray handheld telephone here we are he held it up for arby to see pretty good huh designed it myself kelly said it looks just like a cellular phone yes but its not a cellular phone uses a grid in place a satellite phone links directly to communication satellites in space with one of these i can talk anywhere in the world he dialed swiftly used to be they needed a threefoot dish then it was a onefoot dish now no dish at all just the handset not bad if i say so myself lets see if hes answering he pushed the speakerphone they heard the call dial through hissing static knowing richard thorne said he probably just missed his plane or forgot that he was supposed to be back here today for final approvals and were pretty much finished here when you see were down to the exterior struts and the upholstery the fact is were done hes going to hold us up its very inconsiderate of him the phone rang repeated electronic beeps if i cant get through to him ill try sarah harding sarah harding kelly asked looking up arby said whos sarah harding only the most famous young animal behaviorist in the world arb sarah harding was one of kellys personal heroes kelly had read every article she could about her sarah harding had been a poor scholarship student at the university of chicago but now at thirtythree she was an assistant professor at princeton she was beautiful and independent a rebel who went her own way she had chosen the life of a scientist in the field living alone in africa where she studied lions and hyenas she was famously tough once when her land rover broke down she walked twenty miles across the savannah all by herself driving away lions by throwing rocks at them in photographs sarah was usually posed in shorts and a khaki shirt with binoculars around her neck next to a land rover with her short dark hair and her strong muscular body she looked rugged but glamorous at the same time at least that was how she appeared to kelly who always studied the pictures intently taking in every detail never heard of her arby said thorne said spending too much time with computers arby arby said no kelly saw arbys shoulders hunch and he sort of withdrew into himself the way he always did when he felt criticized sulky he said animal behaviorist thats right thorne said i know levines talked to her several times in the last few weeks shes helping him with all this equipment when it finally goes into the field or advising him or something or maybe the connection is with malcolm after all she was in love with malcolm i dont believe it kelly said maybe he was in love with her thorne looked at her youve met her no but i know about her i see thorne said no more he could see all the signs of hero worship and he approved a girl could do worse than admire sarah harding at least she wasnt an athlete or a rock star in fact it was refreshing for a kid to admire somebody who actually tried to advance knowledge the phone continued to ring there was no answer well we know levines equipment is in order thorne said because the call is going through we know that much arby said can you trace it unfortunately no and if we keep this up well probably drain the field battery which means there was a click and they heard a mans voice remarkably distinct and clear levine okay good hes there thorne said nodding he pushed the button on his handset richard its doc thorne over the speakerphone they heard a sustained static hiss then a cough and a scratchy voice said hello hello its levine here thorne pressed the button on his phone richard its thorne do you read me hello levine said at the other end hello thorne sighed richard you have to press the t button for transmit over hello another cough deep and rasping this is levine hello thorne shook his head in disgust obviously be doesnt know how to work it damn i went over it very carefully with him of course he wasnt paying attention geniuses never pay attention they think they know everything these things arent toys he pushed the send button richard listen to me you must push the t in order to this is levine hello levine please i need help a kind of groan if you can hear me send help listen im on the island i managed to get here all right but a crackle a hiss uhoh thorne said what is it arby said leaning forward were losing him why battery thorne said its going fast damn richard where are you over the speakerphone they heard levines voice dead already situation got now very serious dont know can hear me but if you get help richard tell us where you are the phone hissed the transmission getting steadily worse they heard levine say have me surrounded and vicious can smell them especially night what is he talking about arby said to injury cant not long please and then there was a final fading hiss and suddenly the phone went dead thorne clicked off his own handset and turned off the speakerphone he turned to the kids who were both pale we have to find him he said right away second configuration selforganization elaborates in complexity as the system advances toward the chaotic edge ian malcolm clues thorne unlocked the door to levines apartment and flicked on the lights they stared astonished arby said it looks like a museum levines twobedroom apartment was decorated in a vaguely asian style with rich wooden cabinets and expensive antiques but the apartment was spotlessly clean and most of the antiques were housed in plastic cases everything was neatly labeled they walked slowly into the room does he live here kelly said she found it hard to believe the apartment seemed so impersonal to her almost inhuman and her own apartment was such a mess all the time yeah he does thorne said pocketing the key it always looks like this its why he can never live with a woman he cant stand to have anybody touch anything the livingroom couches were arranged around a glass coffee table on the table were four piles of books each neatly aligned with the glass edge arby glanced at the titles catastrophe theory and emergent structures inductive processes in molecular evolution cellular automata methodology of nonlinear adaptation phase transition in evolutionary systems there were also some older books with titles in german kelly sniffed the air something cooking i dont know thorne said he went into the dining room along the wall he saw a hot plate with a row of covered dishes they saw a polished wood dining table with a place set for one silver and cut glass soup steamed from a bowl thorne walked over and picked up a sheet of paper on the table and read lobster bisque baby organic greens seared ahi tuna a yellow postit was attached hope your trip was good romelia wow kelly saidyou mean somebody makes dinner for him every day i guess thorne said he didnt seem impressed he shuffled through a stack of unopened mail that had been set out beside the plate kelly turned to some faxes on a nearby table the first one was from the peabody museum at yale in new haven is this german she said handing it to thorne dear dr levine your requested document geschichtliche forschungsarbeiten uber die geologie zentralamerikas has been sent by federal express today thank you signed dina skrumbis archivist i cant read it thorne said but i think its something researches on the geology of central america and its from the twenties not exactly hot news i wonder why he wanted it she said thorne didnt answer her he went into the bedroom the bedroom had a spare minimal look the bed a black futon neatly made thorne opened the closet doors and saw racks of clothing everything pressed neatly spaced much of it in plastic he opened the top dresser drawer and saw socks folded arranged by color i dont know how he can live like this kelly said nothing to it thorne said all you need is servants he opened the other drawers quickly one after another kelly wandered over to the bedside table there were several books there the one on top was very small and yellowing with age it was in german the title was die funf todesarten she flipped through it saw colored pictures of what looked like aztecs in colorful costumes it was almost like an illustrated childrens book she thought underneath were books and journal articles with the darkred cover of the santa fe institute genetic algorithms and heuristic networks geology of central america tessellation automata of arbitrary dimension the annual report of the ingen corporation and next to the telephone she noticed a sheet of hastily scribbled notes she recognized the precise handwriting as levines it said site b vulkanische tacano nublar of deaths in mtns no maybe guitierrez careful kelly said whats site b he has notes about it thorne came over to look vulkanische he said that means volcanic i think and tacano and nublarthey sound like place names if they are we can check that on an atlas and whats this about one of five deaths kelly said damned if i know he said they were staring at the paper when arby walked into the bedroom and said whats site b thorne looked up why you better see his office arby said levine had turned the second bedroom into an office it was like the rest of the apartment admirably treat there was a desk with papers laid out in tidy stacks alongside a computer covered in plastic but behind the desk there was a large corkboard that covered most of the wall and on this board levine had tacked up maps charts newspaper clippings landsat images and aerial photographs at the top of the board was a large sign that said site b alongside that was a blurred curling snapshot of a bespectacled chinese man in a white lab coat standing in the jungle beside a wooden sign that said site b his coat was unbuttoned and he was wearing a tee shirt with lettering on it alongside the photo was a large blowup of the tee shirt as seen in the original photograph it was hard to read the lettering which was partly covered on both sides by the lab coat but the shirt seemed to say ngen site b esearch facili in neat handwriting levine had noted ingen site b research facility where just below that was a page cut from the ingen annual report a circled paragraph read in addition to its headquarters in palo alto where ingen maintains an ultramodern square foot research laboratory the company runs three field laboratories around the world a geological lab in south africa where amber and other biological specimens are acquired a research farm in the mountains of costa rica where exotic varieties of plants are grown and a facility on the island of isla nublar miles west of costa rica next to that levine had written no b liars arby said hes really obsessed with site b ill say thorne said and he thinks its on an island somewhere peering closely at the board thorne looked at the satellite images he noticed that although they were printed in false colors at various degrees of magnification they all seemed to show the same general geographical area a rocky coastline and some islands offshore the coastline had a beach and encroaching jungle it might be costa rica but it was impossible to say for sure in truth it could be any of a dozen places in the world he said he was on an island kelly said yes thorne shrugged but that doesnt help us much he stared at the board there must be twenty islands here maybe more thorne looked at a memo near the bottom site b to all departments of minder ofpress avoidan mr hammond wishes to remind allafter ampmarketing longterm marketing plan amp amp marketing of proposed resort facilities requires that full com plexity of jp technology not be revealed announced made known mr hammond wishes to remind all departments that production facility will not be topic subject of any press release or discussion at any time productionmanufacturing facility cannot be reference to production island loc isla s inhouse reference only strict pressguidelines this is weird he said what do you make of this arby came over and looked at it thoughtfully all these missing letters and garbage thorne said does it make any sense to you yes arby said he snapped his fingers and went directly to levines desk there he pulled the plastic cover off the computer and said i thought so the computer on levines desk was not the modern machine that thorne would have expected this computer was several years old large and bulky its cover scratched in many places it had a black stripe on the box that said design associates inc and lower down right by the power switch a shiny little metal tag that said property international genetics technology inc palo alto ca whats this thorne said levine has an ingen computer yes arby said he sent us to buy it last week they were selling off computer equipment and he sent you thorne said yeah me and kelly he didnt want to go himself hes afraid of being followed but this things a cadcam machine and it must be five years old thorne said cadcam computers were used by architects graphic artists and mechanical engineers why would levine want it he never told us arby said flipping on the power switch but i know now yes that memo arby said nodding to the wall you know why it looks that way its a recovered computer file levines been recovering ingen files from this machine as arby explained it all the computers that ingen sold that day had had their hard drives reformatted to destroy any sensitive data on the disks but the cadcam machines were an exception these machines all had special software installed by the manufacturer the software was keyed to individual machines using individual code references that made these computers awkward to reformat because the software would have to be reinstalled individually taking hours so they didnt do it thorne said right arby said they just erased the directory and sold them and that means the original files are still on the disk right the monitor glowed the screen said total recovered files jeez arby said he leaned forward staring intently fingers poised over the keys he pushed the directory button and row after row of file names scrolled down thousands of files in all thorne said how are you going to give me a minute here arby said interrupting him then he began to type rapidly okay arb thorne said he was amused by the imperious way arby behaved whenever he was working with a computer he seemed to forget how young he was his usual diffidence and timidity vanished the electronic world was really his element and he knew he was good at it thorne said any help you can give us will be doc arby said come on go and uh i dont know help kelly or something and he turned away and typed raptor the velociraptor was six feet tall and dark green poised to attack it hissed loudly its muscular neck thrust forward jaws wide tim one of the modelers said what do you think dr malcolm no menace malcolm said walking by he was in the back win of the biology department on his way to his office no menace tim said they never stand like this flatfooted on two feet give him a book he grabbed a notebook from a desk and placed it in the forearms of the animal and he might be singing a christmas carol gee tim said i didnt think it was that bad bad malcolm said this is an insult to a great predator we should feel his speed and menace and power widen the jaws get the neck down tense the muscles tighten the skin and get that leg up remember raptors dont attack with their jaws they use their toeclaws malcolm said i want to see the claw raised up ready to slash down and tear the guts out of its prey you really think so tim said doubtfully it might scare little kids you mean it might scare you malcolm continued down the hallway and another thing change that hissing sound it sounds like somebody taking a pee give this animal a snarl give a great predator his due gee tim said i didnt know you had such personal feelings about it it should be accurate malcolm said you know there is such a thing as accurate and inaccurate irrespective of whatever your feelings are he walked on irritable ignoring the momentary pain in his leg the modeler annoyed him although he had to admit tim was just a representative of the current fuzzyminded thinking what malcolm called sappy science malcolm had long been impatient with the arrogance of his scientific colleagues they maintained that arrogance he knew by resolutely ignoring the history of science as a way of thought scientists pretended that history didnt matter because the errors of the past were now corrected by modern discoveries but of course their forebears had believed exactly the same thing in the past too they had been wrong then and modern scientists were wrong now no episode of science history proved it better than the way dinosaurs had been portrayed over the decades it was sobering to realize that the most accurate perception of dinosaurs had also been the first back in the s when richard owen first described giant bones in england he named them dinosauria terrible lizards that was still the most accurate description of these creatures malcolm thought they were indeed like lizards and they were terrible but since owen the scientific view of dinosaurs had undergone many changes because the victorians believed in the inevitability of progress they insisted that the dinosaurs must necessarily be inferior why else would they be extinct so the victorians made them fat lethargic and dumbbig dopes from the past this perception was elaborated so that by the early twentieth century dinosaurs had become so weak that they could not support their own weight apatosaurs had to stand bellydeep in water or they would crush their own legs the whole conception of the ancient world was suffused with these ideas of weak stupid slow animals that view didnt change until the s when a few renegade scientists led by john ostrom began to imagine quick agile hotblooded dinosaurs because these scientists had the temerity to question dogma they were brutally criticized for years even though it now seemed their ideas were correct but in the last decade a growing interest in social behavior had led to still another view dinosaurs were now seen as caring creatures living in groups raising their little babies they were good animals even cute animals the big sweeties had nothing to do with their terrible fate which was visited on them by alvarezs meteor and that new sappy view produced people like tim who were reluctant to look at the other side of the coin the other face of life of course some dinosaurs had been social and cooperative but others had been hunters and killers of unparalleled viciousness for malcolm the truest picture of life in the past incorporated the interplay of all aspects of life the good and the bad the strong and the weak it was no good pretending anything else scaring little kids indeed malcolm snorted irritably as he walked down the hall in truth malcolm was bothered by what elizabeth gelman had told him about the tissue fragment and especially the tag that tag meant trouble malcolm was sure of it but he wasnt sure what to do about it he turned the corner past the display of clovis points arrowheads made by early man in america up ahead he saw his office beverly his assistant was standing behind her desk tidying papers getting ready to go home she handed him his faxes and said ive left word for dr levine at his office but he hasnt called back they dont seem to know where he is for a change malcolm said sighing it was so difficult working with levine he was so erratic you never knew what to expect malcolm had been the one to post bail when levine was arrested in his ferrari he riffled through the faxes conference dates requests for reprintsnothing interesting okay thanks beverly oh and the photographers came they finished about an hour ago what photographers he said from chaos quarterly to photograph your office what are you talking about malcolm said they came to photograph your office she said for a series about workplaces of famous mathematicians they had a letter from you saying it was i never sent any letter malcolm said and ive never heard of chaos quarterly he went into his office and looked around beverly hurried in after him her face worried is it okay is everything here yes he said scanning quickly it seems to be fine he was opening the drawers to his desk one after another nothing appeared to be missing thats a relief beverly said because he turned and looked at the far side of the room the map malcolm had a large map of the world with pins stuck in it for all the sightings of what levine kept calling aberrant forms by the most liberal count levines count there had now been twelve in all from rangiroa in the west to baia california and ecuador in the cast few of them were verified but now there was a tissue sample that confirmed one specimen and that made all the rest more likely did they photograph this map yes they photographed everything does it matter malcolm looked at the map trying to see it with fresh eyes to see what an outsider would make of it he and levine had spent hours in front of this map considering the possibility of a lost world trying to decide where it might be they had narrowed it down to five islands in a chain off the coast of costa rica levine was convinced that it was one of those islands and malcolm was beginning to think he was right but those islands werent highlighted on the map beverly said they were a very nice group very polite foreign swiss i think malcolm nodded and sighed the hell with it be thought it was bound to get out sooner or later its all right beverly are you sure yes its fine have a good evening good night dr malcolm alone in his office he dialed levine the phone rang and then the answering machine beeped levine was still not home richard are you there if you are pick up its important he waited nothing happened richard its ian listen we have a problem the map is no longer secure and ive had that sample analyzed richard and i think it tells us the location of site b if my there was a click as the phone lifted he heard the sound of breathing richard he said no said the voice this is thorne and i think you better get over here right away the five deaths i knew it malcolm said coming into levines apartment and glancing quickly around i knew he would do something like this you know how impetuous he is i said to him dont go until we have all the information but i should have known of course he went yes he did ego malcolm said shaking his head richard has to be first has to figure it out first has to get there first im very concerned he could ruin everything this impulsive behavior you realize its a storm in the brain neurons on the edge of chaos obsession is just a variety of addiction but what scientist ever had selfcontrol they instruct them in school its bad form to be balanced they forget neils bohr was not only a great physicist but an olympic athlete these days they all try to be nerds its the professional style thorne looked at malcolm thoughtfully he thought he detected a competitive edge he said do you know which island he went to no i do not malcolm was stalking around the apartment taking things in the last time we talked we had narrowed it down to five islands all in the south but we hadnt decided which one thorne pointed to the wallboard the satellite images these islands here yes malcolm said looking briefly theyre strung out in an arc all about ten miles offshore from the bay of puerto cortes supposedly theyre all uninhabited local people call them the five deaths why kelly said some old indian story malcolm said something about a brave warrior captured by a king who offered him his choice of deaths burning drowning crushing hanging decapitation the warrior said he would take them all and he went from island to island experiencing the various challenges sort of a new world version of the labors of hercules so thats what it is kelly said and ran out of the room malcolm looked blank he turned to thorne who shrugged kelly returned carrying the german childrens book in her hand she gave it to malcolm yes he said die funf todesarten the five ways of death interesting that it is in german he has lots of german books kelly said does he that bastard he never told me that means something kelly said yes it means a lot hand me that magnifying glass would you kelly gave him a magnifying glass from the desk what does it mean the five deaths are ancient volcanic islands he said which means that they are geologically very rich back in the twenties the germans wanted to mine them he peered at the images squinting ah yes these are the islands no question matanceros muerte tacano sorna penaall names of death and destructionall right i think we may be close do we have any satellite pictures with spectrographic analyses of the cloud cover arby said is that going to help you find site b what malcolm spun around what do you know about site b arby was sitting at the computer still working nothing just that dr levine was looking for site b and it was the name in the files what files ive recovered some ingen files from this computer and searching through old records i found references to site bbut theyre pretty confusing like this one he leaned back to let malcolm look at the screen summary plan revisions production site b air handlers grade to grade labstructure cmm to cmm bio security level pk to level pk conveyor rates mpm to mpm holding pens hectares to hectares staff admin to admin comm protocol etvx to rdt vx malcolm frowned curious but not very helpful it doesnt tell us which island or even if its on an island at all what else have you got well arby flicked keys lets see theres this site b island network nodal points zone i river zone coast zone ridge zone valley malcolm said okay so its an island and site b has a network but a network of what computers arby said i dont know maybe a radio network for what purpose malcolm said what would a radio network be used for this isnt very helpful arby shrugged he took it as a challenge he began typing furiously again then said waitheres another oneif i can just format itthere got it he moved away from the screen so the others could see malcolm looked and said very good very good site b legends east wing west wing loading bay laboratory assembly bay entrance outlying main core geo turbine convenience store worker village geo core gas station pooltennis putting greens mgrs house jog path gas lines security one security two thermal lines river dock boathouse solar one swamp road river road ridge road mtn view road cliff road holding pens now were getting somewhere malcolm said scanning the listing can you print this out sure arby was beaming is it really good it really is malcolm said kelly looked at arby and said arb thosere the text labels that go with a map yeah i think so pretty neat huh he pushed a button sending the image to the printer malcolm peered at the listing some more then turned his attention back to the satellite maps looking closely at each one with the magnifying glass his nose was just inches from the photographs arb kelly said dont just sit there come on recover the map thats what we need i dont know if i can arby said its a proprietary thirtytwobit formati mean its a big job stop whining arb just do it never mind malcolm said he stepped away from the satellite images pinned on the wall its not important its not arby said a little wounded no arby you can stop because from what youve already discovered i am quite certain we can identify the island right now james ed james yawned and pushed the earpiece tighter into his ear he wanted to make sure he got all this he shifted in the drivers seat of his gray taurus trying to get comfortable trying to stay awake the small tape recorder was spinning in his lap next to his notepad and the crumpled papers from two big macs james looked across the street at levines apartment building the lights were on in the thirdfloor apartment and the bug he had placed there last week was working fine through his earpiece he heard one of the kids say how and then the crippled guy malcolm said the essence of verification is multiple lines of reasoning that converge at a single point meaning what the kid said malcolm said just look at the landsat pictures on his notepad james wrote landsat we already looked at those the girl said james felt foolish not to have realized earlier that these two kids were working for levine he remembered them well they were in the class levine taught there was a short black kid and a gawky white girl just kids maybe eleven or twelve he should have realized not that it mattered now he thought he was getting the information anyway james reached across the dashboard and plucked out the last two french fries and ate them even though they were cold okay he heard malcolm say its this island here this is the island levine went to the girl said doubtfully you think so this isisla sorna james wrote isla sorna thats our island malcolm said why three independent reasons first its privately owned so it hasnt been thoroughly searched by the costa rican government second privately owned by whom by the germans who leased rights to mineral excavations back in the twenties all the german books exactly third from arbys list and from another independent source it is clear that there is volcanic gas located at site b so which islands have volcanic gas take the magnifying glass and look for yourself turns out only one island does you mean this here the girl said right thats volcanic smoke how do you know spectrographic analysis see this spike here thats elementary sulfur in the cloud cover there arent really any sources for sulfur except volcanic sources whats this other spike the girl said methane malcolm said apparently there is a fairly large source of methane gas is that also volcanic thorne said it might be methane is released from volcanic activity but most commonly during active eruptions the other possibility is it might be organic organic meaning what large herbivores and then there was something that james couldnt hear and the kid said do you want me to finish this recovery or not he sounded annoyed no thorne said never mind now arby we know what we have to do lets go kids james looked up at the apartment and saw the lights being turned off a few minutes later thorne and the kids appeared at the front entrance on the street level they got in a jeep and drove off malcolm went to his own car climbed in awkwardly and drove away in the opposite direction james considered following malcolm but he had something else to do now he turned on the car ignition picked up the phone and dialed field systems half an hour later when they got back to thornes office kelly stared stunned most of the workers were gone and the shed had been cleaned up the two trailers and the explorer stood side by side freshly painted dark green and ready to go theyre finished i told you they would be thorne said he turned to his chief foreman eddie carr a stocky young man in his twenties eddie where are we just wrapping up doc eddie said paints still wet in a few places but it should be dry by morning we cant wait until morning were moving out now we are arby and kelly exchanged glances this was news to them too thorne said ill need you to drive one of these eddie weve got to be at the airport by midnight but i thought we were field testing no time for that were going right to the location the front door buzzed thatll be malcolm probably he pushed the button to unlock the door youre not going to field test eddie said with a worried look i think you better shake them down doc we made some pretty complex modifications here and theres no time malcolm said coming in we have to go right away he turned to thorne im very worried about him eddie thorne said did the exit papers come in oh sure weve had them for the last two weeks well get them and call jenkins tell him to meet us at the airport and do the details for us i want to be off the ground in four hours jeez doc just do it kelly said youre going to costa rica thats right weve got to get levine if its not too late were coming with you kelly said right arby said we are absolutely not thorne said its out of the question but we earned it dr levine talked to our parents we already have permission you have permission thorne said severely to go on a field test in the woods a hundred miles from here but were not doing that were going someplace that might be very dangerous and youre not coming with us and thats final but kids thorne said dont piss me off im going to go make a phone call you get your stuff together youre going home and he turned and walked away gee kelly said arby stuck his tongue out at the departing thorne and muttered what an asshole get with the program arby thorne said not looking back you two guys are going home period he went into his office and slammed the door arby stuck his hands in his pockets they couldnt have figured it out without our help i know arb she said but we cant make him take us they turned to malcolm dr malcolm can you please sorry malcolm said i cant but the answer is no kids its just too dangerous dejected they drifted over to the vehicles gleaming beneath the ceiling lights the explorer with the black photovoltaic panels on the roof and hood the inside crammed with glowing electronic equipment just looking at the explorer gave them a sense of adventure an adventure they would not be part of arby peered into the larger trailer cupping his eyes over the window wow look at this im going in kelly said and she opened the door she was momentarily surprised at how solid and heavy it was then she climbed up the steps into the trailer inside the trailer was fitted out with gray upholstery and much more electronic equipment it was divided into sections for different laboratory functions the main area was a biological lab with specimen trays dissecting pans and microscopes that connected to video monitors the lab also included biochemistry equipment spectrometers and a series of automated sampleanalyzers next to it there was an extensive computer section a bank of processors and a communications section all the lab equipment was miniaturized and built into small tables that slid into the walls and then bolted down this is cool arby said kelly didnt answer she was looking closely at the lab dr levine had designed this trailer apparently with a very specific purpose there was no provision for geology or botany or chemistry or lots of other things that a field team might be expected to study it wasnt a general scientific lab at all there really seemed to be just a biology unit and a large computer unit biology and computers period what had this trailer been built to study set in the wall was a small bookshelf the books held in place with a velcro strap she scanned the titles modeling adaptive biological systems vertebrate behavioral dynamics adaptation in natural and artificial systems dinosaurs of north america preadaptation and evolutionit seemed like a strange set of books to take on a wilderness expedition if there was a logic behind it she didnt see it she moved on at intervals along the walls she could see where the trailer had been strengthened dark carbonhoneycomb strips ran up the walls she had overheard thorne saying it was the same material used in supersonic let fighters very light and very strong and she noticed that all the windows had been replaced with that special glass with fine wire mesh inside it why was the trailer so strong it made her a little uneasy when she thought about it she remembered the telephone call with dr levine earlier in the day he had said he was surrounded surrounded by what he had said i can smell them especially at night what was he referring to who was them still uneasy kelly moved toward the back of the trailer where there was a homey little living area complete with gingham curtains on the windows compact kitchen a toilet and four beds storage compartments above and below the beds there was even a little walkin shower it was nice from there she went through the accordion pleating that connected the two trailers it was a little bit like the connection between two railway cars a short transitional passage she emerged inside the second trailer which seemed to be mostly utility storage extra tires spare parts more lab equipment shelves and cabinets all the extra supplies that meant an expedition to some faroff place there was even a motorcycle hanging off the back of the trailer she tried some of the cabinets but they were locked but even here there were extra reinforcing strips as well this section had also been built especially strong why she wondered why so strong look at this arby said standing before a wall unit it was a complex of glowing led displays and lots of buttons and looked to kelly like a complicated thermostat what does it do kelly said monitors the whole trailer he said you can do everything from here all the systems all the equipment and look theres tv he pushed a button and a monitor glowed to life it showed eddie walking toward them across the floor and hey whats this arby said at the bottom of the display was a button with a securitv cover he flipped the cover open the button was silver and said def hey i bet this is that bear defense he was talking about a moment later eddie opened the trailer door and said you better stop that youll drain the batteries come on now you heard what the doc said time for you kids to go home kelly and arby exchanged glances okay kelly said were going reluctantly they left the trailer they walked across the shed to thornes office to say goodbye arby said i wish hed let us go me too i dont want to stay home for break he said theyre just going to be working all the time he meant his parents i know kelly didnt want to go home either this idea of a field test during spring break was perfect for her because it got her out of the house and out of a bad situation her mother did data entry in an insurance company during the day and at night she worked as a waitress at dennys so her mom was always busy at her jobs and her latest boyfriend phil tended to hang around the house a lot at night it had been okay when emily was there too but now emily was studying nursing at the community college so kelly was alone in the house and phil was sort of creepy but her mother liked phil so she never wanted to hear kelly say anything bad about him she just told kelly to grow up so now kelly went to thornes office hoping against hope that at the last minute he would relent he was on the phone his back to them on the screen of his computer they saw one of the satellite images they had taken from levines apartment thorne was zooming in on the image successive magnifications they knocked on the door opened it a little bye dr thorne see you dr thorne thorne turned holding the phone to his ear bye kids he gave a brief wave kelly hesitated listen could we just talk to you for a minute about thorne shook his head no but no kelly ive got to place this call now he said its already four am in africa and in a little while shell go to sleep who sarah harding sarah harding is coming too she said lingering at the door i dont know thorne shrugged have a good vacation kids see you in a week thanks for your help now get out of here he looked across the shed eddie the kids are leaving show them to the door and lock them out get me those papers and pack a bag youre coming with me then in a different voice he said yes operator im still waiting and he turned away harding through the nightvision goggles the world appeared in shades of fluorescent green sarah harding stared out at the african savannah directly ahead above the high grass she saw the rocky outcrop of a kopje brightgreen pinpoints glowed back from the boulders probably rock hyraxes she thought or some other small rodent standing up in her jeep wearing a sweatshirt against the cool night air feeling the weight of the goggles she turned her head slowly she could hear the yelping in the night and she was trying to locate the source even from her high vantage point standing up in the vehicle she knew the animals would be hidden from direct view she turned slowly north looking for movement in the grass she saw none she looked back quickly the green world swirling momentarily now she faced south and she saw them the grass rippled in a complex pattern as the pack raced forward yelping and barking prepared to attack she caught a glimpse of the female she called face one or fl fl was distinguished by a white streak between her eyes f loped along in the peculiar sideways gait of hyenas her teeth were bared she glanced back at the rest of the pack noting their position sarah harding swung the glasses through the darkness looking ahead of the pack she saw the prey a herd of african buffalo standing bellydeep in the grass agitated they were bellowing and stamping their feet the hyenas yelped louder a pattern of sound that would confuse the prey they rushed through the herd trying to break it up trying to separate the calves from their mothers african buffalo looked dull and stupid but in fact they were among the most dangerous large african mammals heavy powerful creatures with sharp horns and notoriously mean dispositions the hyenas could not hope to bring down an adult unless it was injured or sick but they would try to take a calf sitting behind the wheel of the jeep makena her assistant said you want to move closer no this is fine in fact it was more than fine their jeep was on a slight rise and they had a betterthanaverage view with any luck she would record the entire attack pattern she turned on the video camera mounted on a tripod five feet above her head and dictated rapidly into the tape recorder fl south f and f flanking twenty yards f center f circling wide cast cant see f f circling north fl straight through disrupting herd moving stamping theres f straight through f angling through from the north coming out circling again this was classic hyena behavior the lead animals ran through the herd while others circled it then came in from the sides the buffalo couldnt keep track of their attackers she listened to the herd bellowing even as the group panicked broke its tight clustered formation the big animals moved apart turning looking harding couldnt see the calves they were below the grass but she could hear their plaintive cries now the hyenas came back the buffalo stamped their feet lowered their big heads menacingly the grass rippled as the hyenas circled yelping and barking the sounds more staccato she caught a brief glimpse of female f her jaws already red but harding hadnt seen the actual attack the buffalo herd moved a short distance to the east where it regrouped one female buffalo now stood apart from the herd she bellowed continuously at the hyenas they must have taken her calf harding felt frustrated it had happened so swiftly too swiftly which could only mean that the hyenas had been lucky or the calf was injured or perhaps very young even newborn a few of the buffalo were still calving she would have to review the videotape to try and reconstruct what had happened the perils of studying fastmoving nocturnal animals she thought but there was no question they had taken an animal all the hyenas were clustered around a single area of grass they yelped and jumped she saw f and then f their muzzles bloody now the pups came lip squealing to get at the kill the adults immediately made room for them helped them to eat sometimes they pulled away flesh from the carcass and held it so the young ones could eat their behavior was familiar to sarah harding who had become in recent years the foremost expert on hyenas in the world when she first reported her findings she was greeted with disbelief and even outrage from colleagues who disputed her results in very personal terms she was attacked for being a woman for being attractive for having an overbearing feminist perspective the university reminded her she was on tenure track colleagues shook their heads but harding had persisted and slowly over time as more data accumulated her view of hyenas had come to be accepted still hyenas would never be appealing creatures she thought watching them feed they were ungainly heads too big and bodies sloping coats ragged and mottled gait awkward vocalizations too reminiscent of an unpleasant laugh in an increasingly urban world of concrete skyscrapers wild animals were romanticized classified as noble or ignoble heroes or villains and in this mediadriven world hyenas were simply not photogenic enough to be admirable long since cast as the laughing villains of the african plain they were hardly thought worth a systematic study until harding had begun her own research what she had discovered cast hyenas in a very different light brave hunters and attentive parents they lived in a remarkably complex social structure and a matriarchy as well as for their notorious yelping vocalizations they actually represented an extremely sophisticated form of communication she heard a roar and through her nightvision goggles saw the first of the lions approaching the kill it was a large female circling closer the hyenas barked and snapped at the lioness guiding their own pups off into the grass within a few moments other lions appeared and settled down to feed on the hyenas kill now lions she thought there was a truly nasty animal although called the king of beasts lions in truth were actually vile and the phone rang makena she said the phone rang again who could be calling her now she frowned through the goggles she saw the lionesses look up heads turning in the night makena was fumbling beneath the dashboard looking for the phone it rang three more times before he found it she heard him say jambo mzee yes dr harding is here he handed the phone up to her its dr thorne reluctantly she removed her night goggles and took the phone she knew thorne well he had designed most of the equipment in her jeep doc this better be important it is thorne said im calling about richard what about him she caught his concern but didnt understand why lately levine had been a pain in the neck telephoning her almost daily from california picking her brains about field work with animals he had lots of questions about hides and blinds data protocols recordkeeping it went on and on did he ever tell you what he intended to study thorne asked no she said why nothing at all no harding said he was very secretive but i gathered hed located an animal population that he could use to make some point about biological systems you know how obsessive he is why well hes missing sarah malcolm and i think hes in some kind of trouble weve located him on an island in costa rica and were going to get him now now she said tonight were flying to san jose in a few hours ians going with me we want you to come too doc she said even if i took a flight out of seronera tomorrow morning to nairobi itd take me almost a day to get there and thats if i got lucky i mean you decide thorne said interrupting ill give you the details and you decide what you want to do he gave her the information and she wrote it on the notepad strapped to her wrist then thorne rang off she stood staring out at the african night feeling the cool breeze on her face off in the darkness she heard the growl of the lions at the kill her work was here her life was here makena said dr harding what do we do go back she said i have to pack youre leaving yes she said im leaving message thorne drove to the airport the lights of san francisco disappearing behind them malcolm sat in the passenger seat he looked back at the explorer driving behind them and said does eddie know what this is all about yes thorne said but im not sure he believes it and the kids dont know no thorne said there was a beeping alongside him thorne pulled out his little black envoy a radio pager a light was flashing he flipped up the screen and handed it to malcolm read it for me its from arby malcolm said says have a good trip if you want us call well be standing by if you need our help and he gives his phone number thorne laughed you got to love those kids they never give up then he frowned as a thought occurred to him whats the time on that message four minutes ago malcolm said came in via netcom okay just checking they turned right toward the airport they saw the lights in the distance malcolm stared forward gloomily its very unwise for us to be rushing off like this its not the right way to go about it thorne said we should be all right as long as we have the right island we do malcolm said how do you know the most important clue was something i didnt want the kids to know about a few days ago levine saw the carcass of one of the animals oh yes he had a chance to look at it before the officials burned it and he discovered that it was tagged he cut the tag off and sent it to me tagged you mean like yes like a biological specimen the tag was old and it showed pitting from sulfuric acid must be volcanic thorne said exactly and you say it was an old tag several years malcolm said but the most interesting finding was the way the animal died levine concluded the animal had been injured while it was still alive a deep slashing cut in the leg that went right down to the bone thorne said youre saying the animal was injured by another dinosaur yes exactly they drove a moment in silence who else besides us knows about this island i dont know malcolm said but somebodys trying to find out my office was broken into today and photographed great thorne sighed but you didnt know where the island was did you no i hadnt put it together yet do you think anybody else has no malcolm said we re on our own exploitation lewis dodgson threw open the door marked animal quarters and immediately all the dogs began barking dodgson walked down the corridor between the rows of cages stacked ten feet high on both sides the building was large the biosyn corporation of cupertino california required an extensive animaltesting facility walking alongside him rossiter the head of the company gloomily brushed the lapels of his italian suit i hate this fucking place he said why did you want me to come here because dodgson said we need to talk about the future stinks in here rossiter said he glanced at his watch get on with it lew we can talk in here dodgson led him to a glasswalled superintendents booth in the center of the building the glass cut down the sound of the barking but through the windows thev could look out at the rows of animals its simple dodgson said starting to pace but i think its important lewis dodgson was fortyfive years old blandfaced and balding his features were youthful and his manner was mild but appearances were deceiving the babyfaced dodgson was one of the most ruthless and aggressive geneticists of his generation controversy had dogged his career as a graduate student at hopkins he had been dismissed for planning human gene therapy without fda permission later after joining biosyn he had conducted a controversial rabiesvaccine test in chile the illiterate farmers who were the subjects were never informed they were being tested in each case dodgson explained that he was a scientist in a hurry and could not be held back by regulations drawn up for lesser souls he called himself resultsoriented which really meant he did whatever he considered necessary to achieve his goal he was also a tireless selfpromoter within the company dodgson presented himself as a researcher even though he lacked the ability to do original research and had never done any his intellect was fundamentally derivative he never conceived of anything until someone else had thought of it first he was very good at developing research which meant stealing someone elses work at an early stage in this he was without scruple and without peer for many years he had run the reverseengineering section at biosyn which in theory examined competitors products and determined how they were made but in practice reverse engineering involved a great deal of industrial espionage rossiter of course had no illusions about dodgson he disliked him and avoided him as much as possible dodgson was always taking chances cutting corners he made rossiter uneasy but rossiter also knew that modern biotechnology was highly competitive to stay competitive every company needed a man like dodgson and dodgson was very good at what he did ill come right to the pint dodgson said turning to rossiter if we act quickly i believe we have an opportunity to acquire the ingen technology rossiter sighed not again i know jeff i know how you feel i admit there is some history here history the only history is you failed time and again weve tried this back door and front door hell we even tried to buy the company when it was in chapter because you told us it would be available but it turned out it wasnt the japanese wouldnt sell i understand jeff but lets not forget what i cant forget rossiter said is that we paid seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars to your friend nedry and have nothing to show for it but jeff then we paid five hundred thousand to that daiichl marriage broker nothing to show for that either our attempts to acquire ingen technology have been a complete fucking failure thats what i cant forget but the point dodgson said is that we kept trying for a good reason this technology is vital to the future of the company so you say the world is changing jeff im talking about solving one of the major problems this company faces in the twentyfirst century which is dodgson pointed out the window at the barking dogs animal testing lets face it jeff every year we get more pressure not to use animals for testing and research every year more demonstrations more breakins more bad press first it was just simpleminded zealots and hollywood celebrities but now its a bandwagon even university philosophers are beginning to argue that its unethical for monkeys and dogs and even rats to be subjected to the indignities of laboratory research weve even had some protests about our exploitation of squid even though theyre on dinner tables all over the world im telling you jeff theres no end to this trend eventually somebodys going to say we cant even exploit bacteria to make genetic products oh come on just wait itll happen and itll shut us down unless we have a genuinely created animal consider an animal that is extinct and is brought back to life is for all practical purposes not an animal at all it cant have any rights its already extinct so if it exists it can only be something we have made we made it we patent it we own it and it is a perfect research testbed and we believe that the enzyme and hormoiie systems of dinosaurs are identical to mammalian systems in the future drugs can be tested on small dinosaurs as successfully as they are now tested on dogs and ratswith much less risk of legal challenge rossiter was shaking his head you think i know theyre basically big lizards jeff and nobody loves a lizard theyre not like these cute doggies that lick your hand and break your heart lizards have no personality theyre snakes with legs rossiter sighed jeff were talking about real freedom here because at the moment everything to do with living animals is tied up in legal and moral knots biggame hunters cant shoot a lion or an elephant the same animals their fathers and grandfathers used to shoot and then pose proudly for a photo now there are forms licenses expenses and plenty of guilt these days you dont dare shoot a tiger and admit it afterward in the modern world its a much more serious transgression to shoot a tiger than to shoot your parents tigers have advocates but now imagine a specially stocked hunting preserve maybe somewhere in asia where individuals of wealth and importance could hunt tyrannosaurs and triceratops in a natural setting it would be an incredibly desirable attraction how many hunters have a stuffed elk head on their wall the worlds full of them but how many can claim to have a snarling tyranosaurus head hanging above the wet bar youre not serious im trying to make a point here jeff these animals are totally exploitable we can do anything we want with them rossiter stood up from the table put his hands in his pockets he sighed then looked up at dodgson the animals still exist dodgson nodded slowly and you know where they are dodgson nodded okay rossiter said do it he turned toward the door then paused looked back but lew he said lets be clear this is it this is absolutely the last time either you get the animals now or its over this is the last time got it dont worry dodgson said this time ill get them third configuration in the intermediate phase swiftly developing complexity within the system hides the risk of imminent chaos but the risk is there ian malcolm costa rica there was a drenching downpour in puerto cortes rain drummed on the roof of the little metal shed beside the airfield dripping wet thorne stood and waited while the costa rican official went over the papers again and again rodriguez was his name and he was just a kid in his twenties wearing an illfitting uniform terrified of making a mistake thorne looked out at the runway where in the soft dawn light the cargo containers were being clamped to the bellies of two big huey helicopters eddie carr was out there in the rain with malcolm shouting as the workmen secured the clamps rodriguez shuffled the papers now senor thorne according to this your destination is isla sorna thats right and your containers have only vehicles yes thats right research vehicles sorna is a primitive place there is no petrol no supplies not even any roads to speak of have you been there myself no people here have no interest in this island it is a wild spot rock and jungle and there is no place for a boat to land except in very special weather conditions for example today one cannot go there i understand thorne said i just wish that you will be prepared rodriguez said for the difficulties you will find there i think were prepared you are taking adequate petrol for your vehicles thorne sighed why bother to explain yes we are and there are just three of you dr malcolm yourself and your assistant senor carr correct and your intended stay is less than one week thats correct more like two days with anv luck we expect to be off the island sometime tomorrow rodriguez shuffled the papers again as if looking for a hidden cule well is there a problem thorne said glancing at his watch no problem senor your permits are signed by the director general of the biological preserves they are in order rodriguez hesitated but it is very unusual that such a permit would be granted at all why is that i do not know the details but there was some trouble on one of the islands a few years ago and since then the department of biological preserves has closed all the pacific islands to tourists were not tourists thorne said i understand that senor thorne more shuffling of papers thorne waited out on the runway the container clamps locked in place and the containers lifted off the ground very well senor thorne rodriguez said finally stamping the papers i wish you good luck thank you thorne said he tucked the papers in his pocket ducked his head against the rain and ran back out on the runway three miles offshore the helicopters broke through the coastal cloud layer into earlymorning sunlight from the cockpit of the lead huey thorne could look up and down the coast he saw five islands at various distances offshore harsh rocky pinnacles rising out of rough blue sea the islands were each several miles apart undoubtedly part of an old volcanic chain he pressed the speaker button which is sorna the pilot pointed ahead we call them the five deaths he said isla muerte isla matanceros isla pena isla tacano and isla sorna which is the big one farthest north have you been there never senor but i believe there will be a landing site how do you know some years ago there were some flights there i have heard the americans would come and fly there sometimes not germans no no there have been no germans sincei do not know the world war they were americans that came when was that i am not sure perhaps ten years ago the helicopter turned north passing over the nearest island thorne glimpsed rugged volcanic terrain overgrown with dense jungle there was no sign of life or of human habitation to the local people these islands are not happy places the pilot said they say no good comes from here he smiled but they do not know they are superstitious indians now they were over open water with isla sorna directly ahead it was clearly an old volcanic crater bare reddishgray rock walls an eroded cone where do the boats land the pilot pointed to where the sea surged and crashed against the cliffs on the east side of this island there are many caves made by the waves some of the local people call this isla gemido it means groan from the sound of the waves inside the caves some of the caves go all the way through to the interior and a boat can pass through at certain times but not in weather as you see it now thorne thought of sarah harding if she was coming she would land later today i have a colleague who may be arriving this afternoon said can you bring her out i am sorry the pilot said we have a job in golfo juan we will not be back until tonight what can she do the pilot squinted at the sea perhaps she can come by boat the sea changes by the hour she might have luck and you will come back for us tomorrow yes senor thorne we will come in the early morning it is the best time for the winds the helicopter approached from the west rising several hundred feet moving over the rocky cliffs to reveal the interior of isla gemido it appeared just like the others volcanic ridges and ravines heavily overgrown with dense jungle it was beautiful from the air but thorne knew it would be dauntingly difficult to move through that terrain he stared down looking for roads the helicopter thumped lower circling the central area of the island thorne saw no buildings no roads the helicopter descended toward the jungle the pilot said because of the cliffs the winds here are very bad many gusts and updrafts there is only one place on the island where it is safe to land he peered out the window ah yes there thorne saw an open clearing overgrown with tall grass we land there the pilot said isla sorna eddie carr stood in the tail grass of the clearing turned away from the flying dust as the two helicopters lifted off the ground and rose into the sky in a few moments they were small specks their sound fading eddie shaded his eyes as he looked upward in a forlorn voice he said whenre they coming back tomorrow morning thorne said well have found levine by then at least wed better malcolm said and then the helicopters were gone disappearing over the high rim of the crater carr stood with thorne and malcolm in the clearing enveloped in morning heat and deep silence on the island kind of creepy here eddie said pulling his baseball cap down lower over his eyes eddie carr was twentyfour years old raised in daly city physically he was darkhaired compact and strong his body was thick the muscles bunched but his hands were elegant the fingers long and tapered eddie had a talent thorne would have said a genius for mechanical things eddie could build anything and fix anything he could see how things worked just by looking at them thorne had hired him three years earlier his first job out of community college it was supposed to be a temporary job earning money so he could go back to school and get an advanced degree but thorne had long since become dependent on eddie and eddie for his part wasnt much interested in going back to the books at the same time he hadnt counted on anything like this he thought looking around him at the clearing eddie was an urban kid accustomed to the action of the city the honk of horns and the rush of traffic this desolate silence made him uneasy come on thorne said putting a hand on his shoulder lets get started they turned to the cargo containers left by the helicopter they were sitting a few yards away in the tall grass can i help malcolm said a few yards away if you dont mind no eddie said wed better unpack these ourselves they spent half an hour unbolting the rear panels lowering them to the ground and entering the containers after that they took only a few minutes to release the vehicles eddie got behind the wheel of the explorer and flicked on the ignition there was hardly any sound just a soft whirr of the vacuum pump starting up thorne said hows your charge full eddie said batteries okay yeah seem fine eddie was relieved he had supervised the conversion of these vehicles to electric power but it was a rush job and they hadnt had time to test them thoroughly afterward and though it was true that electric cars employed less complex technology than the internalcombustion enginethat chugging relic of the nineteenth century eddie knew that taking untested equipment into the field was always risky especially when that equipment also used the latest technology that fact troubled eddie more than he was willing to admit like most born mechanics he was deeply conservative he liked things to work work no matter what and to him that meant using established proven technology unfortunately he had been voted down this time eddie had two particular areas of concern one was the black photovoltaic panels with their rows of octagonal silicon wafers mounted on the roof and hood of the vehicles these panels were efficient and much less fragile than the old photovoltaics eddie had mounted them with special vibrationdamping units of his own design but the fact remained if the panels were injured in any way they would no longer be able to charge the vehicles or run the electronics all their systems would stop dead his other concern was the batteries themselves thorne had selected the new lithiumion batteries from nissan which were extremely efficient on a weight basis but they were still experimental which to eddie was just a polite word for unreliable eddie had argued for backups he had argued for a little gasoline generator just in case he had argued for lots of things and he had always been voted down under the circumstances eddie did the only sensible thing he built in a few extras and didnt tell anybody about it he was pretty sure thorne knew he had done that but thorne never said anything and eddie never brought it up but now that he was here on this island in the middle of nowhere he was glad he had because the fact was you never knew thorne watched as eddie backed the explorer out of the container and into the high grass eddie left the car in the middle of the clearing where the sunlight would strike the panels and top up the charge thorne got behind the wheel of the first trailer and backed it out it was odd to drive a vehicle which was so quiet the loudest sound was the tires on the metal container and once it was on the grass there was hardly any sound at all thorne climbed out and linked up the two trailers locking them together with the flexible steel accordion connector finally he turned to the motorcycle it too was electric thorne rolled it to the rear of the explorer lifted it onto brackets hooked the power cord into the same system that ran the vehicle and recharged the battery he stepped back that does it in the hot quiet clearing eddie stared toward the high circular rim of the crater rising in the distance above the dense jungle the bare rock shimmered in the morning heat the walls forbidding and harsh he had a sense of desolation of entrapment why would anyone ever come here he said malcolm leaning on his cane smiled to get away from it all eddie dont you ever want to get away from it all not if i can help it eddie said me i always like a pizza hut nearby you know what i mean well youre a ways from one now thorne returned to the back panel of the trailer and pulled out a pair of heavy rifles beneath the barrel of each hung two aluminum canisters side by side he handed one rifle to eddie showed the other to malcolm you ever seen these read about them malcolm said this is the swedish thing right lindstradt air gun most expensive rifle in the world rugged simple accurate and reliable fires a subsonic fluger impact delivery dart containing whatever compound you want thorne cracked open the cartridge bank revealing a row of plastic containers filled with strawcolored liquid each cartridge was tipped with a threeinch needle weve loaded the enhanced venom of conus purpurascens the south sea cone shell its the most powerful neurotoxin in the world acts within a twothousandth of a second its faster than the nerveconduction velocity the animals down before it feels the prick of the dart lethal thorne nodded no screwing around here just remember you dont want to shoot yourself in the foot with this because youll be dead before you realize that youve pulled the trigger malcolm nodded is there an antidote no but whats the point thered be no time to administer it if there was that makes things simple malcolm said taking the gun just thought you ought to know thorne said eddie lets get going the stream eddie climbed into the explorer thorne and malcolm climbed into the cab of the trailer a moment later the radio clicked eddie said you putting up the database doc right now thorne said he plugged the optical disk into the dashboard slot on the small monitor facing him he saw the island appear but it was largely obscured behind patches of cloud what good is that malcolm said just wait thorne said its a system its going to sum data data from what radar in a moment a satellite radar image overlaid the photograph the radar could penetrate the clouds thorne pressed a button and the computer traced the edges enhancing details highlighting the faint spidery track of the road system pretty slick malcolm said but to thorne he seemed tense ive got it eddie said on the radio malcolm said he can see the same thing yes on his dashboard but i dont have the cps eddie said anxiously isnt it working you guys thorne said give it a minute its reading the optical waystations are coming up there was a coneshaped global positioning sensor mounted in the roof of the trailer taking radio data from orbiting navigation satellites thousands of miles overhead the gps could calculate the position of the vehicles within a few yards in a moment a flashing red x appeared on the map of the island okay eddie said on the radio i got it looks like a road leading out of the clearing to the north that where were going id say so thorne said according to the map the road twisted several miles across the interior of the island before finally reaching a place where all the roads seemed to meet there was the suggestion of buildings there but it was hard to be sure okay doc here we go eddie drove past him and took the lead thorne stepped on the accelerator and the trailer hummed forward following the explorer beside him malcolm was silent fiddling with a small notebook computer on his lap he never looked out the window in a few moments they had left the clearing behind and were moving through dense jungle thornes panel lights flashed the vehicle switched to its batteries there wasnt enough sunlight coming through the trees to power the trailer any more they drove on how you doing doc eddie said you holding charge just fine eddie he sounds nervous malcolm said just worried about the equipment the hell eddie said im worried about me although the road was overgrown and in poor condition they made good progress after about ten minutes they came to a small stream with muddy banks the explorer started across it then stopped eddie got out stepping over rocks in the water walking back what is it i saw something doc thorne and malcolm got out of the trailer and stood on the banks of the stream they heard the distant cries of what sounded like birds malcolm looked up frowning birds thorne said malcolm shook his head no eddie bent over and plucked a strip of cloth out of the mud it was darkgreen goretex with a strip of leather sewn along one edge thats from one of our expedition packs he said the one we made for levine yes doc you put a sensor in the pack thorne asked they usually sewed location sensors inside their expedition packs yes may i see that malcolm asked he took the strip of cloth and held it up to the light he fingered the torn edge thoughtfully thorne uncapped a small receiver from his belt it looked like an oversized pager he stared at the liquidcrystal readout im not getting any signal eddie stared at the muddy bank he bent over again heres another piece of cloth and another seems like the pack was ripped into shreds doc another bird cry floated toward them distant unworldly malcolm stared off in the distance trying to locate its source and then he heard eddie say uhoh we have company there were a halfdozen brightgreen lizardlike animals standing in a group near the trailer they were about the size of chickens and they chirped animatedly they stood upright on their hind legs balancing with their tails straight out when they walked their heads bobbed up and down in nervous little jerks exactly like a chicken and they made a distinctive squeaking sound very reminiscent of a bird yet they looked like lizards with long tails they had quizzical alert faces and they cocked their heads when they looked at the men eddie said what is this a salamander convention the green lizards stood watched several more appeared from beneath the trailer and from the foliage nearby soon there were a dozen lizards watching and chattering compys malcolm said procompsognathus triassicus is the actual name you mean these are yes theyre dinosaurs eddie frowned stared i didnt know they came so small he said finally dinosaurs were mostly small malcolm said people always think they were huge but the average dinosaur was the size of a sheep or a small pony eddie said they look like chickens yes very birdlike is there any danger thorne said not really malcolm said theyre small scavengers like jackals they feed on dead animals but i wouldnt get close their bite is mildly poisonous im not getting close eddie said they give me the creeps its like theyre not scared malcolm had noticed that too i imagine its because there havent been any human beings on this island these animals dont have any reason to fear man well lets give them a reason eddie said he picked up a rock hey malcolm said dont do that the whole idea is but eddie had already thrown the rock it landed near a cluster of compys and the lizards ducked away but the others hardly moved a few of them hopped up and down showing agitation but the group stayed where they were they just chittered and cocked their heads weird eddie said he sniffed the air you notice that smell yes malcolm said they have a distinctive odor rotten is more like it eddie said they smell rotten like something dead and you ask me its not natural animals that dont show fear like that what if they have rabies or something they dont malcolm said how do you know because only mammals carry rabies but even as he said it he wondered if that was right warmblooded animals carried rabies were the compys warmblooded he wasnt sure there was a rustling sound from above malcolm looked up at the canopy of trees overhead he saw movement in the high foliage as unseen small animals jumped from branch to branch he heard squeaks and chirps distinctly animal sounds those arent birds up there thorne said monkeys maybe malcolm said i doubt it eddie shivered i say we get out of here he returned to the stream and climbed into the explorer malcolm walked cautiously with thorne back to the trailer entrance the compys parted around them but still did not run away they stood all around their legs chattering excitedly malcolm and thorne climbed into the trailer and closed the doors being careful not to shut them on the little creatures thorne sat behind the wheel and turned on the motor ahead they saw that eddie was already driving the explorer through the stream and heading up the sloping ridge on the far side the uh procomsowhatevers eddie said over the radio theyre real arent they oh yes malcolm said softly theyre real the road thorne was uneasy he was beginning to understand how eddie felt he had built these vehicles and he had an uncomfortable sense of isolation of being in this faraway place with untested equipment the road continued steeply upward through dark jungle for the next fifteen minutes inside the trailer it grew uncomfortably warm sitting beside him malcolm said air conditioning i dont want to drain the battery mind if i open the window if you think its all right thorne said malcolm shrugged why not he pushed the button and the power window rolled down warm air blew into the car he glanced back at thorne nervous doc sure thorne said damned right i am even with the window open he felt sweat running down his chest as he drove over the radio eddie was saying im telling you we should have tested first doc should have done it by the book you dont come to a place with poisonous chickens if youre not sure your vehicles will hold up the cars are fine thorne said hows your levels high normal eddie said just great of course weve only gone five miles its nine in the morning doc the road swung right then left following a series of switchbacks as the terrain became steeper hauling the big trailers thorne had to concentrate on his driving it was a relief to focus his attention ahead of them the explorer turned left going higher up the road i dont see any more animals eddie said he sounded relieved finally the road flattened out as it turned following the crest of the ridge according to the gps display they were now heading north west toward the interior of the island but the jungle still hemmed them in on all sides they could not see much beyond the dense walls of foliage they came to a y intersection in the road and eddie pulled over to the side thorne saw that in the crook of the y was a faded wooden sign with arrows pointing in both directions to the left the sign said to swamp to the right was another arrow and the words to site b eddie said guys which way go to site b malcolm said you got it the explorer started down the right fork thorne followed off to the right sulfurous yellow steam issued from the ground bleaching the nearby foliage white the smell was strong volcanic thorne said to malcolm just as you predicted driving past they glimpsed a bubbling pool in the earth crusted thick yellow around the edges yeah eddie said but thats active in fact id say that holy shit eddies brake lights flashed on and his car slammed to a stop thorne had to swerve scraping jungle ferns on the side of the trailer to miss him he pulled up alongside the explorer and glared at eddie eddie for petes sake will you but eddie wasnt listening he was staring straight forward his mouth wide open thorne turned to look directly ahead the trees along the road had been beaten down creating a gap in the foliage they could see all the way from the ridge road across the entire island to the west but thorne hardly registered the panoramic view because all he saw was a large animal the size of a hippopotamus ambling across the road except it wasnt a hippopotamus this animal was pale brown its skin covered with large platelike scales around its head it had a curving bony crest and rising from this crest were two blunted horns a third horn protruded above its snout over the radio he heard eddie breathing in shallow gasps you know what that is thats a triceratops malcolm said a young one by the looks of it must be eddie said ahead of them a much larger animal now crossed the road it was easily twice the size of the first and its horns were long curving and sharp because thats his mom a third triceratops appeared then a fourth there was a whole herd of creatures ambling slowly across the road they paid no attention to the vehicles as they crossed passed through the gap and descended down the hill disappearing from view only then were the men able to see through the gap itself thorne had a view across a vast marshy plain with a broad river coursing through the center on either side of the river animals grazed there was a herd of perhaps twenty mediumsized darkgreen dinosaurs to the south their large heads intermittently poking up above the grass along the river nearby thorne saw eight duckbilled dinosaurs with large tubelike crests rising above their heads they drank and lifted their heads honking mournfully directly ahead he saw aone stegosaurus with its curved back and its vertical rows of plates the triceratops herd moved slowly past the stegosaur which paid no attention to them and to the west rising above a clump of trees they saw a dozen long graceful necks of apatosaurs their bodies hidden by the foliage that they lazily ate it was a tranquil scene but it was a scene from another world doc eddie said what is this place site b sitting in the cars they stared out over the plain they watched the dinosaurs move slowly through the deep grass they beard the soft cry of the duckbills the separate herds moved peacefully beside the river eddie said so what are we saying this is a place that got bypassed by evolution one of those places where time stands still not at all malcolm said theres a perfectly rational explanation for what you are seeing and we are going to from the dashboard there was a highpitched beeping on the gps map a blue grid was overlaid with a flashing triangular point marked levn its him eddie said we got the son of a bitch youre reading that thorne said its pretty weak its fine its got enough signal strength to transmit the id tab thats levine all right looks like it is coming from the valley over there he started the explorer and it lurched forward up the road lets go eddie said i want to get the hell out of here with the flick of a switch thorne turned on the electric motor for the trailer and beard the chug of the vacuum pump the low whine of the automatic transmission he put the trailer in gear and followed behind the impenetrable jungle closed in around them again close and hot the trees overhead blocked nearly all the sunlight as he drove he heard the beeping become irregular he glanced at the monitor saw the flashing triangle was disappearing then coming back again are we losing him eddie thorne said doesnt matter if we do eddie said weve got a location on him now and we can go right there in fact it should be just down this road here right past this guardhouse or whatever it is dead ahead thorne looked past the explorer and saw a concrete structure and a tilting steel roadbarrier it did indeed look like a guardhouse it was in disrepair and overgrown with vines they drove on coming onto paved road it was clear the foliage on either side had once been cut far back fifty feet on either side pretty soon they came to a second guardhouse and a second checkpoint they continued on another hundred yards the road still curving slowly along the ridge the surrounding foliage became sparser through gaps in the ferns thorne could see wooden outbuildings all painted identical green they seemed to be utility structures perhaps sheds for equipment he had the sense of entering a substantial complex and then suddenly they rounded a curve and saw the entire complex spread out below them it was about a halfmile away eddie said what the hell is that thorne stared astonished in the center of the clearing he saw the flat roof of an enormous building it covered several acres stretching away into the distance it was the size of two football fields beyond the vast roof was a large blocky building with a metal roof which had the functional look of a power plant but if so it was as big as the power plant for a small town at the far end of the main building thorne saw loading docks and turnarounds for trucks over to the right partially hidden in foliage there were a series of small structures that looked like cottages but from a distance it was hard to be sure taken together the whole complex had a utilitarian quality that reminded thorne of an industrial site or a fabrication plant he frowned trying to put it together do you know what this is thorne said to malcolm yes malcolm said nodding slowly its what i suspected for some time now yes its a manufacturing plant malcolm said its a kind of factory but its huge thorne said yes malcolm said it had to be over the radio eddie said im still getting a reading from levine and guess what it seems to be coming from that building they drove past the covered front entrance to the main building beneath the sagging portico the building was of modern design concrete and glass but the jungle had long ago grown up around it vines hung from the roof panes of glass were broken ferns sprouted between cracks in the concrete thorne said eddie got a reading eddie said yeah inside what do you want to do set up base camp in that field over there thorne said pointing a halfmile to the left where once it seemed there had been an extensive lawn it was still an open clearing in the jungle there would be sunlight for the photovoltaics then well have a look around eddie parked his explorer turning it around to face back the way they had come thorne maneuvered the trailers alongside the car and cut the engine he climbed out into the still hot morning air malcolm got out and stood with him here in the center of the island it was completely silent except for the buzz of insects eddie came over slapping himself great place huh no shortage of mosquitoes you want to go get the son of a bitch now eddie unclipped a receiver from his belt and cupped his hand over the display trying to see it in the sunlight still right over there he pointed to the main building what do you say lets go get him thorne said the three men turned climbed into the explorer and leaving the trailers behind drove in hot sunlight toward the giant ruined building trailer inside the trailer the sound of the car engine faded away and therewas silence the dashboard glowed the gps map remained visible on the monitor the flashing x marking their position a small window in the monitor titled active systems indicated the battery charge photovoltaic efficiency and usage over the past twelve hours the electronic readouts all glowed bright green in the living section where the kitchen and beds were located the recirculating water supply in the sink gurgled softly then there was a thumping sound coming from the upper storage compartment located near the ceiling the thumping was repeated and then there was silence after a moment a credit card appeared through the crack of the compartment door the card slid upward lifting the panel latch unhooking it the door swung open and a white bundle of padding fell out landing with a dull thud on the floor the padding unrolled and arby benton groaned stretching his small body if i dont pee im going to scream he said and he hurried on shaky legs into the tiny bathroom he sighed in relief it had been kellys idea for them to go but she left it to arby to figure out the details and he had figured everything out perfectly he thought at least almost everything arby had correctly anticipated it would be freezing cold in the cargo plane and that they would have to bundle up hed stuffed their compartments with every blanket and sheet in the trailer hed anticipated they would be there at least twelve hours and he put aside some cookies and bottles of water in fact hed anticipated everything except the fact that at the last minute eddie carr would go through the trailer and latch all the storage compartments from the outside locking them in so that for the next twelve hours he wouldnt be able to go to the bathroom for twelve hours he sighed again his body relaxing a steady stream of urine still flowed into the basin no wonder agony and hed still be locked in there he thought if he hadnt finally figured out behind him he heard muffled shouts he flushed the toilet and went back crouching down by the storage compartment beneath the bed he quickly unlatched it another padded bundle unrolled and kelly appeared beside him hey kel he said proudly we made it i have to go she said dashing she pulled the door shut behind her arby said we did it were here just a minute arb okay for the first time he looked out the window of the trailer all around them was a grassy clearing and beyond that the ferns and high trees of the jungle and high above the tops of the trees he saw the curving black rock of the volcanic rim so this was isla sorna all right all right kelly came out of the bathroom ohhh i thought i was going to die she looked at him gave him high five by the way howd you get your door unlatched credit card he said she frowned you have a credit card my parents gave it to me for emergencies he said and i figured this was an emergency he tried to make a joke out of it to treat it lightly arby knew kelly was sensitive about anything to do with money she was always making comments about his clothes and things like that arid how he always had money for a taxi or a coke at larsons deli after school or whatever once he said to her that he didnt think money was so important and she said why would you in a funny voice arid ever since then he had tried to avoid the subject arby wasnt always clear about the right thing to do around people everyone treated him so weird anyway because he was younger of course and because he was black arid because he was what the other kids called a brainer he found himself engaged in a constant effort to be accepted to blend in except he couldnt he wasnt white he wasnt big he wasnt good at sports and he wasnt dumb most of his classes at school were so boring arby could hardly stay awake in them his teachers sometimes got annoyed with him but what could he do school was like a video played at superslow speed you could glance at it once an hour and not miss anything and when he was around the other kids how could he be expected to show interest in tv shows like melrose place or the san francisco ers or the shaqs new commercial he couldnt that stuff wasnt important but arby had long ago discovered it was unpopular to say so it was better to keep your mouth shut because nobody understood him except kelly she seemed to know what he was talking about most of the time and dr levine at least the school had an advancedplacement track which was moderately interesting to arby not very interesting of course but better than the other classes and when dr levine had decided to teach the class arby had found himself excited by school for the first time in his life in fact so this is isla sorna huh kelly said looking out the window at the jungle yeah arby said i guess so you know when they stopped the car earlier kelly said could you hear what they were talking about not really all the padding me neither kelly said but they seemed pretty worked up about something yeah they did it sounded like they were talking about dinosaurs kelly said did you hear anything like that arby laughed shaking his head no kel he said because i thought they did come on kel i thought thorne said triceratops kel he said dinosaurs have been extinct for sixtyfive million years i know that he pointed out the window you see any dinosaurs out there kelly didnt answer she went to the other side of the trailer and looked out the opposite window she saw thorne malcolm and eddie disappearing into the main building theyre going to be pretty annoyed when they find us arby said how do you think we should tell them we can let it be a surprise theyll be mad he said so what can they do about it kelly said maybe theyll send us back how they cant yeah i guess arby shrugged casually but he was more troubled by this line of thought than he wanted to admit this was all kellys idea arby had never liked to break the rules or to get into any kind of trouble whenever he had even had a mild reprimand from a teacher he would get flushed and sweaty and for the last twelve hours he had been thinking about how thorne and the others would react look kelly said the thing is were here to help find our friend dr levine thats all weve helped dr thorne already yes and well be able to help them again maybe they need our help maybe arby said he didnt feel convinced kelly said i wonder what they have to eat here she opened the refrigerator you hungry starving arby said suddenly aware that he was so what do you want what is there he sat on the padded gray couch and stretched as he watched kelly poke through the refrigerator come and look she said annoyed im not your stupid housekeeper okay okay take it easy well you expect everybody to wait on you she said i do not he said getting quickly off the couch youre such a brat arby hey he said whats the big deal take it easy you nervous about something no i am not she said she took a wrapped sandwich out of the refrigerator standing beside her he looked briefly inside grabbed the first sandwich he saw you dont want that she said yes i do its tuna salad arby hated tuna salad he put it back quickly looked around again thats turkey on the left she said in the bun he brought out a turkey sandwich thanks no problem sitting on the couch she opened her own sandwich wolfed it down hungrily listen at least i got us here he said unwrapping his own carefully he folded the plastic neatly set it aside yeah you did i admit it you did that part all right arby ate his sandwich he thought he had never tasted anything so good in his entire life it was better even than his mothers turkey sandwiches the thought of his mother gave him a pang his mother was a gynecologist and very beautiful she had a busy life and wasnt home very much but whenever he saw her she always seemed so peaceful and arby felt peaceful around her too they had a special relationship the two of them even though lately she sometimes seemed uneasy about how much he knew one night he had come into her study she was going over some journal articles about progesterone levels and fsh he looked over her shoulder at the columns of numbers and suggested that she might want to try a nonlinear equation to analyze the data she gave him a funny look a kind of separate look thoughtful and distant from him and at that moment he had felt im getting another one kelly said going back to the refrigerator she came out with two sandwiches one in each hand you think theres enough who cares im starving she said tearing off the wrapping on the first maybe we shouldnt eat arb if youre going to worry like this we should have stayed home he decided that was right he was surprised to see that he had somehow finished his own sandwich so he took the other one kelly offered him kelly ate and stared out the window i wonder what that building is that they went into it looks abandoned yeah for years why would somebody build a big building here on some deserted island in costa rica she said maybe they were doing something secret or dangerous she said yeah or that the idea of danger was both titillating and unnerving he felt far from home i wonder what they were doing she said still eating she got up off the couch and went to look out the window sure is a big place huh she said thats weird what is look out here that building is all overgrown like nobodys been there for years and years and this field is all grown up too the grass is pretty high yes but right down here she said pointing near the trailer theres a clear path chewing arby came over and looked she was right just a few yards from their trailer the grass had been trampled down and was yellowed in many places bare earth showed through it was a narrow but distinct trail coming in from the left going off to the right across the open clearing so kelly said if nobodys been here for years what made the trail has to be animals he said it was all he could think of must be a game trail like what animals i dont know whatevers here deer or something i havent seen any deer he shrugged maybe goats you know wild goats like they have in hawaii the trails too wide for deer or goats maybe theres a whole herd of wild goats too wide kelly said she shrugged and turned away from the window she went back to the refrigerator i wonder if theres anything for dessert mention of dessert gave him a sudden thought he went to the com partment above the bed climbed up and poked around whatre you doing she said checking my pack for what i think i forgot my toothbrush so i wont be able to brush my teeth arb she said who cares but i always brush my teeth be daring kelly said live a little arby sighed maybe dr thorne brought an extra one he came back and sat down on the couch beside kelly she folded her arms across her chest and shook her head no dessert nothing not even frozen yogurt adults they never plan right yeah thats true arby yawned it was warm in the trailer he felt sleepy lying huddled in that compartment for the last twelve hours shivering and cramped he hadnt slept at all now he was suddenly tired he looked at kelly and she yawned too want to go outside wake us up we should probably wait here he said if i do im afraid ill go to sleep kelly said arby shrugged sleep was overtaking him fast he went back to the living compartment and crawled onto the mattress beside the window kelly followed him back im not going to sleep she said fine kel his eyes were heavy he realized he couldnt keep them open but she yawned again maybe ill just lie down for a minute he saw her stretch out on the bed opposite him and then his eyes closed and he was immediately asleep he dreamed he was back in the airplane feeling the gentle rocking motion hearing the deep rumble of the engines he slept lightly and at one moment woke up convinced that the trailer actually was rocking and that there really was a low rumbling sound coming from right outside the window but almost immediately he was asleep again and now he dreamed of dinosaurs kellys dinosaurs and in his light sleep there were two animals so huge that he could not see their heads through the window only their thick scaly legs as they thumped on the ground and walked past the trailer but in his dream the second animal paused and bent over and the big head peered in curiously through the window and arby realized that he was seeing the giant head of a tyrannosaurus rex the great jaws working the white teeth glinting in the sunlight and in his dream he watched it all calmly and slept on interior two large swinging glass doors at the front of the main building led into a darkened lobby beyond the glass was scratched and dirty the chrome doorhandles pitted with corrosion but it was clear that the dust debris and dead leaves in front of the doorway had been disturbed in twin arcs somebodys opened these doors recently eddie said yes thorne said somebody wearing asolo boots he opened the door shall we they stepped into the building inside the air was hot and still and fetid the lobby was small and unimpressive a reception counter directly ahead was once covered with gray fabric now overgrown with a dark lichenlike growth on the wall behind was a row of chrome letters that said we make the future but the words were obscured by a tangle of vines mushrooms and fungi sprouted from the carpet over to the right they saw a waiting area with a coffee table and two long couches one of the conches was speckled with crusty brown mold the other had been covered with a plastic tarp next to this couch was what was left of levines green backpack with several deep tears on the fabric on the coffee table were two empty plastic evian bottles a satellite phone a pair of muddy hiking shorts and several crumpled candybar wrappers a brightgreen snake slithered quickly away as they approached so this is an ingen building thorne said looking at the wall sign absolutely malcolm said eddie bent over levines backpack ran his fingers along the tears in the fabric as he did so a large rat jumped out from the pack jesus the rat scurried away squeaking eddie looked cautiously inside the pack i dont think anybodys going to want the rest of these candy bars he said he turned to the pile of clothes you getting a reading from this some of the expedition clothes had microsensors sewn into them no thorne said moving his hand monitor i have a reading butit seems to be coming from there he pointed to a set of metal doors beyond the reception desk leading into the building beyond the doors had once been bolted shut and locked with rusted padlocks but the padlocks now lay on the floor broken open lets go get him eddie said heading for the doors what kind of a snake do you think that was i dont know was it poisonous i dont know the doors opened with a loud creak the three men found themselves in a blank corridor with broken windows along one wall and dried leaves and debris on the floor the walls were dirty and darkly stained in several places with what looked like blood they saw several doors opening off the corridor none appeared to be locked plants were growing up through rips in the carpeted floor near the windows where it was light vines grew thickly over the cracked walls more vines hung down from the ceiling thorne and the others headed down the hallway there was no sound except their feet crunching on the dried leaves getting stronger thorne said looking at his monitor he must be somewhere in this building thorne opened the first door he came to and saw a plain office a desk and chair a map of the island on the wall a desk lamp toppled over from the weight of tangled vines a computer monitor with a film of mold at the far end of the room light filtered through a grimy window they went down the hall to the second door and saw an almost identical office similar desk and chair similar window at the far side of the room eddie grunted looks like were in an office building he said thorne went on he opened the third door and then the fourth more offices thorne opened the fifth door and paused he was in a conference room dirty with leaves and debris there were animal droppings on the long wooden table in the center of the room the window on the far side was dusty thorne was drawn to a large map which covered one whole wall of the conference room there were pushpins of various colors stuck in the map eddie came in and frowned beneath the map was a chest of drawers thorne tried to open them but they were all locked malcolm walked slowly into the room looking around taking it in whats this map mean eddie said you have any idea what the pins are malcolm glanced at it twenty pins in four different colors five pins of each color arranged in a pentagon or anyway a fivepronged pattern of some kind going to all parts of the island id say it looks like a network didnt arby say there was a network on this island yes he didinteresting well never mind that now thorne said he went back into the hallway again following the signal from his hand unit malcolm closed the door behind them and they continued on they saw more offices but no longer opened the doors they followed the signal from levine at the end of the corridor was a pair of sliding glass doors marked no admittance authorized personnel only thorne peered through the glass but he could not see much beyond he had the sense of a large space and complex machinery but the glass was dusty and streaked with grime it was difficult to see thorne said to malcolm you really think you know what this building was for i know exactly what it was for malcolm said its a manufacturing plant for dinosaurs why eddie said would anybody want that nobody would malcolm said thats why they kept it a secret i dont get it eddie said malcolm smiled long story he said he slipped his hands between the doors and tried to pull them open but they remained shut fast he grunted straining with effort and then suddenly with a metallic screech they slid apart they stepped into the darkness beyond their flashlights shone down an inky corridor as they moved forward to understand this place you have to go back ten years to a man named john hammond and an animal called the quagga the what the quagga malcolm said is an african mammal rather like a zebra it became extinct in the last century but in the s somebody used the latest dnaextraction techniques on a piece of quagga hide and recovered a lot of dna so much dna that people began to talk about bringing the quagga back to life and if you could bring the quagga back to life why not other extinct animals the dodo the sabertoothed tiger or even a dinosaur where could you get dinosaur dna thorne said actually malcolm said paleontologists have been finding fragments of dinosaur dna for years they never said much about it because they never had enough material to use it as a classification tool so it didnt seem to have any value it was just a curiosity but to recreate an animal youd need more than dna fragments thorne said youd need the whole strand thats right malcolm said and the man who figured out how to get it was a venture capitalist named john hammond he reasoned that when dinosaurs were alive insects probably bit them and sucked their blood just as insects do today and some of those insects would afterward land on a branch and be trapped in sticky sap and some of that sap would harden into amber hammond decided that if you drilled into insects preserved in amber and extracted the stomach contents you would eventually get some dinodna and did he yes he did and he started ingen to develop this discovery hammond was a hustler and his true talent was raising money he figured out how to get enough money to do the research to go from a dna strand to a living animal sources of funding werent immediately apparent because although it would be exciting to recreate a dinosaur it wasnt exactly a cure for cancer so he decided to make a tourist attraction he planned to recover the cost of the dinosaurs by putting them in a kind of zoo or theme park where he would charge admission are you joking thorne said no hammond actually did it he built his park on an island called isla nublar north of here and he planned to open it to the public in late i went to see the place myself shortly before it was scheduled to open but it turned out hammond had problems malcolm said the park systems broke down and the dinosaurs got free some visitors were killed afterward the park and all its dinosaurs were destroyed they passed a window where they could look out over the plain at the herds of dinosaurs browsing by the river thorne said if they were all destroyed whats this island this island malcolm said is hammonds dirty little secret its the dark side of his park they continued down the corridor you see malcolm said visitors to hammonds park at isla nublar were shown a very impressive genetics lab with computers and gene sequencers and all sorts of facilities for hatching and growing young dinosaurs visitors were told that the dinosaurs were created right there at the park and the laboratory tour was entirely convincing but actually hammonds tour skipped several steps in the process in one room he showed you dinosaur dna being extracted in the next room he showed you eggs about to hatch it was very dramatic but how had he gotten from dna to a viable embryo you never saw that critical step it was just presented as having happened between rooms the fact was hammonds whole show was too good to be true for example he had a hatchery where the little dinosaurs pecked their way out of the eggs while you watched in amazement but there were never any problems in the hatchery no stillbirths no deformities no difficulties of any sort in hammonds presentation this dazzling technology was carried off without a hitch and if you think about it it couldnt possibly be true hammond was claiming to manufacture extinct animals using cuttingedge technology but with any new manufacturing technology initial yields are low on the order of one percent or less so in fact hammond must have been growing thousands of dinosaur embryos to get a single live birth that implied a giant industrial operation not the spotless little laboratory we were shown you mean this place thorne said yes here on another island in secret away from public scrutiny hammond was free to do his research and deal with the unpleasant truth behind his beautiful little park hammonds little genetic zoo was a showcase but this island was the real thing this is where the dinosaurs were made if the animals at the zoo were destroyed eddie said how come they werent destroyed on this island too a critical question malcolm said we should know the answer in a few minutes he shone his light down the tunnel it glinted off glass walls because if i am not mistaken he said the first of the manufacturing bays is just ahead arby arby awoke sitting upright in bed blinking his eyes in the morning light that streamed in through the trailer windows in the next bunk kelly was still asleep snoring loudly he looked out the window at the entrance to the big building and s aw that the adults were gone the explorer was standing by the entrance but there was no one inside the car their trailer sat isolated n the clearing of tall grass arby felt entirely alone frighteningly alone and a sudden sense of panic made his heart pound he never should have come here he thought the whole idea was stupid and worst of all it had been his plan the way they had huddled together in the trailer and then had gone back to thornes office and kelly had talked to thorne so that arby could steal the key the way he had set up a delayed radio message to be transmitted to thorne so that thorne would think they were still in woodside arby had felt very clever at the time but now he regretted it all he decided that he had to call thorne immediately he had to turn himself in he was filled with an overwhelming desire to confess he needed to hear somebodys voice that was the truth he walked from the back of the trailer where kelly was sleeping to the front and turned on the ignition key in the dashboard he picked up the radio handset and said this is arby is anybody there over this is arby but nobody answered after a moment he looked at the dashboard systems monitor which registered all the systems that were operative he didnt see anything about communications it occurred to him that the communications system was probably hooked into the computer he decided to turn the computer on so he went back to the middle of the trailer unstrapped the keyboard plugged it in and turned the computer on there was a menu screen that said thorne field systems and underneath that a listing of subsystems inside the trailer one of them was radio communications so he clicked on that and turned it on the computer screen showed a scrambled hash of static at the bottom was a command line that read multiple frequency inputs received do you want to autotune arby didnt know what that meant but he was fearless around computers autotune sounded interesting without hesitation he typed yes the static scramble remained on the screen while numbers rolled at the bottom he guessed he was seeing frequencies in megahertz but he didnt really know and then suddenly the screen went blank except for a single flashing word in the upperleft corner login he paused frowning that was odd apparently he was required to log into the trailers computer system that meant he would need a password he tried thorne nothing happened he waited a moment then tried thornes initials jt nothing levine nothing thorne field systems nothing tfs nothing field nothing user nothing well he thought at least the system hadnt dumped him out most networks logged you off after three wrong tries but apparently thorne hadnt designed any security features into this one arby would never have made it this way the system was too patient and helpful he tried help the cursor moved to another line there was a pause the drives whirred action he said rubbing his hands laboratory as thornes eyes adjusted to the low light he saw they were standing inside an enormous space consisting of row after row of rectangular stainlesssteel boxes each fitted with a tangled maze of plastic tubing everything was dusty many of the boxes were knocked over the first rows malcolm said are nishihara gene sequencers and beyond are the automatic dna synthesizers its a factory eddie said its like agribusiness or something yes it is at the corner of the room was a printer with some loose sheets of yellowing paper lying beside it malcolm picked up one and

do with why the animals survived thorne said im not sure malcolm said was this sheet related to the final days of the manufacturing facility or was it just something that a worker printed out years ago and somehow left behind he looked around by the printer and found a shelved stack of sheets pulling them out he discovered that they were memos they were on faded blue paper and they were all

backgrounds we need to start this today and again from ccd to h wusup isolated glycogen synthase kinase from xenopus may work better than mammalian gsk alphabeta currently in use anticipate more robust establishment of dorsoventral polarity and less early embyro wastage agree malcolm looked at the next one from backes to h wusup short protein fragments may be acting as prions sourcing doubtful but suggest halt all exogenous protein for carniv orgs until origin is cleared up disease cannot continue thorne looked over his shoulder seems like they had problems he said undoubtedly they did malcolm said it would be impossible not to have them but the question is he drifted off staring at the next memo which was longer ingen production update from lori ruso to all personnel subject low production yields recent episodes of wastage of successful live births in the period hours posthatching have been traced to contami nation from escherichia coli bacteria these have cut produc tion

h step to test for contamination begin setasides at once report all errors stop the line whenever necessary until this is cleared up they had problems with infection and contamination of the production line malcolm said and maybe other sources of contamination as well look at this he handed thorne the next memo ingen production update from h wu to all personnel subject dx tag and release live births will be fitted with the new grumbach field tags at the earliest viable interval formula or other feeding within the laboratory confines will no longer be done the release pro gram is now fully operational and tracking networks are acti vated to monitor thorne said does this mean what i think it means yes malcolm said they were having trouble keeping the newborn animals alive so they tagged them and released them and kept track of them on some kind of network yes i think so they set dinosaurs loose on this island eddie said they must have been crazy desperate is more like it malcolm said just imagine heres this huge expensive hightech process and in the end the animals are getting sick and dying hammond must have been furious so they decided to get the animals out of the laboratory and into the wild but why didnt they find the cause of the sickness why didnt they commercial process malcolm said its all about results and im sure they thought they were keeping track of the animals they could get them back anytime they wanted and dont forget it must have worked they must have put the animals into the field then collected them after a while when they were older and shipped them to hammonds zoo but not all of them we dont know everything yet malcolm said we dont know what happened here they went through the next doorway and found themselves in a small bare room with a central bench and lockers on the walls signs said observe sterile precautions and maintain sk standards at the end of the room was a cabinet with stacks of yellowing gowns and caps eddie said its a changing room looks like it malcolm said he opened a locker it was empty except for a pair of mens shoes he opened several other lockers they were all empty inside one a sheet of paper was taped safety is everybodys business report genetic anomalies dispose of biowaste properly halt the spread of dx now whats dx eddie said i think malcolm said its the name for this mysterious disease at the far end of the changing room were two doors the righthand door was pneumatic operated by a rubber footpanel set in the floor but that door was locked so they went through the left door which opened freely they found themselves in a long corridor with floortoceiling glass panels along the right wall the glass was scratched and dirty but they peered through it into the room beyond which was unlike anything thorne had ever seen the space was vast the size of a football field conveyor belts crisscrossed the room at two levels one very high the other at waist level at various stations around the room clusters of large machinery with intricate tubing and swing arms stood beside the belts thorne shone his light on the conveyor belts an assembly line he said but it looks untouched like its still ready to go malcolm said there are a couple of plants growing through the floor over there but overall remarkably clean too clean eddie said thorne shrugged if its a cleanroom environment then its probably airsealed he said i guess it just stayed the way it was years ago eddie shook his head for years doc i dont think so then what do you think explains it malcolm frowned peering through the glass how was it possible for a room this size to remain clean after so many years it didnt make any hey eddie said malcolm saw it too it was in the far corner of the room a small blue box halfway up the wall cables running into it it was obviously some kind of electrical junction box mounted on the box was a tiny red light it was glowing this place has power thorne moved close to the glass looking through with them that s impossible it must be some kind of stored charge or a battery after five years no battery can last that long eddie said im telling you doc this place has power arby stared at the monitor as white lettering slowly printed across the screen are you firsttime user of the network he typed yes there was another pause he waited more letters slowly appeared your full name he typed in his name do you want a password issued to you youre kidding he thought this was going to be a snap it was almost disappointing he really thought dr thorne would have been more clever he typed yes after a moment your new password is vig amp please make a note of it sure thing arby thought you bet i will there was no paper on the desk in front of him he patted his pockets found a scrap of paper and wrote it down please reenter your password now he typed in the series of characters and numbers there was another pause and then more printing appeared across the screen the speed of the printing was oddly slow and halting at times after all this time maybe the system wasnt working very thank you password confirmed the screen flashed and suddenly turned dark blue there was an electronic chime and then arbys jaw dropped open as he stared at the screen which read international genetic technologies site b local node network services it didnt make any sense how could there be a site b network ingen had closed site b years ago arby had already read the documents and ingen was out of business long since bankrupt what network he thought and how had he managed to get on it the trailer wasnt connected to anything there were no cables or anything so it must be a radio network already on the island somehow hed managed to log onto it but how could it exist a radio network needed power and there was no power here arby waited nothing happened the words just sat there on the screen he waited for a menu to come up but one never did arby began to think that perhaps the system was defunct or hung up maybe it just let you log on and then nothing happened after that or maybe he thought he was supposed to do something he did the simplest thing which was to press return he saw remote network services available current workfiles last modified rresearch pproduction ffield rec mmaintenance aadministration stored datafiles rlresearch avad rresearch gd pproduction fdfn video network a ccd ndc i so it really was an old system files hadnt been modified for years wondering if it still worked he clicked on video network and to his amazement he saw the screen begin to fill with tiny video images there were fifteen in all crowding the screen showing views of various parts of the island most of the cameras seemed to be mounted high up in trees or something and they showed he stared they showed dinosaurs he squinted it wasnt possible these were movies or something he was seeing because in one corner he saw a herd of triceratops in an adjacent square some green lizardlooking things in high grass with just their heads sticking up in another a single stegosaurus ambling along they must be movies he thought the dinosaur channel but then in another image arby saw the two connected trailers standing in the clearing he could see the black photovoltaic panels glistening on the roof he almost imagined he could see himself through the window of the trailer oh my god he thought and in another image he saw thorne and malcolm and eddie get quickly into the green explorer and drive around the back of the laboratory and he realized with a shock the pictures were all real power they drove the explorer to the back of the main building heading for the power station on the way they passed a little village to their right thorne saw six plantationstyle cottages and a larger building marked managers residence it was clear that the cottages had once been nicely landscaped but they were now overgrown partially retaken by the jungle in the center of the complex they saw a tennis court a drained swimming pool a small gas pump in front of what looked like a little general store thorne said i wonder how many people they had here eddie said how do you know theyre all gone what do you mean doc they have power after all these years there has to be an explanation for it eddie steered the car around the back of the loading bays and drove toward the power station directly ahead the power station was a windowless featureless concrete blockhouse marked only by a corrugatedsteel rim for ventilation around the top the steel vents were long since rusted a uniform brown with flecks of yellow eddie drove the car around the block looking for a door he found it at the back it was a heavy steel door with a peeling painted sign that said caution high voltage do not enter eddie jumped out of the car and the others followed thorne sniffed the air sulfur he said very strong malcolm said nodding eddie tugged at the door guys i got a feeling the door opened suddenly with a clang banging against the concrete wall eddie peered into darkness inside thorne saw a dense maze of pipes a trickle of steam coming out of the floor the room was extremely hot there was a loud constant whirring sound eddie said ill be damned he walked forward looking at the gauges many of which were unreadable the glass thickly coated with yellow the joints of the pipes were also rimmed with yellow crust eddie wiped away some of the crust with his finger amazing he said sulfur yeah sulfur amazing he turned toward the source of the sound saw a large circular vent a turbine inside the turbine blades spinning rapidly were drill yellow and thats sulfur too thorne said no eddie said that must be gold those turbine blades are gold alloy gold yeah it would have to be very inert he turned to thorne you realize what all this is its incredible so compact and efficient nobody has figured out how to do this the technology is youre saying its geothermal malcolm said thats right eddie said theyve tapped a heat source here probably gas or steam which is piped up through the floor over there then the heat is used to boil water in a closed cycle thats the network of pipes up there and turn the turbine there which makes electric power whatever the heat source geothermals almost always corrosive as hell most places maintenance is brutal but this plant still works amazing along one wall was a main panel which distributed power to the entire laboratory complex the panel was flecked with mold and dented in several spots doesnt look like anybodys been in here in years he said and a lot of the power grid is dead but the plant itself is still going incredible thorne coughed in the sulfurous air and walked back into the sunlight he looked up at the year of the laboratory one of the loading bays seemed in good shape but the other had collapsed the glass at the rear of the building was shattered malcolm came to stand beside him i wonder if an animal hit the building you think an animal could do that much damage malcolm nodded some of these dinosaurs weigh forty fifty tons a single animal has the mass of a whole herd of elephants that could easily be damage from an animal yes you notice that path running there thats a game trail going past the loading bays and down the hill it could have been animals yes thorne said didnt they think of that when they released the animals in the first place oh im sure they just planned to release them for a few weeks or months then round them up when they were still juvenile i doubt they ever thought they they were interrupted by a crackling electrical hiss like static it was coming from inside the explorer behind them eddie hurried toward the car with a worried look i knew it eddie said our communications module is frying i knew we should have put in the other one he opened the door to the explorer and climbed in the passenger side picked up the handset pressed the automatic tuner through the windshield he saw thorne and malcolm coming back toward the car and then the transmission locked into the car said a scratchy voice who is this dr thorne dr malcolm get in the car as thorne arrived eddie said doc its that damn kid what thorne said its arby over the radio arby was saying get in the car i can see it coming whats he talking about thorne said frowning hes not here is he is he on this island the radio crackled yes im here dr thorne but how the hell did he dr thorne get in the car thorne turned purple with anger he bunched his fists how did that little son of a bitch manage to do this he grabbed the handset from eddie arby god damn it its coming eddie said whats he talking about he sounds completely hysterical i can see it on the television dr thorne malcolm looked around at the jungle maybe we should get in the car he said quietly what does he mean television thorne said he was furious eddie said i dont know doc but if hes got a feed in the trailer we can see it too he flicked on the dashboard monitor he watched as the screen glowed to life that damn kid thorne said im going to wring his neck i thought you liked that kid malcolm said i do but chaos at work malcolm said shaking his head eddie was looking at the monitor oh shit he said on the tiny dashboard monitor they had a view looking straight down at the powerful body of a tyrannosaurus rex as it moved up the game trail toward them its skin was a mottled reddish brown the color of dried blood in dappled sunlight they could clearly see the powerful muscles of its haunches the animal moved quickly without any sign of fear or hesitation staring thorne said everybody in the car the men climbed hurriedly in on the monitor the tyrannosaur moved out of view of the camera but sitting in the explorer they could hear it coming the earth was shaking beneath them swaying the car slightly thorne said ian what do you think we should do malcolm didnt answer he was frozen staring forward eyes blank ian thorne said the radio clicked arby said dr thorne ive lost him on the monitor can you see him yet jesus eddie said with astonishing speed the tyrannosaurus rex burst into view emerging from the foliage to the right of the explorer the animal was immense the size of a twostorey building its head rising high above them out of sight yet for such a large creature it moved with incredible speed and agility thorne stared in stunned silence waiting to see what would happen he felt the car vibrate with each thundering footstep eddie moaned softly but the tyrannosaur ignored them continuing at the same rapid pace it moved swiftly past the front of the explorer they hardly had a chance to see it before its big head and body disappeared into the foliage to the left now they saw only the thick counterbalancing tail some seven feet in the air swinging back and forth with each footstep as the animal moved on so fast thorne thought fast the giant animal had emerged blocked their vision and then was gone again he was not accustomed to seeing something that big move so fast now there was only the tip of the tail swinging back and forth as the animal hurried away then the tail banged against the front of the explorer with a loud metallic clang and the tyrannosaur stopped they heard a low uncertain growl from the jungle the tail swung back and forth in the air again more tentatively soon enough the tail brushed lightly against the radiator a second time now they saw the foliage to the left rustling and bending and the tail was gone because the tyrannosaur thorne realized was coming back reemerging from the jungle it moved toward the car until it was standing directly in front of them it growled again a deep rumbling sound and turned its head slightly from side to side to look at this strange new object then it bent over and thorne could see that the tyrannosaur had something in its mouth he saw the legs of a creature dangling on both sides of the aws flies buzzed in a thick cloud around the tyrannosaurs head eddie moaned oh fuck quiet thorne whispered the tyrannosaurus snorted and looked at the car it bent lower and sniffed repeatedly moving its head slightly to the left and right with each inhalation thorne realized it was smelling the radiator it moved laterally and sniffed the tires then it lifted its huge head slowly until its eyes rose above the surface of the hood it stared at them through the windshield its eyes blinked the gaze was cold and reptilian thorne had the distinct impression that the tyrannosaur was looking at them its eyes shifted from one person to the next with its blunt nose it pushed at the side of the car rocking it slightly as if testing its weight measuring it as an opponent thorne gripped the steering wheel tightly and held his breath and then abruptly the tyrannosaur stepped away and walked to the front of the car it turned its back on them lifting its big tail high the tyrannosaur backed up toward them they heard the tail scraping across the roof of the car the rear haunches came closer and then the tyrannosaur sat down on the hood tilting the vehicle pushing the bumper into the ground with its enormous weight at first it did not move but simply sat there then after a moment it began to wriggle its hips back and forth in a quick motion making the metal squeak what the hell eddie said the tyrannosaur stood again the car sprang back up and thorne saw thick white paste smeared across the hood the tyrannosaur immediately moved away heading down the game trail disappearing into the jungle behind them they saw it emerge into the open again stalk across the open compound it lumbered behind the convenience store passed between two of the cottages and then disappeared from sight again thorne glanced at eddie who jerked his head toward malcolm malcolm had not turned to watch the departing tyrannosaur he was still staring forward his body tense ian thorne said he touched him on the shoulder malcolm said is he gone yes hes gone ian malcolms body relaxed his shoulders dropping he exhaled slowly his head sagged to his chest he took a deep breath and raised his head again youve got to admit he said you dont see that every day are you okay thorne said yeah sure im fine he put his hand on his chest feeling his heart of course im fine after all that was just a small one small eddie said you call that thing small yes for a tyrannosaur females are quite a bit larger theres sexual dimorphism in tyrannosaurs the females are bigger than the males and its generally thought they did most of the hunting but we may find that out for ourselves wait a minuteeddiesaidwhat makes you so sure he was a male malcolm pointed to the hood of the car where the white paste now gave off a pungent odor he scentmarked territory so maybe females can also mark very likely they can malcolm said but anal scent glands are found only among males and you saw how he did it eddie stared unhappily at the hood i hope we can get that stuff off he said i brought some solvents but i wasnt expecting you knowdino musk the radio clicked dr thorne arby said dr thorne is everything all right yes arby thanks to you he said then why are you waiting dr thorne didnt you see dr levine not yet no thorne reached for his sensor unit but it had fallen to the floor he bent over and picked it up levines coordinates had changed hes moving i know hes moving dr thorne yes arby thorne said and then he said wait a minute how do you know hes moving because i can see him arby said hes riding a bicycle kelly came into the front of the trailer yawning and pushing her hair back from her face whore you talking to arb she stared at the monitor and said hey pretty neat i got onto the site b network he said what network its a radio lan kel for some reason its still up is that right but how did kids thorne said over the radio if you dont mind were looking for levine arby picked up the handset hes riding a bicycle down a path in the jungle its pretty steep and narrow i think hes following the same path as the tyrannosaur kelly said as the what thorne put the car in gear driving away from the power station toward the worker compound he went past the gas station and then between the cottages he followed the same path the tyrannosaur had taken the game trail was fairly wide easy to follow we shouldnt have those kids here malcolm said gloomily its not safe not much we can do about it now thorne said he clicked the radio arby do you see levine now the car bounced through what had once been a flower bed and around the back of the managers residence it was a large twostorey building built in a tropical colonial style with hardwood balconies all around the upper floor like the other houses it was overgrown the radio clicked yes dr thorne i see him where is he hes following the tyrannosaur on his bicycle following the tyrannosaur malcolm sighed i should never have gotten involved with him we all agree on that thorne said he accelerated driving past a section of broken stone wall which seemed to mark the outer perimeter of the compound the car plunged on into jungle following the game trail over the radio arby said do you see him yet not yet the trail became progressively narrower twisting as it ran down the hillside they came around a curve and suddenly saw a fallen tree blocking the path the tree had been denuded in the center its branches stripped and broken presumably because large animals had repeatedly stepped over it thorne braked to a stop in front of the tree he got out and walked around to the back of the explorer doc eddie said let me do it no thorne said if anything happens youre the only one who can repair the equipment youre more important especially now that we have the kids standing behind the car thorne lifted the motorcycle off the carrier hooks he swung it down checked the battery charge and rolled it to the front of the car he said to malcolm give me that rifle and slung the rifle around his shoulder thorne took a headset from the dashboard and put it over his head he clipped the battery pack to his belt placed the microphone alongside his cheek you two go back to the trailer thorne said take care of the kids but doc eddie began just do it thorne said and lifted the motorcycle over the fallen tree he set it down on the other side and climbed over himself then he saw the same pungent pale secretions on the trunk it had smeared on his hands he glanced back at malcolm questioningly marking territory malcolm said great thorne said just great he wiped his hands on his trousers then he got on the motorcycle and drove off foliage slapped at thornes shoulders and legs as he drove down the game trail following the tyrannosaur the animal was somewhere up ahead but he couldnt see it he was driving fast the radio headset crackled arby said dr thorne i can see you now okay thorne said it crackled again but i cant see dr levine any more arby said he sounded worried the electric motorcycle made hardly any noise particularly going downhill up ahead the game trail divided in two thorne stopped leaned over the bike looking at the muddy path he saw the footprints of the tyrannosaur going off to the left and he saw the thin line of the bicycle tires also going off to the left he took the left fork but now he drove more slowly ten yards ahead thorne passed the partially eaten leg of a creature which lay at the side of the path the leg was old it was crawling with white maggots and flies in the morning heat the sharp smell was nauseating he continued but soon saw the skull of a large animal some of the flesh and green skin still adhering to the bone it too was covered with flies speaking into the microphone he said im passing some partial carcasses the radio crackled now he heard malcolm say i was afraid of that afraid of what there may be a nest malcolm said did you notice the carcass that the tyrannosaur had in his jaws it was scavenged but he hadnt eaten it theres a good chance he was taking the food home to a nest a tyrannosaur nest thorne said id be cautious malcolm said thorne slipped the bike into neutral and rolled the rest of the way down the hill when the ground leveled out he climbed off the motorcycle he could feel the earth vibrate beneath his feet and from the bushes ahead he heard a deep rumbling sound like the purr of a large jungle cat thorne looked around he didnt see any sign of levines bicycle thorne unshouldered the rifle and gripped it in sweating hands he heard the purring growl again rising and falling there was something odd about the sound it took thorne a moment to realize what it was it came from more than one source more than one big animal purring beyond the foliage directly ahead thorne bent over picked up a handful of grass and released it in the air the grass blew back toward his legs he was downwind he slipped forward through the foliage the ferns around him were huge and dense but up ahead he could see sunlight shining through from a clearing beyond the sound of purring was very loud now there was another sound as wellan odd squeaking sound it was highpitched and at first sounded almost mechanical like a squeaking wheel thorne hesitated then very slowly he lowered a frond and he stared nest in the midmorning light two enormous tyrannosaurs each twenty feet high loomed above him their reddish skin had a leathery appearance their huge heads were fiercelooking with heavy jaws and large sharp teeth but somehow here the animals conveyed no sense of menace to thorne they moved slowly almost gently bending repeatedly over a large circular rampart of dried mud nearly four feet high the two adults held bits of red flesh in their jaws as they ducked their heads below the mud wall this movement was greeted by a frantic highpitched squeaking sound which stopped almost immediately then when the adults lifted their heads again the flesh was gone there was no question this was the nest and malcolm had been right one tyrannosaur was noticeably larger than the other in a few moments the squeaking resumed it sounded to thorne like baby birds the adults continued to duck their heads feeding the unseen babies a bit of torn flesh landed on the top of the mud mound as he watched thorne saw an infant tyrannosaur rise into view above the rampart and start to scramble over the side the infant was about the size of a turkey with a large head and very large eyes its body was covered with a fluffy red down which gave it a scraggly appearance a ring of palewhite down circled its neck the infant squeaked repeatedly and it crawled awkwardly toward the meat using its weak forearms but when it finally reached the carrion it jabbed biting the flesh decisively with tiny sharp teeth it was busily eating the food when it screeched in alarm and started to slide down the outer wall of dried mud immediately the mother tyrannosaur dropped her head and intercepted the babys fall then gently nudged the animal back inside the nest thorne was impressed by the delicacy of her movements the attentive way she cared for her young the father meanwhile continued to tear small pieces of meat both animals kept up a continuous purring growl as if to reassure the infants as thorne watched he shifted his position his foot stepped on a branch there was a sharp crack immediately both adults jerked their heads up thorne froze he held his breath the tyrannosaurs scanned the area around the nest looking intently in every direction their bodies were tense their heads alert their eyes flicked back and forth accompanied by little head jerks after a moment they seemed to relax again they bobbed their heads up and down and rubbed their snouts against each other it seemed to be some kind of ritual movement almost a dance only then did they resume feeding the infants when they had calmed down thorne slipped away moving quietly back to the motorcycle arby whispered over the headset dr thorne i cant see you thorne didnt answer he tapped the microphone with his finger to signal that he had heard arby whispered i think i know where dr levine is hes off to your left thorne tapped the mike again and turned to his left among ferns he saw a rusted bicycle it said prop ingen corp it was leaning against a tree not bad arby thought sitting in the trailer and watching the remote videos as he clicked on them he now had the monitor divided into quarters it was a good compromise between lots of views and images large enough to see one of the views looked down from above on the two tyrannosaurs in the secluded clearing it was midmorning the sun shone brightly on the muddy trampled grass of the clearing in the center he saw a round steepwalled nest of mud inside the nest were four mottled white eggs about the size of footballs there were also some broken egg fragments and two baby tyrannosaurs looking exactly like featherless squeaking birds they sat in the nest with their heads turned up like baby birds mouths gaping wide waiting to be fed kelly watched the screen and said look how cute they are and then she added we should be out there arby didnt answer her he was not at all sure he wanted to be any closer the adults were being very cool about it but arby found the idea of these dinosaurs very unnerving in some deep way that he couldnt analyze arby had always found it reassuring to organize to create order in his life even arranging the images neatly on the computer monitor was calmlng to him but this island was a place where everything was unknown and unexpected where you didnt know what would happen he found that troubling on the other hand kelly was excited she kept making comments about the tyrannosaurs how big they were the size of their teeth she seemed entirely enthusiastic without any fear at all arby felt annoyed with her anyway she said what makes you think you know where dr levine is arbv pointed to the image of the nest on the monitor watch i see it no watch kel as they stared at the screen the image moved slightly it panned to the left then centered again see that arby said so what maybe the wind is blowing the carmera or something arby shook his head no kel hes up in the tree levines moving the camera oh a pause she watched again you might be right arby grinned that was about all he could expect to get from kelly yeah i think so but whats dr levine doing in the tree maybe hes adjusting the camera they listened to thornes breathing over the radio kelly stared at the four video images each showing a different view of the island she sighed i cant wait to get out there she said yeah me too arby said but he didnt mean it he glanced out the window of the trailer and saw the explorer coming back with eddie and malcolm secretly he was glad to see them return thorne stood at the base of the tree looking up he couldnt see levine through the leaves but he knew he must be somewhere up above because he was making what seemed to thorne like a lot of noise thorne glanced nervously back at the clearing screened by intervening foliage he could still hear the purring it remained steady uninterrupted thorne waited what the hell was levine doing up in a tree anyway he heard rustling in the branches above and then silence a grunt then more rustling and then levine said aloud oh shit then a loud crashing sound the crack of branches and a howl of pain and then levine crashed down on the ground in front of thorne landing hard on his back he rolled over clutching his shoulder damn he said levine wore muddy khakis that were torn in several places behind a threeday growth of beard his face was haggard and spattered with mud he looked up as thorne moved toward him and grinned youre the last person i expected to see doc levine said but your timing is flawless thorne extended his hand and levine started to reach for it when from the clearing behind them the tyrannosaurs gave a deafening roar oh not kelly said on the monitor the tyrannosaurs were agitated moving swiftly in circles raising their heads and bellowing dr thorne whats happening arby said they heard levines voice tinny and scratchy on the radio but they couldnt make out the words eddie and malcolm came into the trailer malcolm took one look at the monitor and said tell them to get out of there right now on the monitor the two tyrannosaurs had turned their backs to each other so they were facing outward in a posture of defense the babies were protected in the center the adults swung their heavy tails back and forth over the nest above the babies heads but the tension was palpable and then one of the adults bellowed and charged out of the clearing dr thorne dr levine get out of there thorne swung his leg over the bike and gripped the rubber handles levine jumped on behind clutched him around the waist thorne heard a chilling roar and looked back to see one of the tyrannosaurs crash through the foliage and charge them the animal was running at full speedhead low jaws open in an unmistakable posture of attack thorne twisted the throttle the electric motor whirred the back wheel spun in the mud not moving go levine shouted go the tyrannosaur rushed toward them roaring thorne could feel the ground shake the roar was so loud it hurt his ears the tyrannosaur was nearly on them the big head lunging forward jaws wide open thorne kicked back with his heels pushing the bike forward suddenly the rear wheel caught throwing up a plume of mud and the bike roared up the muddy track he accelerated fast the motorcycle fished and swerved treacherously on the trail behind him levine was shouting something but thorne didnt listen his heart was pounding the bike jumped across a rut in the path and they almost lost their balance then regained it accelerating again thorne did not dare look back he could smell the odor of rotten flesh could hear the rasping breath of the giant animal in pursuit doc take it easy levine shouted thorne ignored him the bike roared up the hill the foliage slapped at them mud spit up on their faces and chests he was pulled over into a rut then brought the bike back to the center of the trail he heard another roar and imagined it was a bit fainter but doc levine shouted leaning close to his car whatre you trying to do kill us doc were alone thorne came to a flat part of the path and risked a glance back over his shoulder levine was rightthey were alone he saw no sign of the pursuing tyrannosaur though he still heard it roaring somewhere in the distance he slowed the bike take it easy levine said shaking his head his face was ashen frightened youre a terrible driver do you know that you ought to take some lessons you almost got us killed there he was attacking us thorne said angrily he was familiar with levines critical manner but right now thats absurd levine said he wasnt attacking at all it sure as hell looked like it thorne said no no no levine said he wasnt attacking us the rex was defending his nest theres a big difference i didnt see any difference thorne said he pulled the bike to a stop and glared at levine in point of fact levine said if the rex had decided to chase you we d be dead right now but he stopped almost immediately he did thorne said theres no question about it levine said in his pedantic manner the rex only intended to scare us off and defend his territory hed never leave the nest unguarded unless we took something or disrupted the nest im sure hes back there with his mate right now hovering over the eggs not going anywhere then i guess were lucky hes a good parent thorne said gunning the motor of course hes a good parent levine continued any fool could tell that didnt you see how thin he was hes been neglecting his own nourishment to feed his offspring probably been doing it for weeks a tyrannosaurus rex is a complex animal with complex hunting behavior and he has complex childrearing behavior as well i wouldnt be surprised if adult tyrannosaurs have an extended parenting role that lasts for months he may teach his offspring to hunt for example start by bringing in small wounded animals and letting the youngsters finish them off that kind of thing itll be interesting to find out exactly what he does why are we waiting here through thornes earpiece the radio crackled malcolm said it would never occur to him to thank you for saving his life thorne grunted evidently not he said levine said who are you talking to is it malcolm is he here yes thorne said i hes agreeing with me isnt he levine said not exactly thorne said shaking his head look doc levine said im sorry if you got upset but there was no reason for it the truth is we were never in danger except from your bad driving fine thats fine thornes heart was still pounding in his chest he took a deep breath swung the bike to the left and headed down a wider path back toward their camp sitting behind him levine said im very glad to see you doc i really am thorne didnt answer he followed the path downward through foliage they descended to the valley picking up speed soon they saw the trailers in the clearing below levine said good you brought everything and the equipments working everything in good condition it all seems to be fine perfect levine said then this is just perfect maybe not thorne said through the back window of the trailer kelly and arby were waving cheerfully through the glass youre kidding levine said fourth configuration approaching the chaotic edge elements show internal conflict an unstable and potentially lethal region ian malcolm levine they came running across the clearing shouting dr levine dr levine youre safe they hugged levine who smiled despite himself he turned to thorne doc levine said this was very unwise why dont you explain that to them thorne said theyre your students kelly said dont be mad dr levine it was our decision arby explained to levine we came on our own on your own levine said we thought youd need help arby said and you did he turned to thorne thorne nodded yes theyve helped us and we promise we wont get in the way kelly said you go ahead and do whatever you have to do and we will just the kids were worried about you malcolm said coming up to levine because they thought you were in trouble anyway whats the big rush eddie said i mean you build all these vehicles and then you leave without them i had no choice levine said the government has an outbreak of some new encephalitis on its hands theyve decided its related to the occasional dinosaur carcass that washes up there of course the whole idea is idiotic but that wont stop them from destroying every animal on this island the minute they find out about it i had to get here first time is short so you came here alone malcolm said nonsense ian stop pouting i was going to call you as soon as i verified this was the island and i didnt come here alone i had a guide named diego a local man who swore he had been on this island as a kid years before and he seemed entirely knowledgeable he led me up the cliff without any problem and everything was going just fine until we were attacked at the stream and diego attacked malcolm said by what i didnt really see what it was levine said it happened extremely fast the animal knocked me down and tore the backpack and i dont really know what happened after that possibly the shape of my pack confused it because i got up and started running again and it didnt chase me malcolm was staring at him you were damn lucky richard yes well i ran for a long time when i looked back i was alone in the jungle and lost i didnt know what to do so i climbed a tree that seemed like a good idea and then around nightfall the velociraptors showed up velociraptors arby said small carnivores levine said basic theropod body shape long snout binocular vision roughly two meters tall weighing perhaps ninety kilos very fast intelligent nasty little dinosaurs and they travel in packs and last night there were eight of them jumping all around my tree trying to get to me all night long jumping and snarling jumping and snarlingi didnt get any sleep at all aw thats a shame eddie said look levine said crossly its not my problem if thorne said you spent the night in the tree yes and in the morning the raptors had gone so i came down and started looking around i found the lab or whatever it is clearly they abandoned it in a hurry leaving some animals behind i went through the building and discovered that there is still power some systems are still going all these years later and most important there is a network of security cameras thats a very lucky break so i decided to check on those cameras and i was hard at work when you people barged in wait a minute eddie said we came here to rescue you i dont know why levine said i certainly never asked you to thorne said it sounded like you did over the phone that is a misunderstanding levine said i was momentarily upset because i couldnt work the phone youve made that phone too complicated doc thats the problem so shall we get started levine paused he looked at the angry faces all around him malcolm turned to thorne a great scientist he said and a great human being look levine said i dont know what your problem is the expedition was going to come to this island sooner or later in this instance sooner is better everything has turned out quite well and frankly i dont see any reason to discuss it further this is not the time for petty bickering we have important things to do and i think we should get started because this island is an extraordinary opportunity and it isnt going to last forever dodgson lewis dodgson sat hunched in a dark corner of the chesperito cantina in puerto cortes nursing a beer beside him george baselton the regis professor of biology at stanford was enthusiastically devouring a plate of huevos rancheros the egg yolks ran yellow across green salsa it made dodgson sick just to look at it he turned away but he could still hear baselton licking his lips noisily there was no one else in the bar except for some chickens clucking around the floor every so often a young boy would come to the door throw a handful of rocks at the chickens and run away again giggling a scratchy stereo played an old elvis presley tape through corroded speakers above the bar dodgson hummed falling in love with you and tried to control his temper he had been sitting in this dump for damn near an hour baselton finished his eggs and pushed the plate away he brought out the small notebook he carried everywhere with him now lew he said ive been thinking about how to handle this handle what dodgson said irritably theres nothing to handle unless we can get to that island while he spoke he tapped a small photograph of richard levine on the edge of the bar table turned it over looked at the image upside down then right side up he sighed he looked at his watch lew baselton said patiently getting to the island is not the important part the important part is how we present our discovery to the world dodgson paused our discovery he repeated i like that george thats very good our discovery well thats the truth isnt it baselton said with a bland smile ingen is bankrupt its technology lost to mankind a tragic tragic loss as i have said many times on television but under the circumstances anyone who finds it again has made a discovery i dont know what else you would call it as henri poincare put it okay dodgson said so we make a discovery and then what hold a press conference absolutely not baselton said looking horrified a press conference would appear extremely crass it would open us up to all sorts of criticism no no a discovery of this magnitude must be treated with decorum it must be reported lew reported in the literature nature i imagine yes dodgson squinted you want to announce this in an academic publication what better way to make it legitimate baselton said its entirely proper to present our findings to our scholarly peers of course it will start a debate but what will that debate consist of an academic squabble professors sniping at professors which will fill the science pages of the newspapers for three days until it is pushed aside by the latest news on breast implants and in those three days we will have staked our claim youll write it yes baselton said and later i think an article in american scholar or perhaps natural history a humaninterest piece what this discovery means for the future what it tells us about the past all that dodgson nodded he could see that baselton was correct and he was reminded once again how much he needed him and how wise he had been to add him to the team dodgson never thought about public reaction and baselton thought about nothing else well thats fine dodgson said but none of it matters unless we get to that island he glanced at his watch again he heard a door open behind him and dodgsons assistant howard king came in pulling a heavyset costa rican man with a mustache the man had a weathered face and a sullen expression dodgson turned on his stool is this the guy yes lew whats his name gandoca senor gandoca dodgson held up the photo of levine you know this man gandoca hardly glanced at the photo he nodded si senor levine thats right senor flicking levine when was he here a few days ago he left with dieguito my cousin they are not back yet and where did they go dodgson asked isla sorna good dodgson drained his beer pushed the bottle away you have a boat he turned to king does he have a boat king said hes a fisherman he has a boat gandoca nodded a fishing boat si good i want to go to isla sorna too si senor but today the weather i dont care about the weather dodgson said the weather will get better i want to go now perhaps later now gandoca spread his hands i am very sorry senor dodgson said show him the money howard king opened a briefcase it was filled with five thousand colon notes gatidoca looked picked up one of the bills inspected it he put it back carefully shifted on his feet a little dodgson said i want to go now si senor gandoca said we leave when you are ready thats more like it dodgson said how long to get to the island perhaps two hours senor fine dodgson said thatll be fine the high hide here we go there was a click as levine connected the flexible cable to the explorers power winch and flicked it on the cable turned slowly in the sunlight they had all moved down onto the broad grassy plain at the base of the cliff the midday sun was high overhead glaring off the rocky rim of the island below the valley shimmered in midday heat there was a herd of hypsilophodons a short distance away the green gazellelike animals raised their heads occasionally above the grass to look toward them every time they heard the clink of metal as eddie and the kids laid out the aluminum strut assembly which had been the subject of so much speculation back in california that assembly now looked like a jumble of thin struts an oversized version of pickup sticks lying in the grass of the plain now we will see levine said rubbing his hands together as the motor turned the aluminum struts began to move and slowly lifted into the air the emerging structure appeared spidery and delicate but thorne knew that the crossbracing would give it surprising strength struts unfolding the structure rose ten feet then fifteen feet and finally it stopped the little house at the top was now just beneath the lowest branches of the nearby trees which almost concealed it from view but the scaffolding itself gleamed bright and shiny in the sun is that it arby said thats it yes thorne walked around the four sides slipping in the locking pins to hold it upright but its much too shiny levine said we should have made it matte black thorne said eddie we need to hide this want to spray it doc i think i brought some black paint levine shook his head no then itll smell how about those palms sure we can do that eddie walked to a stand of nearby palms and began to hack away big fronds with his machete kelly stared up at the aluminum strut assembly its great she said but what is it its a high hide levine said come on and he began to climb the scaffolding the structure at the top was a little house its roof supported by aluminum bars spaced four feet apart the floor of the house was also made of aluminum bars but these were closer together about six inches apart their feet threatened to slip through so levine took the first of the bundles of fronds that eddie carr was raising on a rope and used them to make a more complete floor the remaining fronds he tied to the outside of the house concealing its structure arby and kelly stared out at the animals from their vantage point they could look across the whole valley there was a distant herd of apatosaurs on the other side of the river a cluster of triceratops browsed to the north nearer the water some duckbilled dinosaurs with long crests rising above their heads moved forward to drink a low trumpeting cry from the duckbills floated across the valley toward them a deep unearthly sound a moment later there was an answering cry from the forest at the opposite side of the valley what was that kelly said parasaurolophus levine said its trumpeting through its nuchal crest lowfrequency sound carries a long distance to the south there was a herd of darkgreen animals with large curved protruding foreheads and a rim of small knobby horns they looked a little like buffalo what do you call those kelly said good question levine said they are either gravitholus albertae or more likely pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis but its difficult to say for sure because a full skeleton for these animals has never been recovered their foreheads are very thick bone so weve found many domed cranial fragments but this is the first time ive ever seen the whole animal and those heads what are they for arby said nobody knows levine said everyone has assumed theyre used for butting for intraspecies fighting among males competition for females that sort of thing malcolm climbed up into the hide yes butting heads he said sourly just as you see them now all right levine said so theyre not butting heads at the moment perhaps their breeding season is concluded or perhaps they dont do it at all malcolm said staring at the green animals they look pretty peaceful to me yes levine said but of course that doesnt mean a thing african buffalo appear peaceful most of the time too in fact they usually just stand motonless yet theyre unpredictable and dangerous animals we have to presume those domes exist for a reason even if were not seeing it now levine turned to the kids thats why we made this structure we want to make roundtheclock observations on the animals he said to the extent possible we want a full record of their activities why arby said because malcolm said this island presents a unique opportunity to study the greatest mystery in the history of our planet extinction you see malcolm said when ingen shut down their facility they did it hastily and they left some live animals behind that was five or six years ago dinosaurs mature rapidly most species attain adulthood in four or five years by now the first generation of ingen dinosaurs bred in a laboratory has attained maturity and has begun to breed a new generation entirely in the wild there is now a complete ecological system on this island with a dozen or so dinosaur species living in social groups for the first time in sixtyfive million years arby said so why is that an opportunity malcolm pointed across the plain well think about it extinction is a very difficult research topic there are dozens of competing theories the fossil record is incomplete and you cant perform experiments galileo could climb the tower of pisa and drop balls to test his theory of gravity he never actually did it but he could have newton used prisms to test his theory of light astronomers observed eclipses to test einsteins theory of relativity testing occurs throughout science but how can you test a theory of extinction you cant arby said but here yes malcolm said what we have here is a population of extinct animals artificially introduced into a closed environment and allowed to evolve all over again theres never been anything like it in all history we already know these animals became extinct once but nobody knows why and you expect to find out in a few days yes malcolm said we do how you dont expect them to become extinct again do you you mean right before our eyes malcolm laughed no no nothing like that but the point is for the first time we arent just studying bones were seeing live animals and observing their behavior i have a theory and i think that even in a short time we will see evidence for that theory what evidence kelly said what theory arby said malcolm smiled at them wait he said the red queen the apatosaurs had come down to the river in the heat of the day their graceful curving necks were reflected in the water as they bent to drink their long whiplike tails swung back and forth lazily several younger apatosaurs much smaller than the adults scampered about in the center of the herd beautiful isnt it levine said the way it all fits together just beautiful he leaned over the side and shouted to thorne wheres my mount coming up thorne said the rope now brought up a heavy widebased tripod and a circular mount on top there were five video cameras atop the mount and dangling wires leading to solar panels levine and malcolm began to set it up what happens to the video arby said the data gets multiplexed and we uplink it back to california by satellite well also hook into the security network so well have lots of observation points and we dont have to be here right and this is what you call a high hide yes at least thats what scientists like sarah harding call it thorne climbed up to join them the little shelter was now quite crowded but levine didnt seem to notice he was entirely focused on the dinosaurs he turned a pair of binoculars on the animals spread across the plain just as we thought he said to malcolm spatial oranization infants and juveniles in the center of the herd protective adults on the periphery the apatosaurs use their tails as defense thats the way it looks oh theres no question about it levine said he sighed its so agreeable to be proven right on the ground below eddie unpacked the circular aluminum cage the same one they had seen in california it was six feet tall and four feet in diameter constructed of oneinch titanium bars what do you want me to do with this eddie said leave it down there levine said thats where it belongs eddie set the cage upright in the corner of the scaffolding levine climbed down and whats that for arby said looking down catching a dinosaur in point of fact just the opposite levine clipped the cage to the side of the scaffolding he swung the door open and shut testing it there was a lock in the door he checked the lock too leaving the key in place with its dangling elastic loop its a predator cage like a shark levine said if youre down here walking around and anything happens you can climb in here and youll be safe in case what happens arby said with a worried look actually i dont think anything will happen levine said because i doubt the animals will pay any attention to us or to this little house once the structures been concealed you mean they wont see it oh theyll see it levine said but theyll ignore it but if they smell us levine shook his head we sited the hide so the prevailing wind is toward us and you may have noticed these ferns have a distinct smell it was a mild slightly tangy odor almost like eucalyptus arby fretted but suppose they decide to eat the ferns they wont levine said these are dicranopterus cyatheoides theyre mildly toxic and cause a rash in the month in point of fact theres a theory that their toxicity first evolved back in the jurassic as a defense against dinosaur browsers thats not a theory malcolm said its just idle speculation theres some logic behind it levine said plant life in the mesozoic must have been severely challenged by the arrival of very large dinosaurs herds of giant herbivores each animal consuming hundreds of pounds of plant matter each day would have wiped out any plants that didnt evolve some defense a bad taste or nettles or thorns or chemical toxicity so perhaps cyatheoides evolved its toxicity back then and its very effective because contemporary animals dont eat these ferns anywhere on earth thats why theyre so abundant you may have noticed plants have defenses kelly said of course they do plants evolve like every other form of life and theyve come up with their own forms of aggression defense and so on in the nineteenth century most theories concerned animals nature red in tooth and claw all that but now scientists are thinking about nature green in root and stem we realize that plants in their ceaseless struggle to survive have evolved everything from complex symbiosis with other animals to signaling mechanisms to warn other plants to outright chemical warfare kelly frowned signaling like what oh there are many examples levine said in africa acacia trees evolved very long sharp thorns three inches or so but that only provoked animals like giraffes and antelope to evolve long tongues to get past the thorns thorns alone didnt work so in the evolutionary arms race the acacia trees next evolved toxicity they started to produce large quantities of tannin in their leaves which sets off a lethal metabolic reaction in the animals that eat them literally kills them at the same time the acacias also evolved a kind of chemical warning system among themselves if an antelope begins to eat one tree in a grove that tree releases the chemical ethylene into the air which causes other trees in the grove to step up the production of leaf tannin within five or ten minutes the other trees are producing more tannin making themselves poisonous and then what happens to the antelope it dies well not any more levine said because the evolutionary arms race continued eventually antelopes learned that they could only browse for a short time once the trees started to produce more tannin they had to stop eating it and the browsers developed new strategies for example when a giraffe eats an acacia tree it then avoids all the trees downwind instead it moves on to another tree that is some distance away so the animals have adapted to this defense too in evolutionary theory this is called the red queen phenomenon malcolm said because in alice in wonderland the red queen tells alice she has to run as fast as she can just to stay where she is thats the way evolutionary spirals seem all the organisms are evolving at a furious pace just to stay in the same balance to stay where they are arby said and this is common even with plants oh yes levine said in their own way plants are extremely active oak trees for example produce tannin and phenol as a defense when caterpillars attack them a whole grove of trees is alerted as soon as one tree is infested its a way to protect the entire grove a kind of cooperation among trees you might say arby nodded and looked out from the high hide at the apatosaurs still by the river below so arby said is that why the dinosaurs havent eaten all the trees off this island because those big apatosaurs must eat a lot of plants they have long necks to eat the high leaves but the trees hardly look touched very good levine said nodding i noticed that myself is that because of these plant defenses well it might be levine said but i think there is a very simple explanation for why the trees are preserved whats that just look levine said its right before your eyes arby picked up the binoculars and stared at the herds whats the simple explanation among paleontologists levine said theres been an interminable debate about why sauropods have long necks those animals you see have necks twenty feet long the traditional belief has been that sauropods evolved long necks to eat high foliage that could not be reached by smaller animals so arby said whats the debate most animals on this planet have short necks levine said because a long neck is well a pain in the neck it causes all sorts of problems structural problems how to arrange muscles and ligaments to support a long neck behavioral problems nerve impulses must travel a long way from the brain to the body swallowing problems food has to go a long way from the mouth to the stomach breathing problems air has to be pulled down a long windpipe cardiac problems blood has to be pumped way up to the head or the animal faints in evolutionary terms all this is very difficult to do but giraffes do it arby said yes they do although giraffe necks are nowhere near this long giraffes have evolved large hearts and very thick fascia around the neck in effect the neck of a giraffe is like a bloodpressure cuff going all the way up do dinosaurs have the same cuff we dont know we assume apatosaurs have huge hearts perhaps three hundred pounds or more but there is another possible solution to the problem of pumping blood in a long neck yes youre looking at it right now levine said arby clapped his hands they dont raise their necks correct levine said at least not very often or for long periods of course right now the animals are drinking so their necks are down but my guess is that if we watch them for an extended period well find they dont spend much time with their necks raised high and thats why they dont eat the leaves on the trees right kelly frowned but if their long necks arent used for eating then why did they evolve them in the first place levine smiled there must be a good reason he said i believe it has to do with defense defense long necks arby stared i dont get it keep looking levine said its really rather obvious arbv peered through binoculars he said to kelly i hate it when he tells us its obvious i know she said with a sigh arby glanced over at thorne and caught his eye thorne made a v with his fingers and then pushed one finger tilting it over the movement forced the second finger to shift too so the two fingers were connected if it was a clue he didnt get it he didnt get it he frowned thorne mouthed bridge arby looked and watched the whiplike tails swing back and forth over the younger animals i get it arby said they use their tails for defense and they need long necks to counterbalance the long tails its like a suspension bridge levine squinted at arby you did that very fast he said thorne turned away hiding a smile but im right arby said yes levine said your view is essentially correct long necks exist because the long tails exist its a different situation in theropods which stand on two legs but in quadrupeds there needs to be a counterbalance for the long tail or the animal would simply tip over malcolm said actually there is something much more puzzling about this apatosaur herd oh levine said whats that there are no true adults malcolm said those animals we see are very large by our standards but in fact none of them has attained full adult size i find that perplexing do you it doesnt trouble me in the least levine said unquestionably it is simply because they havent had enough time to reach maturity im sure apatosaurs grow more slowly than the other dinosaurs after all large mammals like elephants grow more slowly than small ones malcolm shook his head thats not the explanation he said oh then what keep looking malcolm said pointing out over the plain its really rather obvious the kids giggled levine gave a little shiver of displeasure what is obvious to me he said is that none of the species appear to have attained full adulthood the triceratops the apatosaurs even the parasaurs are a bit smaller than one would expect this argues for a consistent factor some element of diet the effects of confinement on a small island perhaps even the way they were engineered but i dont consider it particularly remarkable or worrisome maybe youre right malcolm said and then again maybe youre not puerto cortes no flights sarah harding said what do you mean there are no flights it was eleven oclock in the morning harding had been flying for the last fifteen hours much of it spent on a us military transport that shed caught from nairobi to dallas she was exhausted her skin felt grimy she needed a shower and a change of clothes instead she found herself arguing with this very stubborn official in a ratty little town on the west coast of costa rica outside the fain had stopped but the sky was still gray with lowhanging clouds over the deserted airfield i am sorry rodriguez said no flights can be arranged but what about the helicopter that took the men earlier there is a helicopter yes where is it the helicopter is not here i can see that but where is it rodriguez spread his hands it has gone to san cristobal when will it be back i do not know i think tomorrow or perhaps the day after senor rodriguez she said firmly i must get to that island today i understand your wish rodriguez said but i cannot do anything to help this what do you suggest rodriguez shrugged i could not make a suggestion is there a boat that will take me i do not know of a boat this is a harbor harding said she pointed out the window i see all sorts of boats out there i know but i do not believe one will go to the islands the weather is not so favorable but if i were to go down to yes of course rodriguez sighed of course you may ask which was how she found herself shortly after eleven oclock on a rainy morning walking down the rickety wooden dock with her backpack on her shoulder four boats were tied up to the dock which smelled strongly of fish but all the boats seemed to be deserted all the activity was at the far end of the dock where a much larger boat was tied up beside the boat a red jeep wrangler was being strapped for loading along with several large steel drums and wooden crates of supplies she admired the car in passing it had been specially modified enlarged to the size of the land rover defender the most desirable of all field vehicles changing this jeep must have been an expensive alteration she thought only for researchers with lots of money standing on the dock a pair of americans in widebrimmed sun hats were shouting and pointing as the jeep lifted lopsidedly into the air and was swung onto the deck of the boat with an ancient crane she heard one of the men shout careful careful as the jeep thudded down hard on the wooden deck damn it be careful several workmen began to carry the boxes onto the ship the crane swung back to pick up the steel drums harding went over to the nearest man and said politely excuse me but i wonder if you could help me the man glanced at her he was medium height with reddish skin and bland features he looked awkward in new khaki safari clothes his manner was preoccupied and tense im busy now he said and turned away manuel watch it thats sensitive equipment im sorry to bother you she continued but my name is sarah harding and im trying i dont care if youre sarah bernhardt the manuel damn it the man waved his arms you there yes you hold that box upright im trying to get to isla sorna she said finishing at this the mans entire demeanor changed he turned back to her slowly isla sorna he said youre not associated with dr levine by any chance are you yes i am well ill be damned be said suddenly breaking into a warm smile what do you know he extended his hand im lew dodgson from the biosyn corporation back in cupertino this is my associate howard king hi the other man said nodding howard king was younger and taller than dodgson and he was handsome in a cleancut california way sarah recognized his type a classic beta male animal subservient to the core and there was something odd about his behavior toward her he moved a little away and seemed as uncomfortable around her as dodgson now seemed friendly and up there dodgson continued pointing onto the deck is our third george baselton harding saw a heavyset man on the deck bent over the boxes as they came on board his shirtsleeves were soaked in sweat she said are you all friends of richard were on our way over to see him right now dodgson said to help him out he hesitated frowning at her but uh he didnt tell us about you she was suddenly aware then of how she must appear to him a short woman in her thirties wearing a rumpled shirt khaki shorts and heavy boots her clothes dirty her hair unkempt after all the flights she said i know richard through ian malcolm ian and i are old friends i see he continued to stare at her as if he was unsure of her in some way she felt compelled to explain ive been in africa i decided to come here at the last minute she said doc thorne called me oh of course doc the man nodded and seemed to relax as if everything now made sense to him she said is richard all right well i certainly hope so because were taking all this equipment to him youre going to sorna now we are if this weather holds dodgson said glancing at the sky we should be ready to go in five or ten minutes you know youre welcome to join us if you need a ride he said cheerfully we could use the company wheres your stuff ive only got this she said lifting her small backpack traveling light eh well good ms harding welcome to the party he seemed entirely open and friendly now it was such a marked change from his earlier behavior but she noticed that the handsome man king remained distinctly uneasy king turned his back to her and acted very busy shouting at the workmen to be careful with the last of the wooden crates which were marked biosyn corporation in stenciled lettering she had the impression he was avoiding looking at her and she still hadnt gotten a good look at the third man on deck it made her hesitate youre sure its all right of course its all right wed be delighted dodgson said besides how else are you going to get there theres no planes the helicopter is gone i know i checked well then you know if you want to get to the island youd better go with us she looked at the jeep on the boat and said i think doc must already be there with his equipment at the mention of that the second man king snapped his head around in alarm but dodgson just nodded calmly and said yes i think so he left last night i believe thats what he said to me right dodgson nodded so hes already there at least i hope he is from on deck there were shouts in spanish and a captain in greasy overalls came and looked over the side senor dodgson we are ready good dodgson said excellent climb aboard ms harding lets get going king spewing black smoke the fishing boat chugged out of the harbor heading toward open sea howard king felt the rumble of the ships engines beneath his feet heard the creak of the wood he listened to the shouts of the crewmen in spanish king looked back at the little town of puerto cortes a jumble of little houses clustered around the waters edge he hoped this damn boat was seaworthy because they were out in the middle of nowhere and dodgson was cutting corners taking chances again it was the situation king feared most howard king had known lewis dodgson for almost ten years ever since he had joined biosyn as a young berkeley phd a promising researcher with the energy to conquer the world king had done his doctoral thesis on bloodcoagulation factors he had joined biosyn at a time of intense interest in those factors which seemed to hold the key to dissolving clots in patients with heart attacks there was a race among biotech companies to develop a new drug that would save lives and make a fortune as well initially king worked on a promising substance called hemaggluttin v or hgv in early tests it dissolved platelet aggregation to an astonishing degree king became the most promising young researcher at biosyn his picture was prominently featured in the annual report he had his own lab and an operating budget of nearly half a million dollars and then without warning the bottom fell out in preliminary tests on human subjects hgv failed to dissolve clots in either myocardial infarctions or pulmonary embolisms worse it produced severe side effects gastrointestinal bleeding skin rashes neurological problems after one patient died from convulsions the company halted further testing within weeks king lost his lab a newly arrived danish researcher took it over he was developing an extract from the saliva of the sumatran yellow leech which showed more promise king moved to a smaller lab decided he was tired of blood factors and turned his attention to painkillers he had an interesting compound the lisomer of a protein from the african horny toad which seemed to have narcotic effects but he had lost his former confidence and when the company reviewed his work they concluded that his research was insufficiently documented to warrant seeking fda approvals for testing his hornytoad project was summarily canceled king was then thirtyfive and twice a failure his picture no longer graced the annual report it was rumored that the company would probably let him go at the next review period when he proposed a new research project it was rejected at once it was a dark time in his life then lewis dodgson suggested they have lunch dodgson had an unsavory reputation among the researchers he was known as the undertaker because of the way he took over the work of others and prettied it up as his own in earlier years king never would have been seen with him but now he allowed dodgson to take him to an expensive seafood restaurant in san francisco research is hard dodgson said sympathetically you can say that again king said hard and risky dodgson said the fact is innovative research rarely pans out but does management understand no if the research fails youre the one whos blamed its not fair tell me king said but thats the name of the game dodgson shrugged and speared a leg of softshell crab king said nothing personally i dont like risk dodgson continued and original work is risky most new ideas are bad and most original work fails thats the reality if you feel compelled to do original research you can expect to fail thats all right if you work in a university where failure is praised and success leads to ostracism but in industryno no original work in industry is not a wise career choice its only going to get you into trouble which is where you are right now my friend what can i do king said well dodgson said i have my i own version of the scientific method i call it focused research development if only a few ideas are going to be good why try to find them yourself its too hard let other people find them let them take the risk let them go for the socalled glory id rather wait and develop ideas that already show promise take whats good and make it better or at least make it different enough so that i can patent it and then i own it then its mine king was amazed at the straightforward way that dodgson admitted he was a thief he didnt seem in the least embarrassed king poked at his salad for a while why are you telling me this because i see something in you dodgson said i see ambition frustrated ambition and im telling you howard you dont have to be frustrated you dont even have to be fired from the company at the next performance review which is exactly whats going to happen how old is your kid four king said terrible to be out of work with a young family and it wont be easy to get another job whos going to give you a chance now by thirtyfive a research scientist has already made his mark or hes not likely to i dont say thats right but thats how they think king knew thats how they thought at every biotechnology company in california but howard dodgson said leaning across the table lowering his voice a wonderful world awaits you if you choose to look at things differently theres a whole other way to live your life i really think you should consider what im saying two weeks later king became dodgsons personal assistant in the department of future biogenic trends which was bow biosyn referred to its efforts at industrial espionage and in the years that followed king had once again risen swiftly at biosyn this time because dodgson liked him now king had all the accoutrements of success a porsche a mortgage a divorce a kid he saw on weekends all because king had proven to be the perfect second in command working long hours handling the details keeping his fasttalking boss out of trouble and in the process king had come to know all the sides of dodgson his charismatic side his visionary side and his dark ruthless side king told himself that he could handle the ruthless side that he could keep it in check that over the years he had learned how to do that but sometimes he was not so sure like now because here they were in some rickety stinking fishing boat heading out into the ocean off some desolate village in costa rica and in this tense moment dodgson had suddenly decided to play some kind of game meeting this woman and deciding to take her along king didnt know what dodgson intended but he could see the intense gleam in dodgsons eyes that he had seen only a few times before and it was a look that always alarmed him the woman harding was now up on the foredeck standing near the bow she was looking off at the ocean king saw dodgson walking around the jeep and beckoned to him nervously listen king said we have to talk sure dodgson said easily whats on your mind and he smiled that charming smile harding sarah harding stared at the gray menacing sky the boat rolled in the heavy offshore swell the deckhands scrambled to tie down the jeep which threatened repeatedly to break free she stood in the bow fighting seasickness on the far horizon dead ahead she could just see the low black line that was their first glimpse of isla sorna she turned and looked back and saw dodgson and king were huddled by the railing amidships in intense conversation king seemed to be upset gesticulating rapidly dodgson was listening and shaking his head after a moment he put his arm on kings shoulder he seemed to be trying to calm the younger man down both men ignored the activity around the jeep which was odd she thought considering how worried they had been earlier about the equipment now they didnt seem to care as for the third man baselton she had of course recognized him and she was surprised to find him here on this little fishing boat baselton had shaken her hand in a perfunctory way and he had disappeared belowdecks as soon as the ship pulled away from the dock he had not reappeared but perhaps he was seasick too as she continued to watch she saw dodgson break away from king and hurry over to supervise the deckhands left alone king went to check on the straps that lashed the boxes and barrels to the deck farther aft the boxes marked biosyn harding had never heard of the biosyn corporation she wondered what connection ian and richard had with it whenever ian was around her he had always been critical even contemptuous of biotechnology companies and these men seemed to be unlikely friends they were too rigid toogeeky but then she reflected ian did have strange friends they were always showing up unexpectedly at his apartment the japanese calligrapher the indonesian gamalan troupe the las vegas juggler in a shiny bolero jacket that weird french astrologer who thought the earth was hollowand then there were his mathematician friends they were really crazy or so they seemed to sarah they were so wildeyed so wrapped up in their proofs pages and pages of proofs sometimes hundreds of pages it was all too abstract for her sarah harding liked to touch the dirt to see the animals to experience the sounds and the smells that was real to her everything else was just a bunch of theories possibly right possibly wrong waves began to crash over the bow and she moved a little astern to keep dry she yawned she hadnt slept much in the last twentyfour hours dodgson finished working on the jeep and came over to her she said everything all right oh yes dodgson said smiling cheerfully your friend king seemed upset he doesnt like boats dodgson said he nodded to the waves but were making better time itll only be an hour or so until we land tell me she said what is the biosyn corporation ive never heard of it its a small company dodgson said we make what are called consumer biologicals we specialize in recreational and sports organisms for example we engineered new kinds of trout and other game fish were making new kinds of dogssmaller pets for apartment dwellers that sort of thing exactly the sort of thing that ian hated she thought how do you know ian oh we go way back dodgson said she noticed his vagueness how far back to the days of the park the park she said he nodded did he ever tell you how he hurt his leg no she said he would never talk about it he just said it happened on a consulting job that hadi dont know some sort of trouble was it a park yes in a way dodgson said staring out at the ocean after a moment he shrugged and what about you how do you know him he was one of my thesis readers im an ethologist i study large mammals in african grassland ecosystems east africa carnivores in particular carnivores ive been studying hyenas she said before that lions for a long time almost ten years now six years continuously since my doctorate interesting dodgson said nodding and so did you come here all the way from africa yes from seronera in tanzania dodgson nodded vaguely he looked past her shoulder toward the island what do you know looks like the weather may clear after all she turned and saw streaks of blue in the thinning clouds overhead the sun was trying to break through the sea was calmer and she was surprised to see the island was much closer she could clearly see the cliffs rising above the seas the cliffs were reddishgray volcanic rock very sheer in tanzania dodgson said you run a large research team no i work alone no students he said im afraid not its because my work just isnt very glamorous the big savannah carnivores in africa are primarily nocturnal so my research is mostly conducted at night must be hard on your husband oh im not married she said with a little shrug im surprised he said after all a beautiful woman like you i never had time she said quickly to change the subject she said where do you land on this island dodgson turned to look they were now close enough to the island to see the waves crashing high and white against the base of the cliffs they were only a mile or two away its an unusual island dodgson said this whole region of central america is volcanic there are something like thirty active volcanoes between mexico and colombia all these offshore islands were at one time active volcanoes part of the central chain but unlike the mainland the islands are now dormant havent erupted for a thousand years or so so were seeing the outside of the crater exactly the cliffs are all the result of erosion from rainfall but the ocean erodes the base of the cliffs too those flat sections on the cliff you see are where the ocean cut in at the bottom and huge areas of the cliff face were undermined and just cleaved falling straight down into the sea its all soft volcanic rock and so you land there are several places on the windward side where the ocean has cut caves into the cliff and at two of those places the caves meet rivers flowing out from the interior so theyre passable he pointed ahead you see there you can just now see one of the caves sarah harding saw a dark irregular opening cut into the base of the cliff all around it the waves crashed plumes of white water rising fifty feet up into the air youre going to take this boat into that cave there if the weather holds yes dodgson turned away dont worry its not as bad as it looks anyway you were saying about africa when did you leave africa right after doc thorne called he said he was going with ian to rescue richard and asked if i wanted to come and what did you say i said id think about it dodgson frowned you didnt tell him you were coming no because i wasnt sure i wanted to i mean im busy i have my work and its a long way for an old lover dodgson said nodding sympathetically she sighed well you know ian yes i know ian dodgson said quite a character thats one way to put it she said there was an awkward silence dodgson cleared his throat im confused he said who exactly did you tell you were coming here nobody she said i just jumped on the next plane and came but what about your university your colleagues she shrugged there wasnt time and as i said i work alone she looked again at the island the cliffs rose high above the boat they were only a few hundred yards away the cave appeared much larger now but the waves crashed high on either side she shook her head it looks pretty rough dont worry dodgson said see the captains already making for it well be perfectly safe once were passing through and thenit should be very exciting the boat rolled and dipped in the sea an uncertain motion she gripped the railing beside her dodgson grinned see what i mean exciting isnt it he seemed suddenly energized almost agitated his body became tense he rubbed his hands together no need to worry ms harding i cant allow anything to happen to she didnt know what he was talking about but before she could reply the nose of the boat dipped again kicking up spray and she stumbled a little dodgson bent over quickly apparently to steady her but it seemed as if something went wrong his body struck against her legs then lifted and then another wave crashed over them and she felt her body twist and she screamed and clutched at the railing but it was all happening too fast the world upended and swirled around her her head clanged once on the railing and then she was tumbling falling through space she saw the peeling paint on the hull of the boat sliding past her she saw the green ocean rush up toward her and then she was shocked with the sudden stinging cold as she plunged into the rough heaving sea and sank beneath the waves into darkness the valley this is going extremely well levine said rubbing his hands together far beyond my expectations i must say i couldnt be more pleased he was standing in the high hide with thorne eddie malcolm and the kids looking down on the valley floor below everyone was sweating inside the little observation hut the midday air was still and hot around them the grassy meadow was deserted most of the dinosaurs had moved beneath the trees into the cool of the shade the exception was the herd of apatosaurs which had left the trees to return to the river where they were now drinking once again the huge animals clustered fairly tightly around the waters edge in the same vicinity but more spread out were the highcrested parasaurolophasaurs these somewhat smaller dinosaurs positioned themselves near the apatosaur herd thorne wiped sweat out of his eyes and said why exactly are you pleased because of what were seeing here malcolm said he glanced at his watch and wrote an entry in his notebook were getting the data that i hoped for its very exciting thorne yawned sleepy in the heat why is it exciting the dinosaurs are drinking whats the big deal drinking again levine corrected him for the second time in an hour at midday such fluid intake is highly suggestive of the thermoregulatory strategies these large creatures employ you mean they drink a lot to stay cool thorne said always impatient with jargon yes clearly they do drink a lot but in my view their return to the river may have another significance entirely which is come come levine said pointing look at the herds look how they are arranged spatially we are seeing something that no one has witnessed before or even suspected for dinosaurs were seeing nothing less than interspecies symbiosis we are yes levine said the apatosaurs and the parasaurs are together i saw them together yesterday too ill bet that theyre always together when theyre out on the open plain undoubtedly you are wondering why undoubtedly thorne said the reason levine said is that the apatosaurs are very strong but weaksighted whereas the parasaurs are smaller but have very sharp vision so the two species stay together because they provide a mutual defense just the way zebras and baboons stay together on the african plain zebras have a good sense of smell and baboons have good eyesight together theyre more effective against predators than either is alone and you think this is true of the dinosaurs because its rather obvious levine said just look at the behavior when the two herds were alone each clustered tightly among themselves but when theyre together the parasaurs spread out abandoning their former herd arrangement to form an outer ring around the apatosaurs just as you see them now that can only mean that individual paras are going to be protected by the apatosaur herd and vice versa it can only be a mutual predator defense as they watched one of the parasaurs lifted its head and stared across the river it honked mournfully a long musical sound all the other parasaurs looked up and stared too the apatosaurs continued to drink at the river although one or two adults raised their long necks in the midday heat insects buzzed around them thorne said so where are the predators right there malcolm said pointing toward a stand of trees on the other side of the river not far from the water thorne looked and saw nothing dont you see them no keep looking theyre small lizardlike animals dark brown raptors he said thorne shrugged he still saw nothing standing beside him levine began to eat a power bar preoccupied with holding the binoculars he dropped the wrapper on the floor of the hide bits of paper fluttered to the ground below how are those things arby said okay a little sugary got any more he said levine rummaged in his pockets and gave him one arby broke it in half and gave half to kelly he began to unwrap his half carefully folding the paper putting it neatly in his pocket you realize this is all highly significant malcolm said for the question of extinction already its obvious that the extinction of the dinosaurs is a far more complex problem than anyone has recognized it is arby said well consider malcolm said all extinction theories are based on the fossil record but the fossil record doesnt show the sort of behavior were seeing here it doesnt record the complexity of groups interacting because fossils are just bones arby said right and bones are not behavior when you think about it the fossil record is like a series of photographs frozen moments from what is really a moving ongoing reality looking at the fossil record is like thumbing through a family photo album you know that the album isnt complete you know life happens between the pictures but you dont have any record of what happens in between you only have the pictures so you study them and study them and pretty soon you begin to think of the album not as a series of moments but as reality itself and you begin to explain everything in terms of the album and you forget the underlying reality and the tendency malcolm said has been to think in terms of physical events to assume that some external physical event caused the extinctions a meteor hits the earth and changes the weather or volcanoes erupt and change the weather or a meteor causes the volcanoes to erupt and change the weather or vegetation changes and species starve and become extinct or a new disease arises and species become extinct or a new plant arises and poisons all the dinosaurs in every case what is imagined is some external event but what nobody imagines is that the animals themselves might have changednot in their bones but their behavior yet when you look at animals like these and see how intricately their behavior is interrelated you realize that a change in group behavior could easily lead to extinction but why would group behavior change thorne said if there wasnt some external catastrophe to force it why should the behaviour change actually malcolm said behavior is always changing all the time our planet is a dynamic active environment weather is changing the land is changing continents drift oceans rise and fall mountains thrust up and erode away all the organisms on the planet are constantly adapting to those changes the best organisms are the ones that can adapt most rapidly thats why its hard to see how a catastrophe that produces a large change could cause extinction since so much change is occurring all the time anyway in that case thorne said what causes extinction certainly not rapid change alone malcolm said the facts tell us that clearly what facts after every major environmental change a wave of extinctions as usually followedbut not right away extinctions only occur thousands or millions of years later take the last glaciation in north america the glaciers descended the climate changed severely but animals didnt die only after the glaciers receded when youd think things would go back to normal did lots of species become extinct thats when giraffes and tigers and mammoths vanished on this continent and thats the usual pattern its almost as if species are weakened by the major change but die off later its a wellrecognized phenomenon its called softening up the beachhead levine said and whats the explanation for it levine was silent there is none malcolm said its a paleontological mystery but i believe that complexity theory has a lot to tell us about it because if the notion of life at the edge of chaos is true then major change pushes animals closer to the edge it destabilizes all sorts of behavior and when the environment goes back to normal its not really a return to normal in evolutionary terms its another big change and its just too much to keep up with i believe that new behavior in populations can emerge in unexpected ways and i think i know why the dinosaurs whats that thorne said thorne was looking at the trees and saw a single dinosaur hop out into view it was rather slender agile on its hind legs balancing with a stiff tail it was six feet tall greenbrown with darkred stripes like a tiger that malcolm said is a velociraptor thorne turned to levine thats what chased you up in the tree it looks ugly efficient levine said those animals are brilliantly constructed killing machines arguably the most efficient predators in the history of the planet the one that just stepped out will be the alpha animal it leads the pack thorne saw other movement beneath the trees theres more oh yes levine said this particular pack is very large he picked up binoculars and peered through them id like to locate their nest he said i havent been able to find it anywhere on the island of course theyre secretive but even so the parasaurs were all crying loudly moving closer to the apatosaur herd as they did so but the big apatosaurs seemed relatively indifferent the adults nearest the water actually turned their backs to the approaching raptor dont they care arby said theyre not even looking at him dont be fooled levine said the apatosaurs care very much they may look like gigantic cows but theyre nothing of the sort those whiptails are thirty or forty feet long and weigh several tons notice how fast they can swing them one smack from those tails would snap an attackers back so turning away is part of their defense unquestionably yes and you can see now how the long necks balance their tails the tails of the adults were so long they reached entirely across the river to the other shore as they swung back and forth and the parasaurs cried out the lead raptor turned away moments later the entire pack began to slink off following the edge of the trees heading up into the hills looks like youre right thorne said the tails scared them off how many do you count levine said i dont know ten no wait fourteen maybe more i might have missed a few fourteen malcolm scribbled in his notebook you want to follow them levine said not now we could take the explorer maybe later malcolm said i think we need to know where their nest is levine said its essential ian if were going to settle predatorprey relationships nothing is more important than that and this is a perfect opportunity to follow maybe later malcolm said he checked his watch again thats the hundredth time youve checked your watch today thorne said malcolm shrugged getting to be lunchtime he said by the way what about sarah shouldnt she be arriving soon yes i imagine shell show up any time now thorne said malcolm wiped his forehead its hot up here yes its hot they listened to the buzzing of insects in the midday sun and watched the raptors retreat you know im thinking malcolm said maybe we ought to go back go back levine said now what about our observations what about the other cameras we want to place and i dont know maybe itd be good to take a break levine stared at him in disbelief he said nothing thorne and the kids looked at malcolm silently well it seems to me malcolm said that if sarahs coming all the way from africa we should be there to greet her he shrugged i think its simple politeness thorne said i didnt realize that uh no no malcolm said quickly its nothing like that i just uhyou know maybe shes not even coming he looked suddenly uncertain did she say she was coming she said shed think about it malcolm frowned then shes coming if sarah said that shes corning i know her so what do you say want to go back certainly not levine said peering through binoculars i wouldnt dream of leaving here now malcolm turned doc want to go back sure thorne said wiping his forehead its hot if i know sarah malcolm said climbing down the scaffolding shes going to show up on this island just looking great cave she struggled upward and her head broke the surface but she saw only water great swells rising fifteen feet above her on all sides the power of the ocean was immense the surge dragged her forward then back and she was helpless to resist she could not see the boat anywhere only foaming sea on all sides she could not see the island only water only water she fought a sense of overwhelming panic she tried to kick against the current but her boots were leaden she sank down again and struggled back gasping for air she had to get her boots off somehow she gulped a breath and ducked her head under the water and tried to unlace the boots her lungs burned as she fumbled with the knots the ocean swept her back and forth ceaselessly she got one boot off gulped air and ducked down again her fingers were stiff with cold and fright as she worked on the other boot it seemed to take hours finally her legs were free light and she dogpaddled catching her breath the surge lifted her high dropped her again she could not see the island she felt panic again she turned and felt the surge lift once more and then she saw the island the sheer cliffs were close frighteningly close the waves boomed as they smashed against the rocks she was no more than fifty yards offshore being swept inexorably toward the crashing surf on the next crest she saw the cave a hundred yards to her right she tried to swim toward it but it was hopeless she had no power at all to move in this gigantic surf she felt only the strength of the sea sweeping her to the cliffs panic made her heart race she knew she would be instantly killed a wave crested over her she gulped sea water and coughed her eyes blurred she felt nausea and deep deep terror she put her head down and began to swim arm over arm kicking as hard as she could she had no sense of movement only the sideways pull of the surge she dared not look up she kicked harder when she raised her head for another breath she saw she had moved a little not much but a little to the north she was a little nearer to the cave she was encouraged but she was terrified she had so little strength her arms and legs ached with her effort her lungs burned her breath came in short ragged heaving gasps she coughed again grabbed another breath put her head down and kicked onward even with her head in the water she heard the deep boom of the surf against the cliffs she kicked with all her might the currents and surge moved her left and right forward and back it was hopeless but still she tried gradually the ache in her muscles became a steady drill pain she felt she had lived with this pain all her life she did not notice it any more she kicked on oblivious when she felt the surge lift her up again she raised her head for a breath she was startled to see that the cave was very close a few more strokes and she would be swept inside it she had thought the current might be less severe around the cave but it wasnt on either side of the opening the waves crashed high climbing the cliff walls and then falling back the boat was nowhere in sight she ducked her head down again kicked forward using the last of her strength she could feel her entire body weakening she could not last much longer she knew she was being carried toward the cliffs she heard the boom of the surf louder now and she kicked again and suddenly a huge swell swept her up lifting her carrying her toward the cliffs she was powerless to resist it she raised her head to look and saw darkness inky darkness in her exhaustion and pain she realized that she was inside the cave she had been swept into the cave the booming sound was hollow reverberating it was too dark to see the walls on either side the current was intense sweeping her ever deeper she gasped for breath and paddled ineffectually her body scraped against rock she felt a moment of searing pain and then she was swept farther into the depths of the cave but now there was a difference she saw faint light on the ceiling and the water around her seemed to glow the surge lessened she found it easier to keep her head above water she saw hot light ahead brilliantly hot the end of the cave and suddenly astonishingly she was carried through and burst into sunlight and open air she found herself in the middle of a broad muddy river surrounded by dense green foliage the air was hot and still she heard the distant cries of jungle birds up ahead around a bend in the river she saw the stern of dodgsons boat already tied up to the shore she could not see any of the people and she didnt want to see them summoning her remaining strength she kicked toward shore and clutched at a stand of mangroves growing thickly along the waters edge too weak to hold on she hooked her arm around a root and lay on her back in the gentle current looking up at the sky gasping for breath she did not know how much time passed but finally she felt strong enough to haul herself arm over arm along the mangrove roots at the waters edge until she came to a narrow break in the foliage leading to a patch of muddy shore beyond as she dragged herself out of the water and up on the slippery bank she noticed several rather large animal footprints in the mud they were curious threetoed footprints with each toe ending in a large claw she bent to examine them more closely and then she felt the earth vibrating trembling beneath her hands a large shadow fell over her and she looked up in astonishment at the leathery pale underbelly of an enormous animal she was too weak to react even to raise her head the last thing she saw was a huge leathery foot landing beside her shushing in the mud and a soft snorting sound and then suddenly abruptly exhaustion overtook her and sarah harding collapsed and fell onto her back her eyes rolled up into her head and she lost consciousness dodgson a few yards up from the shore of the river lewis dodgson climbed into the custommade jeep wrangler and slammed the door shut beside him in the passenger seat howard king was wringing his hands he said how could you have done that to her done what george baselton said from the back seat dodgson did not reply he turned the key in the ignition the engine rumbled to life he popped the fourwheel drive into gear and headed up the hill into the jungle away from the boat at the shore how could you king said again agitated i mean jesus what happened was an accident dodgson said an accident an accident thats right an accident dodgson said calmly she fell overboard i didnt see anything baselton said king was shaking his head jesus what if somebody comes to investigate and what if they do dodgson said interrupting him we were in rough seas she was standing at the bow a big wave hit us and she was washed overboard she couldnt swim very well we circled and looked for her but there was no hope a very unfortunate accident so what are you concerned about what am i concerned about yes howard exactly what the fuck are you concerned about i saw it for christs sake no you didnt dodgson said i didnt see anything baselton said i was down below the whole time thats fine for you howard king said but what if theres an investigation the jeep bounced up the dirt track moving deeper into the jungle there wont be dodgson said she left africa in a hurry and she didnt tell anybody where she was going how do you know king whined because she told me howard thats how i know now get the map out and stop moaning you knew the deal when you joined me i didnt know you were going to kill somebody for christs sake howard dodgson said with a sigh nothings going to happen get the map out how do you know king said because i know what im doing dodgson said thats why unlike malcolm and thorne who are somewhere on this island screwing around doing fuck knows what in this damned jungle mention of the others caused a new worry fretting king said maybe well run into them no howard we wont theyll never even know were here were only going to be on this island for four hours remember land at one back on the boat by five back at the port by seven back in san francisco by midnight bang done finito and finally after all these years ill have what i should have had long ago dinosaur embryos baselton said embryos king asked surprised oh im not interested in embryos any more dodgson said years ago i tried to get frozen embryos but theres no reason to bother with embryos now i want fertilized eggs and in four hours ill have them from every species on this island how can you do that in four hours because i already know the precise location of every dinosaur breeding site on the island the map howard king opened the map it was a large topographical chart of the island two feet by three feet showing terrain elevations in blue contours at several places in lowland valleys there were dense red concentric circles in some places clusters of circles whats this king said why dont you read what it says dodgson said king turned the map and looked at the legend sigma data landsatnordstat mixed spectra vsfrfaslriffvr and then a bunch of numbers no wait dates correct dodgson said dates pass dates this is a summary chart combining data from several satellite passes correct king frowned and it looks likevisible spectrum and false aparture radar andwhat infrared broadband thermal vr dodgson smiled i did all this in about two hours downloaded all the satellite data summarized it and had the answers i wanted i get it king said these red circles are infrared signatures yes dodgson said big animals leave big signatures i got all the satellite flybys over this island for the last few years and mapped the location of heat sources and the locations overlapped from pass to pass which is what makes these red concentric marks meaning that the animals tend to be located in these particular places why he turned to king because these are the nesting sites yes they must be baselton said maybe thats where they eat king said dodgson shook his head irritably obviously those circles cant be feeding sites why not because these animals average twenty tons apiece thats why you get a herd of twentyton dinos and youre talking a combined biomass of more than half a million pounds moving through the forest that many big animals are going to eat a lot of plant matter in the course of a day and the only way they can do that is by moving right i guess you guess look around you howard do you see any denuded sections of forest no you dont they eat a few leaves from the trees and move on trust me these animals have to move to eat but what they dont move is their nesting sites so these red circles must be nesting sites he glanced at the map and unless im wrong the first of the nests is just over this rise and down the hill on the other side the jeep fishtailed in a patch of mud and ground forward lurching up the hill mating calls richard levine stood in the high hide staring at the herds through binoculars malcolm had gone back to the trailer with the others leaving levine alone in fact levine was relieved to have him gone levine was quite content to make observations on these extraordinary animals and he was aware that malcolm did not share his boundless enthusiasm indeed malcolm always seemed to have other considerations on his mind and malcolm was notably impatient with the act of observation he wanted to analyze the data but he did not want to collect it of course among scientists that represented a wellknown difference in personality physics was a perfect example the experimentalists and the theorists lived in utterly different worlds passing papers back and forth but sharing little else in common it was almost as if they were in different disciplines and for levine and malcolm the difference in their approach had surfaced early back in the santa fe days both men were interested in extinction but malcolm approached the subject broadly from a purely mathematical standpoint his detachment his inexorable formulas had fascinated levine and the two men began an informal exchange over frequent lunches levine taught malcolm paleontology malcolm taught levine nonlinear mathematics they began to draw some tentative conclusions which both found exciting but they also began to disagree more than once they were asked to leave the restaurant then they would go out into the heat of guadelupe street and walk back toward the river still shouting at each other while approaching tourists hurried to the other side of the street in the end their differences came down to personalities malcolm considered levine pedantic and fussy preoccupied with petty details levine never saw the big picture he never looked at the consequences of his actions for his own part levine did not hesitate to call malcolm imperious and detached indifferent to details god is in the details levine once reminded him maybe your god malcolm shot back not mine mine is in the process standing in the high hide levine thought that answer was exactly what you would expect from a mathematician levine was quite satisfied that details were everything at least in biology and that the most common failing of his biological colleagues was insufficient attention to detail for himself levine lived for the details and he could not ever let them go like the animal that had attacked him with diego levine thought of it often turning it over and over again reliving the events because there was something troubling some impression that he could not get right the animal had attacked quickly and he had sensed it was a basic theropod formhind legs stiff tail large skull the usualbut in the brief flash in which he had seen the creature there seemed to be a peculiarity around the orbits which made him think of carnotaurus sastrei from the gorro frigo formation in argentina and in addition the skin was extremely unusual it seemed to be a sort of bright mottled green but there was something about it he shrugged the troubling idea hung in the back of his mind but he couldnt get to it he ust couldnt get it reluctantly levine turned his attention to the parasaur herd browsing by the river alongside the apatosaurs he listened as the parasaurs made their distinctive low trumpeting sounds levine noticed that most often the parasaurs made a sound of short duration a kind of rumbling honk sometimes several animals made this sound at once or very nearly overlapping so it seemed to be an audible way of indicating to the herd where all the members were then there was a much longer more dramatic trumpeting call this sound was made infrequently and only by the two largest animals in the herd which raised their heads and trumpeted loud and long but what did the sound mean standing there in the hot sun levine decided to perform a little experiment he cupped his hands around his mouth and imitated the parasaurs trumpeting cry it wasnt a very good imitation but immediately the lead parasaur looked up turning its head this way and that and it gave a low cry answering levine levine gave a second call again the parasaur answered levine was pleased by this response and made an entry in his notebook but when he looked up again he was surprised to see that the parasaur herd was drifting away from the apatosaurs they collected together formed a single line and began to walk directly toward the high hide levine started to sweat what had he done in some bizarre corner of his mind he wondered if he had imitated a mating cry that was all he needed to attract a randy dinosaur who knew how these animals behaved in mating with growing anxiety he watched them march forward probably he should call malcolm and ask his advice but as he thought about it he realized that by imitating that cry he had interfered with the environment introduced a new variable he had done exactly what he had told thorne he did not intend to do it was thoughtless of course and surely not very important in the scheme of things but malcolm was certain to give him hell about it levine lowered his binoculars and stared a deep trumpeting sound reverberated through the air so loud it hurt his ears the ground began to shake making the high hide sway back and forth precariously my god he thought theyre coming right for me he bent over and with fumbling fingers searched his backpack for the radio problems of evolution in the trailer thorne took the rehydrated meals out of the microwave and passed the plates around the little table everyone unwrapped them and began to cat malcolm poked his fork into the food what is this stuff herbbaked chicken breast thorne said malcolm took a bite and shook his head isnt technology wonderful he said they manage to make it taste just like cardboard malcolm looked at the two kids seated opposite him who were eating energetically kelly glanced up at him and gestured with her fork at the books strapped into a shelf beside the table one thing i dont understand only one malcolm said all this business about evolution she said darwin wrote his book a long time ago right darwin published the origin of species in malcolm said and by now everybody believes it isnt that right i think its fair to say that every scientist in the world agrees that evolution is a feature of life on earth malcolm said and that we are descended from animal ancestors yes okay kelly said so whats the big deal now malcolm smiled the big deal he said is that everybody agrees evolution occurs but nobody understands how it works there are big problems with the theory and more and more scientists are admitting it malcolm pushed his plate away you have to track the theory he said over a couple of hundred years start with baron georges cuvier the most famous anatomist in the world in his day living in the intellectual center of the world paris around people began digging up old bones and cuvier realized that they belonged to animals no longer found on earth that was a problem because back in everybody believed that all the animal species ever created were still alive the idea seemed reasonable because the earth was thought to be only a few thousand years old and because god who had created all the animals would never let any of his creations become extinct so extinction was agreed to be impossible cuvier agonized over these dugup bones but he finally concluded that god or no god many animals had become extinct as a result he thought of worldwide catastrophes like noahs flood okay so cuvier reluctantly came to believe in extinction malcolm said but he never accepted evolution in cuviers mind evolution didnt occur some animals died and some survived but none evolved in his view animals didnt change then along came darwin who said that animals did evolve and that the dugup bones were actually the extinct predecessors of living animals the implications of darwins idea upset lots of people they didnt like to think of gods creations changing and they didnt like to think of monkeys in their family trees it was embarrassing and offensive the debate was fierce but darwin amassed a tremendous amount of factual data he had made an overwhelming case so gradually his idea of evolution was accepted by scientists and by the world at large but the question remained how does evolution happen for that darwin didnt have a good answer natural selection arby said yes that was darwins explanation the environment exerts pressure which favors certain animals and they breed more often in subsequent generations and thats how evolution occurs but as many people realized natural selection isnt really an explanation its just a definition if an animal succeeds it must have been selected for but what in the animal is favored and how does natural selection actually operate darwin had no idea and neither did anybody else for another fifty years but its genes kelly said okay malcolm said fine we come to the twentieth century mendels work with plants is rediscovered fischer and wright do population studies pretty soon we know genes control hereditywhatever genes are remember through the first half of the century all during world war i and world war ii nobody had any idea what a gene was after watson and crick in we knew that genes were nucleotides arranged in a double helix great and we knew about mutation so by the late twentieth century we have a theory of natural selection which says that mutations arise spontaneously in genes that the environment favors the mutations that are beneficial and out of this selection process evolution occurs its simple and straightforward god is not at work no higher organizing principle involved in the end evolution is just the result of a bunch of mutations that either survive or die right right arby said but there are problems with that idea malcolm said first of all theres a time problem a single bacterium the earliest form of life has two thousand enzymes scientists have estimated how long it would take to randomly assemble those enzymes from a primordial soup estimates run from forty billion years to one hundred billion years but the earth is only four billion years old so chance alone seems too slow particularly since we know bacteria actually appeared only four hundred million years after the earth began life appeared very fast which is why some scientists have decided life on earth must be of extraterrestrial origin although i think thats just evading the issue okay second theres the coordination problem if you believe the current theory then all the wonderful complexity of life is nothing but the accumulation of chance events a bunch of genetic accidents strung together yet when we look closely at animals it appears as if many elements must have evolved simultaneously take bats which have echolocationthey navigate by sound to do that many things must evolve bats need a specialized apparatus to make sounds they need specialized ears to hear echoes they need specialized brains to interpret the sounds and they need specialized bodies to dive and swoop and catch insects if all these things dont evolve simultaneously theres no advantage and to imagine all these things happen purely by chance is like imagining that a tornado can hit a junkyard and assemble the parts into a working airplane its very hard to believe okay thorne said i agree next problem evolution doesnt always act like a blind force should certain environmental niches dont get filled certain plants dont get eaten and certain animals dont evolve much sharks havent changed for a hundred and sixty million years opossums havent changed since dinosaurs became extinct sixtyfive million years ago the environments for these animals have changed dramatically but the animals have remained almost the same not exactly the same but almost in other words it appears they havent responded to their environment maybe theyre still well adapted arby said maybe or maybe theres something else going on that we dont understand like what like other rules that influence the outcome thorne said are you saying evolution is directed no malcolm said thats creationism and its wrong just plain wrong but i am saying that natural selection acting on genes is probably not the whole story its too simple other forces are also at work the hemoglobin molecule is a protein that is folded like a sandwich around a central iron atom that binds oxygen hemoglobin expands and contracts when it takes on and gives up oxygenlike a tiny molecular lung now we know the sequence of amino acids that make up hemoglobin but we dont know how to fold it fortunately we dont need to know that because if you make the molecule it folds all by itself it organizes itself and it turns out again and again that living things seem to have a selforganizing quality proteins fold enzymes interact cells arrange themselves to form organs and the organs arrange themselves to form a coherent individual individuals organize themselves to make a population and populations organize themselves to make a coherent biosphere from complexity theory were starting to have a sense of how this selforganization may happen and what it means and it implies a major change in how we view evolution but arby said in the end evolution still must be the result of the environment acting on genes i dont think its enough arb malcolm said i think more is involved i think there has to be more even to explain how our own species arose about three million years ago malcolm said some african apes that had been living in trees came down to the ground there was nothing special about these apes their brains were small and they werent especially smart they didnt have claws or sharp teeth for weapons they werent particularly strong or fast they were certainly no match for a leopard but because they were short they started standing upright on their hind legs to see over the tall african grass thats how it began just some ordinary apes looking out over the grass as time went on the apes stood upright more and more of the time that left their hands free to do things like all apes they were toolusers chimps for example use twigs to fish for termites that sort of thing as time went on our ape ancestors developed more complex tools that stimulated their brains to grow in size and complexity it began a spiral more complex tools provoked more complex brains which provoked more complex tools and our brains literally exploded in evolutionary terms our brains more than doubled in size in about a million years and that caused problems for us like what like getting born for one thing big brains cant pass through the birth canal which means that both mother and child die in childbirth thats no good whats the evolutionary response to make human infants born very early in development when their brains are still small enough to pass through the pelvis its the marsupial solution most of the growth occurs outside the mothers body a human childs brain doubles during the first year of life thats a good solution to the problem of birth but it creates other problems it means that human children will be helpless long after birth the infants of many mammals can walk minutes after theyre born others walk in a few days or weeks but human infants cant walk for a full year they cant feed themselves for even longer so one price of big brains was that our ancestors had to evolve new stable social organizations to permit longterm child care lasting many years these bigbrained totally helpless children changed society but thats not the most important consequence no no being born in an immature state means that human infants have unformed brains they dont arrive with a lot of builtin instinctive behavior instinctively a newborn infant can suck and grasp but thats about all complex human behavior is not instinctive at all so human societies had to develop education to train the brains of their children to teach them how to act every human society expends tremendous time and energy teaching its children the right way to behave you look at a simpler society in the rain forest somewhere and you find that every child is born into a network of adults responsible for helping to raise the child not only parents but aunts and uncles and grandparents and tribal elders some teach the child to hunt or gather food or weave some teach them about sex or war but the responsibilities are clearly defined and if a child does not have say a mothers brothers sister to do a specific teaching job the people get together and appoint a substitute because raising children is in a sense the reason the society exists in the first place its the most important thing that happens and its the culmination of all the tools and language and social structure that has evolved and eventually a few million years later we have kids using computers now if this picture makes sense where does natural selection act does it act on the body enlarging the brain does it act on the developmental sequence pushing the kids out early does it act on social behavior provoking cooperation and childcaring or does it act everywhere all at once on bodies on development and on social behavior everywhere at once arby said i think so malcolm said but there may also be parts of this story that happen automatically the result of selforganization for example infants of all species have a characteristic appearance big eyes big heads small faces uncoordinated movements thats true of kids and puppies and baby birds and it seems to provoke adults of all species to act tenderly toward them in a sense you might say infant appearance seems to selforganize adult behavior and in our case a good thing too thorne said what does that have to do with dinosaur extinction selforganizing principles can act for better or worse just as selforganization can coordinate change it can also lead a population into decline and cause it to lose its edge on this island my hope is well see selforganizing adaptations in the behavior of real dinosaurs and itll tell us why they became extinct in fact im pretty sure we already know why the dinosaurs became extinct the radio clicked bravo levine said over the intercom i couldnt have put it better myself but perhaps you better see what is happening out here the parasaurs are doing something very interesting ian whats that come and look kids malcolm said you stay here and watch the monitors he pressed the radio button richard were on our way parasaurs richard levine gripped the railing of the high hide and watched tensely directly ahead coming into view over a low rise he saw the magnificent head of a parasaurolophus walkeri the duckbilled hadrosaurs skull was three feet long but it was made larger by a long horned crest that extended backward high in the air as the animal approached levine could see the green mottling on the head he saw the long powerful neck the heavy body with its light green underbelly the parasaurolophus was twelve feet tall and roughly the size of a large elephant its head was almost as high as the floor of the high hide the animal moved steadily toward him its footsteps thumping on the ground moments later he saw a second head appear over the risethen a third and a fourth the animals trumpeted and walked in single file directly toward him within moments the lead animal was abreast of the hide levine held his breath as it passed the animal stared at him its large brown eye rolling to watch him it licked its lips with a darkpurple tongue the hide shook with its footsteps and then it had passed continuing on toward the jungle behind soon after the second animal passed the third animal brushed against the structure rocking it slightly but the dinosaur did not seem to notice it continued steadily on so did the others one by one they disappeared into the dense foliage behind the high hide the earth ceased to vibrate it was then that he saw the game trail running past the high hide and into the jungle levine sighed his body relaxed slowly he picked up his binoculars and took a deep breath calming himself his panic faded he began to feel better and then he thought what are they doing where are they going because as he considered it the behavior of the parasaurs seemed extremely strange they had been in a defensive cluster while they fed but in movement they had shifted to single file which broke the usual clumped herd pattern and made every animal vulnerable to predation yet the behavior was clearly organized moving in single file must serve some purpose but what now that they were within the jungle the animals had begun making low trumpeting sounds of short duration again he had the sense that this was some sort of vocalization to convey position perhaps for members to keep track of each other while they moved through the jungle while they changed locations but why were they changing locations where were they going what were they doing he certainly couldnt tell here standing up in the high hide he hesitated listening to them then in a decisive moment he swung his leg over the railing and climbed quickly down the scaffolding heat she felt heat and wet something rough scraped along her face like sandpaper it happened again this roughness on her cheek sarah harding coughed something dripped on her neck she smelled an odd sweetish odor like fermenting african beer there was a deep hissing sound then the rough scraping again starting at her neck moving up her cheek slowly she opened her eyes and stared up into the face of a horse the big dull eye of the horse peered down at her with soft eyelashes the horse was licking her with its tongue it was almost pleasant she thought almost reassuring lying on her back in the mud with a horse it wasnt a horse the head was too narrow she suddenly saw the snout too tapered the proportions all wrong she turned to look and saw that it was a small head leading to a surprisingly thick neck and a heavy body she jumped up scrambling to her knees oh my god her sudden movement startled the big animal which snorted in alarm and moved slowly away it walked a few steps down the muddy shore and then turned back looking at her reproachfully but she could see it now small head thick neck huge lumbering body with a double row of pentagonal plates running along the crest of the back a dragging tail with spikes in it harding blinked it couldnt be confused and dazed her brain fumbled for the name of this creature and it came back to her all the way from childhood stegosaurus it was a god damn stegosaurus in her astonishment her mind went back to the glaring white hospital room when she had visited ian malcolm in his delirium when he mumbled the names of several dinosaurs she had always had her suspicions but even now confronted by a living stegosaur her immediate reaction was that it must be some kind of a trick sarah squinted at the animal looking for the seam in the costume the mechanical joints beneath the skin but the skin was seamless and the animal moved in an integrated organic way the eyes blinked again slowly then the stegosaurus turned away from her moved to the waters edge and lapped it with its large rough tongue the tongue was dark blue how could that be dark blue from venous blood was it coldblooded no this animal moved much too smoothly it had the assurance and indifference of a warmblooded creature lizards and reptiles always seemed to be paying attention to the temperature of their surroundings this creature didnt behave that way at all it stood in the shade and lapped up the cold water indifferent to it all she looked down at her shirt saw the foamy spittle running down from her neck it had drooled on her she touched it with her fingers it was warm it was warmblooded all right a stegosaurus she stared the stegosauruss skin had a pebbled texture but it was not scaly like a reptiles it was more like the skin of a rhino she thought or of a warthog except it was entirely hairless without the bristles of a pig the stegosaurus moved slowly it had a peaceful rather stupid air and it probably was stupid she thought looking again at the head the braincase was much smaller than that of a horse very small for the body weight she got to her feet and groaned her body ached every limb and muscle was sore her legs trembled she took a breath a few yards away the stegosaurus paused glanced at her taking in her new upright appearance when she did not move it became indifferent once again and returned to drinking from the river ill be damned she said she looked at her watch it was onethirty in the afternoon the sun still high overhead she couldnt use the sun to navigate and the afternoon was very hot she decided she had better start walking and try and find malcolm and thorne barefooted moving stiffly her muscles aching she headed into the jungle away from the river after walking half an hour she was very thirsty but she had trained herself to go without water for long periods in the african savannah she continued on indifferent to her own discomfort as she approached the top of a ridge she came to a game trail a wide muddy track through the jungle it was easier walking along the trail and she had been following it for about fifteen minutes when she heard an excited yelping from somewhere ahead it reminded her of dogs and she proceeded cautiously moments later there was a crashing sound in the underbrush corning from several directions at once and suddenly a darkgreen lizardlike animal about four feet high burst through the foliage at terrific speed shrieked and leapt over her she ducked instinctively and hardly had time to recover before a second animal appeared and raced past her within instants a whole herd of animals was running past her on all sides yelping in fear and then the next one brushed against her and knocked her over she fell in the mud as other animals leapt and crashed around her a few feet ahead on the trail she saw a large tree with lowhanging branches she acted without thinking jumping to her feet grabbing the branch and swinging up she reached safety just as a new dinosaur with sharpclawed feet rushed through the maid beneath her and chased after the fleeing green creatures as this animal went away from her she glimpsed a dark body six feet tall with reddish stripes like a tiger soon after a second striped animal appeared then a third a pack of predators hissing and snarling as they pursued the green dinosaurs from her years in the field she found herself automatically counting the animals that rushed past her by her count there were ten striped predators and that immediately piqued her interest it made no sense she thought as soon as the last of the predators was gone she dropped down to the ground arid hurried to follow them it occurred to hey that it might be foolish to do so but her curiosity overcame her she chased the tigerdinosaurs up a hill but even before she reached the crest she could tell from the snarls and growls that they had already brought an animal down at the crest she looked down on their kill but it was like no kill she had ever seen in africa on the seronera plain a kill site had its own organization which was quite predictable and in a way was almost stately the biggest predators lions or hyenas were closest to the carcass feeding with their young farther out waiting their turn were the vultures and marabou storks and still farther out the jackals and other small scavengers circled warily after the big predators finished the smaller animals moved in different animals ate different parts of the bodies the hyenas and vultures ate bones the jackals nibbled the carcass clean this was the pattern at any kill and as a result there was very little squabbling or fighting around the food but here she saw pandemonium a feeding frenzy the fallen animal was thickly covered with striped predators all furiously ripping the flesh of the carcass with frequent pauses to snarl and fight with each other their fights were openly vicious one predator bit the adjacent animal inflicting a deep flank wound immediately several other predators snapped at the same animal which limped away hissing and bleeding badly wounded once at the periphery the wounded animal retaliated by biting the tail of another creature again causing a serious wound a young juvenile about half the size of the others kept pushing forward trying to get at a bit of the carcass but the adults did not make room for it instead they snarled and snapped in fury the youngster was frequently obliged to hop back nimbly keeping its distance from the razorsharp fangs of the grownups harding saw no infants at all this was a society of vicious adults as she watched the big predators their heads and bodies smeared in blood she noticed the crisscross pattern of healed scars on their flanks and necks these were obviously quick intelligent animals yet they fought continually was that the way their social organization had evolved if so it was a rare event animals of many species fought for food territory and sex but these fights most often involved display and ritual aggression serious injury seldom occurred there were exceptions of course when male hippos fought to take over a harem they often severely wounded other males but in any case nothing matched what she saw now as she watched the wounded animal at the edge of the kill slunk forward and bit another adult which snarled and leapt at it slashing with its long toeclaw in a flash the injured predator was eviscerated coils of pale intestine slipping out through a wide gash the animal fell howling to the ground and immediately three adults turned away from the kill and jumped onto its newly fallen body and began to tear the animals flesh with rapacious intensity harding closed her eyes and turned away this was a different world and one she did not understand at all in a daze she headed back down the bill moving quietly carefully away from the kill noise the ford explorer glided quietly forward along the jungle path they were following a game trail on the ridge above the valley heading down toward the high hide in the valley below thorne drove he said to malcolm you were saying earlier that you knew why the dinosaurs became extinct well im pretty sure i do malcolm said the basic situation is simple enough he shifted in his seat dinosaurs arose in the triassic about two hundred million years ago they proliferated throughout the jurassic and the cretaceous periods that followed they were the dominant life form on this planet for about a hundred and fifty million years which is a very long time considering weve been here for only three million eddie said lets not put on airs malcolm said some puny apes have been here for three miilion years we havent recognizable human beings have only been on this planet for thirtyfive thousand years he said thats how long its been since our ancestors painted caves in france and spain drawing pictures of game to invoke success in the hunt thirtyfive thousand years in the history of the earth thats nothing at all weve just arrived okay and of course even thirtyfive thousand years ago we were already making species extinct cavemen killed so much game that animals became extinct on several continents there used to be lions and tigers in europe there used to be giraffes and rhinos in los angeles hell ten thousand years ago the ancestors of native americans hunted the woolly mammoth to extinction this is nothing new this human tendency ian well its a fact although your modern airheads think its all so brandnew ian you were talking about dinosaurs right dinosaurs anyway during a hundred and fifty million years on this planet dinosaurs were so successful that by the cretaceous there were twentyone major groups of them a few groups like the camarasaurs and fabrosaurs had died out but the overwhelming majority of dinosaur groups were still active throughout the cretaceous and then suddenly about sixtyfive million years ago every single group became extinct and only the birds remained so the question is what was that i thought you knew thorne said no i mean what was that sound did you hear something no thorne said stop the car malcolm said thorne stopped the car and clicked off the engine they rolled down the windows and felt the still midday heat there was almost no breeze they listened for a while thorne shrugged i dont hear anything what did you think you sssh malcolm said he cupped his hand to his ear and put his head out the window listening intently after a moment he came back in i could have sworn i heard an engine an engine you mean an internalcombustion engine right he pointed to the east it sounded like it was coming from over there they listened again and heard nothing thorne shook his head i cant imagine a gas engine here ian theres no gas to run one the radio clicked dr malcolm it was arby in the trailer yes arby who else is here on the island what do you mean turn on your monitor thorne flicked on the dashboard monitor they saw a view from one of the security cameras the view looked down into the narrow steep east valley they saw the slope of a hillside dark beneath the trees a tree branch blocked much of the frame but the view was still silent there was no sign of activity what did you see arby just watch through the leaves thorne saw a flash of khaki then another he realized it was a person halfwalking halfsliding down the steep jungle slope toward the floor below small compact frame short dark hair ill be damned malcolm said smiling you know who that is yes of course its sarah well we better go get her thorne reached for the radio pressed the button richard he said there was no answer richard are you reading there was no answer malcolm sighed great hes not answering probably decided to go for a walk pursuing his research thats what im afraid of thorne said eddie unhook the motorcycle and go see what levines doing now take a lindstradt with you well go pick up sarah trail levine followed the game trail moving deeper into the darkness of the jungle the parasaurs were somewhere up ahead making a lot of noise as they crashed through the ferns and palms on the jungle floor at least now he understood why they had formed into a single file there was no other practical way to move through the dense growth of the rain forest their vocalizations had never stopped but levine noticed they were taking on a different character more highpitched more excited he hurried forward pushing past wet palm fronds taller than he was following the beaten trail as he listened to the cries of the animals ahead he also began to notice a distinctive odor pungent and sweetsour he had the feeling the odor was growing stronger but up ahead something was happening there was no doubt about it the parasaur vocalizations were now clipped almost barking sounds he sensed in them an agitated quality but what could agitate an animal twelve feet high and thirty feet long his curiosity overwhelmed him levine began to run through the jungle shoving aside palms leaping over fallen trees in the foliage ahead he heard a hissing sound a sort of spattering and then one of the parasaurs gave a long low trumpeting cry eddie carr drove the motorcycle up to the high hide and stopped levine was gone he looked at the ground around the hide and saw many deep animal footprints in the ground the prints were large about two feet in diameter and they seemed to be going off into the jungle behind the hide he scanned the ground and saw fresh bootmarks as well they had an asolo tread he recognized them as levines in some places the bootmarks disrupted the edge of the animal footprints which meant that they had been made afterward the bootmarks also led into the forest eddie carr swore the last thing he wanted to do was to go into that jungle the very idea gave him the creeps but what choice was there he had to get levine back that guy he thought was getting to be a real problem eddie unshouldered the rifle and set it laterally across the handlebars of the motorcycle then he twisted the grips and silently the bike moved forward into darkness heart pounding with excitement levine pushed past the last of the big palms he stopped abruptly directly ahead of him the tall of a parasaur swung back and forth above his head the animals hindquarters were turned toward him and a thick stream of urine gushed from the posterior pubis spattering on the ground below levine jumped back avoiding the stream beyond the nearest animal he saw a clearing in the jungle trampled flat by countless animal feet the parasaurs had located themselves at various positions within this clearing and they were all urinating together so they were latrine animals he thought that was fascinating and totally unexpected many contemporary animals including rhinos and deer preferred to relieve themselves at particular spots and many times the behavior of herds was coordinated latrine behavior was generally considered to be a method of marking territory but whatever the reason no one had ever suspected that dinosaurs acted in this way as levine watched the parasaurs finished urinating and each moved a few feet to the side then they defecated again in unison each parasaur produced a large mound of strawcolored spoor this was accompanied by low trumpeting from each animal in the herd along with an enormous quantity of expelled flatus redolent of methane behind him a voice whispered very nice he turned and saw eddie carr sitting on the motorcycle he was waving his hand in front of his face dino farts he said better not light a match around here youll blow the place up ssssh levine hissed angrily shaking his head he turned back to the parasaurs this was no time to be interrupted by a vulgar young fool several of the animals bent their heads down and began to lick the puddles of urine no doubt they wanted to recover lost nutrients he thought perhaps salt or perhaps hormones or perhaps it was something seasonal or perhaps levine edged forward they knew so little about these creatures they didnt even know the most basic facts about their lives how they ate how they eliminated how they slept and bred a whole world of intricate interlocking behaviors had evolved in these longvanished animals understanding them now could be the work of a lifetime for dozens of scientists but that would probably never happen all he could hope to do was make a few conjectures a few simple deductions that skimmed the surface of the complexity of their lives the parasaurs trumpeted and headed deeper into the forest levine moved forward to follow them dr levine eddie said quietly get on the bike now levine ignored him but as the big animals departed he saw dozens of tiny green dinosaurs leap chattering out into the clearing he realized at once what they were procompsognathus triassicus small scavenger found by fraas in in bavaria levine stared fascinated of course he knew the animal well but only from reconstructions because there were no complete skeletons of procompsognathus anywhere in the world ostrom had done the most complete studies but he had to work with a skeleton that was badly crushed and fragmentary the tall neck and arms were all missing from the animals ostrom described yet here the procompsognathids were fully formed and active hopping around i ike so many chickens as he watched the compys began to eat the fresh dung and drink what was left of the urine levine frowned was that part of ordinary scavenger behavior levine wasnt sure he edged forward to look at them more closely dr levine eddie whispered it was interesting that the compys only ate fresh dung not the dried remnants that were everywhere in the clearing whatever nutrients they were obtaining from the dung it must only be present in fresh specimens that suggested a protein or hormone that would degrade over time probably he should obtain a fresh sample for analysis he reached into his shirt pocket and withdrew a plastic baggie he moved among the compys which seemed indifferent to his presence he crouched down by the nearest dung pile and reached slowly forward dr levine he glanced back annoyed and in that moment one of the compys leapt forward and bit his hand another jumped onto his shoulder and bit his car levine yelled and stood up the compys hopped onto the ground and scampered away damn it he said eddie drove up on the motorcycle thats enough he said get on the damn bike were getting out of here nest the red jeep wrangler came to a stop directly ahead the game trail they had been following continued through the foliage to a clearing beyond the game trail was wide and muddy trampled flat by large animals they could see large deep footprints in the mud from the clearing they heard a low honking noise like the sound of very large geese dodgson said okay give me the box king didnt answer baselton said what box without taking his eyes off the clearing dodgson said theres a black box on the seat beside you and a battery pack give them to me baselton grunted its heavy thats because of the cone magnets dodgson reached back took the box which was made of black anodized metal it was the size of a shoebox except it ended in a flaring cone underneath was mounted a pistol grip dodgson clipped a battery pack to his belt and plugged it into the box then he picked the box up by the pistol grip there was a knob at the back facing him and a graduated dial dodgson said batteries charged theyre charged king said okay dodgson said ill go first into the nest area ill adjust the box and get rid of the animals you two follow behind me and once the animals are gone you each take an egg from the nest then you leave and bring them back to the car ill come back last then we all drive off got it right baselton said okay king said what kind of dinosaurs are these i have no fucking idea dodgson said climbing out of the car and it doesnt make any difference just follow the procedure he closed the door softly the others got out quietly and they started forward down the wet trail their feet squished in the mud the sound from the clearing continued to dodgson it sounded like a lot of animals he pushed aside the last of the ferns and saw them it was a large nesting site with perhaps four or five low earthen mounds covered in grasses the mounds were about seven feet wide and three feet deep there were twenty beigecolored adults around the moundsa whole herd of dinosaurs surrounding the nesting site and the adults were big thirty feet long and ten feet high all honking and snorting oh my god baselton said staring dodgson shook his head theyre maiasaurs he whispered this is going to be a piece of cake maiasaurs had been named by paleontologist jack horner before horner scientists assumed that dinosaurs abandoned their eggs as most reptiles did those assumptions fitted the old picture of dinosaurs as coldblooded reptilian creatures like reptiles they were thought to be solitary murals on museum walls rarely showed more than one example from each species a brontosaurus here a stegosaurus or a triceratops there wading through the swamps but horners excavations in the badlands of montana provided clear unambiguous evidence that at least one species of hadrosaurs had engaged in complex nesting and parenting behavior horner incorporated that behavior in the name he gave these creatures maiasaur meant goodmother lizard watching them now dodgson could see the maiasaurs were indeed attentive parents the big adults circling the nests moving carefully to step outside the shallow earthen mounds the beige maiasaurs were duckbilled dinosaurs they had large heads that ended in a broad flattened snout rather like the bill of a duck they were taking mouthfuls of grass and dropping it on the eggs in the mounds this was he knew a way to regulate the temperature of the eggs if the huge animals sat on the eggs they would crush them so instead they put a layer of grass over the eggs which trapped heat and kept the eggs at a more constant temperature the animals worked steadily theyre huge baselton said theyre nothing but oversized cows dodgson said although the maiasaurs were large they were planteaters and they had the docile slightly stupid manner of cows ready here we go he lifted the box like a gun and stepped forward into view dodgson expected a big reaction when the maiasaurs saw him but there was none at all they hardly seemed to notice him one or two adults looked over stared with dumb eyes and then looked away the animals continued to drop grass on the eggs which were pale white oval and nearly two feet long each was about twice the size of an ostrich egg about the size of a small beach ball no animals had hatched yet king and baselton stepped out and stood beside him in the clearing still the maiasaurs ignored them amazing baselton said fine for us dodgson said and he turned on the box a continuous highpitched shriek filled the clearing the maiasaurs immediately turned toward the sound honking and lifting their heads they seemed agitated confused dodgson twisted the dial and the shriek became higher earsplitting the maiasaurs bobbed their heads and moved away from the painful sound they clustered at the far end of the clearing several of the animals urinated in alarm a few of them moved away into the folliage abandoning the nest they were agitated but they stayed away go now dodgson said king stepped into the nearest nest and grunted as he picked up an egg his arms hardly reached around the huge oval the maiasaurs honked at him but none of the adults moved forward then baselton went into the nest took an egg and followed king back to the car dodgson walked backward holding the box on the adults at the edge of the clearing he turned the sound off at once the maiasaurs came back honking loudly and repeatedly but as they returned to the nests it seemed as if the adults forgot what had just happened within a few moments they ceased honking and went back to dropping grass over the eggs they ignored dodgson as he left and headed back along the game trail stupid animals dodgson thought as he went to the car baselton and king were setting the eggs into big styrofoam containers in the back and fitting the foam packing around them carefully both men were grinning like kids that was amazing great fantastic whatd i tell you dodgsoii said nothing to it he glanced at his watch at this rate well finish in less than four hours he climbed behind the steering wheel and turned on the engine baselton got into the back seat king got in the passenger seat and took out the map next dodgson said the high hide i tell you its fine levine said irritably he was sweating in the stifling heat beneath the aluminum roof of the high hide look it didnt even break the skin he held out his hand there was a red semicircle where the compy had pressed its teeth into the skin but that was all beside him eddie said yeah well your ear is bleeding a little i dont feel anything it cant be bad no its not bad eddie said opening the firstaid kit but i better clean it up i prefer levine said to get on with my observations the dinosaurs were barely a quartermile away from him and he could see them well in the still midday air he could hear them breathe he could hear them breathe or at least he could if this young man would leave him alone look levine said i know what im doing here you came in at the end of a very interesting and successful experiment i actually called the dinosaurs to me by imitating their cry you did eddie said yes i did that was what led them into the forest in the first place so i hardly think that i need your assistance the thing is eddie said you got some of that dino shit on your ear and theres a couple of little punctures ill just clean it off for you he soaked a gauze pad with disinfectant may sting a little i dont care i have other ow stop moving eddie said itll only take a second its absolutely unnecessary if you just stand still itll be done there he took the gauze away levine saw brown and a faint streak of red just as he suspected the injury was trivial he reached up and touched his ear it didnt hurt at all levine squinted out at the plain as eddie packed up the firstaid case jeez its hot up here eddie said yes levine said shrugging sarah harding arrived and i think they took her back to the trailer you want to go back now i cant imagine why levine said i just thought you might want to say hello or something eddie said my work is here levine said he turned away raised his binoculars to his eyes so eddie said you dont want to come back wouldnt dream of it levine said staring through binoculars not in a million years not in sixtyfive million years trailer kelly curtis listened to the sound of the shower she couldnt believe it she stared at the muddy clothes tossed casually on the bed shorts and a khaki shortsleeve shirt sarah hardings actual clothes she couldnt help it kelly reached out and touched them she noticed how the fabric was worn and frayed buttons sewn back on they didnt match and there were some reddish streaks near the pocket that she thought must be old bloodstains she reached down and touched the fabric kelly sarah was calling to her from the shower she remembered my name yes kelly said her voice betraying her nervousness is there any shampoo ill look dr harding kelly said opening drawers hastily the men had all gone into the next compartment leaving her alone with sarah while she washed kelly searched desperately opening the drawers slamming them shut again listen sarah called its okay if you cant find any im looking is there any dishwashing liquid kelly paused there was a green plastic bottle by the sink yes dr harding but give it to me its all the same stuff i dont care the hand reached out past the shower curtain kelly handed it to her and my name is sarah okay dr harding sarah okay sarah sarah harding was a regular person very informal and normal entranced kelly sat on the seat in the kitchen and waited swinging her feet in case dr harding sarah needed anything else she listened to sarah humming im gonna wash that man right out of my hair after a few moments the shower turned off and her hand reached out and took the towel on the hook and then she came out wrapped in the towel sarah ran her fingers through her short hair which seemed to be all the attention she gave to her appearance that feels better boy this is a plush field trailer doc really did a great job yes she said its nice she smiled at kelly how old are you kelly thirteen what is that eighth grade seventh seventh grade sarah said thoughtfully kelly said dr malcolm left some clothes for you he said he thought theyd fit she pointed to a clean pair of shorts and a tee shirt whose are these i think theyre eddies sarah held them up might work she took them around the corner into the sleeping area and started getting dressed she said what are you going to do when you grow up i dont know kelly said thats a very good answer it is kellys mother was always pushing her to get a parttime job to decide what she wanted to do with her life yes sarah said nobody smart knows what they want to do until they get into their twenties or thirties oh what do you like to study actually uh i like math she said in a sort of guilty voice sarah must have heard her tone because she said whats wrong with math well girls arent good at it i mean you know no i dont know sarahs voice was flat kelly felt panic she had been experiencing this warm feeling with sarah harding but now she sensed it was dissolving away as if she had given a wrong answer to a disapproving teacher she decided not to say anything else she waited in silence after a moment sarah came out again wearing eddies baggy clothes she sat down and started putting on a pair of boots she moved in a very normal matteroffact way what did you mean girls arent good at mathematics well thats what everybody says everybody like who my teachers sarah sighed great she said shaking her head your teachers and the other kids call me a brainer stuff like that you know kelly just blurted it out she couldnt believe that she was saying all this to sarah harding whom she hardly knew at all except from articles and pictures but here she was telling her all this personal stuff all these things that upset her sarah just smiled cheerfully well if they say that you must be pretty good at math huh i guess she smiled thats wonderful kelly but the thing is boys dont like girls who are too smart sarahs eyebrows went up is that so well thats what everybody says like who like my mom uhhuh and she probably knows what shes talking about i dont know kelly admitted my mom only dates jerks actually so she could be wrong sarah asked glancing up at kelly as she tied her laces i guess well in my experience some men like smart women and some dont its like everything else in the world she stood up you know about george schaller sure he studied pandas right pandas and before that snow leopards and lions and gorillas hes the most important animal researcher in the twentieth centuryand you know how he works kelly shook her head before he goes into the field george reads everything thats ever been written about the animal hes going to study popular books newspaper accounts scientific papers everything then he goes out and observes the animal for himself and you know what he usually finds she shook her head not trusting herself to speak that nearly everything thats been written or said is wrong like the gorilla george studied mountain gorillas ten years before dian fossey ever thought of it and he found that what was believed about gorillas was exaggerated or misunderstood or just plain fantasy like the idea that you couldnt take women on gorilla expeditions because the gorillas would rape them wrong everythingjust wrong sarah finished tying her boots and stood so kelly even at your young age theres something you might as well learn now all your life people will tell you things and most of the time probably ninetyfive percent of the time what theyll tell you will be wrong kelly said nothing she felt oddly disheartened to hear this its a fact of life sarah said human beings are just stuffed full of misinformation so its hard to know who to believe i know how you feel you do sure my mom used to tell me id never amount to anything she smiled so did some of my professors really it didnt seem possible oh yes sarah said as a matter of fact from the other section of the trailer they heard malcolm say no no those idiots they could ruin everything sarah immediately turned and went into the other section kelly jumped off the seat and hurried after her the men were all clustered around the monitor everyone was talking at once and they seemed to be upset this is terrible malcolm was saying terrible thorne said is that a jeep they had a red jeep harding said coming up to look then its dodgson malcolm said damn whats he doing here i can guess kelly pushed through to get a look on the screen she saw foliage and intermittent flashes of a redandblack vehicle where are they now malcolm said to arby i think theyre in the east valley arby said near where we found dr levine the radio clicked levines voice said do you mean there are now other people on the island yes richard well you better go stop them before they mess everything up i know do you want to come back not without a compelling reason inform me if one arises and his radio clicked off harding stared at the screen watching the jeep thats them all right she said thats your friend dodgson hes not my friend malcolm said he got up wincing in pain from his leg lets go he said we have to stop these bastards theres no time to waste nest the red jeep wrangler rolled softly to a stop directly ahead was a wall of dense foliage but through it they could see sunlight from the clearing beyond dodgson sat quietly in the car listening king turned to him i i about to speak but dodgson held up his hand gesturing to him to be silent then he heard it clearly a low rumbling growl almost a purr it was coming from beyond the foliage ahead it sounded like the biggest jungle cat he had ever heard and intermittently he felt a slight vibration hardly anything but enough to make the car keys clink against the steering column as he felt that vibration it slowly dawned on him its walking something very big walking beside him king was staring forward in astonishment his mouth hung open dodgson glanced back at baselton the professor was gripping the seat with white fingers as he listened to the sound a shadow moved across the ferns directly ahead judging the shadow the animal was twenty feet high and forty feet long it walked on its hind legs and had a large body a short neck a very big head a tyrannosaur dodgson hesitated staring at the shadow his heart was pounding in his chest he considered going on to the next nest but he was confident that the box would work here too he said lets get this over with give me the box baselton handed him the box just as he had done before dodgson said charged batteries arc charged king said okay he said here we go exactly the same as before ill go first you two follow and bring the eggs back to the car ready ready baselton said king did not answer he was still staring at the shadow what kind of a dinosaur is that thats a tyrannosaurus oh jesus king said a tyrannosaurus baselton said it doesnt matter what it is dodgson said irritably just follow the plan like before everybody ready just a minute baselton said king said what if it doesnt work we already know it works dodgson said theres a rather curious fact about tyrannosaurs that was recently reported baselton said a paleontologist named roxton did a study of the tyrannosaur braincase and concluded that they have a brain not much different from a frogs although of course much bigger the implication was their nervous systems were adapted to motion only they can t see you if you stand still stationary objects become invisible to them are you sure about that king said baselton said that was the report and it makes perfect sense one cant forget that dinosaurs for all their intimidating size were actually rather primitive intellects its quite logical that a tyrannosaur would have the mental equipment of a frog i dont see why were rushing into this king said nervously he stared forward its much bigger than the other ones so what dodgson said you heard what george said its just a big frog lets get it done get out of the fucking car and dont slam the doors george baselton had felt quite good and authoritative recalling that obscure article from the journals he had been in his accustomed role dispensing information to people who lacked it now that he approached the nest he was astonished to notice that his knees had begun to tremble his legs felt like rubber he had always thought that was a figure of speech he was alarmed to realize it could be literally true he bit his lip and forced himself under control he was not he told himself going to show fear he was the master of this situation dodgson was already moving ahead holding the black box like a gun in his hand baselton glanced over at king who was deathly pale and sweating he looked on the verge of collapse he moved forward slowly baselton walked alongside him making sure he was all right up ahead dodgson gave a final glance back waved to baselton and king to catch up he glared at both of them and then he stepped through the foliage into the clearing baselton saw the tyrannosaur no there were two they stood on both sides of a mud mound two adults twenty feet high on their hind legs powerful dark red with big vicious jaws like the maiasaurs the animals stared at dodgson for a moment a dumb stare as if amazed to see an intruder and then the tyrannosatirs roared in fury an incredible bellowing airshaking roar dodgson lifted the box pointed it at the animals immediately a continuous highpitched shriek filled the clearing the tyrannosaurs roared in response and lowered their heads extending their necks forward snapping their jaws preparing to attack they were huge and they were unaffected by the sound they started to come around the mound toward dodgson the earth shook as they moved oh fuck kin said but dodgson stayed cool he twisted the dial baselton clapped his hands over his cars the shriek became higher louder earsplitting incredibly painful the response was immediate the tyrannosaurs stepped back as if they had received a physical blow they ducked their heads they blinked their eyes rapidly the sound seemed to vibrate in the air they roared again but weakly now without conviction a terrible screaming came from inside the mud nest dodgson moved forward pointing the box in the air directly at the animals the tyrannosaurs backed away looking into the nest then to dodgson they swung their heads back and forth rapidly as if trying to clear their ears dodgson calmly adjusted the dial the sound went higher it was now excruciating dodgson began to climb the mud mound of the nest baselton and king scrambled up following him baselton found himself looking down into a nest with four mottled white eggs and two young babies that looked for all the world like scrawny oversized turkeys anyway some kind of gigantic baby birds the two tyrannosaurs were at the far end of the clearing held away by the sound like the maiasaurs they urinated in agitation they stomped their feet but they did not come closer over the earsplitting shriek of the box dodgson shouted get the eggs in a daze king stumbled down into the nest grabbing the nearest egg he fumbled it in his shaking hands the egg flew into the air he caught it again and lurched back he stepped on the leg of one of the babies which screamed in fear and pain at this the parents tried to come forward again drawn by the infants cries king hastily clambered out of the nest ducked away through the foliage baselton watched him go george dodgson shouted still aiming the box at the tyrannosaurs get the other egg baselton turned to look at the adult tyrannosaurs seeing their agitation and their anger watching their laws snap open and closed and he had the sudden feeling that sound or no sound these animals would not allow anyone to enter the nest again king had been lucky but baselton would not be lucky he could feel it and george now baselton said i cant you dumb fuck holding the gun high dodgson began to climb down into the nest himself but as he started he twisted his body and the battery plug pulled out of the box the sound abruptly died in the clearing there was silence baselton moaned the tyrannosaurs shook their heads a final time and roared baselton saw dodgson go rigidly still his body frozen baselton also stood still somehow he forced his body to stay where he was he forced his knees to stop trembling he held his breath and he waited on the far side of the clearing the tyrannosaurs began to move toward him what are they doing arby cried in the trailer he was so close to the monitor his nose almost touched the screen are they crazy theyre just standing there beside him kelly said nothing she watched the screen silently want to be out there now kel arby said shut up kelly said no theyre not crazy malcolm said over the radio as he stared at the dashboard monitor the explorer lurched down the trail heading toward the eastern sector of the island thorne was driving sarah and malcolm were in the back seat sarah said he should be trying to put his sound machine together again are they really just going to stand there yes malcolm said why they are misinformed malcolm said dodgson dodgson watched the lead tyrannosaur come toward him for such big animals they were cautious only one of the two parents approached them and although it paused to roar fiercely every few paces it seemed oddly tentative as if it was perplexed by the fact that the men were staying there or perhaps it could not see them perhaps he and baselton had vanished from their view the other parent hung back remaining toward the other side of the nest bobbing and ducking its head agitated agitated but not attacking of course the roars of the approaching dinosaur were terrifying bloodchilling dodgson didnt dare glance at baselton just a few yards away baselton was probably peeing in his pants right now just so he didnt turn and run dodgson thought if he ran he was a dead man if he stayed perfectly still everything would be all right standing stiffly keeping his body rigid dodgson held the anodized box at waist level in his left hand near his belt buckle with his right hand he slowly ever so slowly pulled up the disconnected power cord in a few moments he would feel the end plug in his hands and then he would slip it back into the box meanwhile he never took his eyes off the approaching tyrannosaur he felt the ground shake beneath his feet he heard the cries of the infant that king had stepped on those cries seemed to bother the parents to arouse them no matter just a few seconds more and he would have the plug back in the power pack and then the tyrannosaur was very close now dodgson could smell the rotten odor of the carnivore the animal roared and he felt hot breath it was standing right by baselton dodgson turned his head fractionally to watch baselton stood entirely still the tyrannosaur came close and lowered his big head he snorted at baselton he raised his head again as if perplexed he really cant see him dodgson thought the tyrannosaur bellowed a ferocious sound somehow baselton stayed unmoving the tyrannosaur bent over bringing his huge head down again the jaws opened and closed baselton stared straight forward not blinking with huge flaring nostrils the tyrannosaur smelled him a long snuffling inhalation that fluttered baseltons trouser legs then the tyrannosaur nudged baselton tentatively with his snout and in that moment dodgson realized that the animal could see him after all and then the tyrannosaur swung his head laterally striking baselton in the side and easily knocking him to the earth baselton yelled as the tyrannosaurs big foot came down pinning him to the ground baselton raised his arms and shouted you son of a bitch just as the head came down jaws wide and closed on him the movement was gentle almost delicate but in the next instant the head snapped high tearing the body and dodgson heard a scream and saw something small and floppy hanging from the jaws and realized it was baseltons arm baseltons hand swung freely the metal band of his wristwatch glinting beneath the tyrannosaurs huge eye baselton was screaming a continuous undifferentiated sound and hearing it dodgson broke into a dizzying sweat then he turned and ran back toward the car back toward safety back toward anything he ran kell and arb turned away from the monitor at the same moment kelly felt sick she couldnt watch but through the radio they could till hear the tinny screams of the man lying on his back while the tyrannosaur tore him apart turn it off kelly said a moment later the sound stopped kelly sighed let her shoulders drop thank you she said i didnt do anything arby said she glanced back at the screen and quickly looked away again the tyrannosaur was tearing at something red she shivered it was silent in the trailer kelly heard the tick of electronic counters and the thumping of the water pumps under the floor outside there was the faint sound of wind rustling the tall grass kelly suddenly felt very alone very isolated on this island arby she said what are we going to do arby didnt answer her he bolted for the bathroom i knew it malcolm said staring at the dashboard monitor i knew that would happen they tried to steal eggs now look the tyrannosaurs are leaving both of them he pushed the radio transmitter arby kelly are you there we cant talk kelly said the explorer continued down the hillside toward the area of the tyrannosaur nest thorne gripped the wheel grimly as he drove what a damn mess kelly are you listening we cant see whats happening down there the tyrannosaurs have left the nest kelly whats happening dodgson sprinted for the jeep the battery pack fell off his belt as he ran but he didnt care up ahead in the jeep he saw king waiting tense and pale dodgson got behind the wheel started the engine the tyrannosaurs roared wheres baselton king asked didnt make it dodgson said what do you mean i mean he fucking didnt make it dodgson yelled and slammed the car into gear the jeep took off bouncing up the hill they heard the tyrannosaurs bellowing behind them king was holding the egg looking back down the road maybe we should get rid of this he said dont you fucking dare dodgson said king was rolling down the window maybe he just wants the egg back no dodgson said no he reached across the passenger seat struggling with king as he drove the trail was narrow with deep ruts the jeep lurched forward suddenly one of the tyrannosaurs burst from the trees in the road ahead the animal stood there snarling blocking the road oh christ dodgson said slamming on the brakes the car slid sickeningly in the muddy track came to a stop the tyrannosaur lumbered toward them bellowing turn around king screamed turn around but dodgson didnt turn around he slammed the car into reverse and started backing down the trail he was driving fast and the road was narrow youre crazy king said youre going to kill us dodgson swung his arm smacked king with his hand shut the flick up he shouted it took all his attention to maneuver the car back down the winding trail even going as fast as he could he was sure the tyrannosaur would be faster it wasnt going to work they were in a fucking jeep with a fucking cloth top and they were going to get killed and no king shouted behind them dodgson saw the second tyrannosaur charging up the road toward them he looked forward saw the first tyrannosaur bearing down on them they were trapped he twisted the wheel in panic and the car ran off the road crashing backward into dense underbrush and surrounding trees and he felt a jolting impact then the rear of the car dropped sickeningly and he realized the back wheels were hanging over the edge of a hill he gunned the engine frantically but the wheels just spun in the air it was hopeless and slowly the car sank backward deeper into foliage so dense he could not see through it but they were over the edge beside him king was sobbing he heard the tyrannosaurs roaring very near now dodgson flung open the car door and jumped out into space he lunged through the foliage fell hit a tree trunk and tumbled down a steep jungle hill somewhere along the way he felt a sharp pain in his forehead and saw stars for the brief moment before blackness enveloped him and he lost consciousness decision they sat in the explorer on top of the ridge overlooking the junglecovered east valley the windows were down they listened to the bellowing of the tyrannosaurs as the huge animals crashed through the underbrush they both left the nest thorne said yeah those guys must have taken something malcolm sighed they were silent a while listening they heard a soft buzzing and then eddie pulled up alongside them in the motorcycle i thought you might need help are you going to go down malcolm shook his head no absolutely not its too dangerous we dont know where they are sarah harding said why did dodgson just stand there like that thats not the way to act around predators you get caught around lions you make a lot of noise wave your hands throw things at them try to scare them off you dont just stand there he probably read the wrong research paper malcolm said shaking his head theres been a theory going around that tyrannosaurs can only see movement a guy named roxton made casts of rex braincases and concluded that tyrannosaurs had the brain of a frog the radio clicked levine said roxton is an idiot he doesnt know enough anatomy to have sex with his wife his paper was a joke what paper thorne said the radio clicked again roxton levine said believed that tyrannosaurs had a visual system like an amphibian like a frog a frog sees motion but doesnt see stillness but it is quite impossible that a predator such as a tyrannosaur would have a visual system that worked that way quite impossible because the most common defense of prey animals is to freeze a deer or something like that it senses danger and it freezes a predator has to be able to see them anyway and of course a tyrannosaur could over the radio levine snorted with disgust its just like the other idiotic theory put forth by grant a few years back that a tyrannosaur could be confused by a driving rainstorm because it was not adapted to wet climates thats equally absurd the cretaceous wasnt particularly dry and in any case tyrannosaurs are north american animals theyve only been found in the us or canada tyrannosaurs lived on the shores of the great inland sea east of the rocky mountains there are lots of thunderstorms on mountain slopes im quite sure tyrannosaurs saw plenty of rain and they evolved to deal with it so is there any reason why a tyrannosaur might not attack somebody malcolm said yes of course the most obvious one levine said which is if it wasnt hungry if it had just eaten another animal anything larger than a goat would take care of its hunger for hours to come no no the tyrannosaur sees fine moving or still they listened to the roaring coming up from the valley below they saw thrashing in the underbrush about half a mile away to the north more bellowing the two rexes seemed to be answering each other sarah harding said what are we carrying thorne said three lindstradts fully loaded okay she said lets go the radio crackled im not there levine said over the radio but id certainly advise waiting the hell with waiting malcolm said sarahs right lets go down there and see how bad it is your funeral levine said arby came back to the monitor wiping his chin he still looked a little green what are they doing now dr malcolm and the others are going to the nest are you kidding he said alarmed dont worry kelly said sarah can handle it you hope arby said nest just beyond the clearing they parked the explorer eddie pulled up in the motorcycle and leaned it against the trunk of a tree and waited while the others climbed out of the explorer sarah harding smelled the familiar sour odor of rotting flesh and excrement that always marked a carnivore nesting site in the afternoon heat it was faintly nauseating flies buzzed in the still air harding took one of the rifles slung it over her shoulder she looked at the three men they were all standing very still tense not moving malcolms face was pale particularly around the lips it reminded her of the time that coffmann her old professor had visited her in africa coffmann was one of those harddrinking hemingway types with lots of affairs at home and lots of tales of his adventures with the orangs in sumatra the ringtailed lemurs in madagascar so she took him with her to a kill site in the savannah and he promptly passed out he weighed more than two hundred pounds and she had to drag him out by the collar while the lions circled and snarled at her it had been a good lesson for her now she leaned close to the three men and whispered if youve got any qualms about this dont go just wait here i dont want to worry about you i can do this myself she started off are you sure yes now keep quiet she moved directly toward the clearing malcolm and the others hurried to catch up with her she pushed aside the palm fronds and stepped out into the open the tyrannosaurs were gone and the mud cone was deserted over to the right she saw a shoe with a bit of torn flesh sticking out above the ragged sock that was all there was left of baselton from within the nest she heard a plaintive highpitched squeal harding climbed up the mud bank with malcolm struggling to follow she saw two infant tyrannosaurs there mewling nearby were three large eggs they saw heavy footprints all around in the mud they took one of the eggs malcolm said damn you didnt want anything to disrupt your little ecosystem malcolm smiled crookedly yeah i was hoping too bad she said and moved quickly around the edge of the pit she bent over looking at the baby tyrannosaurs one of the babies was cowering its downy neck pulled into its body but the second one behaved very differently it did not move as they approached but remained lying sprawled on its side breathing shallowly eyes glazed this ones been hurt she said levine was standing in the high hide he pressed the headset to his ear and spoke into the microphone near his cheek i need a description he said thorne said theres two of them roughly two feet long weighing maybe forty pounds about the size of small cassowary birds large eyes short snouts palebrown color and theres a ring of down around the necks can they stand uhif they can not very well theyre kind of flopping around squeaking a lot then theyre infants levine said nodding probably only a few days old never been out of the nest id be very careful why is that with offspring that young levine said the parents wont leave them for long harding moved closer to the injured infant still mewling the baby tried to crawl toward her dragging its body awkwardly one leg was bent at an odd angle i think the left legs hurt eddie came closer standing alongside her to see is it broken yeah probably but hey eddie said the baby lunge d forward and clamped its jaws around the ankle of his boot he pulled his foot away dragging the baby which held its grip tightly hey let go eddie lifted his leg up shook it back and forth but the baby refused to let go he pulled for a moment longer then stopped now the baby just lay there on the ground breathing shallowly jaws still locked around eddies boot jeez eddie said aggressive little guy isnt he sarah said right from birth eddie looked down at the tiny razorsharp jaws they hadnt penetrated the leather the baby held on firmly with the butt of his rifle he poked the infants head a couple of times it had no effect at all the baby lay on the ground breathing shallowly its big eyes blinked slowly as they stared up at eddie but it did not release its grip they heard the distant roars of the parents somewhere to the north lets get out of here malcolm said weve seen what we came here to see weve got to find where dodgson went thorne said i think i saw a track up the trail they might have gone off there we better have a look they all started back to the car wait a minute eddie said looking down at his foot what am i going to do about the baby shoot it malcolm said over his shoulder you mean kill it sarah said its got a broken leg eddie its going to die anyway yeah but thorne called were going back up the trail eddie and if we dont find dodgson well take the ridge road going toward the laboratory then down to the trailer again okay doc im right behind you eddie lifted his rifle turned it in his hands do it now sarah said climbing into the explorer because you dont want to be here when momma and poppa get back gamblers ruin driving up the trail malcolm stared at the dashboard monitor as the image flicked from one camera view to another he was looking for dodgson and the rest of his party over the radio levine said how bad was it they took one egg malcolm said and we had to shoot one of the babies so a loss of two out of a total hatching brood of what six thats right frankly id say its a minor matter levine said as long as you stop those people from doing anything more were looking for them now malcolm said morosely harding said it was bound to happen ian you know you cant expect to observe the animals without changing anything its a scientific impossibility of course it is malcolm said thats the greatest single scientific discovery of the twentieth century you cant study anything without changing it since galileo scientists had adopted the view that they were objective observers of the natural world that was implicit in every aspect of their behavior even the way they wrote scientific papers saying things like it was observed as if nobody had observed it for three hundred years that impersonal quality was the hallmark of science science was objective and the observer had no influence on the results he or she described this objectivity made science different from the humanities or from religionfields where the observers point of view was integral where the observer was inextricably mixed up in the results observed but in the twentieth century that difference had vanished scientific objectivity was gone even at the most fundamental levels physicists now knew you couldnt even measure a single subatomic particle without affecting it totally if you stuck your instruments in to measure a particles position you changed its velocity if you measured its velocity you changed its position that basic truth became the heisenberg uncertainty principle that whatever you studied you also changed in the end it became clear that all scientists were participants in a participatory universe which did not allow anyone to be a mere observer i know objectivity is impossible malcolm said impatiently im not concerned about that then what are you concerned about im concerned about the gamblers ruin malcolm said staring at the monitor gamblers ruin was a notorious and muchdebated statistical phenomenon that had major consequences both for evolution and for everyday life lets say youre a gambler he said and youre playing a cointoss game every time the coin comes up heads you win a dollar every time it comes up tails you lose a dollar okay what happens over time harding shrugged the chances of getting either heads or tails is even so maybe you win maybe you lose but in the end youll come out at zero unfortunately you dont malcolm said if you gamble long enough youll always lose the gambler is always ruined thats why casinos stay in business but the question is what happens over time what happens in the period before the gambler is finally ruined okay she said what happens if you chart the gamblers fortunes over time what you find is the gambler wins for a period or loses for a period in other words everything in the world goes in streaks its a real phenomenon and you see it everywhere in weather in river flooding in baseball in heart rhythms in stock markets once things go bad they tend to stay bad like the old folk saying that bad things come in threes complexity theory tells us the folk wisdom is right bad things cluster things go to hell together thats the real world so what are you saying that things are going to hell now they could be thanks to dodgson malcolm said frowning at the monitor what happened to those bastards anyway king there was a buzzing like the sound of a distant bee howard king was dimly aware of it as he came slowly back to consciousness he opened his eyes and saw the windshield of a car and the branches of trees beyond the buzzing was louder king didnt know where he was he couldnt remember how he got here what had happened he felt pain in his shoulders and at his hips his forehead throbbed he tried to remember but the pain distracted him prevented him from thinking clearly the last thing he remembered was the tyrannosaur in front of him on the road that was the last thing then dodgson had looked back and king turned his head and cried out as sudden sharp pain ran up his neck to his skull the pain made him gasp took his breath away he closed his eyes wincing then he slowly opened them again dodgson was not in the car the drivers door hung wide open a dappled shadow across the door panel the keys were still in the ignition dodgson was gone there was a streak of blood across the top of the steering wheel the black box was on the floor by the gearshift the open drivers door creaked a little moved a little in the distance king heard the buzzing again like a giant bee it was a mechanical sound he now realized something mechanical it made him think of the boat how long would the boat wait at the river what time was it anyway he looked at his watch the crystal was smashed the hands fixed at he heard the buzzing again it was coming closer with an effort king pushed himself away from the seat toward the dashboard streaks of electric pain shot up his spine but quickly subsided he took a deep breath im all right he thought at least im still here king looked at the open drivers door in the sunlight the sun was still high it must still be sometime in the afternoon when was the boat leaving four oclock five oclock he couldnt remember any more but he was certain that those spanish fishermen wouldnt hang around once it started to get dark theyd leave the island and howard king wanted to be on the boat when they did it was the only thing he wanted in the world wincing he raised himself up and painfully slid over to the drivers seat he settled himself in took a deep breath and then leaned over and looked out the open door the car was hanging over empty space supported by trees he saw a steep jungle hillside falling away beneath him it was dark beneath the canopy of trees he felt dizzy just looking down the ground must be twenty or thirty feet below him he saw scattered green ferns and a few dark boulders he twisted his body to look more and then he saw him dodgson lay on his back head downward on the slope of the hill his body was crumpled arms and legs thrown out in awkward positions he was not moving king couldnt see him very well in the dense foliage on the hillside but dodgson looked dead the buzzing was suddenly very loud building rapidly and king looked forward and saw through the foliage that blocked the windshield a car driving by not ten yards away a car and then the car was gone from the sound of it he thought it was an electric car so it must be malcolm howard king was somehow encouraged by the thought that other people were on this island he felt new strength despite the pain in his body he reached forward and turned the key in the ignition the engine rumbled he put the car in gear and gently stepped on the accelerator the rear wheels spun he engaged the frontwheel drive at once the jeep rumbled forward lurching through the branches a moment later he was out on the road he remembered this road now to the right it led down to the tyrannosaurus nest malcolms car had gone to the left king turned left and headed up the road he was trying to remember how to get back to the river back to the boat he vaguely recalled that there was a yfork in the road at the top of the hill he would take that fork he decided drive down the hill and get the hell off this island that was his only goal to get off this island before it was too late bad news the explorer came to the top of the hill and thorne drove onto the ridge road the road curved back and forth cut into the rock face of the cliff in many places the dropoff was precipitous but they had views over the entire island eventually they came to a place where they could look over the valley they could see the high hide off to the left and closer by the clearing with the two trailers off to the right was the laboratory complex and the worker complex beyond i dont see dodgson anywhere malcolm said unhappily where could he have gone thorne pushed the radio button arby yes doc do you see them no but he hesitated what dont you want to come back here now its pretty amazing what is thorne said eddie arby said he just got back and he brought the baby with him malcolm leaned forward he did what fifth configuration at the edge of chaos unexpected outcomes occur the risk to survival is severe ian malcolm baby in the trailer they were clustered around the table where the baby tyrannosaurus rex now lay unconscious on a stainlesssteel pan his large eyes closed his snout pushed into the clear plastic oval of an oxygen mask the mask almost fitted the babys blunt snout the oxygen hissed softly i couldnt just leave him eddie said and i figured we can fix his leg but eddie malcolm said shaking his head so i shot him full of morphine from the firstaid kit and brought him back you see the oxygen mask almost fits him eddie malcolm said this was the wrong thing to do why hes okay we just fix him and take him back but youre interfering with the system malcolm said the radio clicked this is extremely unwise levine said over the radio extremely thank you richard thorne said i am entirely opposed to bringing any animal back to the trailer too late to worry about that now sarah harding said she had moved forward alongside the baby and began strapping cardiac leads to the animals chest they heard the thump of the heartbeat it was very fast over a hundred and fifty beats a minute how much morphine did you give him gee eddie said i justyou know the whole syringe what is that ten ccs i think maybe twenty malcolm looked at harding how long before it wears off i have no idea she said ive sedated lions and jackals in the field when i tagged them with those animals theres a rough correlation between dose and body weight but with young animals its unpredictable maybe a few minutes maybe a few hours and i dont know a thing about baby tyrannosaurs basically its a function of metabolism and this one seems to be rapid birdlike the hearts pumping very fast all i can say is lets get him out of here as quickly as possible harding picked up the small ultrasound transducer and held it to the babys leg she looked over her shoulder at the monitor kelly and arby were blocking the view please give us a little room here she said and they moved away we dont have much time please as they moved away sarah saw the greenandwhite outlines of the leg and its bones surprisingly like a large bird she thought a vulture or a stork she moved the transducer okaytheres the metatarsalsand theres the tibia and fibula the two bones of the lower leg arby said why are the bones different shades like that the legs had some dense white sections within palergreen outlines because its an infant harding said his legs are still mostly cartilage with very little calcified bone id guess this baby probably cant walk yet at least not very well there look at the patellayou can see the blood supply to the joint capsule how come you know all this anatomy kelly said i have to i spend a lot of time looking through the seat of predators she said examining pieces of bones that are left behind and figuring out which animals have been eaten to do that you have to know comparative anatomy very well she moved the transducer along the babys leg and my father was a vet malcolm looked up sharply your father was a vet yes at the san diego zoo he was a bird specialist but i dont seecan you magnify this arby flicked a switch the image doubled in size ah okay all right there it is you see it no its midfibula see it a thin black line thats a fracture just above the epiphysis that little black line there arby said that little black line means death for this infant sarah said the fibula wont heal straight so the ankle joint cant pivot when he stands on his hind feet the baby wont be able to run and probably cant even walk itll be crippled and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old eddie said but we can set it okay sarah said what were you going to use for a cast diesterase eddie said i brought a kilo of it in hundredcc tubes i packed lots for glue the stuffs polymer resin it solidifies hard as steel great harding said thatll kill him too it will hes growing eddie in a few weeks hell be much larger we need something thats rigid but biodegradeable she said something that will wear off or break off in three to five weeks when his legs healed what have you got eddie frowned i dont know well we havent got much time harding said eddie said doc this is like one of your famous test questions how to make a dinosaur cast with only qtips and superglue i know thorne said the irony of the situation was not lost on him he had given problems such as these to his engineering students for three decades now he was faced with one himself eddie said maybe we could degrade the resin mix it with something like table sugar thorne shook his head hydroxy groups in the sucrose will make the resin friable itll harden okay but itll shatter like glass as soon as the animal moves what if we mix it with cloth thats been soaked in sugar you mean to get bacteria to decay the cloth yeah and then the cast breaks yeah thorne shrugged that might work he said but without testing we cant know how long the cast will last might be a few days it might be a few months thats too long sarah said this animal is growing rapidly if growth is constricted itll end up being crippled by the cast what we need eddie said is an organic resin that will form a decaying binder like a gum of some kind chewing gum arby said because i have plenty of no i was thinking of a different kind of gum chemically speaking the diesterase resin well never solve it chemically thorne said we dont have the supplies what else can we do theres no choice but what if you make something thats different in different directions arby said strong one way and weak in another you cant eddie said its a homogeneous resin its all the same stuff goopy glue that turns rockhard when it dries and no wait a minute thorne said turning to the boy what do you mean arby well arby said sarah said the leg is growing that means its going to grow longer which doesnt matter for a cast and wider which does because itll start to squeeze the leg but if you made it weak in the diameter hes right thorne said we can solve it structurally how eddie said just build in a splitline maybe using aluminum foil we have some for cooking thatd be much too weak eddie said not if we coat it with a layer of resin thorne turned to sarah what we can do is make a cast that is very strong for vertical stresses but weak for lateral stresses its a simple engineering problem the baby can walk around on its cuff and everything is fine as long as the stresses are vertical but when its leg grows it will pop the splitline open and the cuff will fall away yes arby said nodding is that hard to do she said no it should be pretty easy you just build a cuff of aluminum foil and coat it with resin eddie said and whatll hold the cuff together while you coat it how about chewing gum arby said you got it thorne said smiling at that moment the baby rex stirred its legs twitching it raised its head the oxygen mask dropping away and gave a low weak squeak quickly sarah said grabbing the head more morphine malcolm had a syringe ready he jabbed it into the animals neck just five ccs now sarah said whats wrong with more keep him out longer hes in shock from the injury ian you can kill him with too much morphine youll put him into respiratory arrest his adrenal glands are probably stressed too if he even has adrenals malcolm said does a tyrannosaurus rex have hormones at all the truth is we dont know anything about these animals the radio clicked and levine said speak for yourself ian in point of fact i suspect we will find that dinosaurs have hormones there are compelling reasons to imagine they do as long as you have gone to the misguided trouble of taking the baby you might draw some tubes of blood meanwhile doc could you pick up the phone malcolm sighed that guy he said is starting to get on my nerves thorne moved down the trailer to the communications module near the front levines request was odd there was a perfectly good system of microphones throughout the trailer but levine knew that he had designed the system himself thorne picked up the phone yes doc levine said ill get right to the point bringing the baby to the trailer was a mistake its asking for trouble what sort of trouble we dont know is the point and i dont want to alarm anybody but why dont you bring the kids out to the high hide for a while and why dont you and eddie come too youre telling me to get the hell out of here you really think its necessary in a word levine said yes i do as the morphine was injected into the baby he gave a sighing wheeze and collapsed back onto the steel pan sarah adjusted the oxygen mask around his face she glanced back at the monitor checking the heart rate but once again arby and kelly were blocking her view kids please thorne stepped forward clapped his bands okay kids field trip lets get moving arby said now but we want to watch the baby no no thorne said dr malcolm and dr harding need room to work this is the time for a field trip to the high hide we can watch the dinosaurs for the rest of the afternoon but doc dont argue were just in the way here and were going thorne said eddie you come too leave these two lovebirds to do their work in a few moments they left the trailer door slammed shut behind them sarah harding heard the soft whirr of the explorer as it drove away bent over the baby adjusting the oxygen mask she said lovebirds malcolm shrugged levine was this levines idea clearing everybody out probably does he know something we dont malcolm laughed im sure he thinks he does well lets start the cast she said i want to get it done quickly and take this baby home again the high hide the sun had disappeared behind lowbanging clouds by the time they reached the high hide the entire valley was bathed in a soft reddish glow as eddie parked the explorer beneath the aluminum scaffolding and they all climbed up to the little shelter above levine was there binoculars to his eyes he did not seem glad to see them stop moving around so much he said irritably from the shelter they had a magnificent view over the valley somewhere in the north thunder rumbled the air was cooling and felt electric is there going to be a storm kelly asked looks like it thorne said arby glanced doubtfully at the metal roof of the shelter how long are we staying out here for a while thorne said this is our only ay here the helicopters are taking us away tomorrow morning i thought you kids deserved a chance to see the dinosaurs in the field one more time arby squinted at him whats the real reason i know kelly said in a worldly tone yeah what dr malcolm wants to be alone with sarah stupid why theyre old friends kelly said so we were just going to watch no kelly said i mean theyre old friends i know what youre talking about arby said im not stupid you know knock it off levine said staring through the binoculars youre missing the interesting stuff whats that those triceratops down at the river somethings bothering them the triceratops herd had been drinking peacefully from the river but now they were beginning to make noise for such huge animals their vocalizations were incongruously highpitched they sounded more like yelping dogs arby turned to look theres something in the trees he said across the river there was some hint of dark movement beneath the trees the triceratops herd shifted and began backing toward each other until they formed a sort of rosette with their curved horns facing outward against the unseen menace the solitary baby was in the center yelping in fear one of the animals presumably its mother turned and nuzzled it afterward the baby was silent i see them kelly said staring at the trees theyre raptors over there the triceratops herd faced the raptors the adults barking as they swung their sharp horns up and down they created a kind of barrier of moving spikes there was an unmistakable sense of coordination of group defense against predators levine was smiling happily theres never been any evidence for this he said suddenly cheerful in fact most paleontologists dont believe it happens dont believe what happens arby said this kind of group defensive behavior especially with trikes they look a bit like rhinos so theyve been assumed to be solitary like rhinos but now we will seeahyes from beneath the trees a single velociraptor hopped out into view it moved quickly on its hind legs balancing with a stiff tall the triceratops herd barked noisily at the appearance of the raptor the other raptors remained hidden beneath the trees the solitary velociraptor in full view moved in a slow semicircle around the herd entering the water on the far side it crossed swimming easily and came out on the other bank it was now about fifty yards upstream from the barking triceratops herd which wheeled to present a united front all their attention was focused on the single velociraptor slowly other raptors began to slink out of their hiding place they moved low bodies hidden in the tall grass jeez arby said theyre hunting in a pack levine said nodding he picked up a bit of candy bar wrapper from the floor of the shelter and dropped it watching it flutter off in the wind the main pack is downwind so the trikes cant smell them he raised the binoculars to his eyes again i think he said that were about to see a kill they watched as the raptors closed in around the herd and then suddenly lightning cracked on the island rim brilliantly lighting the valley floor one of the stalking raptors stood up in surprise its head was briefly visible above the grass immediately the triceratops herd wheeled again regrouping to face the new menace all the raptors stopped as if to reconsider their plan what happened arby said why are they stopping theyre in trouble why look at them the main pack is still across the river theyre too far away to mount an attack you mean theyre giving up already looks like it levine said one by one the raptors in the grass raised their heads making their positions known as each new predator appeared the triceratops barked loudly the raptors seemed to know the situation was hopeless they slunk away moving back toward the trees seeing them retreat the triceratops barked even louder and then the single raptor by the waters edge charged it moved incredibly fast astonishingly fast streaking like a cheetah across the fifty yards that separated it from the herd the adult triceratops had no time to reform the baby was exposed it squealed in fright as it saw the approaching animal the velociraptor leapt into the air raising both its hind legs lightning cracked again and in the brilliant light they saw the twin curved claws high in the air at the last moment the nearest adult turned swiveling its big horned head with the wide bony crest and it knocked the raptor a glancing blow sending the animal sprawling on the muddy bank immediately the adult triceratops charged forward its head high when it reached the raptor it stopped abruptly and swung its big head down lowering its horns toward the fallen animal but the raptor was quick hissing it leapt to its feet and the triceratotops horns slashed harmlessly into the mud the raptor spun sideways and kicked the adult on the snout drawing blood with its big curved claw the adult bellowed but by then two other adults were charging forward while the others remained behind with the baby the raptor scrambled away back into the grass wow arby said that was something the herd king gave a long sigh of relief as he came to the yfork in the road and drove the red jeep left coming onto a wide dirt road he recognized it at once this was the ridge road that led back to the boat as he looked off to his left he could see down across the east valley the boat was still there all right he gave a shout and accelerated sharply relief flooding through him on the deck he could see the spanish fishermen staring up at the sky despite the threatening storm they didnt seem to be preparing to leave probably they were waiting for dodgson well he thought that was fine king would be there in a few minutes after working his wav through dense jungle he could finally see exactly where he was the ridge road was high following the crest of one of the volcanic spines there was almost no foliage up here and as the road twisted and turned he had views across the entire island to the east he could look down into the ravine and the boat at the shore to the west he could look straight across at the laboratory and malcolms twin trailers parked near the far edge of the clearing they never did find out what the hell malcolm was doing here he thought not that it mattered now king was getting off the island that was the only thing that mattered he could almost feel the deck beneath his feet maybe one of the fishermen would even have a beer a nice cold beer while they chugged down the river and pulled out of this damned island hed toast dodgson is what hed do maybe he thought ill have two beers king came around a curve and saw a herd of animals standing thickly in the road they were some kind of green dinosaurs about four feet tall with big domed heads and a bunch of little horns they reminded him of green water buffalo but there were a lot of them he braked sharply the car swerved to a stop the green dinosaurs looked at his car but they did not move the herd just stood there in a lazy contented way king waited drumming his fingers on the steering wheel when nothing happened he honked the horn and flashed his headlights the animals just stared they were funnylooking creatures with that smooth bulging curve on the forehead and all those little horns around it they just stared at him with a stupid cowlike look he slipped the car into gear and edged it forward slowly expecting that he could push his way through the animals they didnt move aside finally his front bumper nudged the nearest animal which grunted took a couple of steps back lowered its head and butted the front of the car hard with a metallic clang christ he thought it could puncture the radiator if he wasnt careful he stopped the car again and waited the motor idling the animals settled down again several of them lay down on the road he couldnt drive over them he looked ahead toward the river and saw the boat not more than a quarter of a mile away he hadnt realized it was so near as he watched he realized that the fishermen were very busy on the deck they were swinging the crane back lashing it down they were getting ready to leave the hell with waiting he thought he opened the door and climbed out leaving the car in the center of the road immediately the animals jumped to their feet and the nearest one charged him he had the door open the animal smashed into it slamming it shut leaving a deep dent in the metal king scrambled toward the edge of the hill only to find he was at the top of a steep vertical descent of more than a hundred feet hed never make it down at least not here farther along the slope was not so steep but now more animals were charging him he had no choice he ran around the back of the car just as another animal smashed into the rear taillight shattering the plastic a third animal charged the back of the car directly king scrambled up onto the spare tire as the animal slammed into the bumper the jolt knocked him off and he fell to the ground rolling while the buffaloes snorted all around him he got to his feet and ran to the opposite side of the toad where there was a slight rise he scrambled up it moving into foliage the animals did not pursue him not that it did him any goodnow he was on the wrong side of the road somehow he had to get back to the other side he climbed to the top of the rise and started down swearing to himself he decided to work his way forward a hundred yards or so until he was beyond the butting animals and then cross the road if he could do that then he could get to the boat almost immediately he was surrounded by dense jungle he tripped tumbled down a muddy slope and when he got to his feet was no longer sure which way to go he was at the bottom of a ravine and the palm trees were ten feet tall and very thick he couldnt see more than a few feet in any direction in a moment of panic he realized he didnt know which way to go he pushed forward through the wet leaves hoping to get his bearings back the kids were still peering over the railing looking at the departing raptors thorne pulled levine to one side and said quietly why did you want us to come here just a precaution levine said bringing the infant to the trailer is asking for trouble what sort of trouble levine shrugged we dont know is the point but in general parents dont like it when their babies are taken away and that baby has some very big parents from the other side of the shelter arby said look look what is it levine said its a man gasping for breath king emerged from the jungle and walked out onto the plain at last he could see where he was he paused soaked and muddy to get his bearings he was disappointed to find that he was nowhere near the boat in fact he still seemed to be on the wrong side of the road he was facing a broad grassy plain with a river coursing through it the plain was mostly deserted although there were several dinosaurs farther down the banks they were the horned ones triceratops and they looked a little agitated the big adults were raising their heads up and down making barking sounds obviously he would have to follow the river until it brought him to the boat but hed have to be careful getting past these triceratops he reached in his pocket and pulled out a candy bar he ripped the wrapping while he watched the triceratops wishing they would go away how long would it take him to reach the boat that was the only question on his mind he decided to move triceratops or not he began walking through the tall grass then he heard a reptilian hiss it was coming from the grass somewhere to his left and he noticed a smell a peculiar rotten smell he paused waiting the candy bar didnt taste so good any more then behind him he heard splashing it was coming from the river king turned to look its one of those men from the jeep arby said standing in the high hide but why is he waiting from their vantage point they could see the dark shapes of the raptors moving through the grass on the other side of the river now two of the raptors came forward splashing in the water moving toward the man oh no arby said king saw two dark striped lizards moving across the river they walked on their hind legs with a sort of hopping motion their bodies were reflected in the flowing water of the river they snapped their long jaws and hissed menacingly at king he glanced upstream and saw another lizard crossing and another beyond that those other animals were already deep in the water and had begun to swim howard king backed away from the river moving deeper into the tall grass then he turned and ran he was chestdeep in grass and running hard gasping for breath when suddenly another lizard head rose up in front of him hissing and snarling he dodged changed direction but suddenly the nearest lizard leapt in the air it jumped so high its body cleared the grass he could see the entire animal flying through the air its two hind legs raised to pounce he glimpsed curved daggerlike claws king turned again and the lizard shrieked as it landed on the ground behind him and tumbled away in the grass king ran on he was energized by pure fear behind him he heard the lizard snarling he ran hard ahead was another twenty yards of grassy clearing and then the jungle began again he saw trees big trees he could climb one and get away off to the left he saw another lizard moving diagonally across the clearing toward him king could only see the head above the grass the lizard seemed to be moving incredibly fast he thought im not going to make it but he would try panting lungs searing he sprinted for the trees only ten more yards now his arms pumped his legs churned his breath came in ragged gasps and then something heavy struck him from behind forcing him to the ground and he felt searing pain down his back and he knew it was the claws they dug into the flesh of his back as he was knocked down he hit the dirt hard and tried to roll but the animal on his back held on he could not move he was pinned down on his stomach hearing the animal snarl behind him the pain in his back was excruciating dizzying and then he felt the animals hot breath on the back of his neck and he heard the snorting breath and his terror was extreme then suddenly a kind of lassitude a deep and welcome sleepiness took him everything became slow as if in a dream he could see all the blades of grass in the ground in front of his face he saw them with a kind of languid intensity and he almost did not mind the sharp pain on his neck and he almost did not care that his neck was within the animals hot jaws it seemed to be happening to someone else he was many miles away he had a moment of surprise when he felt the bones of his neck crunching loudly and then blackness nothing dont look thorne said turning arby away from the railing in the high hide he drew the boy toward his chest but arby impatiently pushed away again to watch what was happening thorne reached for kelly but she stepped away from him and stared out at the plain dont look thorne kept saying dont look the kids watched in silence levine focused his binoculars on the kill there were now five raptors snarling around the mans body tearing viciously at the carcass as he watched one of the raptors jerked its head up tearing away a piece of bloodsoaked shirt the ragged edge of the collar another was shaking the mans severed head in its jaws before finally dropping it on the ground thunder rumbled and lightning flashed in the distant sky it was growing dark and levine was having difficulty seeing exactly what was happening but it was clear that whatever hierarchical organization they had adopted for hunting was abandoned for a kill here it was every animal for itself the frenzied raptors hopped and ducked their heads as they tore the body to pieces and there was plenty of nipping and fighting among themselves one animal came up with something brown hanging from its jaws the animal got an odd expression on its face as it chewed then it turned away from the rest of the pack and held the brown object carefully in its forearms in the growing darkness it took levine a moment to recognize what it was doing it was eating a candy bar and it seemed to be enjoying it the raptor turned back and buried its long nose in the bloody carcass again from across the plain other raptors were racing to join the feast halfrunning halfbounding in great forward leaps snarling and furious they threw themselves into the fray levine lowered his glasses and looked at the two kids they were staring silently and calmly at the kill dodgson dodgson was awakened by a noisy chattering like the sound of a hundred tiny birds it seemed to be coming from all around him slowly he realized that he was lying on his back on damp sloping ground he tried to move but his body felt painful and heavy some sort of weight pressed down on his legs his stomach his arms the weight on his chest made it difficult to breathe and he was sleepy incredibly sleepy he wanted nothing more in all the world than to go back to sleep dodgson started to drift off to unconsciousness but something was pulling at his hand tugging at his fingers one by one as if pulling him back to consciousness slowly slowly pulling him back dodgson opened his eyes there was a little green dinosaur standing beside his hand it leaned over and bit his finger in its tiny jaws tugging at the flesh his fingers were bleeding ragged chunks of flesh had already been bitten away he pulled his hand away in surprise and suddenly the chattering grew louder he turned and saw that he was surrounded by these little dinosaurs they were standing on his chest and legs as well they were the size of chickens and they pecked at him like chickens quick darting bites on his stomach his thighs his crotch revolted dodgson jumped to his feet scattering the lizards which hopped away chirping in annoyance the little animals moved a few feet away then stopped they turned back and stared at him showing no sign of fear on the contrary they seemed to be waiting that was when he realized what they were they were procompsognathids compys scavengers christ he thought they thought i was dead he staggered back almost losing his balance he felt pain and a wave of dizziness the little animals chittered watched his every move go on he said waving his hand get out of here they did not leave they stood there cocking their heads to one side quizzically and waited he bent his head stared down at himself his shirt his trousers were torn in a hundred places blood dribbled from a hundred tiny wounds down his clothes he felt a wave of dizziness and put his hands on his knees he took a deep breath and watched his blood drip onto the leafstrewn ground christ he thought he took another deep breath when he did not move the animals began to inch forward he stood up and they backed away but a moment later they began to come forward again one came close dodgson kicked it viciously sending the little body flying through the air the animal squealed in alarm but it landed like a cat upright and uninjured the others remained where they were waiting he looked around realized it was getting dark he looked at his watch there were only a few minutes more of daylight beneath the jungle canopy it was already quite dark he had to get to safety and soon he checked the compass on his watch strap and headed south he was pretty sure the river was to the south he had to get back to the boat he would be safe at the boat as he started walking the compys chittered and followed after him they stayed about five or ten feet behind making a lot of noise as they hopped and crashed through the low foliage there were dozens of them he realized as darkness descended their eyes glowed bright green his body was a mass of pain every step hurt his balance was not good he was losing blood and he was very very sleepy he would never make it all the way to the river he would not make it more than another couple of hundred yards he fell tripping over a root he got up slowly dirt clinging to his bloodsoaked clothes he looked back at the green eyes behind him and forced himself onward he could go a little farther he thought and then directly ahead he saw a light through the foliage was it the boat he moved faster hearing the compys behind him he pushed through the foliage and then saw a little shed like a toolshed or a guardhouse made of concrete with a tin roof it had a square window and light was shining through the window he fell again got to his knees and crawled the rest of the way to the house he reached the door pulled himself up on the doorknob and opened the door inside the shed was empty some pipes came up through the floor some time in the past they had connected to machinery but the machinery was gone there were only the rust spots where it had once been bolted to the concrete floor in a corner of the room was an electric light it was fitted with a timer so that it came on at night that was the light he had seen did they have electricity on this island how he didnt care he staggered into the room closed the door firmly behind him and sank down onto the bare concrete through the dirty windowpanes he saw the compys outside banging against the glass hopping in frustration but he was safe for the moment he would have to go on of course he would somehow have to get off this fucking island but not now he thought later hed worry about everything later dodgson laid his cheek on the damp concrete floor and slept trailer sarah harding laced the aluminumfoil cuff around the babys injured leg the baby was still unconscious breathing easily not moving its body was relaxed the oxygen hissed softly she finished shaping the aluminum foil into a cuff six inches long using a small brush she began to paint resin over it to make a cast how many raptors are there she said i couldnt tell for sure when i saw them i thought nine i think theres more malcolm said i think eleven or twelve in all twelve she said glancing up at him on this little island yes the resin had a sharp odor like glue she brushed it evenly on the aluminum you know what im thinking she said yes he said there are too many far too many ian she worked steadily it doesnt make sense in africa active predators like lions are very spread out theres one lion for every ten square kilometers sometimes every fifteen kilometers thats all the ecology can support on an island like this you should have no more than five raptors hold this uhhuh but dont forget the prey here is hugesome of those animals are twenty thirty tons im not convinced thats a factor sarah said but for the sake of argument lets say it is ill double the estimate and give you ten raptors for the island but you tell me there are twelve and there are other major predators as well like the rexes yes there are thats too many she said shaking her head the animals are pretty dense here malcolm said not dense enough she said in general predator studies whether tigers in india or lions in africa all seem to show that you can support one predator for every two hundred prey animals that means to support twentyfive predators here you need at least five thousand prey on this island do you have anything like that no how many animals in total do you think are here he shrugged a couple of hundred maybe five hundred at most so youre off by an order of magnitude ian hold this and ill get the lamp she swung the heat lamp over the baby to harden the resin she adjusted the oxygen mask over the babys snout the island cant support all those predators she said and yet theyre here he said what could explain it she shook her head there has to be a food source that we dont know about you mean an artificial source he said i dont think there is one no she said artificial food sources make animals tame and these animals arent tame the only other possibility i can think of is that theres a differential death rate among prey if they grow very fast or die young then that might represent a larger food supply than expected malcolm said ive noticed the largest animals seem small its as if they dont seem to reach maturity maybe theyre being killed off early maybe she said but if theres a differential death rate large enough to support this population you should see evidence of carcasses and lots of skeletons of dead animals have you seen that malcolm shook his head no in fact now that you mention it i havent seen any skeletons at all me neither she pushed the light away theres something funny about this island ian i know malcolm said you do yes he said ive suspected it from the beginning thunder rumbled from the high hide the plain below them was dark and silent except for the distant snarling of the raptors maybe we should go back eddie said anxiously why levine said levine had switched to his nightvision glasses pleased with himself that he had thought to bring them through the goggles the world was shades of pale green he clearly saw the raptors at the kill site the tall grass trampled and bloody all around the carcass was long since finished though they could still hear the cracking of bones as the animals gnawed on them i just think eddie said that now that its night wed be safer in the trailer why levine said well its reinforced its strong and very safe it has everything that we need i just think we should be there i mean youre not planning on staying out here all night are you no levine said what do you think i am a fanatic eddie grunted but lets stay for a while longer levine said eddie turned to thorne doc what do you say its going to start raining soon just a little longer thorne said and then well all go back together there have been dinosaurs on this island for five years maybe more malcolm said but none have appeared elsewhere suddenly in the last year carcasses of dead animals are showing up on the beaches of costa rica and according to reports on islands of the pacific as well carried by currents presumably but the question is why now why all of a sudden after five years something has changed but we dont know wait a minute he moved away from the table over to the computer console he turned toward the screen what are you doing she said arby got us into the old network he said and it still has research files from the eighties he moved the mouse across the screen we havent looked at them he saw the menu come up showing work files and research files he began to scroll through screens of text years ago they had trouble with some disease he said there were a lot of notes about it in the laboratory what kind of disease they didnt know malcolm said in the wild there are some very slowacting illnesses she said may take five or ten years to show up caused by viruses or prions you know protein fragmentslike scrapie or madcow disease but malcolm said those diseases only come from eating contaminated food there was a silence what do you suppose they fed them back then she asked because if i was growing baby dinosaurs id wonder what do they cat milk i suppose but milk yes malcolm said reading the screens first six weeks goats milk thats the logical choice she said goats milk is what they always use in zoos because its so hypoallergenic but what about later give me a minute here malcolm said harding held the babys leg in her hand waiting for the resin to harden she looked at the cast sniffed it it was still strongsmelling i hope thats all right she said sometimes if theres a distinctive smell the animals wont allow infants to return but maybe this will dissipate after the compound hardens how long has it been malcolm glanced at his watch ten minutes another ten minutes and itll set she said id like to take this guy back to the nest thunder rumbled they looked out the window at the black night probably too late to return him tonight malcolm said he was still typing peering at the screen sowhat did they feed them okay in the period from to the herbivores got a macerated plant matter on a feeding schedule three times a dayand the carnivores got he stopped whatd the carnivores get looks like a groundup extract of animal protein from what the usual source is turkey or chicken with some antibiotics added sarah he said they used sheep extract no she said they wouldnt do that yeah they did came from their supplier who used groundup sheep youre kidding she said malcolm said im afraid so now let me see if i can find ou a soft alarm sounded on the wall panel above him a red light began to flash a moment later the exterior lights above the trailer turned on bathing the grassy clearing around them in bright halogen glare whats that harding said the sensors something set them off malcolm moved away from the computer peered out the window he saw nothing but tall grass and the dark trees at the perimeter it was silent still sarah still intent on the baby said what happened i dont know i dont see anything but something triggered the sensors i guess wind theres no wind he said in the high hide kelly saidhey look thorne turned from their location in the valley they could look north to the high cliff behind them and the two trailers above in the grassy clearing the exterior lights on the trailers had come on thorne unclipped the radio at his belt ian are you there a momentary crackle im here doc whats happening i dont know malcolm said the perimeter lights just turned on i think the sensor was activated but we dont see anything out there eddie said airs cooling off fast now might have been convection currents set it off thorne said ian everything okay yes fine dont worry eddie said i always figured we set the sensitivity too high thats all it is levine frowned and said nothing sarah finished with the baby and wrapped him in a blanket and gently strapped him down to the table with cloth restraint straps she came over and stood beside malcolm she looked out the window what do you think malcolm shrugged eddie says the systems too sensitive is it i dont know its never been tested before he scanned the trees at the edge of the clearing looking for any movement then he thought he heard a snorting sound almost a growl it seemed like it was answered from somewhere behind him he went to look out the other side of the trailer at the trees on the other side malcolm and harding looked out straining to see something in the night malcolm held his breath tensely after a moment harding sighed i dont see anything ian no me neither must be a false alarm then he felt the vibration a deep resonant thumping in the ground that was carried to them through the floor of the trailer he glanced at sarah her eyes widened malcolm knew what it was the vibration came again unmistakably this time sarah stared out the window she whispered ian i see it malcolm turned and joined her she was pointing out the window toward the nearest trees what and then he saw the big head emerge from the foliage midway u one tree the head turned slowly from side to side as if listening it was an adult tyrannosaurus rex ian she whispered look there are two of them over to the right he saw a second animal step from behind the trees it was larger the female of the pair the animals growled a deep rumble in the night they emerged slowly from the cover of the trees stepping into the clearing they blinked in the harsh light are those the parents i dont know i think so he glanced over at the baby it was still unconscious breathing steadily the blanket rising and falling regularly what are they doing here she said i dont know the animals were still standing at the edge of the clearing near the cover of the trees they seemed hesitant waiting are they looking for the baby she said sarah please im serious thats ridiculous why they must have tracked it here the tyrannosaurs raised their heads lifting their jaws then they turned their heads left and right in slow arcs they repeated the movement then took a step forward toward the trailer sarah he said were miles from the nest there isnt any way for them to track it how do you know sarah you said yourself we dont know anything about these animals we dont know anything about their physiology their biochemistry their nervous systems their behavior and we dont know anything about their sensory equipment either yes but theyre predators ian good sense of vision good sense of hearing and smell i assume so yes but we dont know what else sarah said what else malcolm said ian there are other sensory modalities snakes sense infrared bats have echolocation birds and turtles have magnetosensors they can detect the earths magnetic field which is how they migrate dinosaurs may have other sensory modalities that we cant imagine sarah this is ridiculous is it then you tell me what are they doing out there outside near the trees the tyrannosaurs had become silent they were no longer growling but they were still moving their heads back and forth in slow arcs turning left and right malcolm frowned it looks liketheyre looking around straight into bright lights no ian theyre blinded as soon as she said it he realized she was right but the heads were turning back and forth in that regular way then what are they doing smelling no heads are high nostrils arent moving listening she nodded possibly listening to what maybe to the baby he glanced over again sarah the baby is out cold i know it isnt making any noise none that we can hear she stared at the tyrannosaurs but theyre doing something ian that behavior were seeing has meaning we just dont know what it is from the high hide levine stared through his nightvision glasses at the clearing he saw the two tyrannosaurs standing at the edge of the forest they were moving their heads in an odd synchronized way they took a few hesitant steps toward the trailer lifted their heads turned right and left and then seemed finally to make up their minds the animals moved quickly almost aggressively across the clearing over the radio they heard malcolm say its the lights the lights are drawing them a moment later the exterior lights were turned off and the clearing went black they all squinted in the darkness they heard malcolm say that did it thorne said to levine what do you see nothing whatre they doing theyre just standing there through the nightvision goggles he saw that the tyrannosaurs had paused as if confused by this change in light even from a distance he could hear their growls but they were uneasy they swung their great heads up and down and snapped their jaws but they did not move closer kelly said what is it theyre waiting levine said at least for the moment levine had the distinct impression that the tyrannosaurs were unsettled the trailer must represent a large and fearsome change in their environment perhaps they would turn away he thought and leave despite their enormous size they were cautious almost timid animals they growled again and then he saw them move forward toward the darkened trailer ian what do we do damned if i know malcolm whispered they were crouched down side by side in the passageway trying to stay out of sight in the windows the tyrannosaurs moved implacably forward they could feel each step as a distinct vibration now two ten ton animals moving toward them theyre coming right at us i noticed he said the first of the animals reached the trailer coming so close that the body blocked the entire window all malcolm could see was powerfully muscled legs and underbelly the head was far above them out of view then the second tyrannosaur came up on the opposite side the two animals began to circle the trailer growling and snorting heavy footsteps shook the floor beneath them they smelled the pungent predator odor one of the tyrannosaurs brushed against the side of the trailer and they heard a scraping sound scaly flesh on metal malcolm felt sudden panic it was the smell that did it the smell that he suddenly remembered from before he began to sweat he glanced over at sarah and saw that she was intent watching the movements of the animals this isnt hunting behavior she whispered i dont know malcolm said maybe it is they arent lions you know one of the tyrannosaurs bellowed in the night a frightening earsplitting sound not hunting she said theyre searching ian a moment later the second tyrannosaur bellowed in reply then the big head swung down and peered in through the window in front of them malcolm ducked down flattening himself on the trailer floor and sarah collapsed on top of him her shoe pressed on his ear its going to be fine sarah outside they heard the tyrannosaurs snorting and growling malcolm whispered would you mind moving she edged to one side and he eased up slowly peering cautiously over the seat cushions he had a glimpse of the big eye of the rex staring in at him the eye swiveled in the socket he saw the jaws open and close the hot breath of the animal fogged the glass the tyrannosaurs head swung away moving back from the trailers and for a moment malcolm breathed more easily but then the head swung back and slammed with a heavy thud into the trailer rocking it hard dont worry sarah the trailers very strong she whispered i cant tell you how relieved i am from the opposite side the other rex bellowed and struck the trailer with its snout the suspension creaked with the impact the two tyrannosaurs now began an alternating rhythmic pounding of the trailer from either side malcolm and harding were thrown back and forth sarah tried to steady herself but was knocked away at the next impact the floor tilted crazily under each blow lab equipment flew off the tables glass shattered and then abruptly the pounding stopped there was silence grunting malcolm got up on one knee he peered out the window and saw the hindquarters of one of the tyrannosaurs as it moved forward what do we do he whispered the radio crackled thorne said ian are you there ian for gods sake turn that off sarah whispered malcolm reached for his belt whispered were okay and clicked the radio off sarah was crawling on her hands and knees forward through the trailer into the biology lab he followed her and saw the big tyrannosaur peering in through the window at the baby strapped down the tyrannosaur made a soft grunting sound then it paused looking in the window it grunted again she wants her baby ian sarah whispered well god knows malcolm said its all right with me they were huddled on the floor trying to stay out of sight how are we going to get it to her i dont know maybe push it out the door i dont want them to step on it sarah said who cares malcolm said the tyrannosaur at the window made a series of soft grunts followed by a long menacing growl it was the big female sarah but she was already standing up facing the tyrannosaur she immediately began to speak her voice soft soothing its okayits all right nowthe baby is fineim just going to loosen these straps hereyou can watch me the head outside the window was so huge it filled the entire glass frame sarah saw the powerful muscles of the neck ripple beneath the skin the jaws moved slightly her hands trembled as she undid the straps thats rightyour baby is finesee its just fine crouched below at her feet malcolm whispered what are you doing she did not change her soft soothing tone i know it sounds crazybut it works with lionssometimesthere we areyour baby is free sarah unwrapped the blanket and took away the oxygen mask all the while speaking calmly nowall i have to do she lifted the baby up in her hands is get it to you suddenly the females head swung back and smashed sideon into the glass which shattered into a white spiderweb with a harsh crack sarah couldnt see through it but she saw a shadow move and then the second impact broke the glass free sarah dropped the baby on the tray and jumped back as the head crashed through and pushed several feet into the trailer streams of blood ran down the adults snout from the shards of glass but after the initial violence it stopped and became delicate in its movements it sniffed the baby starting at the head moving slowly down the body it sniffed the cast too and licked it briefly with its tongue finally it rested its lower jaw lightly on the babys chest it stayed that way for a long time not moving only the eyes blinked slowly staring at sarah malcolm lying on the floor saw blood dripping over the edge of the counter he started to get up but she pushed his head back down with her hand she whispered ssssh whats happening its feeling the heartbeat the tyrannosaur grunted opened its mouth and gently gripped the infant between its jaws then it moved slowly back out through the broken glass carrying the baby outside it set the baby on the ground below their vision it bent over the head disappearing from view malcolm whispered did it wake up is the baby awake ssssh there was a repetitive slurping sound coming from outside the trailer it was interspersed with soft guttural growls malcolm saw sarah leaning forward trying to see out the window he whispered whats happening shes licking him and pushing him with her snout and thats all she just keeps doing it what about the baby nothing it keeps rolling over like its dead how much morphine did we give him the last time i dont know he said how should i know malcolm remained on the floor listening to the slurping and the growling and finally after what seemed like an eternity he heard a soft highpitched squeak hes waking up ian the babys waking up malcolm crawled up on his knees and looked out the window in time to see the adult carrying the baby in its jaws walking away toward the perimeter of the clearing whats it doing i guess taking it back the second adult came into view following the first malcolm and sarah watched the two tyrannosaurs move away from the trailer across the clearing malcolms shoulders dropped that was close he said yes that was close she sighed and wiped blood from her forearm in the high hide thorne pressed the radio button ian are you there ian kelly said maybe they turned the radio off a light rain began to fall pattering on the metal roof of the shed levine was staring through his nightvision glasses toward the cliff lightning flashed and thorne said can you see what the animals are doing i can eddie said it looksit looks like theyre going away they all began to cheer only levine remained silent watching through the glasses thorne turned to him is that right richard is everything okay actually i think not levine said im afraid we have made a serious error malcolm watched the retreating tyrannosaurs through the shattered glass window beside him sarah said nothing she never took her eyes off the animals rain started to fall water dripped from the shards of lass thunder rumbled in the distance and lightning cracked harshly down illuminating the giant animals as they moved away at the nearest of the big trees the adults stopped and placed the baby on the ground why are they doing that sarah said they should be going back to the nest i dont know maybe theyre maybe the baby is dead she said but no in the next flash of lightning they could see the baby moving it was still alive they could hear its highpitched squeaking as one of the adults took the baby in its laws and gently placed it in a fork among the high branches of a tree oh no sarah said shaking her head this is wrong ian this is all wrong the female tyrannosaur remained with the baby for some moments moving it positioning it then the female turned opened its jaws and roared the male tyrannosaur roared in response and then both animals charged the trailer at full speed racing across the clearing toward them oh my god sarah said brace yourself sarah malcolm shouted its going to be bad the impact was stunning knocking them sideways through the air sarah screamed as she tumbled away malcolm hit his head and fell to the floor seeing stars beneath him the trailer rocked on its suspension with a metallic scream the tyrannosaurs roared and slammed into it again he heard her shouting ian ian and then the trailer crashed over onto its side malcolm turned away glassware and lab equipment smashed all around him when he looked up everything was cockeyed directly above him was the broken window the tyrannosaur had smashed rain dripped through onto malcolms face lightning flashed and then he saw a big head peering down at him and snarling he heard the harsh scratching of the tyrannosaurs claws on the metal side of the trailer then the face disappeared a moment later he heard them bellowing as they pushed the trailer through the dirt he called sarah and he saw her somewhere behind him just as the world spun crazily again and the trailer was upended with a crash now the trailer was lying on its roof malcolm started crawling along the ceiling trying to reach sarah he looked up at the lab equipment locked down on the lab benches above his head liquid dripped onto him from a dozen sources something stung his shoulder he heard a hiss and realized it must be acid somewhere in the darkness ahead sarah was groaning lightning flashed again and malcolm saw her lying crumpled near the accordion junction that connected the two trailers that junction was twisted almost shut which must mean that the second trailer was still upright it was crazy everything was crazy outside the tyrannosaurs roared and he heard a muffled explosion they were biting the tires he thought too bad they dont bite into the battery cable thatd give them a real surprise suddenly the tyrannosaurs slammed into the trailer again knocking it laterally along the clearing as soon as it stopped they slammed again the trailer lurched sideways by then he had reached sarah she threw her arms around him ian she said the whole left half of her face was dark when the lightning flashed he saw it was covered in blood are you okay im fine she said with the back of her hand she wiped blood out of her eye can you see what it is in another lightning flash he saw the glint of a large chunk of glass embedded near her hairline he pulled it out and pressed his hand against the sudden gush of blood they were in the kitchen he reached up toward the stove and pulled down a dishtowel he held it against her head and watched the cloth darken does it hurt its okay i think its not too bad he said outside the tyrannosaurs roared in the night what are they doing she said her voice was dull the tyrannosaurs slammed into the trailer again with this impact the trailer seemed to move a lot more than before sliding sideways and down sliding down theyre pushing us he said where ian to the edge of the clearing the tyrannosaurs slammed again and the trailer moved farther theyre pushing us over the cliff the cliff was five hundred feet of sheer rock straight down to the valley below theyd never survive the fall she held the dishtowel with her own hand pushing his hand away do something yeah okay he said he moved away from her bracing for the next impact he didnt know what to do he had no idea what to do the trailer was upside down and everything was crazy his shoulder burned and he could smell the acid eating his shirt or maybe it was his flesh it burned a lot the whole trailer was dark all the power was out there was glass everywhere and he all the power was out malcolm started to get to his feet but the next impact flung him sideways and he fell hard slamming his head against the refrigerator the door swung open and cartons of cold milk glass bottles crashed down on him but there was no light from the refrigerator because all the power was out lying on his back malcolm looked out the window and saw the big foot of a tyrannosaur standing in the grass lightning flashed as the foot raised to kick and immediately the trailer moved again sliding easily now metal screeching and then tilting downward oh shit he said ian but it was too late the whole trailer was groaning and creaking in metallic protest and then malcolm saw the far end sink down as the trailer slid over the cliff it started slowly and then gathered speed the ceiling they were lying on falling away everything falling sarah falling clutching at him as she went and the tyrannosaurs bellowing in triumph were going over the cliff he thought not knowing what else to do he grabbed the refrigerator door hanging on tightly the door was cold and slippery with moisture the trailer tilted and fell the metal creaking loudly malcolm felt his hands sliding off the white enamel slidingslidingand then be lost his grip and fell free dropping helplessly straight down toward the far end of the trailer he saw the drivers seat rushing up to him but before he got there he struck something in the darkness felt a moment of searing pain and bent double and slowly gently everything around him went black rain drummed on the roof of the shed and poured in a continuous sheet down the sides levine wiped the lenses of his glasses then lifted them again to his eyes he stared at the cliffs in the darkness arby said what is it what happened i cant tell levine said it was hard to see anything in this downpour moments before they had watched in horror as the two tyrannosaurs pushed the trailer toward the cliff the large animals had done it with ease levine guessed the tyrannosaurs had a combined mass of twenty tons and the trailer only weighed about two tons once they had turned it over it slid easily over the wet grass as they pushed it with their underbellies and kicked it with their powerful leg muscles why are they doing that thorne said to levine standing beside him i suspect he said that we have changed the perceived territory hows that again you have to remember what were dealing with levine said tyrannosaurs may show complex behavior but most of it is instinctual its unthinking behavior wired in and territoriality is part of that instinct the tyrannosaurs mark territory they defend territory its not thinking behavior they dont have very large brains but they do it from instinct all instinctive behavior has triggers releasers for the behavior and im afraid that by moving the baby we redefined their territory to include the clearing where the baby was found so now theyre going to defend their territory by driving out the trailers then lightning flashed and they all saw it in the same horrifying moment the first trailer had gone over the cliff it was hanging upside down in space still connected by the accordion connector to the second trailer in the clearing above that connector wont hold eddie shouted not long in the glare of lightning they saw the tyrannosaurs up in the clearing methodically they were now pushing the second trailer toward the cliff thorne turned to eddie im going he said ill come with you eddie said no stay with the kids but you need stay with the kids we cant leave them alone but levine can no you stay thorne said he was already climbing down the scaffolding slippery in drenching rain toward the explorer below he saw kelly and arby looking down at him he jumped in the car clicked on the ignition he was already thinking of the distance to the clearing it was three miles maybe more even driving fast it would take him seven or eight minutes to get there and by then it would be too late hed never make it in time but he had to try sarah harding heard a rhythmic creaking and opened her eyes everything was dark she was disoriented then lightning flashed and she stared straight down toward the valley five hundred feet below the view swung gently back and forth she was looking through the windshield of the trailer hanging down the side of the cliff they were not falling any more but they were hanging precariously in space she herself was lying across the drivers seat which had broken free of its mounting and shattered a control panel in the wall loose wires hung out panel indicators flickered she was having trouble seeing from the blood in her left eye she pulled out the tail of her shirt and ripped two strips of cloth she folded one to make a compress and pressed it against the gash on her forehead then she tied the second strip around her head to hold the compress down the pain was intense for a moment she gritted her teeth until it faded from somewhere above her she felt a thumping vibration she turned and looked straight up she saw the whole length of the trailer suspended vertically malcolm was ten feet above her bent over a lab table not moving ian she said he didnt answer he didnt move the trailer shuddered again creaking under a dull impact and then harding realized what was happening the first trailer was dangling straight down the cliff face swinging freely in space but it was still connected to the second trailer up on the clearing the first trailer now hung from the accordion connector and the tyrannosaurs up above were now pushing the second trailer off the cliff ian she said ian she scrambled to her feet ignoring the pain in her body she felt a wave of dizziness and wondered how much blood she had lost she began to climb straight up standing first on the back of the drivers seat grabbing for the nearest biology table she pulled herself upward until she could reach a handle mounted in the wall the trailer swayed beneath her from the handle she managed to grab the refrigerator door putting her fingers through a wire shelf she tested it it held and she gave it her full weight she raised her leg until she got her shoe into the refrigerator itself then she swung her body still higher until she was standing up and could reach the handle to the oven it was like mountain climbing through a damn kitchen she thought soon she was alongside malcolm lightning flashed again and she saw his battered face he groaned she crawled over to him trying to see how badly he was hurt ian she said his eyes were closed sorry never mind i got you into this ian can you move are you okay he groaned my leg ian we have to do something from the clearing above them she heard the tyrannosaurs roaring it seemed to her that they had been roaring her whole life the trailer lurched and swung her legs slid out of the refrigerator and she was hanging free in space from the oven door the far end of the trailer was some twenty feet below the oven handle wouldnt hold her weight she knew not for long harding swung her legs kicking wildly finally touched something solid she felt with her feet then stepped down looking back she saw she was standing on the side of the stainlesssteel sink she moved her foot and the faucet turned on soaking her feet the tyrannosaurs roared pounding hard the trailer moved farther out into space swinging ian theres not much time we have to do something he raised his head stared at her with blank eyes lightning flashed again his lips moved power he said what about it power is off she didnt know what he was talking about of course the power was off then she remembered he had turned it off earlier when the tyrannosaurs were approaching the light had bothered them before maybe it would bother them again you want me to turn the power on his head nodded fractionally yes turn it on how ian she looked around in the darkness theres a panel where he didnt answer her she reached out shook his shoulder ian where is the panel he pointed downward she looked down saw the loose wires from the panel i cant its broken up she could hardly hear him vaguely she remembered that there was another control panel just inside the second trailer if she could get in she might be able to turn the power on okay ian she said ill do it she moved on going higher the floor of the trailer was now thirty feet below her the tyrannosaurs roared and kicked again she swung in space she moved on she intended to go through the accordion passage into the second trailer but as she came closer to the top she saw that it was not possible in the harsh flare of lightning she saw the accordion passage was twisted tightly shut she was trapped in the first trailer she heard the tyrannosaurs bellowing and slamming the second trailer above ian she looked down he wasnt moving hanging there she realized with a sick feeling that she was defeated another kick another two kicks and it would be all over they would fall there was nothing they could do there was no time left she was hanging suspended in blackness the power was out and there was nothing or was there she heard an electrical hum not far away in the darkness was there a panel lip here at this end of the trailer did they design it to have panels at both ends hanging near the top of the trailer her shoulders and forearms burning with strain she looked around for a second power panel she was up near the far end if there was a panel it should be nearby but where in the glare of lightning she looked over one shoulder then the other she saw no panel her arms ached ian please no panel it wasnt possible she kept hearing that hum there had to be a panel she just wasnt seeing it there had to be a panel she swung left and right and lightning flashed again casting crazy shadows and then at last she saw it it was just six inches above her head it was upside down but she could see all the buttons and switches they were dark now if she could just figure out which was which the hell with it she released her right hand and hanging from her left pressed every button on the panel she could touch immediately the trailer began to light up every interior light coming on she kept pressing the buttons one after another some shorted out there were sparks and smoke she kept pressing more suddenly the side monitor came on just inches from her face a streaky video blur then it came into focus although she was looking at it sideways she could see the tyrannosaurs up on the clearing standing over the second trailer their forearms touching it their powerful legs kicking and pushing at it she pressed more buttons the final one had a silver protective cover she flipped the cover open and pressed that button too on the monitor she saw the tyrannosaurs disappear in a sudden flaring burst of incandescent sparks and she heard them roar in rage and then the video monitor went off and there was a crackling explosion of sparks all around harding stinging her face and hands and then everything in the trailer went off and it was dark again there was silence for a long moment then inexorably the pounding began again thorne the windshield wipers flicked back and forth thorne took the curves fast despite the driving rain he glanced at his watch two minutes gone perhaps three perhaps more he wasnt sure the road was a muddy track slippery and dangerous he splashed through deep puddles holding his breath each time the car had been waterproofed back in his shop but you were never sure about these things each puddle was another test so far so good three minutes gone at least three the road curved opened out and in a flash of lightning he saw a deep puddle ahead he accelerated through it the car kicking up plumes of water on both side windows and then he was through it still going still going as he headed up a hill he saw the dashboard needles swing wildly and he heard the sizzle that he knew meant a fatal electrical short there was an explosion under the hood and acrid smoke poured out from the radiator and the car stopped dead four minutes he sat in the car hearing the rain pound on the metal roof he turned the ignition key nothing happened dead rain poured in sheets down the windshield he sat back in his seat sighed and stared at the road ahead the radio crackled on the seat beside him doc are you almost there thorne stared at the road trying to guess where he was he estimated that he must still be more than a mile from the trailer in the clearing maybe more too far to try it on foot he swore and pounded the seat no eddie i shorted you what eddie the cars dead im thorne broke off he noticed something from around the curve ahead he saw a faint flashing red glow thorne squinted trying to be sure yes his eyes were not playing tricks on him it was there all right a flashing red glow eddie said doc you there thorne didnt answer he grabbed the radio and the lindstradt rifle jumped out of the car and ducking his head against the rain began to run up the hill toward the junction of the ridge road coming around a curve he saw the red jeep standing in the middle of the ridge road its taillights flashing one of the lights was broken glaring white he ran forward trying to see inside in a flash of lightning he could see there was no driver the drivers door was not even closed the side was deeply dented thorne climbed inside reaching down with his hand for the steering wheelyes the keys were there he turned the ignition the motor rumbled to life he shoved the jeep in gear backed it around and headed up the ridge toward the clearing it was only another few curves before he saw the green roof of the laboratory and turned left his headlights swinging across the grassy clearing and shining onto the dinosaurs pushing the trailer confronted by these new lights the tyrannosaurs turned in unison and bellowed at thornes jeep they abandoned the trailer and charged thorne threw the jeep into reverse and was backing away frantically before he realized the animals were not coming toward him instead they were running diagonally across the clearing toward a tree near thorne beneath the tree they paused their heads turned upward thorne doused his lights and waited now he saw the animals only intermittently in the flashes of lightning in one crackling burst he saw them take down the baby from the tree then he saw them nuzzling the baby obviously his sudden arrival had made them anxious about the infant the next time lightning flashed the tyrannosaurs were gone the clearing was empty were they really gone or were they just hiding he rolled down the window stuck his head out in the rain that was when he heard an odd low continuous squealing sound it sounded like the extended cry of an animal but it was too steady too continuous as he listened he realized it was something else it was metal thorne turned on his lights again and drove forward slowly the tyrannosaurs were gone in the pale beam of the headlamps he saw the second trailer with a continuous metallic squeal it was still sliding slowly across the wet grass toward the edge of the cliff what is he doing now kelly yelled over the rain hes driving levine said looking through goggles from the high hide they could see thornes headlamps cross the clearing hes driving to the trailer and hes hes what kelly said what is he doing now hes driving around and around a tree levine said a big tree by the clearing why he must be running the cable around the tree eddie said thats the only possible reason there was a moment of silence whats he doing now arby said hes gotten out of the jeep now hes running toward the trailer thorne was down on his hands and knees in the mud holding the big hook of the jeep winch in his hands the trailer was sliding away from him but he managed to crawl beneath it and get the hook around the rear axle he pulled his fingers clear just as the hook slammed tight against the brake cover and he rolled his body away newly restrained the trailer jumped sideways in the grass the tires slamming down where his body had been moments before the metal cable from the winch was pulled taut the whole underbelly of the trailer creaked in protest but it held thorne crawled out from beneath the trailer and squinted at it in the rain he looked carefully at the wheels of the jeep to see if they were moving at all no with the cable wrapped around the tree the counterbalancing weight of the jeep was enough to hold the second trailer on the rim of the cliff he went back to the jeep climbed inside and set the brake he heard eddie saying doc doc im here eddie you manage to stop it yeah its not moving any more the radio crackled thats great but listen doc you know that connector is just fivemil mesh over stainless rod it was never intended to i know eddie im working on it thorne climbed out of the car again he ran quickly through the rain toward the trailer he opened the side door and went inside the interior was inky black he could see nothing at all everything was overturned his feet crunched on glass all the windows were shattered he held the radio in his hand eddie yes doc i need rope he knew that eddie had all sorts of supplies squirreled away doc just tell me its in the other trailer doc thorne crashed against a table in the darkness great there might be some nylon line in the utility locker eddie said but i dont know how much he didnt sound hopeful thorne pushed his way down the trailer came to the wall cabinets they were jammed shut he tugged at them in the darkness then turned away the utility locker was just beyond maybe there would be rope there and right now he needed rope trailer sarah harding still hanging by her arms from the top of the trailer stared up at the twisted accordion connector leading to the second trailer the pounding from the dinosaurs had stopped and the other trailer was no longer moving but now she felt water dripping cold onto her face and she knew what that meant the accordion connector was beginning to leak she looked up and saw a tear had begun to open in the mesh fabric revealing the twisted coils of steel that formed the connector the tear was small now but it would rapidly widen and as the mesh broke the steel would begin to uncoil to lengthen and finally snap they had only minutes before the hanging trailer broke free and fell to the ground below she climbed back down to malcolm bracing herself to stand beside him ian i know he said shaking his head ian we have to get out of here she grabbed him under his armpits and pulled him upright and youre coming with me he shook his head defeated she had seen that gesture before in her life that futile shake giving up she hated to see it harding never gave up not ever malcolm grunted i cant you have to she said sarah i dont want to hear it ian theres nothing to talk about now lets go she was pulling him and he groaned but he straightened his body she pulled hard and got him up off the table lightning flashed and he seemed to find some energy he managed to stand on the edge of the seat facing the table he was unsteady but standing what do we do i dont know but were going to get out of hereis there any rope he nodded weakly where he pointed straight down toward the nose of the trailer now hanging in space down there under the dash come on she leaned out into space and spread her legs so she was braced against the floor opposite her she was standing like a rock climber in a chimney twenty feet below her to the dashboard okay ian lets go malcolm said i cant do it sarah seriously then lean on me ill carry you but now damn it malcolm hoisted himself up grasped a wall fitting his arm trembling he was dragging his right leg then she felt his weight on her sudden and heavy almost knocking her free his arms locked around her neck choking her she gasped reached back with both arms grabbed his thighs and lifted him while he adjusted his arms better around her neck finally she could breathe sorry he said its okay she said here we go she started to make her way down the vertical passageway grabbing at whatever she could in places there were handholds and when there were no handholds she clutched at drawer handles table legs window latches even the carpeting on the floor her fingers tearing the cloth at one point the carpet came away in a big strip and she slipped before her legs tightened wider and she halted her downward slide hanging behind her malcolm wheezed his arms around her neck were trembling he said youre very strong but still feminine she said grimly she was only ten feet from the dashboard then five she found a wall grip hung dangling her legs her feet touched the steering wheel she lowered herself down easing malcolm onto the dashboard he lay back gasping the trailer creaked and swayed she fumbled under the dashboard found a utility box popped it open metal tools spilled out clattering and she found a rope halfinch nylon easily fifty feet of it she got up staring down through the windshield at the bottom of the valley hundreds of feet below directly to her side she saw the drivers door to the trailer she twisted the handle pushed it open it clanged against the outer surface of the trailer and she felt rain on her face she leaned out and looked up the side of the trailer she saw smooth metal paneling with no hand grips but underneath the trailer there must be axles and boxes and other things to stand on gripping the wet metal of the doorjamb she bent over trying to look at the underside of the trailer she heard a metallic clanking and she heard someone say finally and a bulky shape suddenly loomed in front of her it was thorne hanging on the undercarriage for christs sake thorne said what are you waiting for an engraved invitation lets go its ian she said hes hurt typical kelly thought looking at arby in the high hide when things got tough he just couldnt handle it too much emotion too much tension and he got all trembly and weird arby had long since turned away from the cliff and now was looking out the other side of the shelter toward the river almost as if nothing was going on typical kelly turned back to levine whats happening now she said thorne just went in levine said peering through the goggles he went in you mean in the trailer yes and nowsomeones coming out who i think sarah shes getting everybody out kelly strained in the night trying to see the rain had almost stopped there was only a light drizzle now across the valley the trailer still swung free in space she thought she could make out a figure clinging to the undercarriage but she couldnt be sure whats she doing climbing alone yes levine said alone sarah harding came out through the door twisting her body in the rain she did not look down she knew the valley was five hundred feet below her she could feel the trailer swinging she had the rope slung around her shoulder she edged around lowered her leg and stood on a gearbox she felt with her hand gripped a cable swung around thorne was inside the trailer talking to her well never get malcolm up without a rope he said can you climb it lightning flashed she stared straight up at the underside of the trailer glistening wet with rain she saw the slick learn of grease then blackness again sarah can you do it yes she said she reached up and started to climb in the high hide kelly was saying where is she whats happening is she all right levine watched through the glasses shes climbing he said arby listened to their voices distantly he was turned away staring off at the river in the darkened plain he waited impatiently for the next lightning flash waited to see if it was true what he had seen earlier she did not know how but slipping and sliding she somehow got to the top of the cliff and flung herself over the side there was no time to waste she uncoiled the rope and crawled beneath the second trailer she looped the rope through a metal bracket quickly knotted it then she went back to the edge of the cliff and threw the rope down doc she shouted standing at the trailer door thorne caught the rope and tied it around malcolm malcolm groaned lets go thorne said he put his arm around malcolm and swung them both out until they were standing on the gearbox christ malcolm said looking upward but sarah was already pulling him the rope tightening just use your arms thorne said malcolm started to rise in a few moments he was ten feet above thorne sarah was up on the cliff but thorne couldnt see her ians body blocked his view thorne began to climb his legs struggling for purchase the underside of the trailer was slippery he thought i should have made it nonskid but who would ever make the undercarriage of a vehicle nonskid in his minds eye he saw the accordion connector tearingslowly tearingopening wider he climbed upward hand over hand foot by foot lightning flashed and he realized that they were close to the top sarah was standing on the edge of the cliff reaching down for malcolm malcolm was pulling himself up with his arms his legs swung limp free but he was still going another few feetsarah grabbed malcolm by the shirt collar and hauled him up the rest of the way malcolm flopped over out of sight thorne continued up his feet slipped his arms ached he climbed sarah was reaching down to him come on doc she said her hand was extended fingers reaching toward him with a metallic whang the mesh ripped on the connector and the trailer dropped down ten feet the coils widening thorne climbed faster looking up toward sarah her hand still reached down you can do it doc he climbed closing his eyes just climbing holding the rope gripping it tightly his arms ached his shoulders ached and the rope seemed to become smaller in his hands he twisted it around his fist trying to hold on but at the last moment he began to slip and then he felt a sudden burning pain in his scalp sorry about that sarah said and she pulled him up by his hair the pain was intense but he didnt care he hardly noticed because now he was alongside the accordion connector watching the coils pop free like a bursting corset and the trailer dropped lower but she still pulled him she was immensely strong and then his fingers touched wet grass and he was over the side safe beneath them there was a sharp series of metallic sounds whang whang whang as the coiled metal rods snapped one after another and then with a final groan the trailer broke all connection and fell free down the cliff face growing smaller and smaller until it smashed on the rocks far below in the glare of lightning it looked like a crumpled paper bag thorne turned and looked up at sarah thanks he said sarah sat heavily on the ground beside him blood dripped from her bandaged head she opened her fingers and released a handful of his gray hair which fell in a wet clump onto the grass hell of a night she said the high hide watching through the nightvision glasses levine said they made it kelly said all of them yes they made it kelly began to jump and cheer arby turned and grabbed the glasses out of levines hand hey levine said just a minute i need them arby said he spun back around and looked out at the dark plain for a moment he couldnt see anything just a green blur his fingers found the focus knob he twisted it quickly and the image came into view what the hell is so important levine said irritably thats an expensive piece of equipment and then they all heard the snarling it was coming closer in pale shades of luminous green arby saw the raptors clearly there were twelve of them moving in a loose cluster through the grass heading in the direction of the high hide one animal was a few yards ahead and seemed to be the leader but it was hard to discern any organization in the pack the raptors were all snarling and licking the blood off their snouts wiping their faces with their clawed forearms a gesture oddly intelligent almost human in the nightvision glasses their eyes glowed bright green they did not seem to have noticed the high hide they never looked up toward it but they were certainly headed in that direction abruptly the glasses were yanked out of arbys hands excuse me levine said i think id better handle this arby said you wouldnt even know about it if it wasnt for me be quiet levine said he brought the glasses to his eyes focused them and sighed at what he saw twelve animals about twenty yards away eddie said quietly do they see us no and were downwind of them so they wont smell us my guess is theyre following the game trail that runs past the hide if were quiet theyll go right past us eddies radio crackled he hastily reached to turn it down they all stared out at the plain the night was now calm and still the rain had stopped and the moon was breaking through thinning clouds faintly they saw the approaching animals dark against the silver grass eddie whispered can they get up here i dont see how levine whispered were almost twenty feet above the ground i think well be fine but you said they can climb trees ssssh this isnt a tree now everybody down and quiet malcolm winced in pain as thorne stretched him out on a table in the second trailer i dont seem to have much luck on these expeditions do i no you dont sarah said just take it easy ian thorne held a flashlight while she cut away malcolms trouser he had a deep gash on his right leg and he had lost a lot of blood she said we have a medical kit thorne said i think theres one outside where we store the bike get it thorne went outside to get it malcolm and harding were alone in the trailer she shone the light into the wound peering closely malcolm said how bad is it it could be worse she said lightly youll survive in fact the wound cut deep almost to the bone somehow it had missed the artery that was lucky but the gash was filthy she saw grease and bits of leaves mashed into the ragged red muscle shed have to clean it out but shed wait for the morphine to take effect first sarah malcolm said i owe you my life never mind ian no no i do ian she said looking at him this sincerity is not like you itll pass he said and smiled a little she knew he must be in pain thorne returned with the medical kit and she filled the syringe tapped out the bubbles and injected it into malcolms shoulder he grunted ow how much did you give me a lot why because i have to clean the wound out ian and youre not going to like it when i do malcolm sighed he turned to thorne its always something isn t it go on sarah do your damnedest levine watched the approaching raptors through the night glasses they moved in a loose group with their characteristic hopping gait he watched hoping to see some organization in the pack some structure some sign of a dominance hierarchy velociraptors were intelligent and it made sense that they would organize themselves hierarchically and that this would appear in their spatial configuration but he could see nothing they were like a band of marauders shapeless hissing and snapping at one another near levine in the high hide eddie and the kids were crouched down eddie had his arms around the kids comforting them the boy especially was panicky the girl seemed to be okay she was calmer levine didnt understand why anyone was afraid they were perfectly secure high up here he watched the approaching pack with academic detachment trying to discern a pattern in their rapid movements there was no doubt they were following the game trail their path exactly matched the paras earlier in the day up from the river then over the slight rise and along the back of the high hide the raptors paid no attention to the hide itself they seemed mostly to interact with each other the animals came around the side of the structure and were about to continue on when the nearest animal paused it fell behind the rest of the pack sniffing the air then it bent over and began to poke its snout through the grass around the bottom of the hide what was it doing levine wondered the solitary raptor growled it continued to root in the grass and then it came up with something in its hand something it held in its clawed fingers levine squinted trying to see it it was a piece of wrapping paper from a candy bar the raptor looked up at the high hide its eyes glowing it stared right at levine and it snarled malcolm you feel okay thorne said better all the time malcolm said he sighed his body relaxed you know theres a reason why people like morphine he said sarah harding adjusted the inflatable plastic splint around malcolms leg she said to thorne how long until the helicopter comes thorne glanced at his watch less than five hours dawn tomorrow for sure yes absolutely harding nodded okay hell be okay im fine malcolm said in a dreamy voice im just sad that the experiment is over and it was such a good experiment too so elegant so unique darwin never knew harding said to thorne im going to clean this out now hold his leg for me more loudly she said what didnt darwin know ian that life is a complex system he said and everything that goes along with that fitness landscapes adaptive walks boolean nets selforganizing behavior poor man ouch what are you doing there just tell us harding said bent over the wound darwin had no idea that life is so unbelievably complex malcolm said nobody realizes it i mean a single fertilized egg has a hundred thousand genes which act in a coordinated way switching on and off at specific times to transform that single cell into a complete living creature that one cell starts to divide but the subsequent cells are different they specialize some are nerve some are gut some are limb each set of cells begins to follow its own program developing interacting eventually there are two hundred and fifty different kinds of cells all developing together at exactly the right time just when the organism needs a circulatory system the heart starts pumping just when hormones are needed the adrenals start to make them week after week this unimaginably complex development proceeds perfectly perfectly its incredible no human activity comes close i mean you ever build a house a house is simple in comparison but even so workmen build the stairs wrong they put the sink in backward the tile man doesnt show up when hes supposed to all kinds of things go wrong and yet the fly that lands on the workmans lunch is perfect ow take it easy sorry she said continuing to clean his wound but the point malcolm said is that this intricate developmental process in the cell is something we can barely describe let alone understand do you realize the limits of our understanding mathematically we can describe two things interacting like two planets in space three things interacting three planets in space well that becomes a problem four or five things interacting we cant really do it and inside the cell theres one hundred thousand things interacting you have to throw up your hands its so complex how is it even possible that life ever happens at all some people think the answer is that living forms organize themselves life creates its own order the way crystallization creates order some people think life crystallizes into being and thats how the complexity is managed because if you didnt know any physical chemistry you could look at a crystal and ask all the same questions youd see those beautiful spars those perfect geometric facets and you could ask whats controlling this process how does the crystal end up so perfectly formed and looking so much like other crystals but it turns out a crystal is just the way molecular forces arrange themselves in solid form no one controls it it happens on its own to ask a lot of questions about a crystal means you dont understand the fundamental nature of the processes that led to its creation so maybe living forms are a kind of crystallization maybe life just happens and maybe like crystals theres a characteristic order to living things that is generated by their interacting elements okay well one of the things that crystals teach us is that order can arise very fast one minute you have a liquid with all the molecules moving randomly the next minute a crystal forms and all the molecules are locked in order right right okay now think of the interaction of life forms on the planet to make an ecosystem thats even more complex than a single animal all the arrangements are very complicated like the yucca plant you know about that tell me the yucca plant depends on a particular moth which gathers pollen into a ball and carries the ball to a different plant not a different flower on the same plant where it rubs the ball on the plant fertilizing it only then does the moth lay its eggs the yucca plant cant survive without the moth the moth cant survive without the plant complex interactions like that make you think maybe behavior is a kind of crystallization too youre speaking metaphorically harding said im talking about all the order in the natural world malcolm said and how perhaps it can emerge fast through crystallization because complex animals can evolve their behavior rapidly changes can occur very quickly human beings are transforming the planet and nobody knows whether its a dangerous development or not so these behavioral processes can happen faster than we usually think evolution occurs in ten thousand years human beings have gone from hunting to farming to cities to cyberspace behavior is screaming forward and it might be nonadaptive nobody knows although personally i think cyberspace means the end of our species yes why is that because it means the end of innovation malcolm said this idea that the whole world is wired together is mass death every biologist knows that small groups in isolation evolve fastest you put a thousand birds on an ocean island and theyll evolve very fast you put ten thousand on a big continent and their evolution slows down now for our own species evolution occurs mostly through our behavior we innovavate new behavior to adapt and everybody on earth knows that innovation only occurs in small groups put three people on a committee and they may get something done ten people and it gets harder thirty people and nothing happens thirty million it becomes impossible thats the effect of mass media it keeps anything from happening mass media swamps diversity it makes every place the same bangkok or tokyo or london theres a mcdonalds on one corner a benneton on another a gap across the street regional differences vanish all differences vanish in a massmedia world theres less of everything except the top ten books records movies ideas people worry about losing species diversity in the rain forest but what about intellectual diversity our most necessary resource thats disappearing faster than trees but we havent figured that out so now were planning to put five billion people together in cyberspace and itll freeze the entire species everything will stop dead in its tracks everyone will think the same thing at the same time global uniformity oh that hurts are you done almost harding said hang on and believe me itll be fast if you map complex systems on a fitness landscape you find the behavior can move so fast that fitness can drop precipitously it doesnt require asteroids or diseases or anything else its just behavior that suddenly emerges and turns out to be fatal to the creatures that do it my idea was that dinosaurs being complex creatures might have undergone some of these behavioral changes and that led to their extinction what all of them it just takes a few malcolm said some dinosaur roots in the swamps around the inland sea changes the water circulation and destroys the plant ecology that twenty other species depend on bang theyre gone that causes still more dislocations a predator dies off and its prey grow unchecked the ecosystem becomes unbalanced more things go wrong more species die and suddenly its over it could have happened that way just behavior yes malcolm said anyway that was the idea and i had this nice thought that we might prove itbut now its finished we have to get out of here you better tell the others thorne clicked on the radio eddie its doc there was no answer eddie the radio crackled and then they heard a noise that at first sounded like static it was a moment before they realized it was a highpitched human scream the high hide the first of the raptors hissed as it began jumping up clattering against the high hide shaking the structure its claws raked against the metal and it fell down again eddie was astonished at how high it jumped the animal could leap eight feet straight up again and again without apparent effort its jumps attracted the other animals which slowly came back to circle the hide soon the hide was surrounded by leaping snarling raptors it swayed back and forth as the animals slammed into it clawed for purchase and fell back again but more ominously levine saw they were learning already some of them had begun to use their clawed forearms to grip the structure holding on while their legs got footing one of the raptors came within a few feet of their little shelter before finally falling back the falls never seemed to hurt the animals they immediately leapt up and jumped again eddie and the kids scrambled to their feet levine said get back dont look out and he pushed the kids into the center of the shelter eddie was bent over his knapsack and held up an incandescent flare he poppcd it and flung it over the side two of the raptors fell away the flare sputtered an the wet ground casting harsh red shadows but the raptors kept coming eddie pulled up one of the aluminum bars from the floor leaned over the side railing brandishing the bar like a club one of the raptors had already climbed high enough to dart forward jaws gaping at eddies neck surprised eddie shouted and jerked his head back the raptor narrowly missed him but its jaws closed on his shirt then the raptor fell back jaws clenched tight and its weight pulled eddie forward over the failing he yelled help me help as he started to topple over the side levine threw his arms around him dragging him back levine looked past eddies shoulder at the raptor which was now dangling in space hissing furiously still gripping the shirt eddie pounded the raptor on the snout with his bar but the raptor held on like a bulldog eddie was bent precariously over the railing he might fall at any moment he jabbed the bar into the animals eye and abruptly the raptor released its grip the two men fell back into the shelter when they got to their feet they saw raptors climbing up the sides of the hide as they appeared at the rail eddie swung at them with the strut knocking them back quick he shouted to the kids up on the roof quick kelly started climbing one of the struts then pushed herself easily up onto the roof arby stood there his expression blank she looked back down and said come on arb the boy was frozen his eyes wide with fear levine ran to help him lifted him up eddie was swinging the strut in wide arcs the metal smacking against the raptors one of the raptors caught the strut in its jaws and jerked it hard eddie lost his balance twisted and fell backward toppling over the side he cried nooo as he fell immediately all the animals dropped down to the ground they heard eddie screaming in the night the raptors snarled levine was terrified he was still holding arby in his arms pushing him up to the roof go on he kept saying go on go on from the roof kelly was saying you can do it arb the boy gripped the roof pulling himself up his legs churning in panic he kicked levine hard in the mouth and levine dropped him he saw the boy slide away and drop backward to the ground oh christ levine said oh christ thorne was underneath the trailer unhooking the cable he released it crawled out and sprinted for the jeep he heard the whirr of a motor and saw that sarah had gotten onto the motorbike and was already racing off a lindstradt rifle slung across her shoulder he got behind the wheel turned on the engine and waited impatiently while the cable winched in the hook sliding across the grass it seemed to take forever now the cable was snaking around the tree he waited he looked over and saw the light from sarahs bike moving off through the foliage heading down toward the high hide at last the winch motor stopped thorne threw the car in gear and roared away from the clearing the radio clicked ian he said dont worry about me malcolm said in a dreamy voice im just fine kelly was lying flat on the angled roof of the shed looking down over the side she saw arby hit the ground on the other side of the structure from eddie he seemed to hit hard but she didnt know what happened to him because she had turned away to grip the wet roof and when she looked back down again arby was gone gone sarah harding drove fast on the muddy jungle road she wasnt sure where she was but she thought by following the terrain downward she would eventually come out onto the plain at least that was her hope she accelerated came around a curve and suddenly saw a big tree blocking the road she braked to a stop spun the bike around and headed back again farther up the road she saw thornes twin headlights turning off to the right she followed his jeep racing her engine in the night levine stood in the center of the high hide frozen with terror the raptors were no longer jumping no longer trying to climb the structure he heard them down on the ground snarling he heard the sharp crunch of bones the boy had never made a sound cold sweat broke out all over his body then he heard arby shout back get back up on the roof kelly twisted around trying to see down on the other side in the dying light of the flare she saw that arby was inside the cage he had managed to close the door and was reaching his hand back through the bars to turn the key in the lock there were three raptors near him they leapt forward when they saw his hand and he pulled it back quickly he shouted get back the raptors began to bite the cage turning their heads sideways to gnaw the bars one of the animals got its lower jaw tangled up in the looped elastic band that hung from the key the raptor pulled its head away stretching the elastic and suddenly the key snapped out of the lock smacking against its neck the raptor squealed in surprise and stepped backward the elastic was now looped tight around the lower jaw the key glinting in the light the raptor scratched at it with its forearms trying to pull the elastic loop off but it was caught around the curved back teeth and the animals efforts just made the elastic snap on the skin soon it gave up and began rubbing its snout in the dirt trying to get the key off meanwhile the other raptors managed to pull the cage free from the superstructure and knock it over onto the ground they ducked their heads slashing arby behind the bars when they realized that wouldnt work they kicked and stomped the cage repeatedly more animals joined them soon seven raptors were clustered over the cage they kicked it and it rolled away from the hide their bodies blocked her view of arby she heard a faint sound and looked up to see two headlights in the distance it was a car someone was coming arb was in hell inside the cage he was surrounded by black snarling shapes the raptors couldnt get their jaws through the spaces in the bars but their hot saliva dripped down on him and when they kicked their claws came through slashing his arms and shoulders as he rolled his body was bruised his head hurt from banging against the bars his world was swirling terrifying pandemonium he knew only one thing with certainty the raptors were rolling him away from the hide as the car came closer levine went to the railing and looked down in the light of the red flare he saw three raptors dragging what remained of eddies body toward the jungle they paused frequently to fight over it snapping at each other but they still managed to haul it away then he saw that another group of raptors were kicking and pushing the cage they rolled it down the game trail and into the forest now he could hear the rumble of the jeep engine as the car came closer he saw thornes silhouette behind the wheel he hoped he had a gun levine wanted to kill every one of these damned animals he wanted to kill them all up on the roof kelly watched the raptors kicking the cage rolling it away one raptor remained behind turning around and around in circles like a frustrated dog then she saw it was the raptor that had caught its jaw in the elastic loop the key still dangled along its check glinting in the red light the raptor jerked its head up and down trying to get free the jeep came roaring forward and the raptor seemed confused by the sudden bright lights thorne accelerated trying to hit it with his car the raptor turned and ran off out into the plain kelly scrambled off the roof and headed down thorne threw open the door as levine jumped into the car they got the kid levine said pointing along the trail kelly was still coming down shouting wait thorne said get back up there sarahs coming well get arby but we cant lose them thorne grinned the engine and started to drive down the game trail chasing the raptors in the trailer ian malcolm listened to the voices shouting over the radio he heard the panic the confusion black noise he thought everything going to hell at once a hundred thousand things interacting he sighed and closed his eyes thorne drove fast the jungle was dense around them the trail ahead began to narrow the big palms edging closer slapping the car he said can we make it its wide enough levine said i walked it earlier today paras use this trail how could this happen thorne said the cage was attached to the scaffolding i dont know levine said it broke off how how i didnt see a lot happened and eddie thorne said grimly it was fast levine said the jeep plunged through the jungle bouncing hard as it followed the game trail they banged their heads on the cloth roof thorne drove recklessly up ahead the raptors were moving fast he could hardly see the last of the animals sprinting in the darkness up ahead they wouldnt listen to me kelly shouted as sarah pulled up on the motorcycle about what the raptor took the key arbys locked in the cage and the raptor took the key where sarah said there she said pointing across the plain in the moonlight they could just see the dark shape of the fleeing raptor we need the key get on sarah said unshouldering her rifle kelly climbed behind her on the bike sarah thrust the gun into her hands can you shoot no i mean i never can you drive a bike no i then you have to shoot sarah said now look triggers here okay safetys here twist it like this okay itll be a rough ride so dont release it until we get close close to what but sarah didnt hear her she grinned the engine and the bike accelerated heading out into the plain chasing the fleeing raptor kelly put one arm around sarah and tried to hold on the jeep bounced along the jungle trail splashing through muddy pools i dont remember it this rough levine said clutching the armhold maybe you should slow down hell no thorne said if we lose sight of him its over we dont know where the raptor nest is and in this jungle at nightah hell up ahead the raptors were leaving the trail running off into the underbrush the cage was gone thorne could not see the terrain very well but it looked like a sheer hill going almost straight down you cant do it levine said its too steep i have to do it thorne said dont be crazy levine said face facts weve lost the kid doe its too bad but weve lost him thorne glared at levine he didnt give up on you he said and were not giving up on him thorne spun the wheel and drove the jeep over the edge the car nosed down sickeningly gained speed and began a steep descent shit levine yelled youll kill us all hang on bouncing they plunged downward into darkness sixth configuration order collapses in simultaneous regions survival is now unlikely for individuals and groups ian malcolm chase the motorcycle raced forward across the grassy plain kelly clutched sarah with one hand and held the rifle with the other the rifle was heavy her arm was getting tired the motorcycle jolted over the terrain the wind blew her hair around her face hold on sarah shouted the moon broke through the clouds and the grass before them w as silver in the moonlight the raptor was forty yards ahead of them the animal just within range of their headlamp they were gaining steadily kelly saw no other animals on the plain except for the apatosaur herd in the far distance they came closer to the raptor the animal ran swiftly its tall stiff barely visible above the grass sarah angled the bike to the right as they came alongside the raptor they moved steadily closer she leaned back her month close to kellys ear get ready she shouted what do i do they were running parallel to the raptor back by its tail sarah accelerated passing the legs moving toward the head the neck she shouted shoot it in the neck where anywhere the neck kelly fumbled with the gun now no wait wait the raptor panicked as the motorcycle approached it increased its speed kelly was trying to find the safety the gun was bouncing everything was bouncing her fingers touched the safety slid off she reached again she was going to have to use two hands and that meant letting go of sarah get ready sarah shouted but i cant now do it now sarah swerved the bike coming alongside the raptor they were now just three feet away kelly could smell the animal it turned its head and snapped at them kelly fired the gun bricked in her hands she grabbed sarah again the raptor kept running what happened you missed kelly shook her head never mind sarah shouted you can do it ill get closer she angled the bike toward the raptor again moving closer but this time was different as they came alongside the raptor abruptly charged them butting at them with its head sarah howled and twisted the bike away widening the gap smart bastards arent they she shouted no second chances the raptor chased them for a moment then suddenly turned changing direction racing away across the plains its going for the river kelly shouted sarah gunned the engine the bike shot forward how deep kelly didnt answer how deep i dont know kelly shouted she was trying to remember how the raptors looked when they crossed the river she seemed to remember they were swimming that meant it must be at least more than three feet sarah said yes no good they were now ten yards behind the raptor and losing ground the animal had entered an area marked with thick benettitalean cycads the rough trunks scratched at them the terrain was uneven the bike botinced and jolted over the bumps cant see sarah shouted hold on she angled left moving away from the raptor heading for the river the animal was disappearing in the grass whatre you doing kelly shouted we have to cut him off shrieking a flock of startled birds rose up in front of them sarah drove through flapping wings and kelly ducked her head the rifle thunked in her hand careful sarah shouted what happened it went off how many shots do i have two more make em good the river was up ahead shimmering in the moonlight they burst out of the grass and came onto the muddy bank sarah turned the motorcycle swerved slipped and the bike shot away kelly fell hitting the cold mud sarah landing hard on top of her immediately sarah jumped up running for the bike shouting come on dazed kelly followed her the rifle in her hands was thick with mud she wondered if it would still work sarah was already on the bike gunning the engine waving her forward kelly jumped on and sarah headed up the riverbank the raptor was twenty yards ahead of them approaching the water its getting away thornes jeep crashed down the hillside out of control palms slapped against the windshield they could see nothing at all but they felt the steepness of the incline the jeep fished sideways levine yelled thorne gripped the steering wheel tried to turn the car back he touched the brake the jeep straightened and continued down the hill there was a gap in the palms he saw a field of black boulders looming directly ahead the raptors were scrambling over the boulders but maybe if he went left no levine shouted no hang on thorne yelled and he twisted the wheel the car lost traction and slid downward they hit the first of the boulders shattering a headlight the car swung up at an angle crashed down again thorne thought that had finished the transmission but somehow the car was still going angling down the hillside moving off to the left the second headlight smashed on a tree branch they continued down in darkness through another layer of palms and then abruptly they banged down on level ground the jeep tires rolled across soft earth thorne brought the car to a stop silence they peered out the windows trying to see where they were but it was so dark it was hard to see anything they seemed to be at the bottom of a deep gully a canopy of trees overhead alluvial contours levine said we must be in a streambed as his eyes adjusted thorne saw he was right the raptors were running down the center of the streambed which was lined with big boulders on both sides but the bed itself was sandy and it was wide enough for the car to pass through he followed them you have any idea where we are levine said staring at the raptors no thorne said the car drove forward the streambed widened opening out into a flat basin the boulders disappeared there were trees on both sides of the river patches of moonlight appeared here and there it was easier to see but the raptors were gone he stopped the car rolled down the window and listened he could hear them hissing and growling the sound seemed to be coming from off to the left thorne put the car in gear and left the streambed in moving off among ferns and occasional pine trees levine said do you suppose the boy survived that hill i dont know thorne said i cant imagine he drove forward slowly they came to a break in the trees and saw a clearing where the ferns had been tram led flat beyond the clearing they saw the banks of the river moonlight glinting on the water somehow they had returned to the river but it was the clearing itself that held their attention within the broad open space they saw the huge pale skeletons of several apatosaurs the giant rib cages arcs of pale bone shone in the silver light the dark hulk of a partially eaten carcass lay on its side in the center clouds of flies buzzing above it in the night what is this place thorne said it looks like graveyard yes levine said but its not the raptors were all clustered to one side fighting over the remains of eddies carcass at the opposite side of the clearing they saw three low mud mounds the walls were broken in many places within the nests they saw crushed fragments of eggshells there was the strong stench of decay levine leaned forward staring this is the raptor nest he said in the darkness of the trailer malcolm sat up wincing he grabbed the radio you found it the nest the radio crackled levine said yes i think so describe it malcolm said levine spoke quietly reporting features estimating dimensions to levine the velociraptor nest appeared slovenly uncared for illmade he was surprised because dinosaur nests usually conveyed an unmistakable sense of order levine had seen it time and again in fossil sites from montana to mongolia the eggs in the nest were arranged in neat concentric circles often there were more than thirty eggs in a single nest suggesting that many females cooperated to share a single mud mound numerous adult fossils would be found nearby indicating that the dinosaurs cared communally for the eggs at a few excavations it was even possible to get a sense of the spatial arrangement with the nests in the center the adults moving carefully around the outside so as not to disturb the incubating eggs in this rigid structure the dinosaurs were reminiscent of their descendants the birds which also displayed precise courtship mating and nestbuilding patterns but the velociraptors behaved differently there was a disorderly chaotic feeling to the scene before him illformed nests quarreling adults very few young and juvenile animals the eggshells crushed the broken mounds stepped on around the mounds levine now saw scattered small bones which he presumed were the remains of newborns he saw no living infants anywhere in the clearing there were three juveniles but these younger animals were forced to fend for themselves and they already showed many scars on their bodies the youngsters looked thin undernourished poking around the periphery of the carcass they were cautious backing away whenever one of the adults snapped at them and what about the apatosaurs malcolm asked what about the carcasses levine counted four all together in various stages of decomposition you have to tell sarah malcolm said but levine was wondering about something else he was wondering how these big carcasses had gotten here in the first place they hadnt died here by accident surely all animals would have avoided this nest they couldnt have been lured here and they were too large to carry so how did they get here something was tickling the back of his mind some obvious thought that he wasnt they brought arby malcolm said yes levine said they did he stared at the nest trying to figure it out then thorne nudged him theres the cage he said pointing at the far side of the clearing lying on the ground partially hidden behind fronds levine saw the glint of aluminum struts but he couldnt see arby way over there levine said the raptors were ignoring the cage still fighting over eddies carcass thorne brought out a lindstradt rifle snapped open the cartridge pack he saw six darts not enough he said and snapped it shut there were at least ten raptors in the clearing levine rummaged in the back seat found his knapsack which had fallen to the floor he unzipped it came out with a small silver cylinder the size of a large softdrink bottle it had a skull and crossbones stenciled on it beneath lettering read caution toxic metacholine mivacuriam whats that thorne said something they cooked up in los alamos levine said its a nonlethal area neutralizer releases a shortacting cholinesterase aerosol paralyzes all life forms for up to three minutes itll knock all the raptors out but what about the boy thorne said you cant use that youll paralyze him levine pointed if we throw the canister to the right of the cage the gasll blow away from him toward the raptors or it may not thorne said and he may be badly injured levine nodded he put the cylinder back in the knapsack then sat facing forward staring at the raptors so levine said what do we do now thorne looked over at the aluminum cage partially blocked by ferns then he saw something that made him sit up the cage moved slightly the bars shifting in the moonlight did you see that levine said thorne said im going to get that kid out of there but how levine said the oldfashioned way thorne said he climbed out of the car sarah accelerated racing the motorcycle up the mud banks of the river the raptor was just ahead cutting diagonally toward them heading for the water go kelly shouted go the raptor saw them and changed course angling farther ahead it was trying to get distance on them but they were moving faster on the open banks they came abreast of the animal flanking it and then sarah left the banks heading back onto the grassy plain the raptor moved right deeper into the plain away from the river you did it kelly shouted sarah maintained her speed moving slowly closer to the raptor it seemed to have given up on the river and now had no plan it was just running up the plain and they were steadily inexorably gaining kelly was excited she tried to wipe the maid off her rifle preparing to shoot again damn sarah shouted what look kelly leaned forward stared past sarahs shoulder directly ahead she saw the herd of apatosaurs they were only fifty yards from the first of the enormous animals which bellowed and wheeled in sudden fear their bodies were greengray in the moonlight the raptor streaked directly toward the herd it thinks its going to lose us sarah gunned the bike moving closer get it now now kelly aimed and fired the gun bucked but the raptor kept going missed up ahead the apatosaurs were turning their big legs stomping the ground their heavy tails whipped through the air but they were too slow to move away the raptor raced forward heading directly beneath the big apatosaurs what do we do kelly shouted no choice sarah yelled she pulled parallel to the raptor just as they passed into shadow racing beneath the first animal kelly glimpsed the curve of the belly hanging three feet above her the legs were as thick as tree trunks stamping and turning the raptor ran on darting among the moving legs sarah swerved followed above them the animals roared and turned and roared again they were beneath another belly then out into moonlight then in shadow again now they were in the middle of the herd it was like being in a forest of moving trees directly ahead a big leg came down with a slam that shook the ground the bike bounced as sarah swung left they scraped against the animals flesh hang on she shouted and swerved again following the raptor above them the apatosaurs were bellowing and moving the raptor dodged and turned and then broke clear racing out the back of the herd shit sarah said spinning the bike around a whiptail swung low narrowly missing them and then they too were free chasing the raptor again the motorcycle raced across the grassy plain last chance sarah shouted do it kelly raised the rifle sarah was driving hard and fast pulling very close to the running raptor the animal turned to butt her but she held her position punched it hard in the head with her fist now kelly shoved the barrel against the flesh of the neck and squeezed the trigger the gun snapped back hard jolting her in the stomach the raptor ran on no she shouted no and then suddenly the raptor fell tumbling end over end in the grass and sarah swung the bike away and pulled to a stop the raptor was five yards away flopping in the grass it snarled and yelped then it was silent sarah took the rifle snapped open the cartridge pack kelly saw five more darts i thought that was the last one she said i lied sarah said wait here kelly stayed by the bike while sarah moved cautiously forward through the grass sarah fired one more shot then stood waiting for a few moments then she bent down when she came back she was holding the key in her hand in the nest the raptors were still tearing at the carcass off to one side but the intensity of the behavior was diminishing some of the animals were turning away rubbing their jaws with their clawed hands drifting slowly toward the center of the clearing moving closer to the cage thorne climbed into the back of the jeep pushing aside the canvas cover he checked the rifle in his hands levine slid into the drivers seat he started the engine thorne steadied himself in the back of the jeep gripped the rear bar he turned to levine go the jeep raced forward across the clearing by the carcass the raptors looked up in surprise as they saw the intruder by then the jeep was past the center of the clearing driving past the enormous dead skeletons the broad ribs high over their heads and then levine was swinging the car left pulling alongside the aluminum cage thorne jumped out and grabbed the cage in both hands in the darkness he couldnt tell how badly arby was hurt the boy was turned face down levine climbed out of the car thorne yelled for him to get back in as he lifted the cage high and swung it onto the back of the jeep thorne jumped into the back next to the cage and levine shoved the car in gear behind them the raptors snarled and raced forward in pursuit running among the skeletal ribs they crossed the clearing with stunning speed as levine stepped on the gas the nearest raptor leapt high landing up on the back of the car and grabbing the canvas tarp in its teeth the animal hissed and held on levine accelerated and the jeep bounced out of the clearing in darkness malcolm sank back into morphine dreams images floated in front of his eyes fitness landscapes the multicolored computer images now employed to think about evolution in this mathematical world of peaks and valleys populations of organisms were seen to climb the fitness peaks or slide down into the valleys of nonadaptation stu kauffman and his coworkers had shown that advanced organisms had complex internal constraints which made them more likely to fall off the fitness optima and descend into the valleys yet at the same time complex creatures were themselves selected by evolution because complex creatures were able to adapt on their own with tools with learning with cooperation but complex animals had obtained their adaptive flexibility at some costthey had traded one dependency for another it was no longer necessary to change their bodies to adapt because now their adaptation was behavior socially determined that behavior required learning in a sense among higher animals adaptive fitness was no longer transmitted to the next generation by dna at all it was now carried by teaching chimpanzees taught their young to collect termites with a stick such actions implied at least the rudiments of a culture a structured social life but animals raised in isolation without parents without guidance were not fully functional zoo animals frequently could not care for their offspring because they had never seen it done they would ignore their infants or roll over and crush them or simply become annoyed with them and kill them the velociraptors were among the most intelligent dinosaurs and the most ferocious both traits demanded behavioral control millions of years ago in the nowvanished jurassic world their behavior would have been socially determined passed on from older to younger animals genes controlled the capacity to make such patterns but not the patterns themselves adaptive behavior was a kind of morality it was behavior that had evolved over many generations because it was found to succeed behavior that allowed members of the species to cooperate to live together to hunt to raise young but on this island the velociraptors had been recreated in a genetics laboratory although their physical bodies were genetically determined their behavior was not these newly created raptors came into the world with no older animals to guide them to show them proper raptor behavior they were on their own and that was just how they behaved in a society without structure without rules without cooperation they lived in an uncontrolled everycreatureforhimself world where the meanest and the nastiest survived and all the others died the jeep picked up speed bouncing hard thorne held on to the bars to keep from being thrown out behind him he saw the raptor swinging back and forth in the air still clinging to the tarp it wasnt letting go levine drove back onto the flat muddy banks of the river and turned right following the edge of the water the raptor hung on tenaciously directly ahead lying in the mud levine saw another skeleton another skeleton why were all these skeletons here but there was no time to think he drove forward passing beneath the row of ribs without lights he leaned forward and squinted in the moonlight looking for obstacles ahead in the back of the car the raptor scrambled up released the tarp clamped its jaws on the cage and began to pull it out of the back of the jeep thorne lunged grabbed the end of the cage nearest him the cage twisted rolling thorne onto his back he found himself in a tug of war with the raptor and the raptor was winning thorne locked his legs around the front passenger seat trying to hold on the raptor snarled thorne sensed the sheer fury of the animal enraged that it might lose its prize here levine shouted holding a gun out to thorne thorne was on his back gripping the cage in both hands he couldnt take the gun levine looked back and saw the situation he looked in the rearview mirror behind them he saw the rest of the pack still in pursuit snarling and growling he could not slow down thorne could not let go of the cage still driving fast levine swung around in the passenger seat and aimed the rifle backward he tried to maneuver the gun knowing what would happen if he accidentally shot thorne or arby watch it thorne was shouting watch it levine managed to get the safety off and swung the barrel straight at the raptor which was still gripping the cage bars in its jaws the animal looked up and in a quick movement closed its jaws over the barrel it tugged at the gun levine fired the raptors eyes popped wide as the dart slammed into the back of its throat it made a gurgling sound then went into convulsions toppling backward out of the jeep and yanking the gun from levines hands as it fell thorne scrambled to his knees and pulled the cage inside the car he looked down inside it but he couldnt tell about arby looking back he saw the other raptors were still pursuing but they were now twenty yards back and losing ground on the dashboard the radio hissed doc thorne recognized sarahs voice yes sarah where are you following the river thorne said the storm clouds had now cleared and it was a bright moonlit night behind him the raptors still continued to chase the jeep but they were now failing steadily behind i cant see your lights sarah said dont have any there was a pause the radio crackled her voice was tense what about arby we have him thorne said thank god how is he i dont know alive the landscape opened out they came back into a broad valley the grass silvery in the moonlight thorne looked around trying to orient himself then he realized they were back on the plain but much farther to the south they must still be on the same side of the river as the high hide in that case they ought to be able to make their way up onto the ridge road somewhere to the left that road would lead them back to the clearing and the remaining trailer and safety he nudged levine pointed to the right go there levine turned the car thorne clicked the radio sarah yes doc were going back to the trailer on the ridge road okay sarah said well find you sarah looked back at kelly wheres the ridge road i think its that one up there kelly said pointing to the spine of the ridge on the cliffs high above them okay sarah said she gunned the bike forward the jeep rumbled across the plain deep in silvery grass they were moving fast the raptors were no longer visible behind them looks like we lost them thorne said maybe levine said when he had pulled out of the streambed he had seen several animals dart off to the left they would now be hidden in the grass he wasnt sure they would give up so easily the jeep was roaring toward the cliffs directly ahead he saw a curving switchback road running up from the valley floor that was the ridge road he felt sure now that the terrain was smoother thorne crawled back between the seats and crouched over the cage he peered in through the bars at arby who was groaning softly half the boys face was slick with blood and his shirt was soaked but his eyes were open and he seemed to be moving his arms and legs thorne leaned close to the bars hey son he said gently can you hear me arby nodded moaning how you doing there been better arby said the jeep ground onto the dirt road and headed upward along the switchbacks levine felt a sense of relief as they moved higher away from the valley he was finally on the ridge road and he was going to be safe he looked up toward the crest and then he saw the dark shapes in the moonlight already at the top of the road hopping up and down raptors waiting for him he pulled to a stop what do we do now move over thorne said grimly ill take it from here at the edge of chaos thorne came up onto the ridge and turned left accelerating the road stretched ahead in the moonlight a narrow strip running between a rock wall to his left and a sheer cliff falling away on the right twenty feet above him on the ridge he saw the raptors leaping and snorting as they ran parallel to the jeep levine saw them too what are we going to do he said thorne shook his head look in the too kit look in the glove compartment get anything you can find levine bent over fumbling in darkness but thorne knew they were in trouble their gun was gone they were in a jeep with a cloth top and the raptors were all around them he guessed he was probably about half a mile from the clearing and the trailer half a mile to go thorne slowed as he came into the next curve moving the car away from the plunging drop of the cliff rounding the curve he saw a raptor crouched in the middle of the road facing them its head lowered menacingly thorne accelerated toward it the raptor leapt up in the air legs raised high it landed on the hood of the car claws squealing as they raked metal it smashed against the windshield the glass streaking spiderwebs with the animals body lying against the windshield thorne couldnt see anything on this dangerous road he slammed on the brakes hey levine shouted tumbling forward the raptor on the hood slid off to the side now thorne could see again and he stamped on the gas levine fell back again as the car moved forward but three raptors were charging the car from the side one jumped onto the running board and locked its jaws on the side mirror the animals glaring eye was close to thornes face he swung the wheel left scraping the car along the rocky face of the road ten yards ahead a boulder protruded he glanced at the raptor which continued to hold on tenaciously right to the moment when the boulder smashed into the side mirror tearing it away the raptor was gone the road widened a little thorne had more room to maneuver now he felt a heavy thump and looked up to see the canvas top sagging above his head claws slashed down by his ear ripping through the canvas he swung the car right then left again the claws pulled out but the animal was still up there its body still indenting the cloth beside him levine produced a big hunting knife and thrust it upward through the cloth immediately another claw raked downward slashing levines hand he yelled in pain dropping the knife thorne bent over reaching down to the floor for it in the rearview mirror he saw two more raptors in the road behind him chasing the jeep they were gaining on him but the road was broader now and he accelerated the raptor on the roof peered over the top looking in through the broken windshield thorne held the knife in his fist and jabbed it straight up with full force again and again it didnt seem to make any difference as the road curved he jerked the wheel right then back the whole jeep tilting and the raptor on the roof lost its grip and rolled backward off the top it tore most of the canvas roof away as it went the animal bounced on the ground and hit the two pursuing raptors the impact knocked all three over the side they fell snarling down the cliff face that does it levine shouted but a moment later another raptor jumped down from the cliff and ran forward only a few feet from the jeep and lightly almost easily the raptor leapt up into the back of the jeep in the passenger seat levine stared the raptor was fully inside the jeep its head low arms up jaws wide in an unmistakable posture the raptor hissed at him levine thought its all over he was shocked his entire body broke out in sweat be felt dizzy and he realized in a single instant there was nothing he could do that he was moments from death the creature hissed again snapping its jaws crouching to lunge and then suddenly white foam appeared at the corners of its mouth and its eyes rolled back foam bubbled out of its jaws it began to twitch its body going into spasms it fell over on its side in the back of the car behind them he now saw sarah on the motorcycle and kelly holding the rifle thorne slowed and sarah pulled alongside them she handed the key to levine for the cage she shouted levine took it numbly almost dropped it he was in shock moving slowly dumbly i nearly died he thought get her gun thorne said levine looked off to the left where more raptors were still racing along parallel to the car he counted six but there were probably more he tried to count again his mind working slowly get the damned gun levine took the gun from kelly feeling the cold metal of the barrel in his hands but now the car sputtered the engine coughing dying then coughing again jerking forward whats that he said turning to thorne trouble thorne said were out of gas thorne popped the car into neutral and it rolled forward losing speed ahead was a slight rise and beyond that across a curve he could see the road sloped down again sarah was on the motorcycle behind them shaking her head thorne realized his only hope was to make it over the rise he said to levine unlock the cage get him out of there levine was suddenly moving quickly almost panicky but crawled back and got the key in the lock the cage creaked open he helped arby out thorne watched the speedometer as the needle fell they were going twentyfive miles an hourthen twentythen fifteen the raptors running alongside began to move closer sensing the car was in trouble fifteen miles an hour still falling hes out levine said from the back he clanged the cage shut push the cage off thorne said the cage rolled off the back bouncing down the hill ten miles an hour the car seemed to be creeping and then they were over the rise moving down the other side gaining speed again twelve miles an hour fifteen twenty he careened around the curves trying not to touch the brakes levine said well never make it to the trailer he was screaming at the top of his lungs eyes wide with fear i know thorne could see the trailer off to the left but separated from them by a gentle rise in the road they could not get there but up ahead the road forked sloping down to the right toward the laboratory and if he remembered correctly that road was all downhill thorne turned right away from the trailer he saw the big roof of the laboratory a flat expanse in the moonlight he followed the road past the laboratory down around the back toward the worker village he saw the managers house to the right and the convenience store with the gas pumps in front was there a chance they might still have gasoline look levine said pointing behind them look look thorne glanced over his shoulder and saw that the raptors were dropping back giving up the chase in the vicinity of the laboratory they seemed to hesitate theyre not following us any more levine shouted yeah thorne said but wheres sarah behind them sarahs motorcycle was nowhere to be seen trailer sarah harding twisted the handlebars and the motorcycle shot forward over the low rise in the road ahead she crested and came down again heading toward the trailer behind her four raptors snarled in pursuit she accelerated trying to get ahead of them to gain precious yards because they were going to need it she leaned back and shouted to kelly okay this has to be fast what kelly shouted when we get to the trailer you jump off and run in dont wait for me understand kelly nodded tensely whatever happens dont wait for me okay harding roared up to the trailer braked hard the bike skidded on the wet grass banged into the metal siding but kelly was already leaping off scrambling up toward the door going into the trailer sarah had wanted to get the bike inside but she saw the raptors were very close too close she pushed the bike toward them and in a single motion stepped up and threw herself through the trailer door landing on her back on the floor she twisted her body around and kicked the door shut with her legs just as the first of the raptors slammed against it inside the dark trailer she held the door shut as the animals pounded it repeatedly she felt for a lock on the door but couldnt find one ian does this door lock she heard malcolms voice dreamy in the darkness life is a crystal he said ian try and pay attention then kelly was alongside her hands moving up and down the raptors thumped against the door after a moment she said its down here by the floor harding heard a metallic click and stepped away kelly reached out took her hand the raptors were pounding and snarling outside itll be okay harding said reassuringly she went over to malcolm still lying on the bed the raptors snapped and lunged at the window near his head their claws raking the glass malcolm watched them calmly noisy bastards arent they by his side the firstaid kit was open a syringe on the cushion he had probably injected himself again through the windows the animals stopped throwing themselves against the glass she heard the sound of scraping metal from over by the door and then saw that the raptors were dragging the motorbike away from the trailer they were hopping up and down on it in fairy it wouldnt be long before they punctured the tires ian she said we have to do this fast im in no rush he said calmly she said what kind of weapons have you got here weaponsohi dont know he sighed what do you want weapons for ian please youre talking so fast he said you know sarah you really ought to try to relax in the darkened trailer kell was frightened but she was reassured at the nononsense way sarah talked about weapons and kelly was beginning to see that sarah didnt let anything stop her she just went and did it this whole attitude of not letting other people stop you of believing that you could do what you wanted was something she found herself imitating kelly listened to dr malcolms voice and knew that he would be of no help he was on drugs and he didnt care and sarah didnt know her way around the trailer kelly did she had searched the trailer earlier looking for food and she seemed to remember in the darkness she pulled open the drawers quickly she squinted trying to see she was sure she remembered one drawer low down had contained a pack marked with a skull and crossbones that pack might have some kind of weapons she thought she heard sarah say ian try and think and she heard dr malcolm say oh i have been sarah ive had the most wonderful thoughts you know all those carcasses at the raptor site present a wonderful example of not now ian kelly went through the drawers leaving them open so she would know which ones she had already checked she moved down the trailer and then her hand touched rough canvas she leaned forward yes this was it kelly pulled out a square canvas pack that was surprisingly heavy she said sarah look sarah harding took the pack to the window where moonlight shone in she unzipped the pack and stared at the contents the pack was divided into padded sections she saw three square blocks made of some substance that felt rubbery and there was a small silver cylinder like a small oxygen bottle what is all this stuff we thought it was a good idea malcolm said but now im not sure it was the thing is that what is it she said interrupting she had to keep him focused his mind was drifting nonlethals malcolm said alexanders ragtime band we wanted to have whats this she said holding up one of the blocks in front of his face areadispersal smoke cube what you do is just smoke she said it just makes smoke yes but whats this she said raising the silver cylinder it had writing on it cholinesterase bomb releases gas produces shortterm paralysis when it goes off or so they say how short a few minutes i think but how does it work she said turning it in her hand there was a cap at the end with a locking pin she started to pull it off to get a look at the mechanism dont he said thats how you do it you pull the pin and throw goes off in three seconds okay she said hastily she packed up the medical kit throwing the syringe inside shutting the lid what are you doing malcolm said alarmed were getting out of here she said as she moved to the door malcolm sighed its so nice to have a man around the house he said the cylinder sailed high through the air tumbling in the moonlight the raptors were about five yards away clustered around the bike one of the animals looked up and saw the cylinder which landed in the grass a few yards away sarah stood by the door waiting nothing happened no explosion nothing ian it didnt work curious one raptor hopped over toward where the cylinder had landed in the grass it ducked down and when it raised its head it held the cylinder glinting in its jaws she sighed it didnt work oh never mind malcolm said calmly the raptor shook its head biting into the cylinder what do we do now kelly said there was a loud explosion and a cloud of dense white smoke blasted outward across the clearing the raptors disappeared in the cloud harding closed the door quickly now what kelly said with malcolm leaning on her shoulder they moved across the clearing in the night the gas cloud had dissipated several minutes before the first raptor they found in the grass was lying on its side eyes open absolutely motionless but it wasnt dead harding could see the steady pulse in the neck the animal was merely paralyzed she said to malcolm how long will it last have no idea malcolm said much wind theres no wind ian then it should last a bit they moved forward now the raptors lay all around them they stepped around the bodies smelling the rotten odor of carnivores one of the animals lay across the bike she eased malcolm down to the ground where he sat sighing after a moment he began to sing i wish in the land of cotton old times there are not forgotten look away harding tugged at the motorcycle handlebars trying to pull the bike from beneath the raptor the animal was too heavy kelly said let me and reached for the handlebars harding went forward without hesitating she bent over and put her arms around the raptors neck and pulled the head upward she felt a wave of revulsion hot scaly skin scraped her arms and cheek she grunted as she leaned back raising the animal in dixie landduhduhduhduhto live and die in dixie she said to kelly got it not yet kelly said pulling on the handlebars hardings face was inches from the velociraptors head and laws the head flopped back and forth as she adjusted her grip close to her face the open eye stared at her unseeing harding tugged trying to lift the animal higher almost kelly said harding groaned lifting the eye blinked frightened harding dropped the animal kelly pulled the bike away got it away awayaway down southin dixie harding came around the raptor now the big leg twitched the chest began to move lets go she said ian behind me kelly on the handlebars awayawayaway down south lets go harding said climbing on the bike she kept her eyes on the raptor the head gave a convulsive jerk the eye blinked again it was definitely waking up lets go lets go lets go village sarah drove the motorcycle down the hill toward the worker village looking past kelly sarah saw the jeep parked at the store not far from the gas pumps she braked to a stop and they all climbed off in the moonlight kelly opened the door to the store and helped malcolm inside sarah rolled the motorcycle into the store and closed the door doc she said were over here thorne said with arby by the moonlight filtering in through the windows she could see the store looked very much like an abandoned roadside convenience stand there was a glasswalled refrigerator of soft drinks the cans obscured by mold on the glass a wire rack nearby held candy bars and twinkies the wrappers speckled green crawling with larvae in the adjacent magazine rack the pages were curled the headlines five years old to one side were rows of basic supplies toothpaste aspirin suntan lotion shampoo combs and brushes alongside this were racks of clothing tee shirts and shorts socks tennis rackets bathing suits and a few souvenirs key chains ashtrays and drinking glasses in the center of the room was a little island with a computer cash register a microwave and a coffee maker the microwave door hung wide some animal had made a nest inside the coffee maker was cracked and laced with cobwebs what a mess malcolm said looks fine to me sarah harding said the windows were all barred the walls seemed solid enough the canned goods would still be edible she saw a sign that said restrooms so maybe there was plumbing too they should be safe here at least for a while she helped malcolm to lie down on the floor then she went over to where thorne and levine were working on arby i brought the firstaid kit she said how is he pretty bruised thorne said some gashes but nothing broken head looks bad everything hurts arby said even my mouth somebody see if theres a light she said let me look arby okay youre missing a couple of teeth thats why but that can be fixed the cut on your head isnt so bad she swabbed it clean with gauze turned to thorne how long until the helicopter comes thorne looked at his watch two hours and where does it land the pad is several miles from here working on arby she nodded okay so we have two hours to get to the pad kelly said how can we do that the cars out of gas dont worry sarah said well figure something out its going to be fine you always say that kelly said because its always true sarah said okay arby i need you to help now im going to sit you up and get your shirt off thorne moved off to one side with levine levine was wildeyed his body moving in a twitchy way the drive in the jeep seemed to have finished him off what is she talking about he said were trapped here trapped there was hysteria in his voice we cant go anywhere we cant do anything im telling you were all going to d keep it down thorne said grabbing his arm leaning close dont upset the kids what difference does it make levine said theyre going to find out sooner or ow take it easy thorne was squeezing his arm hard he leaned close to levine youre too old to act like an asshole he said quietly now pull yourself together richard are you listening to me richard levine nodded good now richard im going to go outside and see if the pumps work they cant possibly work levine said not after five years im telling you its a waste of richard thorne said we have to check the pumps there was a pause the two men looked at each other you mean youre going outside levine said yes levine frowned another pause crouched over arby sarah said where are the lights guys just a minute thorne said to her he leaned close to levine okay okay levine said taking a breath thorne went to the front door opened it and stepped out into darkness levine closed the door behind him thorne heard a click as the door locked he immediately turned and rapped softly levine opened the door a few inches peering out for christs sake thorne whispered dont lock it but i just thought dont lock the damn door okay okay im sorry for christs sake thorne said he closed the door again and turned to face the night around him the worker village was silent he heard only the steady drone of cicadas in the darkness it seemed almost too quiet he thought but perhaps it was just the contrast from the snarling raptors thorne stood with his back to the door for a long time staring out at the clearing he saw nothing finally he walked over to the jeep opened the side door and fumbled in the dark for the radio ills hand touched it it had slid under the passenger seat he pulled it out and carried it back to the store knocked on the door levine opened it said its not lock here thorne handed him the radio closed the door again again he paused watching around him the compound was silent the moon was full the air was still he moved forward and peered closely at the gas pumps the handle of the nearest one was rusted and draped with spiderwebs he pulled the nozzle up and flicked the latch nothing happened he squeezed the nozzle handle no liquid came out he tapped the glass window on the pump that showed the number of gallons and the glass fell out in his hand inside a spider scurried across the metal numerals there was no gas they had to find gas or theyd never get to the helicopter he frowned at the pumps thinking they were simple the kind of very reliable pumps you found at a remote construction site and that made sense because after all this was an island he paused this was an island that meant everything came in by plane or boat most times probably by boat small boats where supplies were offloaded by hand which meant he bent over examining the base of the pump in the moonlight just as he thought there were no buried gas tanks he saw a thick black pvc pipe running at an angle just tinder the ground he could see the direction the pipe was going around the side of the store thorne followed it moving cautiously in the moonlight he paused for a moment to listen then moved on he came around to the side and saw just what he expected to see fiftygallon metal drums ranged along the side wall there were three of them connected by a series of black hoses that made sense all the gasoline on the island would have had to come here in drums he tapped the drums softly with a knuckle they were hollow he lifted one hoping to hear the slosh of liquid at the bottom they needed only a gallon or two nothing the drums were empty but surely he thought there must be more than three drums he did a quick calculation in his head a lab this large would have had a halfdozen support vehicles maybe more even if they were fuelefficient theyd burn thirty or forty gallons a week to be safe the company would have stored at least two months supply perhaps six months supply that meant ten to thirty drums and steel drums were heavy so they probably stored them close by probably just a few yards he turned slowly looking the moonlight was bright and he could see well beyond the store there was an open space and then clumps of tall rhododendron bushes which bad overgrown the path leading to the tennis court above the bushes the chainlink fence was laced with creeping vines to the left was the first of the worker cottages he could see only the dark roof to the right of the court nearer the store there was thick foliage although he saw a gap a path he moved forward leaving the store behind approaching the dark gap in the bushes he saw a vertical line and realized it was the edge of an open wooden door there was a shed back in the foliage the other door was closed as he came closer he saw a rusted metal sign with flaking red lettering the letters were black in the moonlight precaucion non fumare inflammable he paused listening he heard the raptors snarling in the distance but they seemed far away back up on the hill for some reason they still had not approached the village thorne waited heart pounding staring forward at the dark entrance to the shed at last he decided it wasnt going to get any easier they needed gas he moved forward the path to the shed was wet from the nights rain but the shed was dry inside his eyes adjusted it was a small place perhaps twelve by twelve in the dim light he saw a dozen rusted drums standing on end three or four more on their sides thorne touched them all quickly one after another they were light empty every one empty feeling defeated thorne moved back toward the entrance to the shed he paused for a moment staring out at the moonlit night and then as he waited he heard the unmistakable sound of breathing inside the store levine moved from window to window trying to follow thornes progress his body was jumpy with tension what was thorne doing he had gone so far from the store it was very unwise levine kept glancing at the front door wishing he could lock it he felt so unsafe with the door unlocked now thorne had gone off into the bushes disappearing entirely from view and he had been gone a long time at least a minute or two levine stared out the window and bit his lip he heard the distant snarl of the raptors and realized that they had remained up at the entrance to the laboratory they hadnt followed the vehicles down even now why not he wondered the question was welcome in his mind calming almost soothing a question to answer why had the raptors stayed up at the laboratory all kinds of explanations occurred to him the raptors had an atavistic fear of the laboratory the place of their birth they remembered the cages and didnt want to be captured again but he suspected the most likely explanation was also the simplest that the area around the laboratory was some other animals territory it was scentmarked and demarcated and defended and the raptors were reluctant to enter it even the tyrannosaur he remembered now had gone through the territory quickly without stopping but whose territory levine stared out the window impatiently as he waited what about the lights sarah called from across the room i need light here in a minute levine said at the entrance to the shed thorne stood silently listening he heard soft snorting exhalations like a quiet horse a large animal waiting the sound was coming from somewhere to his right thorne looked over slowly he saw nothing at all moonlight shone brightly over the worker village he saw the store the gas pumps the dark shape of the jeep looking to his right he saw an open space and clijmps of rhododendron bushes the tennis court beyond nothing else he stared listening hard the soft snorting continued hardly louder than a faint breeze but there was no breeze the trees and bushes were not moving or were they thorne had the sense that something was wrong something right before his eyes something that he could see but couldnt see with the effort of staring he began to think his eyes were playing tricks on him he thought he detected a slight movement in the bushes to the tight the pattern of the leaves seemed to shift in the moonlight shift and stabilize again but he wasnt sure thorne stared forward straining and as he looked he began to think that it wasnt the bushes that had caught his eye but rather the chainlink fence for most of its length the fence was overgrown with an irregular tangle of vines but in a few places the regular diamond pattern of links was visible and there was something strange about that pattern the fence seemed to be moving rippling thorne watched carefully maybe it is moving he thought maybe theres an animal inside the fence pushing against it making it move but that didnt seem quite right it was something else suddenly lights came on inside the store they shone through the barred windows casting a geometric pattern of dark shadows across the open clearing and onto the bushes by the tennis court and for a moment just a rnoment thorne saw that the bushes beside the tennis court were oddly shaped and that they were actually two dinosaurs seven feet tall standing side by side staring right at him their bodies seemed to be covered in a patchwork pattern of light and dark that made them blend in perfectly with leaves behind them and ith the fence of the tennis court thorne was confused their concealment had been perfect too perfect until the lights from the store windows had shone out and caught them in the sudden bright glare thorne watched holding his breath and then he realized that the leafy lightanddark pattern went only partway up their bodies to midthorax above that the animals had a kind of diamondshaped crisscross pattern that matched the fence and as thorne stared the complex patterns on their bodies faded the animals turned a chalky white and then a series of vertical striped shadows began to appear which exactly matched the shadows cast by the windows and before his eyes the two dinosaurs disappeared from view again squinting with concentrated effort he could just barely distinguish the outlines of their bodies he would never have been able to see them at all had he not already known they were there they were chameleons but with a power of mimicry unlike any chameleon thorne had ever seen slowly he backed away into the shed moving deeper into darkness my god levine exclaimed staring out the window sorry harding said but i had to turn on the lights that boy needs help i cant do it in the dark levine did not answer her he was staring out the window trying to comprehend what he had just seen he now realized what he had glimpsed the day diego was killed that brief momentary sense that something was wrong levine now knew what it was but it was quite beyond anything that was known among terrestrial animals and what is it she said standing alongside him at the window is it thorne look levine said she stared out through the bars at the bushes what what am i supposed to look he said she watched for a moment longer then shook her head im sorry start at the bottom of the bushes levine told her then let your eyes move up very slowlyjust lookand youll see the outline he heard her sigh im sorry then turn out the lights again he said and youll see she turned the lights out and for a moment levine saw the two animals in sharp relief their bodies pale white with vertical stripes in the moonlight almost immediately the pattern started to fade harding came back pushed in alongside him and this time she saw the animals instantly just as levine knew she would no shit she said there are two of them yes side by side andis the pattern fading yes its fading as they watched the striped pattern on their skins was replaced by the leafy pattern of the rhododendrons behind them once again the two dinosaurs blended into invisibility but such complex patterning implied that their epidermal layers were arranged in a manner similar to the chromatophores of marine invertebrates the subtlety of shading the rapidity of the changes all suggested harding frowned what are they she asked chameleons of unparalleled skill obviously although im not sure one is entirely justified in referring to them as chameleons since technically chameleons have only the ability what are they sarah said impatiently actually id say theyre carnotaurus sastrei type specimens from patagonia two meters in height with distinctive heads you notice the short bulldog snouts and the pair of large horns above the eyes almost like wings theyre carnivores yes of course they have the wheres thorne he went into that clump of bushes to the right some time ago i havent seen him but what do we do she said do levine said im not sure i follow you we have to do something she said speaking slowly as if he were a child we have to help thorne get back i dont know how levine said those animals must weigh five hundred pounds each and there are two of them i told him not to go out in the first place but now harding frowned staring out she said go turn the lights back on id prefer to go turn the lights back on levine got up irritably he had been relishing his remarkable discovery a truly unanticipated feature of dinosaurs although not of course entirely without precedent among related vertebrates and now this little musclebound female was barking orders at him levine was offended after all she was riot much of a scientist she was a naturalist a field devoid of theory one of those people who poked around in animal crap and imagined they were doing original research a nice outdoor life is all it amounted to it wasnt science by any stretch on harding shouted looking out the window he flicked the lights on and started to head back to the window hastily he went back and turned them off on he turned them on again she got up from the window and crossed the roomthey didn t like that she said it bothered them well theres probably a refractory period yeah i think so here open these she scooped up a handful of flashlights from one of the shelves handed them to him then went and got batteries from an adjacent wire rack i hope these still work what are you going to do levine said we she said grimly we thorne stood in the darkness of the shed staring outward through the open doors someone had been turning the lights on and off inside the store then for a while they remained on but now suddenly they went off again the area in front of the shed was lit only by moonlight he heard movement a soft rustling he heard the breathing again and then he saw the two dinosaurs walking upright with stiff tails their skin patterns seemed to shift as they walked and it was difficult to follow them but they were moving toward the shed they arrived at the entrance their bodies silhouetted against the moonlight beyond their outlines finally clear they looked like small tyrannosaurs except they had protuberances above the eyes and they had very small stubby forelimbs the carnivores ducked their squarish heads down and looked into the shed cautiously snorting sniffing their tails swinging slowly behind them they were really too big to come inside and for a moment he hoped that they would not then the first of them lowered its head growled and stepped through the entrance thorne held his breath he was trying to think what to do but he couldnt think of anything at all the animals were methodical the first one moving aside so the second could enter as well suddenly from along the side of the store a halfdozen glaring lights shone out in bright beams the lights moved splashed on the dinosaurs bodies the beams began to move back and forth in slow erratic patterns like searchlights the dinosaurs were clearly visible and they didnt like it they growled and tried to step away from the lights but the beams moved continuously searching them out crisscrossing over their bodies as the lights passed over their torsos the skin paled in response reproducing the movement of the beams after the lights had moved on their bodies streaking white fading to dark streaking white again the lights never stopped moving except when they shone into the faces of the dinosaurs and into their eyes the big eyes blinked beneath their hooded wings the animals twitched their heads and ducked away as if annoyed by flies the dinosaurs became agitated they turned backing out of the shed and bellowed loudly at the moving lights still the lights moved relentlessly swinging back and forth in the night the pattern of movement was complex confusing the dinosaurs bellowed again and took a menacing step toward the lights but it was halfhearted they clearly didnt like being around these moving sources after a moment they shuffled off the lights following them driving them away past the tennis courts thorne moved forward he heard harding say doc better get out of there before they decide to come back thorne moved quickly toward the lights he found himself standing beside levine and harding they were swinging fistfuls of flashlights back and forth they all went back to the store inside levine slammed the door shut and sagged back against it i was never so frightened in my entire life richard harding said coldly get a grip on yourself she crossed the room and placed the flashlights on the counter going out there was insane levine said wiping his forehead he was drenched in sweat his shirt stained dark actually it was a slam dunk harding said she turned to thorne you could see they had a refractory period for skin response its fast compared to say an octopus but its still there my assumption was that those dinosaurs were like all animals that rely on camouflage theyre basically ambushers theyre not particularly fast or active they stand motionless for hours in an unchanging environment disappearing into the background and they wait until some unsuspecting meal comes along but if they have to keep adjusting to new light conditions they know they cant hide they get anxious and if they get anxious enough they finally just run away which is what happened levine turned and glared angrily at thorne this was all your fault if you hadnt gone out there that way just wandering off richard harding said cutting him off we need gas or well never get out of here dont you want to get out of here levine said nothing he sulked well thorne said there wasnt any gas in the shed anyway hey everybody sarah said look whos here arby came forward leaning on kelly he had changed into clothes from the store a pair of swimming trunks and a tee shirt that said ingen bioengineering labs and beneath we make the future arby had a black eye a swollen cheekbone and a cut that harding had bandaged on his forehead his arms and legs were badly bruised but he was walking and he managed a crooked smile thorne said how do you feel son arby said you know what i want more than anything right now what thorne said diet coke arby said and a lot of aspirin sarah bent over malcolm he was humming softly staring upward how is arby he asked hell be okay does he need any morphine malcolm asked no i dont think so good malcolm said he stretched out his arm rolling up the sleeve thorne cleaned the nest out of the microwave and heated up some canned beef stew he found a package of paper plates decorated in a halloween motif pumpkins and bats and spooned the food onto the plates the two kids ate hungrily he gave a plate to sarah then turned to levine what about you levine was staring out the window no thorne shrugged arby came over holding his plate is there any more sure thorne said he gave him his own plate levine went over and sat with malcolm levine said well at least we were right about one thing this island was a true lost world a pristine untouched ecology we were right from the beginning malcolm looked over and raised his head are you joking he said what about all the dead apatosaurs ive been thinking about that levine said the raptors killed them obviously and then the raptors did what malcolm said dragged them to their nest those animals weigh hundreds of tons richard a hundred raptors couldnt drag them no no he sighed the carcasses must have floated to a bend in the river where they beached the raptors made their nest at a source of convenient food supply dead apatosaurs well possibly but why so many dead apatosaurs richard why do none of the animals attain adulthood and why are there so many predators on the island well we need more data of course levine began no we dont malcolm said didnt you go through the lab we already know the answer what is it levine said irritably prions malcolm said closing his eyes levine frowned whatre prions malcolm sighed ian levine said what are prions go away malcolm said waving his hand arby was curled up in a cornet near sleep thorne rolled up a tee shirt and put it under the boys head arby mumbled something and smiled in a few moments he began to snore thorne got up and went over to sarah who was standing by the window outside the sky was beginning to lighten above the trees turning pale blue how much time now she said thorne looked at his watch maybe an hour she started to pace weve got to get gas she said if we have gas we can drive the jeep to the helicopter site but theres no gas thorne said there must be some somewhere she continued to pace you tried the pumps yes theyre dry what about inside the lab i dont think so where else what about the trailer thorne shook his head its just a passive towtrailer the other unit has an auxiliary generator and some gas tanks but it went over the cliff maybe the tanks didnt rupture when it fell we still have the motorcycle maybe i can go out there and sarah he said its worth a try sarah from the window levine said softly heads up we have visitors good mother in the predawn light the dinosaurs came out of the bushes and went directly toward the jeep there were six of them big brown duckbills fifteen feet high with curving snouts maiasaurs levine said i didnt know there were any here what are they doing the huge animals clustered around the jeep and immediately began to tear it apart one ripped away the canvas top another poked at the roll bar rocking the vehicle back and forth i dont understand levine said theyre hadrosaurs herbivores this aggressiveness is quite uncharacteristic uhhuh thorne said as they watched the maiasaurs tipped the jeep over the vehicle crashed over on its side one of the adults reared up and stood on the side panels its huge feet crushed the vehicle inward but when the jeep fell over two white styrofoam cases tumbled out onto the ground the maiasaurs seemed to be focused on these cases they nipped at the styrofoam tossing chunks of white around the ground they moved hurriedly in a kind of frenzy something to eat levine said some kind of dinosaur catnip what then the top of one case tore away and they saw a cracked egg inside protruding from the egg was a wrinkled bit of flesh the maiasaurs slowed their movements were now cautious gentle they honked and grunted the big bodies of the animals blocked their view there was a squeaking sound youre kidding levine said on the ground a tiny animal moved about its body was pale brown almost white it tried to stand but flopped down at once it was barely a foot long with wrinkled folds of flesh around its neck in a moment a second animal tumbled out beside it harding sighed slowly one of the maiasaurs ducked its huge head down and gently scooped the baby up in its broad bill it kept its mouth open as it raised its head the baby sat calmly on the adults tongue looking around with its tiny head as it rose high into the air the second baby was picked up the adults milled around for a moment as if unsure whether there was more to do and then honking loudly they all moved off leaving behind a crumpled shattered vehicle thorne said i guess gas is no longer a problem i guess not sarah said thorne stared at the wreckage of the jeep shaking his head its worse than a headon collision he said it looks like its been put in a compactor just wasnt built for those sorts of stresses levine snorted engineers in detroit didnt expect a fiveton animal to stand on it you know thorne said i would have liked to see how our own car stood up under that you mean because we beefed it up yes thorne said we really built it to take fantastic stresses huge stresses ran it through computer programs added those honeycomb panels the whole wait a minute harding said turning away from the window what are you talking about the other car thorne said what other car the car we brought he said the explorer of course she said suddenly excited theres another car i completely forgot the explorer well its history now thorne said it shorted out last night when i was coming back to the trailer i ran it through a puddle and it shorted out so maybe it still no thorne said shaking his head a short like thatd blow the vr its an electric car its dead im surprised you dont have circuit breakers for that well we never used to put them in although on this latest versionhe trailed off he shook his head i cant believe it the car has circuit breakers yes eddie put them in last minute so the car might still run yes it probably would if you reset the breakers where is it she said she was heading for the motorcycle i left it on that side road that runs from the ridge road down to the hide but sarah its our only chance she said she pulled on her radio headset adjusted the microphone to her cheek and rolled the motorcycle to the door call me she said im going to go find us a car they watched through the windows in the earlymorning light she climbed onto the motorcycle and roared off up the hill levine watched her go what do you figure her odds are thorne just shook his head the radio crackled doc thorne picked it up yes sarah im coming up the hill now i seetheres six of them raptors yeah theyre uhlisten im going to try another path i see a the radio crackled sarah she was breaking up sort of a game trail that here think i better sarah thorne said youre breaking up do now so just ish me luck over the radio they heard the hum of the bike then they heard another sound which might have been an animal snarl and might have been more static thorne bent forward holding the radio close to his ear then abruptly the radio clicked and was silent he said sarah there was no answer maybe she turned it off levine said thorne shook his head sarah nothing sarah are you there they waited nothing hell thorne said time passed slowly levine stood by the window staring out kelly was snoring in a corner arby lay next to malcolm fast asleep and malcolm was humming tunelessly thorne sat on the floor in the center of the room leaning back against the checkout counter every so often hed pick up the radio and try to call sarah but there was never any answer he tried all six channels there was no answer on any of them eventually he stopped trying the radio crackled ate these damned things never work right a grunt cant figure out what things damn across the room levine sat forward thorne grabbed the radio sarah sarah finally she said her voice crackling where the hell have you been doc are you all right of course im all right theres something wrong with your radio youre breaking up yeah what should i do try screwing down the cover on your battery pack its probably loose no i mean what should i do about the car thorne said what im at the car doc im there what should i do levine glanced at his watch twenty minutes until the helicopter arrives he said you know she just might make it dodgson dodgson awoke aching and stiff on the floor of the concrete utility shed he got to his feet and looked out the window he saw streaks of red in a paleblue sky he opened the door to the utility shed and went outside he was very thirsty and his body was sore he started walking beneath the canopy of trees the tingle around him was silent in the early morning he needed water more than anything he needed water somewhere off to his left he heard the soft gurgle of a stream he headed toward it moving more quickly through the trees he could see the sky growing lighter he knew that malcolm and his party were still here they must have some plan to get off the island if they could get off he could too he came over a low rise and looked down at a gully and a flowing stream it looked clear he hurried down toward it wondering if it was polluted he decided he didnt care just before he reached the stream he tripped over a vine and fell swearing he got to his feet and looked back then he saw it wasnt a vine he had tripped over it was the strap of a green backpack dodgson tugged at the strap and the whole backpack slid out of the foliage the pack had been torn apart and it was crusty with dried blood as he pulled it the contents clattered out among the ferns flies were buzzing everywhere but he saw a camera a metal case for food and a plastic water bottle he searched quickly through the surrounding ferns but he didnt find much else except some soggy candy bars dodgson drank the water and then realized he was very hungry he popped open the metal case hoping for some decent food but the case didnt contain food it was filled with foam packing and in the center of the packing was a radio he flicked it on the battery light glowed strongly he flicked from one channel to another hearing static then a mans voice sarah this is thorne sarah after a moment a womans voice doc did you hear me i said im at the car dodgson listened and smiled so there was a car in the store thorne held the radio close to his cheek okay he said sarah listen carefully get in the car and do exactly what i tell you okay fine she said but tell me first is levine there hes here the radio clicked she said ask him if theres any danger from a green dinosaur thats about six feet tall and has a domed forehead levine nodded tell her yes theyre called pachycephalosaurs he says yes thorne said theyre pachycephalosomethings and you should be careful why because theres about fifty of them all around the car explorer the explorer was sitting in the middle of a shady section of the road with overhanging trees above the car had stopped just beyond a depression where there had no doubt been a large puddle the night before now the puddle had become a mudhole thanks to the dozen or so animals that sat in it splashed in it drank from it and rolled at its edges these were the green domeheaded dinosaurs that she had been watcing for the last few minutes trying to decide what to do because not only were they near the mudhole they were also located in front of the car and around the sides of the car she had watched the pachycephalosaurs with uneasiness harding had spent a lot of time on the ground with wild animals but usually animals she knew well from long experience she knew how closely she could approach and under what circumstances if this were a herd of wildebeest she would walk right in without hesitation if it were a herd of american buffalo she would be cautious but shed still go in and if it was a herd of african buffalo she wouldnt go anywhere near them she pushed the microphone against her cheek and said how much time left twenty minutes then i better get in there she said any ideas there was a pause the radio crackled levine says nobody knows anything about these animals sarah great levine says a complete skeleton has never been recovered so nobody has even a guess about their behavior except that theyre probably aggressive great she said she was looking at the situation of the car and the overhanging trees it was a shady area peaceful and quiet in the earlymorning light the radio crackled levine says you might try walking slowly in and see if the herd lets you through but no quick movements no sudden gestures she stared at the animals and thought they have those domed heads for a reason no thanks she said im going to try something else what in the store levine said whatd she say she said she was going to try something else like what levine said he went to the window and looked out the sky was growing lighter he frowned there was some consequence to that he thought something he knew in the back of his mind but wasnt thinking about something about daylight and territory territory levine looked out at the sky again trying to put it together what difference did it make that daylight was coming he shook his head gave it up for the moment how long to reset the breakers just a minute or two thorne said then there might still be time levine said there was static hiss from the radio and they heard harding say okay im above the car youre where im above the car she said in a tree harding climbed out on the branch moving farther from the trunk feeling it bend under her weight the branch seemed supple she was now ten feet above the car swinging lower few of the animals below had looked up at her but the herd seemed to be restless animals sitting in the mud got up and began to turn and mill she saw their tails flicking back and forth anxiously she moved farther out and the branch bent lower it was slippery from the nights rain she tried to gauge her position above the car it looked pretty good she thought suddenly one of the animals charged the trunk of the tree she was in butting it hard the impact was surprisingly forceful the tree swayed her branch swinging up and down while she struggled to hold on oh shit she thought she rose up into the air came down again and then she lost her grip her hands slipped on wet leaves and wet bark and she fell free at the last moment she saw that she would miss the car entirely then she hit the ground landing hard in muddy earth right beside the animals the radio crackled sarah thorne said there was no answer whats she doing now levine began to pace nervously i wish we could see what shes doing in the corner of the room kelly got up rubbing her eyes why dont you use the video thorne said what video kelly pointed to the cash register thats a computer it is yeah i think so kelly yawned as she sat in the chair facing the cash register it looked like a dumb terminal which meant it probably didnt have access to much but it was worth a try anyway she turned it on nothing happened she flicked the power switch back and forth nothing idly she swung her legs and kicked a wire beneath the table she bent over and saw that the terminal was unplugged so she plugged it in the screen glowed and a single word appeared login to proceed further she knew she needed a password arby had a password she glanced over and saw that he was still asleep she didnt want to wake him up she remembered that he had written it down on a piece of paper and stuck it in his pocket maybe it was still in his clothes she thought she crossed the room found the bundle of his wet muddy clothes and began going through the pockets she found his wallet the keys to his house and some other stuff finally she found a piece of paper in his back pocket it was damp and streaked with mud the ink had smeared but she could still read his writing vig amp kelly took the paper and went back to the computer she typed in all the characters carefully and pressed the return key the screen went blank and then a new screen came up she was surprised it was different from the screen she had seen earlier in the trailer she was in the system but the whole thing looked different maybe because this wasnt the radionet she thought she must be logged into the actual laboratory system it had more graphics because the terminal was hardwired maybe they even ran optical pipe out here across the room levine said kelly how about it im working on it she said cautiously she began to type rows of icons appeared rapidly across the screen one after another she knew she was looking at a graphic interface of some kind but the meaning of the images wasnt obvious to her and there were no explanations the people who had used this system were probably trained to know what the images meant but kelly didnt know she wanted to get into the video system yet none of the pictures suggested anything to do with video she moved the cursor around wondering what to do she decided shed have to guess she picked the diamondshaped icon on the lower left and clicked on it uhoh she said alarmed levine looked over something wrong no she said its fine she quickly clicked on the header and got back to the previous screen this time she tried one of the triangularshaped icons the screen changed again thats it she thought immediately the image popped off and the actual video images began to flash up on the screen on this little cash register monitor the pictures were tiny but now she was in familiar territory and she moved around quickly moving the cursor manipulating the images what are you looking for she said the explorer thorne said she clicked the screen the image zoomed up got it she said levine said you do he sounded surprised kelly looked at him and said yeah i do the two men came and stared at the screen over her shoulder they could see the explorer on a shaded road they could see the pachycephalosaurs lots of them milling around the car the animals were poking at the tires and the front fender but they didnt see sarah anywhere where is she thorne said sarah harding was underneath the car lying on her face in the mud she had crawled there after she fell it was the only place to go and now she was staring out at the animals feet milling all around her she said doc are you there doc doc but the damned radio wasnt working again the pachys were stamping and snorting trying to get at her tinder the car then she remembered that thorne had said something about screwing down the battery pack she reached behind her back and found the pack and twisted the cover shut tight immediately her earpiece began to crackle with static doc she said where are you thorne said im under the car why did you already try it try what try to start it to start the car no she said i didnt try to start it i fell well as long as youre under there you can check the breakers thorne said the breakers are under the car some of them look up by the front wheels she twisted her body sliding in the mud okay im looking theres a box right behind the front bumper over on the left i see it can you open it i think so she crawled forward and pulled at the latch the lid came down she was staring at three black switches i see three switches and they are all pointing up up toward the front of the car hmmm thorne said that doesnt make sense can you read the writing yes it says vv and then r okay he said that explains it what the box is in backward flip all the switches the other way are you dry no doc im soaking wet lying in the damn mud well then use your shirtsleeve or something harding pulled herself forward approaching the bumper the nearest pachys snorted and banged on the bumper they leaned down and twisted their heads trying to get to her they have very bad breath she said say again never mind she flipped the switches one after another she heard a hum from the car above her okay i did it the car is making a noise thats fine thorne said what do i do now nothing you better wait she lay back in the mud looking at the feet of the pachys they were moving tramping all around her how much time left she said about ten minutes she said well im stuck under here doc i know she looked at the animals they were on all sides of the car if anything they seemed to be growing more active and excited they stamped their feet and snuffled impatiently why were they so worked up she wondered and then suddenly they all thundered off they ran toward the front of the car and away up the road she twisted her body and watched them go there was silence doc she said yeah whyd they leave stay under the car thorne said doc dont talk the radio clicked off she waited not sure what was happening she had heard the tension in thornes voice she didnt know why but now she heard a soft scuffling sound and looking over saw two feet standing by the drivers side of the car two feet in muddy boots mens boots harding frowned she recognized the boots she recognized the khaki trousers even though they were now caked with mud it was dodgson the mans boots turned to face the door she heard the door latch click dodgson was getting in the car harding acted so swiftly she was not aware of thinking grunting she swung her body around sideways reached out with her arms grabbed both ankles and pulled hard dodgson fell giving a yell of surprise he landed on his back and turned his face dark and angry he saw her and scowled no shit he said i thought i finished you off on the boat harding went red with rage and started to crawl out from under the car dodgson scrambled to his knees as she was halfway out but then she felt the ground begin to shake and she immediately knew why she saw dodgson look over his shoulder and flatten himself on the ground hurriedly he started to crawl under the car beside her she turned in the mud looking down along the length of the car and she saw a tyrannosaurus coming up the road toward them the ground vibrated with each step now dodgson was crawling toward the center of the car pushing himself close to her but she ignored him she watched the big feet with the splayed claws as they came alongside the car and stopped each foot was three feet long she heard the tyrannosaur growling she looked at dodgson his eyes were wide with terror the tyrannosaur paused beside the car the big feet shifted she heard the animal somewhere above sniffing then growling again the head came down the lower jaw touched the ground she could not see the eye just the lower jaw the tyrannosaur sniffed again long and slow it could smell them beside her dodgson was trembling uncontrollably but harding was strangely calm she knew what she had to do quickly she shifted her body twisting around moving so her head and shoulders were braced against the rear wheel of the car dodgson turned to look at her just as her boots began to push against his lower legs pushing them out from beneath the car terrified dodgson struggled trying to push back but her position was much stronger inch by inch his boots moved out into the cold morning light then his calves she grunted as she pushed concentrating every ounce of her energy in a highpitched voice dodgson said what the hell are you doing she heard the tyrannosaur growling she saw the big feet move dodgson said stop it are you crazy stop it but harding didnt stop she got her boot on his shoulder and pushed once more for a while dodgson struggled against her and then suddenly his body moved easily and she saw that the tyrannosaur had his legs in its jaws and was pulling dodgson out from under the car dodgson wrapped his hands around her boot trying to hold on trying to drag her with him she put her other boot on his face and kicked hard he let go he slid away from her she saw his terrified face ashen month open no words came out she saw his fingers digging into the mud leaving deep gouges as he was pulled away and then his body was dragged out everything was strangely quiet she saw dodgson spin around onto his back and look upward she saw the shadow of the tyrannosaur fall across him she saw the big head come down the jaws wide and she heard dodgson begin to scream as the jaws closed around his body and he was lifted up dodgson felt himself rise high into the air twenty feet above the ground and all the time he continued to scream he knew at any moment the animal would snap its great jaws shut and he would die but the jaws never closed dodgson felt stabbing pain in his sides but the jaws never closed still screaming dodgson felt himself carried back into the jungle high branches of trees lashed his face the hot breath of the animal whooshed in snorts over his body saliva dripped onto his torso he thought he would pass out from terror but the jaws never closed inside the store they stared at the tiny monitor as dodgson was carried away in the jaws of the tyrannosaur over the radio they heard his tinny distant screams you see malcolm said there is a god levine was frowning the rex didnt kill him he pointed to the screen look there you can see his arms are still moving why didnt it kill him sarah harding waited until the screams faded she crawled out from beneath the car standing up in the morning light she opened the door and got behind the wheel the key was in the ignition she gripped it with muddy fingers she twisted it there was a chugging sound and then a soft whine all the dashboard lights came on then silence was the car working she turned the wheel and it moved easily so the power steering was on doc yes sarah the cars working im coming back okay he said hurrv she put it in drive and felt the transmission engage the car was unusually quiet almost silent which was why she was able to hear the faint thumping of a distant helicopter daylight she was driving beneath a thick canopy of trees back toward the village she heard the sound of the helicopter build in intensity then it roared overhead unseen through the foliage above she had the window down and was listening it seemed to move off to her right toward the south the radio clicked sarah yes doc listen we cant communicate with the helicopter okay she said she understood what had to be done wheres the landing site south about a mile theres a clearing take the ridge road she was coming up to the fork she saw the ridge road going off to the right okay she said im going tell them to wait for us thorne said then come back and get us everybody okay she said everybodys fine thorne said she followed the road hearing a change in the sound of the helicopter she realized it must he landing the rotors continued a low whirr which meant the pilot wasnt going to shut down the road curved off to the left the sound of the helicopter was now a muted thumping she accelerated driving fast careening around the corner the road was still wet from the rains the night before she wasnt raising a cloud of dust behind her there was nothing to tell anyone that she was here doc how long will they wait i dont know thorne said over the radio can you see it not yet she said levine stared out the window he looked at the lightening sky through the trees the streaks of red were gone it was now a bright even blue daylight was definitely coming daylight and then he put it together he shivered as he realized he went to the window on the opposite side looked out toward the tennis court he stared at the spot where the carnotauruses had been the night before they were gone now just as he feared this is bad he said its only just now eight thorne said glancing at his watch how long will it take her levine said i dont know three or four minutes and then to get back levine said another five minutes i hope we make it that long he was frowning unhappily why thorne said were okay in a few minutes levine said well have direct sun shining down outside so what thorne said the radio clicked doc sarah said i see it i see the helicopter sarah came around a final curve and saw the landing site off to her left the helicopter was there blades spinning she saw another junction in the road with a narrow road leading left down a hill into jungle and then out to the clearing she drove down it descending a series of switchbacks forcing her to go slow she was now back in the jungle beneath the canopy of trees the ground leveled out she splashed across a narrow stream and accelerated forward directly ahead there was a gap in the tree canopy and sunlight on the clearing beyond she saw the helicopter its rotors were beginning to spin faster it was leaving she saw the pilot behind the bubble wearing dark glasses the pilot checked his watch shook his head to the copilot and then began to lift off sarah honked her horn and drove madly forward but she knew they could not hear her her car bounced and jolted thorne was saying what is it sarah whats happening she drove forward leaning out the window yelling wait wait but the helicopter was already rising into the air lifting up out of her view the sound began to fade by the time her car burst out of the jungle into the clearing she saw the helicopter heading away disappearing over the rocky rim of the island and then it was gone lets stay calm levine said pacing the little store tell her to get back right away and lets stay calm he seemed to be talking to himself he walked from one wall to the next pounding the wooden planks with his fist he shook his head unhappily just tell her to hurry you think she can be back in five minutes yes thorne said why what is it richard levine pointed out the window daylight he said were trapped here in daylight we were trapped here all night too thorne said we made it okay but daylight is different levine said why because at night he said this is carnotaurus territory other animals dont come in we saw no other animals at all around here last night but once daylight comes the carnotaurus cant hide any more not in open spaces in direct sunlight so theyll leave and then this wont be their territory any more which means levine glanced at kelly over by the computer he hesitated then said just take my word for it we have to get out of here right away and go where sitting at the computer kelly listened to thorne talking to dr levine she fingered the piece of paper with arbys password on it she felt very nervous the way dr levine was talking was making her nervous she wished sarah was back by now she would feel better when sarah was here kelly didnt like to think about their situation she had been holding herself together keeping up her spirits until the helicopter came but now the helicopter had come and gone and she noticed neither of the men was talking about when it would come back maybe they knew something like it wasnt coming back dr levine was saying they had to get out of the store thorne was asking dr levine where he wanted to go levine said id prefer to get off this island but i dont see how we can so i suppose we should make our way back to the trailer its the safest place now back to the trailer she thought where she and sarah had gone to get malcolm kelly didnt want to go back to the trailer she wanted to go home tensely kelly smoothed out the piece of damp paper pressing it flat on the table beside her dr levine came over stop fooling around he said see if you can find sarah i want to go home kelly said levine sighed i know kelly he said we all want to go home and he walked away again moving quickly tensely kelly pushed the paper away turning it over and sliding it under the keyboard in case she should need the password again as she did so her eye was caught by some writing on the other side she pulled the paper out again she saw site b legends east wing west wing loading bay laboratory assembly bay entrance outlying main core geo turbine convenience store worker village geo core gas station pooltennis putting greens mgrs house jog path gas lines security one security two thermal lines river dock boathouse solar one swamp road river road ridge road mtn view road cliff road holding pens she realized at once what it was a screen shot from levines apartment from the night when arby had been recovering files from the computer it seemed like a million years ago another lifetime but it had really been onlywhat two days ago she remembered how proud arby had been when he had recovered the data she remembered how they had all tried to make sense of this list now of course all these names had meaning they were all real places the laboratory the worker village the convenience store the gas station she stared at the list youre kidding she thought dr thorne she said i think you better look at this thorne stared as she pointed at the list you think so he said thats what it says a boathouse can you find it kelly you mean find it on the video she shrugged i can try try thorne said he glanced at levine who was across the room pounding on the walls again he picked up the radio sarah its doc and the radio crackled doc ive had to stop for a minute why thorne said sarah harding was stopped on the ridge road fifty yards ahead she saw the tyrannosaur going down the road away from her she could see that he had dodgson in his month and somehow dodgson was still alive his body was still moving she thought she could hear him scream she was surprised to find she had no feeling about him at all she watched dispassionately as the tyrannosaur left the road and headed off down a slope back into the jungle sarah started the car and drove cautiously forward at the computer console kelly flicked through video images one after another until finally she found it a wooden dock enclosed inside a shed or a boathouse open to the air at the far end the interior of the boathouse looked in pretty good shape there werent a lot of vines and ferns growing over things she saw a powerboat tied up rocking against the dock she saw three oil drums to one side and out the back of the boathouse there was open water and sunlight it looked like a river what do you think she said to thorne i think its worth a try he said looking over her shoulder but where is it can you find a map maybe she said she flicked the keys and managed to get back to the main screen with its perplexing icons arby awoke yawned and came over to look at what she was doing nice graphics you logged on huh yeah she said i did but im having a little trouble figuring it out levine was pacing staring out the windows this is all well and good he said but it is getting brighter out there by the minute dont you understand we need a way out of here this building is singlewall construction its fine for the tropics but its basically a shack itll do thorne said for three minutes maybe i mean look at this levine said he walked to the door rapped it with his knuckles this door is just with a crash the wood splintered around the lock and the door swung open levine was thrown aside landing hard on the floor a raptor stood hissing in the doorway a way out sitting at the console kelly was frozen in terror she watched as thorne ran forward from the side throwing the full weight of his body against the door slamming it hard against the raptor startled the animal was knocked back the door closed on its clawed hand thorne leaned against the door on the other side the animal snarled and pounded help me thorne shouted levine scrambled to his feet and ran forward adding his weight i told you levine shouted suddenly there were raptors all around the store snarling they threw themselves at the windows denting the steel bars pushing them in toward the glass they slammed against the wooden walls knocking down shelves sending cans and bottles clattering to the floor in several places the wood began to splinter on the walls levine looked back at her find a way out of here kelly stared the computer was forgotten come on kel arby said concentrate she turned back to the screen unsure what to do she clicked on the cross in the left corner nothing happened she clicked on the upperleft circle suddenly icons began to print out rapidly filling the screen dont worry there must be a key to explain it arby said we just need to know what but kelly was not listening she was pressing more buttons and moving the cursor already trying to get something to happen to get a help screen something anvthing suddenly the whole screen began to twist to distort what did you do arby said in alarm kelly was sweating i dont know she said she pulled her hands away from the keyboard its worse arhy said you made it worse the screen continued to squeeze together the icons shifting distorting slowly as they watched come on kids levine shouted were trying kelly said arby said its becoming a cube thorne pushed the big glasswalled refrigerator in front of the door the raptor slammed against the metal rattling the cans inside where are the guns levine said sarah has three in her car great at the windows some of the bars were now so deeply dented that they broke the glass along the righthand wall the wood was splintering tearing open big gaps we have to get out of here levine shouted at kelly we have to find a way he ran to the rear of the store to the bathrooms but a moment later he returned theyre back there too it was happening fast all around them on the screen she now saw a rotatlng cube turning in space kelly didnt know how to stop it come on kel arby said peering at her through swollen eyes you can do it concentrate come on everyone in the room was shouting kelly stared at the cube on the screen feeling hopeless and lost she didnt know what she was doing any more she didnt know why she was there she didnt know what the point of anything was why wasnt sarah here standing beside her arby said come on do the icons one at a time kel you can do it come on stay with it focus but she couldnt focus she couldnt click on the icons they were rotating too fast on the screen there must be parallel processors to handle all the graphics she just stared at it she found herself thinking of all sorts of things thoughts that just came unbidden into her mind the cord under the desk hardwired lots of graphics sarah talking to her in the trailer come on kel you have to do this now find a way out in the trailer sarah said most of what people tell you will be wrong its important kel arby said he was trembling as he stood beside her she knew he concentrated on computers as a way to block things out as a way to the wall splintered wide an eightinch plank cracking inward and a raptor stuck his head through snarling snapping his jaws she kept thinking of the cord under the desk the cord under the desk her legs had kicked the cord under the desk the cord under the desk arby said its important and then it hit her no she said to him its not important and she dropped off the seat crawling down under the desk to look what are you doing arby screamed but already kelly had her answer she saw the cable from the computer going down into the floor through a neat hole she saw a seam in the wood her fingers scrabbled at the floor pulling at it and suddenly the panel came away in her hands she looked down darkness yes there was a crawlspace no more a tunnel she shouted here the refrigerator fell forward the raptors crashed through the front door from the sides other animals tore through the walls knocking over the display cases the raptors sprang into the room snarling and ducking they found the bundle of arbys wet clothes and snapped at them ripping them apart in fury they moved quickly hunting but the people were gone escape kelly was in the lead holding a flashlight they moved single file along damp concrete walls they were in a tunnel four feet square with flat metal racks of cables along the left side water and gas pipes ran near the ceiling the tunnel smelled moldy she heard the squeak of rats they came to a yjunction she looked both ways to the right was a long straight passageway going into darkness it probably led to the laboratory she thought to the left was a much shorter section of tunnel with stairs at the end she went left she crawled up through a narrow concrete shaft and pushed open a wooden trapdoor at the top she found herself in a small utility building surrounded by cables and rusted pipes sunlight streamed in through broken windows the others climbed up beside her she looked out the window and saw sarah harding driving down the hill toward them harding drove the explorer along the edge of the river kelly was sitting beside her in the front seat they saw a wooden sign for the boathouse up ahead so it was the graphics that gave you the clue kelly harding said admiringly kelly nodded i just suddenly realized it didnt matter what was actually on the screen what mattered was there was a lot of data being manipulated millions of pixels spinning there and that meant there had to be a cable and if there was a cable there must be a space for it and enough space that workmen could repair it all of that so you looked under the desk yes she said thats very good harding said i think these people owe you their lives not really kelly said with a little shrug sarah shot her a look all your life other people will try to take your accomplishments away from you dont you take it away from yourself the road was muddy alongside the river and heavily overgrown with plants they heard the distant cries of the dinosaurs somewhere behind them harding maneuvered around a fallen tree and then they saw the boathouse ahead uhoh levine said i have a bad feeling from the outside the building was in ruins and heavily overgrown with vines the roof had caved in in several places no one spoke as harding pulled the explorer up in front of a pair of broad double doors scaled with a rusted padlock they climbed out of the car and walked forward in inkledeep mud you really think theres a boat in there arby said doubtfully malcolm leaned on harding while thorne threw his weight against the door rotten timbers creaked then splintered the padlock fell to the ground harding said here hold him and put malcolms arm over thornes shoulder then she kicked a hole in the door wide enough to crawl through immediately she went inside into darkness kelly hurried in after her what do you see levine said pulling planks away to widen the hole a furry spider scurried up the boards jumping away theres a boat here all right harding said and it looks okay levine pushed his head through the hole ill be damned he said we just might get out of here after all exit lewis dodgson fell tumbling through the air he dropped from the month of the tyrannosaur and landed hard on an earthen slope the breath was knocked out of him his head slammed down and he was dizzy for a moment he opened his eyes and saw a sloping bank of dried mud he smelled a sour odor of decay and then he heard a sound that chilled him it was a highpitched squeaking he got up on one elbow and saw he was in the tyrannosaur nest the sloping mound of dried mud was all around him now there were three infants here including one with a piece of aluminum wrapped around its leg the infants were squeaking with excitement as they toddled toward him dodgson scrambled to his feet unsure of what to do the other adult tyrannosaur was on the far side of the nest purring and snorting the one that had brought him was standing over him dodgson watched the babies moving toward him with their downy necks and their sharp little jaws and then he turned to run in an instant the big adult brought his head down knocking dodgson over then the tyrannosaur raised its head again and waited watching what the hell is going on dodgson thought cautiously he got to his feet again and again he was knocked down the infants squeaked and came closer he saw that their bodies were covered in bits of flesh and excrement he could smell them he got up on all fours and began crawling away something grabbed his leg holding him he looked back and saw that his leg was in the jaws of the tyrannosaur the big animal held it gently for a moment then it bit down decisively the bones snapped and crunched dodgson screamed in pain he could no longer move he could no longer do anything but scream the babies toddled forward eagerly for a few seconds they kept their distance heads darting forward to take quick bites but then when dodgson did not move away one hopped up on his leg and began to bite at the bleeding flesh the second jumped on his crotch and pecked with razorsharp jaws at his waist the third came right alongside his face and with a single snap bit into his cheek dodgson howled he saw the baby eating the flesh of his own face his blood was dripping down its jaws the baby threw its head back and swallowed the cheek and then turned opened its jaws again and closed over dodgsons neck seventh configuration partial restabilization may occur after eliminating destructive elements survival partly determined by chance events ian malcolm departure the boat left the jungle river behind and moved into darkness the walls of the cave echoed the throb of the engines as thorne steered the boat through the swift tidal current to their left a waterfall splashed down a ray of light on cascading water and then they burst out moving beyond the high cliff wall and the crashing surf into the open ocean kelly gave a cheer and threw her arms around arby who winced and smiled levine looked back at the island i have to admit i never thought wed make it but with our cameras in place and the uplink working i we expect we can continue to gather the data until we finally get our answer about extinction sarah harding stared at him maybe we will and maybe we wont why not its a perfect lost world she stared at him in disbelief its nothing of the sort she said too many predators remember well so it may appear but we dont know richard she said ian and i checked the records they made a mistake on that island many years ago back when the lab was still in production what mistake they were manufacturing infant dinosaurs and they didnt know what to feed them for a while they gave them goats milk which was fine its very hypoallergenic but as the carnivores grew they fed them a special animalprotein extract and the extract was made from groundup sheep levine said so whats wrong with that in a zoo they never use sheep extract she said because of the danger of infection infection levine repeated in a low voice what kind of infection prions malcolm said from the other side of the boat levine looked blank prions harding said are the simplest diseasecausing entities known even simpler than viruses theyre just protein fragments theyre so simple they cant even invade a body they have to be passively ingested but once eaten they cause disease scrapie in sheep madcow disease and kuru a brain disease in human beings and the dinosaurs developed a priondisease called dx from a bad batch of sheep protein extract the lab battled it for years trying to get rid of it youre saying they didnt for a while it seemed as if they did the dinosaurs were flourishing but then something happened the disease began to spread the prions are excreted in feces so it is possible excreted in feces levine said the compys were eating feces yes the compys are all infected the compys are scavengers they spread the protein over carcasses and other scavengers became infected eventually all the raptors were infected raptors attack healthy animals not always successfully one bite and the animal becomes infected and so bit by bit the infection spread through the island again thats why the animals die early and the rapid dieoff supports a much larger predator population than you would expect levine was visibly anxious you know he said one of the compys bit me i wouldnt worry harding said there may be a mild encephalitis but its usually just a headache well get you to a doctor in san jose levine began to sweat he wiped his forehead with his hand actually i dont feel very good at all it takes a week richard she said im sure youll be fine levine sank back in his seat unhappily but the point she said is that i doubt this island will be able to tell you very much about extinction malcolm stared back at the dark cliffs for a moment and then began to speak maybe thats the way it should be he said because extinction has always been a great mystery its happened five major times on this planet and not always because of an asteroid everyones interested in the cretaceous dieout that killed the dinosaurs but there were dieouts at the end of the jurassic and the triassic as well they were severe but they were nothing compared to the permian extinction which killed eighty percent of all life on the planet on the seas and on the land no one knows why that catastrophe happened but i wonder if we are the cause of the next one how is that kelly said human beings are so destructive malcolm said i sometimes think were a kind of plague that will scrub the earth clean we destroy things so well that i sometimes think maybe thats our function maybe every few eons some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world clears the decks and lets evolution proceed to its next phase kelly shook her head she turned away from malcolm and moved lip the boat to sit alongside thorne are you listening to all that thorne said i wouldnt take any of it too seriously its jist theories human beings cant help making them but the fact is that theories are just fantasies and they change when america was a new country people believed in something called phlogiston you know what that is no well it doesnt matter because it wasnt real anyway they also believed that four humors controlled behavior and they believed that the earth was only a few thousand years old now we believe the earth is four billion years old and we believe in photons and electrons and we think human behavior is controlled by things like ego and selfesteem we think those beliefs are more scientific and better arent they thorne shrugged theyre still just fantasies theyre not real have you ever seen a selfesteem can you bring me one on a plate how about a photon can you bring me one of those kelly shook her head no but and you never will because those things dont exist no matter how seriously people take them thorne said a hundred years from now people will look back at us and laugh theyll say you know what people used to believe they believed in photons and electrons can you imagine anything so silly theyll have a good laugh because by then there will be newer and better fantasies thorne shook his head and meanwhile you feel the way the boat moves thats the sea thats real you smell the salt in the air you feel the sunlight on your skin thats all real you see all of us together thats real life is wonderful its a gift to be alive to see the sun and breathe the air and there isnt really anything else now look at that compass and tell me where south is i want to go to puerto cortes its time for us all to go home acknowledgments this novel is entirely fiction but in
