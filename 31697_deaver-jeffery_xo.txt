wait for the concert next friday c u soon yours forever xo edwin sunday sunday chapter the heart of a concert hall is people and when the vast space is dim and empty as this one was at the moment a venue can bristle with impatience indifference even hostility okay rein in that imagination kayleigh towne told herself stop acting like a kid standing on the wide scuffed stage of the fresno conference centers main hall she surveyed the place once more bringing her typically hypercritical eye to the task of preparing for fridays concert considering and reconsidering lighting and stage movements and where the members of the band should stand and sit where best to walk out near though not into the crowd and touch hands and blow kisses where best acoustically to place the foldback speakersthe monitors that were pointed toward the band so they could hear themselves without echoes or distortion many performers now used earbuds for this kayleigh liked the immediacy of traditional foldbacks there were a hundred other details to think about she believed that every performance should be perfect more than perfect every audience deserved the best one hundred ten percent she had after all grown up in bishop townes shadow an unfortunate choice of word kayleigh now reflected ill be your shadow forever back to the planning this show had to be different from the previous one here about eight months ago a retooled program was especially important since many of the fans would have regularly attended her hometown concerts and she wanted to make sure they got something unexpected that was one thing about kayleigh townes music her audiences werent as big as some but were loyal as golden retrievers they knew her lyrics cold knew her guitar licks knew her moves onstage and laughed at her shtick before she finished the lines they lived and breathed her performances hung on her words knew her bio and likes and dislikes and some wanted to know much more with that thought her heart and gut clenched as if shed stepped into hensley lake in january thinking about him of course then she froze gasping yes someone was watching her from the far end of the hall where none of the crew would be shadows were moving or was it her imagination or maybe her eyesight kayleigh had been given perfect pitch and an angelic voice but god had decided enough was enough and skimped bigtime on the vision she squinted adjusted her glasses she was sure that someone was hiding rocking back and forth in the doorway that led to the storage area for the concession stands then the movement stopped she decided it wasnt movement at all and never had been just a hint of light a suggestion of shading though still she heard a series of troubling clicks and snaps and groansfrom where she couldnt telland felt a chill of panic bubble up her spine him the man who had written her hundreds of emails and letters intimate delusional speaking of the life they could share together asking for a strand of hair a fingernail clipping the man who had somehow gotten near enough at a dozen shows to take closeup pictures of kayleigh without anyone ever seeing him the man who had possiblythough it had never been provenslipped into the band buses or motor homes on the road and stolen articles of her clothing underwear included the man who had sent her dozen of pictures of himself shaggy hair fat in clothing that looked unwashed never obscene but curiously the images were all the more disturbing for their familiarity they were the shots a boyfriend would text her from a trip him her father had recently hired a personal bodyguard a huge man with a round bulletshaped head and an occasional curly wire sprouting from his ear to make clear what his job was but darthur morgan was outside at the moment making the rounds and checking cars his security plan also included a nice touch simply being visible so that potential stalkers would turn around and leave rather than risk a confrontation with a pound man who looked like a rapper with an attitude which sure enough hed been in his teen years she scanned the recesses of the hall againthe best place he might stand and watch her then gritting her teeth in anger at her fear and mostly at her failure to tame the uneasiness and distraction she thought get back to work and whatre you worried about youre not alone the band wasnt in town yetthey were finishing some studio work in nashvillebut bobby was at the huge midas xl mixing console dominating the control deck in the back of the hall two hundred feet away alicia was getting the rehearsal rooms in order a couple of the beefy guys in bobbys road crew were unpacking the truck in the back assembling and organizing the hundreds of cases and tools and props and plywood sheets and stands and wires and amps and instruments and computers and tunersthe tons of gear that even modest touring bands like kayleighs needed she supposed one of them could get to her in a hurry if the source of the shadow had been him dammit quit making him more than he is him him him like youre even afraid to say his name as if to utter it would conjure up his presence shed had other obsessed fans plenty of themwhat gorgeous singersongwriter with a voice from heaven wouldnt collect a few inappropriate admirers shed had twelve marriage proposals from men shed never met three from women a dozen couples wanted to adopt her thirty or so teen girls wanted to be her best friend a thousand men wanted to buy her a drink or dinner at bob evans or the mandarin oriental and thered been plenty of invitations to enjoy a wedding night without the inconvenience of a wedding hey kayleigh think on it cause ill show you a good time better than you ever had and by the by heres a picture of what you can expect yah its really me not bad huh very stupid idea to send a picture like that to a seventeenyearold kayleighs age at the time by the by usually she was cautiously amused by the attention but not always and definitely not now kayleigh found herself snagging her denim jacket from a nearby chair and pulling it on to cover her tshirt providing another barrier to any prying eyes this despite the characteristic september heat in fresno which filled the murky venue like thin stew and more of those clicks and taps from nowhere kayleigh she turned quickly trying to hide her slight jump even though she recognized the voice a solidly built woman of around thirty paused halfway across the stage she had cropped red hair and some subdued inking on arms shoulders and spine partly visible thanks to her trim tank top and tight hiphugging black jeans fancy cowboy boots didnt mean to scare you you okay you didnt whats up she asked alicia sessions a nod toward the ipad she carried these just came in proofs for the new posters if we get them to the printer today well definitely have them by the show they look okay to you kayleigh bent over the screen and examined them music nowadays is only partly about music of course probably always has been she supposed but it seemed that as her popularity had grown the business side of her career took up a lot more time than it used to she didnt have much interest in these matters but she generally didnt need to her father was her manager alicia handled the daytoday paperwork and scheduling the lawyers read the contracts the record company made arrangements with the recording studios and the cd production companies and the retail and download outlets her longtime producer and friend at bhrc records barry zeigler handled the technical side of arranging and production and bobby and the crew set up and ran the shows all so that kayleigh towne could do what she did best write songs and sing them still one business matter of interest to her was making sure fansmany of them young or without much moneycould buy cheap but decent memorabilia to make the night of the concert that much more special posters like this one tshirts key chains bracelets charms guitar chord books headbands backpacks and mugs for the moms and dads driving the youngsters to and from the shows and of course often buying the tickets as well she studied the proofs the image was of kayleigh and her favorite martin guitarnot a big dreadnoughtsize but a smaller ancient with a crisp yellowing spruce top and a voice of its own the photo was the inside picture from her latest album your shadow him no dont eyes scanning the doors again you sure youre okay alicia asked voice buzzing with a faint texas twang yeah kayleigh returned to the poster proofs which all featured the same photo though with different type messages and background her picture was a straighton shot depicting her much as she saw herself at fivetwo shorter than she would have liked her face a bit long but with stunning blue eyes lashes that wouldnt quit and lips that had some reporters talking collagen as if her trademark golden hair four feet longand no not cut only trimmed in ten years and four monthsflowed in the fake gentle breeze from the photographers electric fan designer jeans and highcollared darkred blouse a small diamond crucifix you gotta give the fans the package bishop towne always said thats visual too im talking and the standardsre different tween men and women you get into trouble you deny it he meant that in the country music world a man could get away with a look like bishops own jutting belly cigarette a lined craggy face riddled with stubble wrinkled shirt scuffed boots and faded jeans a woman singer he lecturedthough he really intended to say girlhad to be put together for date night and in kayleighs case that meant a church social of course the good girl next door was the image on which shed built her career sure the jeans could be a little tight the blouses and sweaters could closely hug her round chest but the necklines were high the makeup was subtle and leaned toward pinks go with them great alicia shut off the device a slight pause i havent gotten your fathers okay yet theyre good the singer reassured her nodding at the ipad sure ill just run it by him you know now kayleigh paused then okay acoustics good here asked alicia who had been a performer herself she had quite a voice and a love of music which was undoubtedly why shed taken a job for someone like kayleigh towne when the efficient nononsense woman could have earned twice as much as a personal assistant for a corporate executive shed signed on last spring and had never heard the band perform here oh the sound is great kayleigh said enthusiastically glancing at the ugly concrete walls you wouldnt think it she explained how the designers of the venue back in the s had done their homework too many concert hallseven sophisticated ones intended for classical musichad been built by people without confidence in the natural ability of musical instruments and voices to reach the farthest seats with direct volume that is the sound emanating from the stage architects would add angular surfaces and freestanding shapes to boost the volume of the music which did that but also sent the vibrations in a hundred different directions this resulted in every performers acoustic nightmare reverberation in effect echoes upon echoes that yielded muddy sometimes even offkey sounds here in modest fresno kayleigh explained to alicia as her father had to her the designers had trusted in the power and purity of the voice and drum skin and sounding board and reed and string she was about to ask the assistant to join her in a chorus of one of her songs to prove her pointalicia did great harmonieswhen she noticed her looking toward the back of the hall she assumed the woman was bored with the scientific discussion but the frowning gaze suggested something else was on her mind what kayleigh asked isnt it just us and bobby what do you mean i thought i saw somebody she lifted a finger tipped in a blackpainted nail that doorway there just where kayleigh herself had thought shed seen the shadow ten minutes before palms sweating absently touching her phone kayleigh stared at the changing shapes in the back of the hall yes no she just couldnt tell then shrugging her broad shoulders one of them sporting a tattoo of a snake in red and green alicia said hm guess not whatever it was its gone now okay see you later the restaurant at one yeah sure kayleigh listened absently to the thumping of boots as she left and continued to stare at the black doorways angrily she suddenly whispered edwin sharp there ive said his name edwin edwin edwin now that ive conjured you up listen here get the hell out of my concert hall ive got work to do and she turned away from the shadowy gaping doorway from which of course no one was leering at her at all she stepped to center stage looking over the masking tape on the dusty wood blocking out where she would stand at different points during the concert it was then that she heard a mans voice crying from the back of the hall kayleigh it was bobby now rising from behind the mixing console knocking his chair over and ripping off his hardshell earphones he waved to her with one hand and pointed to a spot over her head with another look out no kayleigh she glanced up fast and saw one of the strip lightsa sevenfoot colortran unitfalling free of its mounting and swinging toward the stage by its thick electric cable stepping back instinctively she tripped over a guitar stand she hadnt remembered was behind her tumbling arms flailing gasping the young woman hit the stage hard on her tailbone the massive light plummeted toward her a deadly pendulum growing bigger and bigger she tried desperately to rise but fell back blinded as the searing beams from the thousandwatt bulbs turned her way then everything went black chapter kathryn dance had several lives widowed mother of two children approaching their teen years agent with the california bureau of investigation her specialty interrogation and kinesicsbody language analysis dutiful if sometimes irreverent and exasperated daughter to parents who lived nearby that was the order in which she placed these aspects of her life then there was number four which was nearly as vital to her psychic wellbeing as the first three music like alan lomax in the middle of the last century dance was a folklorist a song catcher occasionally shed take time off climb into her suv sometimes with kids and dogs sometimes like now solo and go in search of music the way hunters take to the fields for deer or turkey dance was now piloting her pathfinder along highway from the monterey peninsula through a largely barren stretch of california to fresno in the san joaquin valley three hours away this was the agricultural heart of the country and open doubletrailer trucks piled high with garlic tomatoes and other fruits and vegetables rolled endlessly toward the massive foodprocessing plants in the hazy distance the working fields were verdant or if harvested already rich black but everything else was dry and dun as forgotten toast dust swirled in the nissans wake and insects died splatty deaths on the windshield dances mission over the next few days was to record the homemade tunes of a local group of mexican musicians all of whom lived in or near fresno most of them picked in the fields so theyd adopted the name los trabajadores the workers dance would record them on her digital tascam hdp a bit more expensive than she could afford but superb then edit and post the songs on her website american tunes people could download them for a small fee of which she would send most to the musicians and would keep enough to cover the cost of the site and to take herself and the kids out to dinner occasionally no one got rich from the downloads but some of the groups that she and her business partner in the venture martine christensen had discovered had come to regional and even national attention shed just come off a tough case in monterey the cbi office she was assigned to and decided to take some time off the children were at their music and sports camps spending the nights with their grandparents dance was free to roam fresno yosemite and environs record los trabajadores and look for other talent in this musically rich area not only latino but a unique strain of country could be found here theres a reason of course the genre is often called countrywestern in fact the bakersfield sound originating in that city a few hours south of fresno had been a major country music movement it had arisen in reaction to what some people thought was the overly slick productions of nashville in the fifties performers like buck owens and merle haggard began the movement and it had enjoyed a recent resurgence in the music of such artists as dwight yoakam and gary allan dance sipped a sprite and juggled radio stations shed considered making this trip a romantic getaway and inviting jon boling to come with her but hed just gotten a consulting assignment for a computer startup and would be tied up for several days and for some reason dance had decided she preferred to make the trip solo the kidnapping case shed just closed had been tough two days ago shed attended the funeral of the one victim they couldnt save in the company of the two they had she turned up the ac this time of year the monterey peninsula was comfortable even chilly occasionally and shed dressed according to her port of embarkation in a longsleeved gray cotton shirt and blue jeans she was hot she slipped off her pinkrimmed glasses and wiped them on a napkin steering with her knees somehow sweat had managed to crawl down one lens the pathfinders thermometer reported degrees outside september right dance was looking forward to the trip for another reasonto see her only celebrity friend kayleigh towne the now famous singersongwriter kayleigh had been a longtime supporter of dances website and the indigenous musicians she and martine championed the singer had invited dance to her big concert friday night in fresno though a dozen years younger than dance kayleigh had been a performer since she was nine or ten years old and a pro since her late teens funny sophisticated and one hell of a writer and entertainer with no ego whatsoever the woman was mature beyond her years and dance enjoyed her company very much she was also the daughter of country music legend bishop towne on the two or three occasions when dance had come to kayleighs performances or visited her in fresno bearlike bishop had lumbered into the room with his thousandpound ego and the intensity of somebody as addicted to recovery as he had been to cocaine and liquor hed rambled on about people in the industryspoken with an inflected capital i musicians he knew intimately hundreds musicians hed learned from only the greats musicians hed mentored most of the presentday superstars and musicians hed gotten into fistfights with plenty of those too he was brash crude and overtly theatrical dance had been enthralled on the other hand his latest album had tanked his voice had deserted him his energy too and those were two things that even the most sophisticated digital massaging in the studio cant do much about and nothing could rescue the trite songwriting so different from the brilliant words and tunes that had made him a hit years ago still he had his faithful entourage and he was in bold control of kayleighs career woe to any producer or record company or music venue that didnt treat her right dance now entered fresno proper salinas valley one hundred miles to the west was known as the nations lettuce bowl but the san joaquin was bigger and produced more and fresno was its heart the place was a nondescript working town of about a half million it had some gang activity and the same domestic robbery homicide and even terrorist threats that you saw in every small urban area nowadays with the rate a bit higher than the national average for all crimes that inflation she surmised was a reflection of unemploymenthovering here around percent she noticed a number of young men living evidence of this statistic hanging out on hazy street corners dressed in sleeveless tshirts and baggy shorts or jeans they watched her and other cars pass by or talked and laughed and drank from bottles swathed in paper bags dust and heat waves rose from baking surfaces dogs sat on porches and gazed through her car at distant nothingness and she caught glimpses of children in backyards jumping happily over trickling sprinklers a questionable if not illegal activity in perpetually droughtplagued california the satellite got her easily to the mountain view motel off highway it had no such vista though that might be due to the haze at best she deduced squinting east and north were some timid foothills that would eventually lead to majestic yosemite stepping into the brittle heat dance actually felt lightheaded breakfast with the kids and dogs had been a long time ago the hotel room wasnt ready yet but that didnt matter since she was meeting kayleigh and some friends in a half hour at one she checked her bags with the front desk and jumped back into the pathfinder which was already the temperature of a hotplate she punched another address into the gps and dutifully headed where directed wondering why most of the programmed voices in satnav were womens at a stoplight she picked up her phone and glanced at the incoming call and text list empty good that no one at the office or the childrens camps had contacted her but odd that there was nothing from kayleigh who was going to call that morning to confirm their gettogether and one thing about the performer that had always impressed dance despite her fame she never neglected the little things in fact in life and performances she seemed to be utterly responsible another call to kayleigh straight to voicemail kathryn dance had to laugh the owners of the cowboy saloon had a sense of humor the dark woody place giddily cool had not a single cowboy artifact but life in the saddle was well representedby the women who rode the range roped branded and punched cattle and did some fancy sixgun work if you could believe the poster showing an old west version of rosie the riveter shooting bottles off a fence rail according to the movie art blownup book jackets lunch boxes toys paintings and photos the era must have been saturated with fliphaired excessively busty gals in fivegallon hats cute neckerchiefs suede skirts and embroidered blouses as well as some of the finest boots ever made kathryn dance loved footwear and owned two pairs of elaborately tooled noconas but neither came close to the ones worn by dale evans roy rogerss partner from the s tv show on impressive display in a faded poster at the bar she ordered an iced tea drank it down fast and got another then sat at one of the round tables overvarnished and nicked looking at the clientele two elderly couples a trio of tired jumpsuited utility workers whod probably been on the job at dawn a slim young man in jeans and plaid shirt studying the oldfashioned jukebox several businessmen in white shirts and dark ties minus jackets she was looking forward to seeing kayleigh to recording the songs of the workers looking forward to lunch too she was starving and concerned it was now onetwenty where was her friend music from the jukebox filled the place dance gave a faint laugh it was a kayleigh towne songa particularly good choice too considering this venue me im not a cowgirl the song was about a suburban soccer mom who seems to live a life very different from that of a cowgirl but in the end realizes that maybe shes one in spirit typical of kayleighs songs it was lighthearted and yet spoke meaningfully to people it was then that the front door opened and a slab of powerful sunlight fell onto the scuffed linoleum floor on which danced geometric shapes the shadows of the people entering dance rose kayleigh surrounded by four others the young singer stepped into the restaurant smiling but also looking around quickly she was troubled dance noted immediately no more than that kayleigh towne was scared but whatever shed been concerned about finding here was absent and she relaxed then stepped forward hugging dance firmly kathryn hey this is so great i couldnt wait to get here the singer was in jeans and oddly a thick denim jacket despite the heat her lovely hair flowed free nearly as long as she was tall dance added i called a couple of times there was well there was a little problem at the concert hall its all right hey everybody thiss my bud kathryn dance dance greeted bobby prescott whom shed met a few years ago thirtyish an actors looks belied by a shy smile curly brown hair there was also pudgy and terminally shy tye slocum with long reddish hair in need of a trim he was the bands guitar technician and repairman unsmiling athletic alicia sessions who looked to dance like she belonged in a downtown manhattan punkrock club was kayleighs personal assistant and someone else was in the entourage an africanamerican man over six feet tall well into the pound range security the fact that kayleigh had a bodyguard wasnt surprising though dance was troubled to note that he was intently on the job even here he carefully examined everyone in the barthe young man at the jukebox the workers the businessmen and even the elderly couples and the bartender clearly running their faces through a mental database of potential threats what had prompted this whatever threat he was here to guard against wasnt present and he turned his attention back to kayleigh he didnt relax though people like him never didthats what made them so good he went into a waiting state looks okay to me his name was darthur morgan and when he shook dances hand he examined her closely and his eyes gave a flicker of recognition dance as an expert in kinesics and body language knew that she gave off cop vibrations even when not intending to join us for lunch kayleigh said to the big man no thank you maam ill be outside no its too hot better there well get an iced tea or soda and come in if you need to but without ordering a beverage he steamed slowly through the dim restaurant and with one glance at a wax museum cowgirl twirling a lasso stepped outside the skinny bartender came around carrying menus and a fierce admiration for kayleigh towne who smiled at the young man in a maternal way though they were about the same age kayleigh glanced at the jukebox embarrassed that it was her voice serenading them so dance asked what happened okay ill tell you she explained that as she was doing some prep work for the fridaynight concert a strip lightone of the long ones above the stagecame loose and fell my god youre all right yeah fine aside from a sore butt bobby sitting next to kayleigh gripped her arm he looked at her protectively i dont know how it happened he said in a low voice i mean it was a strip light a cyc light you dont mount or dismount it for a show it was there permanently eyes avoiding everyones big tye slocum offered and you checked it bobby i saw you twice all the lights bobbys the best roadie around never had an accident like that before if itd hit her alicia said anger in her voice man that would have been it it couldve killed her bobby added its a thousand watts could alsove set the whole place on fire if the lamps had shattered i cut the main power switch in case they did im going to check it out better when im back tonight ive got to go to bakersfield and pick up a new amplifier and speaker bank then the incident was tucked away and they ordered lunch dance was in fighting trim after the twoweeklong kidnapping caseshed shed nine poundsand decided to splurge with an order of fries with her grilled chicken sandwich kayleigh and tye ordered salads alicia and bobby had tostadas and opted for coffee despite the heat the conversation turned to dances musical website and she talked a bit about her own failed attempts at being a singer in san francisco kathryn has a great voice kayleigh said displaying five or six kinesic deception clues dance smiled a mans voice interrupted excuse me folks hey there kayleigh it was the young man from the jukebox smiling he nodded at dance and the table and then looked down at kayleigh hello the singers tone had gone suddenly into a different mode bright but guarded didnt mean to be eavesdropping i heard there was some problem you all right just fine thanks silence for a moment the sort that means appreciate your interest but you can head off now kayleigh said youre a fan sure am well thanks for your support and your concern you going to the concert on friday oh you bet ill be there wouldnt miss it for the world you sure youre okay a pause bordering on the awkward maybe kayleigh was digesting the last sentence sure am bobby said okay friend you take care now were going to get back to lunch as if the roadie hadnt even spoken the man said with a breathy laugh you dont recognize me do you sorry the singer offered alicia said firmly ms towned like some privacy you dont mind hey alicia the young man said to her the personal assistant blinked obviously she hadnt recognized the man and would be wondering how he knew her name then he ignored her too and laughed again his voice high eerie its me kayleigh edwin sharp your shadow chapter a loud bang echoed in the restaurant as kayleighs iced tea glass slipped from her grip and slammed into the floor the big glass landed at just the right angle to produce a sound so like a gunshot that dance found her hand moving to the place where her glock pistolpresently locked away in her bedside safe at homenormally rested eyes wide breath rasping in and out of her lungs kayleigh said youre youre edwin her reaction was one approaching panic but with a brow furrowed in sympathy the man said hey there kayleigh its okay dont you worry but her eyes were zipping to the door on the other side of which was darthur morgan and if dance was right his own pistol dance tried to piece it together couldnt be a former boyfriend shed have recognized him earlier must be an inappropriate fan kayleigh was just the sort of performerbeautiful single talentedto have stalker problems no embarrassment you didnt recognize me edwin said bizarrely reassuring her and oblivious to her distress since i sent you that last picture of me i lost a bit of weight yep seventythree pounds he tapped his belly i didnt write you about it wanted it to be a surprise i read country week and ew see the pictures of you with some of those boys i know you like the slimmer builds didnt think youd appreciate a chubby and got myself a twentyfivedollar haircut you know how men are always talking about changing but they never do like your song i wasnt going to give you a mr tomorrow im a mr today kayleigh was speechless nearly hyperventilating from some angles edwin would be goodlookingfull head of black hair trimmed conservatively like a politicians and sprayed firmly into place keen deep brown eyes smooth complexion if a bit pale but that face was also very long angular with heavy protruding eyebrows like soot he was trim yes but biglarger than shed noticed at first easily sixtwo or three and despite the weight loss he was probably two hundred pounds his rangy arms were long and his hands massive but curiouslyand unsettlinglypink instantly bobby prescott was on his feet and stepping in front of the man bobby was large too but wide not tall and edwin towered over him hey edwin said cheerfully bobby the roadie excuse me chief of the road crew and then his eyes returned to kayleigh staring at her adoringly id be honored if youd have some iced tea with me just over there in the corner ive got a few things to show you how did you know youd be here hell everybody knows that this is your favorite place just look at the blogs its where you wrote me im not a cowgirl he nodded at the jukebox from which that very song was playingnow for the second time dance noted the suburbs and the cities thats what im about me im not a cowgirl unless maybe you count looking people in the eye and talking to them straight not putting up with bigots or cheaters or with hate remembering everything my mom and daddy said about how to treat my family my country and my friends didnt think i was a cowgirl but i guess that all depends love that song he gushed just love it well you know that i told you must be a hundred times i really kayleigh was a deer in the middle of the road bobby put his hand on edwins shoulder not quite hostile not quite friendly dance wondered if this would be the start of a fight and she reached for the only weapon she hadher mobileto dial if need be but edwin simply stepped back a few inches ignoring bobby come on lets get that iced tea i know you think theirs here is the best in town ill treat mr today remember hey your hairs really beautiful ten years four months dance had no idea what that meant but the comment clearly upset kayleigh even more her jaw trembled kayleighd like to be left alone alicia said firmly the woman seemed to be just as strong as bobby prescott and her glare was more fierce you enjoying working for the band alicia he asked her as if making conversation at a cocktail party youve been with em about what five six months right youre talented too ive seen you on youtube you surely can sing wow alicia leaned forward ominously what the hell is this how do you know me listen friend bobby said time for you to leave then tye slocum slowly pushed back in his chair and strode to the door edwins eyes followed and on his face was welded the same smile that had been there from the moment hed stepped to the table but something had changed it was as if he actually expected kayleigh to join him for tea and was perplexed she wasnt tyes mission to summon the security guard seemed to irritate him kayleigh please i didnt want to bother you here but you never got back to me on email i just want to visit for a bit weve got a lot to talk about i really cant bobby took edwins arm once more before dance could intervene but again the man simply stood back he didnt seem to have any interest in a confrontation much less a physical fight there was a blinding flash and the table was immersed in light as the door opened then the illumination was blocked removing his aviator shades darthur morgan moved in fast he looked at edwins face and dance could see the muscles around his mouth tighten a sign of displeasure at himself for missing the slimmeddown stalker youre edwin sharp thats right mr morgan it wasnt hard to get information about people nowadays especially those connected with a very public person like kayleigh towne but learning the name of her security guard im going to ask you to leave ms towne alone now she wants you to leave youre becoming a security threat well under giles versus lohan im really not mr morgan theres not even an implied threat anyway the last thing that i want is to hurt or threaten anybody im just here offering my friend some sympathy over something that happened to her something traumatic and seeing if shed like some tea happy to buy you some too i think thats about it now morgan said in a low insistent baritone edwin continued calmly youre private of course you can make a citizens arrest but only if you see me committing a crime and i havent done that you were a police officer thatd be different but youre well its come to that dance thought guess i knew it would and she rose displaying her cbi identification card ah edwin stared for what seemed to be an inordinately long time as if memorizing it had a feeling you were law could i see some id you bet he handed over his drivers license issued by washington state edwin stanton sharp address in seattle the picture was of somebody who was indeed much heavier and with long stringy hair where are you staying in fresno dance asked a house by woodward park one of those new developments its not bad a smile sure gets hot in fresno you moved here alicia asked in a surprised whisper kayleighs eyes widened at this and her shoulders rose nope just renting for the time being im in town for the concert its going to be the best of the year i cant wait why would he rent a house to attend a single concert no you wanted to stalk kayleigh bobby blurted the lawyers warned you about that lawyers dance wondered edwin looked around the table the smile dimmed i think all of you how youre acting is upsetting kayleigh he said to her im sorry about that i know what youre up against but dont worry itll all work out he walked to the door paused and turned back and goodbye to you too agent dance god bless you for the sacrifices you make for the people of this state chapter when dance said tell me they did all of them at once and only after she reined in the intersecting narratives did she begin to grasp the whole picture last winter a fan had become convinced that kayleighs automated form letters and emails signed xo kayleigh hugs and kisses were to be taken personally because the songs had meant so much to him perfectly expressing how he felt about life hed told himself that they were soul mates he began a barrage of correspondenceemail facebook and twitter posts handwritten lettersand hed sent her presents advised to ignore him kayleigh and her assistants stopped responding except to send back any gifts unopened but edwin sharp nonetheless persisted apparently believing that her father and handlers felt threatened by the connection between him and kayleigh and wanted to keep them apart he was told to stop dozens of times the law firm representing kayleigh and her father threatened him with civil action and referral to the police if he didnt cease and desist but he hadnt its been so creepy kayleigh now said her voice breaking she took a sip of tea from a new glass the bartender had brought her when hed come to mop up the spill hed want a strand of hair a fingernail clipping a piece of paper id kissed with my lipstick on it hed take pictures of me in places where id never seen him backstage or in parking lots dance said thats the thing about a crime like this you never quite know where the stalker is maybe miles away maybe outside your window kayleigh continued and the mail hundreds of letters and email messages id change my email address and a few hours later hed have the new one do you think he had anything to do with the light that fell dance asked kayleigh said she thought shed seen some weird things that morning at the convention center maybe shadows moving maybe not she hadnt seen an actual person alicia sessions was more certain i saw something too im sure she shrugged her broad shoulders offering hints of tattoos largely hidden under the cloth nothing specific though no face or body the band wasnt in town yet and the rest of the crew had been outside when they thought theyd seen the shadowy figure bobby hadnt seen anything other than the strip light starting to fall dance asked do the local deputies know about him the singer answered oh yeah they do they knew he was planning to come to the concert on fridayeven though the lawyers threatened to get a restraining order they didnt really think hed done anything bad enough for us to get one though but the sheriff was going to keep an eye on him if he showed up make sure he knew they were watching him ill call the sheriffs office alicia said and tell them hes here and where hes staying she gave a surprised laugh he sure didnt hide it kayleigh looked around troubled this used to be my favorite restaurant in town now its all spoiled im not hungry anymore id like to leave im sorry she waved for and settled up the check hold on a second bobby walked to the front door and opened it a crack he spoke to darthur morgan the roadie returned to the table hes gone darthur saw him get in his car and drive off lets go out the back just the same alicia suggested tye asked morgan to drive around to that lot and dance accompanied the small entourage through a beerpungent storeroom past a grim toilet they stepped into a parking lot of bleached weeds and dusty cars and crumbling asphalt dance noticed kayleigh glance to her right and gasp she followed the singers gaze twenty feet away a car was parked in the lot behind the restaurant it was a huge old model dull red sitting in the drivers seat was edwin sharp through the open window he called hey kayleigh check out my wheels its not a cadillac just a buick like it he didnt seem to expect an answer he added dont worry ill never put my car ahead of you my red cadillac was one of kayleighs smash hits it was about a girl who loves her old car and dumps any man who doesnt care for the big battered vehicle bobby prescott stormed forward and raged get the fuck out of here you son of a bitch and dont even think about following us to find out where kayleigh lives you try that and im calling the cops edwin nodded smiling and drove off with the suns glare and the unsure kinesics of someone shed just met dance couldnt be certain but her impression was that the stalkers face had registered a hint of confusion when bobby spokeas if of course he knew where kayleigh lived why wouldnt he chapter no surprise california has always been home to latino music some salvadoran honduran and nicaraguan but the bulk of the sounds are mexicana traditional mariachi banda ranchera norteño and sones plenty of pop and rock too and even south of the borders own brand of ska and hiphop these sounds flowed from the many spanishlanguage stations up and down the central valley into the homes businesses and fields here taking up half the airwavesthe rest of the bandwidth split between anglo music and checkseeking religious stations spouting incoherent theology it was close to pm and dance was now getting a firsthand taste of this musical sound in the sweltering garage of jose villalobos on the outskirts of fresno the familys two toyotas had been banished from the small detached structure which was usually a rehearsal hall tonight though it was a recording studio the six musicians of los trabajadores were just finishing up the last number for dances digital recorder the men ranging in age from twentyfive to sixty had been playing together for some years both traditional mexican folk music and their own material the recording had gone well though the men hadnt been too focused at firstlargely because of whom dance had brought with her kayleigh towne hair looped in an elaborately braided bun atop her head in faded jeans tshirt and denim vest the musicians had been awed and two had scurried into the house to return with wives and children for autographs one of the women had tearfully said you know your song leaving homewe all love it god bless you for writing it this was a ballad about an older woman whos packing up her belongings and leaving the house where she and her husband raised their children the listener wonders if shes just become a widow or if the house has been foreclosed on by the bank now im starting over starting over once again to try to make a new life without family or friends in all my years on earth theres one thing that i know nothing can be harder than to leave behind your home only at the end is it revealed that shes undocumented and is being deported though shes spent her whole life in the united states just after the woman is dropped off alone at a bus station in mexico she sings the coda america the beautiful in spanish it was kayleighs most controversial song earning her the anger of those taking a hard line on immigration reform but it was also hugely popular and had become an anthem among latino workers and those preaching a more open border policy as they were packing up dance explained how the songs would be uploaded onto her and martines website she couldnt guarantee what might happen but given that the band was so good theyd probably sell a fair number of downloads and it was possible with the growth of latino radio throughout the united states and independent record labels specializing in that sound that they might draw some producers or ad agencies attention curiously becoming successful didnt interest them in the least oh they wouldnt mind making some money with their music but with the downloads only villalobos said yeah we dont want that kind of lifeon the road we wont travel we have jobs families bebés jesus has twinshe got to go change diapers now a glance toward the grinning handsome young man who was packing away his old battered gibson hummingbird guitar they said goodbye and dance and kayleigh climbed into her dark green suburban dance had left her pathfinder at the mountain view and had ridden here with kayleigh in her suv darthur morgan began the drive back to dances motel hed stayed out in the suv to keep an eye on the street six or seven small hardcover books leather bound were in the front seat the titles were stamped in gold on the spine only classics dance guessed he didnt seem to read them when he was on guard duty itself maybe they were his pleasure when he was in his room at night a portal to take him away from the persistence of threat kayleigh was looking out the window at the dimly lit or black landscape i envy them she said hows that its like a lot of the musicians on your website they play at night and on weekends for their friends and families its not for the money sometimes i wish i wasnt so good ha modesty alert but you know what i mean i never really wanted to be a star i wanted to have a husband andshe nodded back toward villalobossbabies and sing to them and friends it just all got away from me she was silent and dance supposed she was thinking if i wasnt famous i wouldnt have edwin sharp in my life dance could see kayleighs reflection and noted her jaw was set and there were possibly tears in her eyes then kayleigh turned back shoving her troubled thoughts away it seemed and said with a sly grin so tell me dish men like yeah kayleigh said you mentioned jon somebody the greatest guy in the world dance said brilliant used to be in silicon valley now he teaches and does consulting the most important thing is that wes and maggie like him she added that her son had had a very difficult time with his mothers dating he hadnt liked anybody until boling of course it didnt help that one guy i introduced them to turned out to be a killer no oh we werent in any danger he was after the same perp i was its just that i wanted to put him in jail my friend wanted to kill him i dont know kayleigh said ominously theres something to be said for that thinking again probably of edwin sharp but the kids love jon its working out well and the singer asked and what you going to tell me or not and here im the kinesics pro dance debated but in the end demurred oh nothing just who knows whats going to happen ive only been a widow a few years im in no hurry sure kayleigh said not exactly believing the lame explanation and dance reflected yes she liked jon boling a lot hey she probably loved him and on more than one occasion lying in bed together during one of the few nights theyd spent out of town shed come close to saying so and shed sensed that he had too he was kind easygoing goodlooking with a great sense of humor but then there was michael michael oneil was a detective with the monterey county office of the sheriff he and dance had worked together for years and if she was instinctively on anyones wavelength it was oneils they worked in timepiece harmony they laughed they loved the same foods and wines they argued like the dickens and never took a word of it personally dance believed that he was as perfect for her as anyone could be aside from that little glitch a wife who had finally left him and their childrennaturally just after dance started going out with jon boling oneil and his wife anne were still married though she was living in san francisco now oneil had mentioned divorce papers being prepared but timetables and plans seemed vague this would be a topic for another evening with kayleigh towne though in ten minutes theyd arrived at the mountain view and darthur morgan steered the suburban to the front of the motel dance said good night to them both it was then that kayleighs phone buzzed and she looked down at the screen frowning she hit answer hello hello she listened for a moment and then said firmly who is this hand on the door lever dance paused and looked back at the singer kayleigh disconnected regarding the screen once more weird what somebody just played a verse from your shadow the title track of her latest album and already a huge hit they didnt say anything whoever it was they just played the first verse dance had downloaded the track and she recalled the words you walk out onstage and sing folks your songs you make them all smile what could go wrong but soon you discover the job takes its toll and everyones wanting a piece of your soul the thing is it was a recording from a concert you dont do live albums dance said recalling that kayleigh preferred the control of the studio she was still staring at the screen right itd be a bootleg but it was really high qualityalmost like a real voice not a recording but who was playing it why you recognize the phone number no not a local area code you think it was edwin she asked her voice going tense with stress looking up at darthur morgan whose dark still eyes were visible in the rearview mirror but wait only my friends and family have this number how could he get it she grimaced maybe the same way he got my email could it be somebody in the band dance asked a practical joke i dont know nobodys done anything like that before give me the number ill make some calls and ill check out edwin too whats his last name sharp no e would you kathryn you bet dance wrote down the number of the call and climbed out of the suburban they said good night i guess we better get home now darthur as the vehicle pulled away kayleigh was looking around the empty parking lot as if edwin sharp were lurking nearby dance headed inside aware that she was humming one line to your shadow as it looped through her thoughts unstoppable what could go wrong what could go wrong what could go wrong chapter dance stopped at the mountain view bar and got a glass of pinot noir then walked to her room and stepped inside shed hung the do not disturb sign on the knob earlier and she left it there now looking forward to that mothers raritysleeping late she showered pulled on a robe and sipping the wine plopped down on the bed she hit speed dial button three hey boss tj scanlon said cheerfully answering on a half ring odd noises emanated from the background ringing shouts calliope music though dance realized that she didnt know exactly what a calliope was are you in an arcade or something carnival date were in line for the roller coaster but ill go around again for you his voice faded as he spoke away from the phone its my boss right you better finish that slurpee before we get on no im telling you really does the word inverted mean anything tj was the most alternative of the agents in the monterey office of the cbi who were in general a conservative lot he was the goto man when it came to long demanding assignments undercover work and any trivia regarding the sixties bob dylan tiedye and lava lamps quirky yes but who was dance to judge here she was taking a week off in fresno and sitting in a stiflingly hot garage to record obscure songs by a group of cheerful and likely undocumented farmworkers need you to check out something tj she gave him what she knew on edwin sharp she then recited the number of the caller whod played the song for kayleigh not long ago tj asked anything in particular on sharp the usual but civil too stalking lawsuits restraining orders here and washington state throw in oregon for good measure will do pine trees pinot noir cheese no thats wisconsin have fun we are i won sadie a panda no im serious lose the slurpee centrifugal force will not do it so long boss dance disconnected she tried jon boling but his phone went to voicemail another sip of wine and then she decided it was time for bed she rose and walked to the window drawing the drapes shut then brushed her teeth ditched the robe and pulled on boxers and a faded pink tshirt way too big kathryn dance was a nightgown girl only on special occasions she rolled toward the light groping for the switch and froze the window before leaving for villaloboss dance had closed the gauze curtain and the heavy drapes the firstfloor room overlooked the parking lot a fourlane street and across it a small park the same drapes shed just closed once again only shed never opened them earlier someone else had been inside her room and pulled them apart who had breached the do not disturb barrier it hadnt been housekeepingthe room wasnt straightened up the bed still mussed from where shed plopped down to call the children that afternoon nothing seemed to have been disturbed her dark green suitcases were where shed left them the clothes still in the closet as before carelessly dangling on theftproof hangers and the five pairs of shoes were exactly where shed set them in a row near the dresser her computer bag didnt seem tampered with and the computer itself was password protected anyway so no one could have read her files or emails shutting the light off she walked to the window and looked out it was eleventhirty and the park across the road was empty wait no someone was in the shadows she couldnt make out a specific person but she saw the tiny orange glow of a cigarette moving slowly as the smoker would lift it for a drag she remembered edwin sharps slow patient scan of her face and body in the restaurant that day how hed carefully read all the information on her id card stalkers she knew were experts at getting information on peopleboth the objects of their obsession and those who threatened to impede their access edwin certainly had shown he was good at such research knowing what he did about kayleighs associates but maybe it was a coincidence there might have been some electrical or plumbing issue and workers had had to come into the room despite the sign on the door she called the front desk but the clerk didnt know if anyone had been inside she made sure all the windows were locked and the chain securely fixed to the door and she conducted one more examination of the park through a crack in the drapes the moon had emerged but it was still too dark and hazy to see much the orange glow of the cigarette flared as the smoker inhaled deeply then the dot dropped to the ground and vanished under a shoe or boot she saw no other motion had he left because shed shut the light out and presumably gone to sleep dance waited a moment more then climbed into bed she closed her eyes and wondered why she bothered sleep she knew would be a long long time coming chapter reeling through his mind was jackson brownes the loadout from the seventies album running on empty the tune an homage to roadies a sortof homage you got the impression the singer came first but dont they always still nobody else ever wrote a song dedicated to bobby prescotts profession and he hummed it often now close to midnight he parked near the convention center and climbed out of the bands quest van stretching after the marathon drive to and from bakersfield to pick up the custombuilt amp kayleigh towne preferred that her musicians use amps with tubeslike oldtime tvs and radios thered been a huge debate about which was a better sound solidstate amps versus the tube models with the tube purists contending that that older technology produced an indescribable clipping sound when played in overdrive which digital amps had never been able to duplicate not surprisingly this had been bishop townes philosophy and when the old man as his own roadies called him was performing the stage was filled with marshall jcm tsls fender deluxe reverb iis traynor custom valve ycvwrs and vox acs bobby was a guitarist as well there werent many roadies techs or personal assistants in the music world who couldnt sit in at a show if they absolutely had to he himself thought the richness of tubes was noticeable but only when playing blues he now unlocked the stage door at the convention center and wheeled the big unit inside he also had a box of light mounts and safety cables thinking again of the strip light falling that morning jesus performing could be a dangerous business his father had been a recording engineer in london in the sixties and seventies back then the seriousminded professionals robert senior worked withthe beatles and stones for instancewere outnumbered by crazy selfdestructive musicians who managed to kill themselves pretty frequently with drugs liquor cars and aggressively poor judgment but even taking bad behavior out of the picture performing could be dangerous electricity was the biggest riskhed known of three performers electrocuted onstage and two singers and a guitarist hit by lightning one roadie had fallen from a high stage and broken his neck a half dozen had died in traffic accidents often because they fell asleep and several had been crushed to death when gear trucks brakes failed and the vehicles jumped the chocks but a light coming unfixed that was weird and had never happened in his years as a roadie and endangering kayleigh he actually shivered thinking about that tonight the cavernous hall was filled with shadows cast by the exit lights but rather than the ill ease kayleigh had described that morning bobby felt a low twist of pleasure being here he and kayleigh had always been in neartotal harmony except for one thing to her music was a business a task a profession and concert halls were about acoustics only for bobby the romantic these places were special almost sacred he believed that halls like this continued to echo with the sounds of all the musicians whod performed there and this ugly concrete venue in fresno had one hell of a history a local boy himself bobby had seen dylan here and paul simon and u and vince gill and union station and arlo guthrie and richard thompson and rosanne cash and sting and garth brooks and james taylor and shania and well the list was endless and their voices and the ringing sound of their guitars and horn sections and reeds and drums changed the very fiber of the place he believed as he approached the strip light that had fallen he noticed that someone had moved it he had left instructions that the heavy black light fixture shouldnt be touched after hed lowered it to the stage but now it sat on the very edge above the orchestra pit a good thirty feet from where it had stopped swinging after it fell hed ream somebody for that hed wanted to see exactly what had happened crouching down bobby examined the unit what the hell had gone wrong could it be that asshole edwin sharp maybe bobby prescott never heard the footsteps of whoever came up behind him he simply felt the hands slam into his back and he went forward barking a brief scream as the concrete floor of the orchestra pit twenty feet below raced up to break his jaw and arm oh jesus jesus he lay on his belly staring at the bone starkly white and flecked with blood that poked through his forearm skin bobby moaned and screamed and cried out for help who who did it edwin he mightve heard me tell kayleigh in the café that i was going to be here late help me silence bobby tried to reach into his pocket for his mobile the pain was too great he nearly fainted well try again youre going to bleed to death then over his gasping breath he heard a faint sound above him a scraping he twisted his head and looked up no god no he watched the strip light directly above him easing toward the edge of the stage no who is that no bobby struggled to crawl away clawing at the concrete floor with the fingers of his unbroken arm but his legs werent working either one inch two move roll aside but too late the light slammed into his back going a hundred miles an hour he felt another snap high in his body and all the pain went away my back my back his vision crinkled bobby prescott came to sometime laterseconds minutes hours he didnt know all he knew was that the room was bathed in astonishing light the spotlight sitting on his back had been turned on all thousand watts pouring from the massive lamps he then saw on the wall the flicker of shadows cast by flames at first he didnt know what was on firehe felt no heat whatsoever but then the repulsive scent of burning hair burning flesh filled the small space and he understood monday monday chapter at the braying of the phone kathryn dance awoke her first thought the children then her parents then michael oneil maybe on assignment one of the gang or terroristrelated cases hed been working on lately as she fumbled for her mobile dropped it then fumbled some more she ran through a number of scenarios as to why anyone would call at the crack of dawn when she was on vacation and jon boling was he all right she righted the phone but without her glasses she couldnt see the number she hit the green button yes woke you up boss what sorry sorry what do you mean sorry is everyone all right there one sentence made of many dance was remembering as she did all too often the call from the state trooper about billa brief sympathetic but emotionless call explaining to her that the life shed planned on with her husband the life shed believed would forever be her rock would not happen not here there was it just that she was exhausted she blinked what time was it five am four tj scanlon said i didnt know if you needed me struggling upright tugging down the tshirt that had become a noose during an apparently restless night start at the beginning oh you didnt hear no i didnt hear sorry what do you mean okay got a notice on the wire about a homicide in fresno happened late last night early this morning more awake now or less unawake tell me somebody connected with kayleigh townes band lord who brushing her dark blond hair from her face the worse the news the calmer kathryn dance became partly training partly nature partly mother though as a kinesics expert she was quite aware of her own bobbing foot she stalled it somebody named robert prescott she wondered bobby yes that was his last name prescott this was bad shed noted from their interaction yesterday that he and kayleigh were close friends in addition to being work associates details nothing yet dance also thought back to edwins unnatural smile his leering eyes his icily calm demeanor which she believed might conceal bundled rage tj said it was just a oneparagraph notice on the wire information only not a request for assistance the cbi was available to help out local california public safety offices with major crime investigations but with a few exceptions the bureau agents waited until they were contacted the cbi had a limited number of bodies to go around california was a big state and a lot of bad things happened there the younger agent continued the vic died at the convention center where the concert was going to be held on friday go on its being handled by the fresnomadera consolidated sheriffs office the sheriff is anita gonzalez the head detective is p k madigan been on the force a long time forever dont know anything else about him ill get over there now you have anything on sharp yet the stalker no warrants or court orders came up here nothing in california at all still waiting for the locals from washington and oregon the phone number you gave me that somebody called kayleigh on it was a prepaid bought with cash from a drugstore in burlingame south of san francisco where the airport was located no video and no other record of the transaction the clerks have no idea who it was it was three days ago no other details yet keep on it email sharps full bio anything you can get your command is what i wish for boss they disconnected what time was it the room was still dark but light showed behind the drapes glasses on oh eightthirty the crack of midmorning she walked into the bathroom for a brief hot shower in twenty minutes she was dressed in black jeans a black tshirt and a silk business jacket navy blue conservative matteroffact the heat would be challenging with these clothes but the possibility of duty loomed shed learned long ago that a woman officer had to be a length ahead of men when it came to appearing professional sad but the way of the world she took her laptop with her just in case the intruder returned if in fact she had been intruded upon yesterday then she was out the door slipping the do not disturb sign onto the lshaped knob of the hotel room wondering briefly if the prohibition would have any effect outside under an uncompromising sun her temples face and armpits bristled as sweat flowed dance fished for the pathfinder key in her coach purse and absently slapped her hip where her glock normally resided a weapon that was today conspicuously absent chapter had there really been just one victim pulling into the convention center lot aiming for the stage door dance noted more emergency and public safety personnel than seemed necessary two dozen easily walking slowly speaking on phones or radios carrying battered equipment green and red and yellowthe colors of stoplights colors of childrens toys four fire trucks two ambulances eight police cruisers and several unmarked she wondered again if tjs information was flawed had others died she drove forward to a dodge unmarked but obvious parked and climbed out a woman in a deputys uniform glanced dances way c stanning stamped on a plate above her taut breast her hair was equally tight and it ended in pert incongruous pigtails tipped in blue rubber bands help you dance displayed her cbi card and the woman didnt seem to know what to make of it you is sacramento involved dance nearly said she was just here on vacation and believed she knew the victim but law enforcement is a world in which instinct countswhen dealing both with suspects and with allies she said not yet i happened to be nearby stanning juggled these words perhaps factoring in her own instructions from on high and said okay dance continued on toward the bland concrete convention center a slash of glaring light hit her in the face brutally as she approached she slipped into the shade but this route was just as unpleasant the air between two tall walls leading to the front doors was dead and stifling she stepped inside and in a half second the relief of the airconditioning was utterly negated by the stench kathryn dance had been a law enforcer for some years and had attended hundreds of crime scenes being an investigator with cbi she was rarely a first responder and didnt do forensics much of the horror had been tamed by the time she arrived blood staunched bodies covered with washable tarps body parts recovered and cataloged so the scent of burned flesh and hair was unexpected it hit like a fist in her belly she didnt hesitate but she did steel herself and pushed past the assault somehow keeping the nausea under control she walked into the massive arena which would hold thirty thousand she guessed all the overheads were on revealing the tired and shabby décor it was as if a play or concert had ended and the promoters were eager to prod the audience into the lobby to buy cds and souvenirs on the stage and main floor were a dozen people in the varied uniforms of law enforcement fire and ems climbing to the stage she joined a cluster at the edge looking down into the orchestra pit it was from there that a faint trail of fetid smoke rose slowing she struggled not to gag then continued on what had happened she wondered she recalled the falling light from yesterday dance noted immediately from their posture and the sweep of their eyes that two of the law officers who all wore tan uniforms were senior to the others one was a woman hovering in her fifties with long hair and a pocked face with latina features she was stocky and stood in a pose that suggested she disliked the uniformthe tight slacks and the closefitting blouse which blossomed outward at the waist painted on rolls of fat the man she was speaking to was caucasian though sporting a dark tan he also was stocky but his was targeted weight situated in his gut which rode above thin hips and legs a large round face crisscrossed with sun wrinkles his postureleaning forward shoulders upand still squinting gray eyes suggested an arrogant and difficult man his head hair was black and thick he wore a revolver a longbarreled colt while on the hips of everyone else here were the semiauto glocks that were de rigueur among law enforcers in california ah yes she was right in her guess he was p k madigan the head of detectives conversation slowed as they turned to see the slim woman in jeans and sport coat stride toward them madigan asked brusquely and you are in a way that didnt mean what the words said at all he looked over her shoulder darkly toward who might have let her breach his outer perimeter dance noted the woman was named gonzalez the sheriff and so she addressed her and displayed her id which both of the incharge duo examined carefully im sheriff gonzalez this is chief detective madigan the decision not to offer first names in an introduction is often an attempt to assert power dance merely noted the choice now she wasnt here to flex muscles my office called me about a homicide i happened to be in the area on another matter could be official might not be let the sheriff and chief detective guess dance added im also a friend of kayleigh townes when i heard the vic was in her crew i came right over here well thanks kathryn madigan said and the use of first names is an attempt to disempower the flicker in gonzalezs eyes at this faint affrontbut absence of any look madigans waytold dance reams about the chief detective hed carved out a major fiefdom at the fmcso the detective continued but we dont need any cbi involvement at this point wouldnt you say sheriff id think not gonzalez said staring dance in the eyes it was a magnetic look and based notas in the case of madiganon gender or jurisdictional power but on the womans determination not to glance at a figure perhaps four sizes smaller than hers whatever our rank or profession were frail human beings first madigan continued you said you were here on another matter i look over the interagencies pretty good every morning didnt see any bureau activity here theyyoudont always tell us of course hed called her bluff a personal matter dance steamed ahead the victim was bobby prescott the head of the road crew thats right anyone else hurt madigan wasnt inclined to answer and used a nearby deputy as an excuse to turn away and have a very quiet conversation with him leaving his boss to respond to the interloper as she liked sheriff gonzalez offered only bobby and what happened madigan rejoined the conversation were in the preliminary stage not sure at this point he definitely didnt want her here but since she was with a senior agency he had at least to act deferential dance was a large dog wandering into a picnicunwanted but possibly too dangerous to shoo away cod a pause then gonzalez said he was doing some work on the stage last night it seems he slipped and fell a spotlight landed on him it was on he caught fire cause was blood loss and the burns lord what a terrible way to die mustve burned for a while the alarms didnt go off the smoke detectors down there in the pit werent working we dont know why the first thing in her mind was the image of edwin sharp glancing toward bobby prescott with that fake smile and with eyes that could easily reflect a desire to turn the roadie into a bag of dust you ought to be aware bout mr sharp our stalker madigan asked well yes one of the boys with the crew tye slocum told me that there was an incident yesterday at the cowboy saloon dance described what she had seen and heard bobby confronted him a couple of times and edwin probably overheard bobby say he was going to come back here later last night and check out some equipment malfunction it would be late because he had to go to bakersfield to pick something up madigan added absently edwins on our radar we know hes renting a house near woodward park north part of town for a month dance recalled that edwin had been quite forthcoming about his residence she was still curious why hed rented for that time length dance noted too that both madigan and she herself tended to refer to the stalker by his first name this often happened when dealing with suspects who were potentially ed emotionally disturbed dance reminded herself that whatever name they used not to sell the young man short the chief detective took a phone call then he was back with dance though only for the briefest of times and with the briefest of smilesjust as phony as edwins she reflected appreciate you stopping by well give cbi a call if theres anything we need dance looked over the stage the misty air above the pit gonzalez offered so long now despite the doublebarreled goodbye dance didnt feel like leaving just yet how did the light fall on him the sheriff said maybe tugged it after him when he fell the cord you know was it a strip light dance asked madigan muttered dunno what that is take a look the last sentence was delivered with a bit of challenge dance did it was indeed a hard thing to see the scorched body and yes the unit was a fourlamp strip that mightve been the one that fell yesterday tye mentioned that madigan said were looking into it he was clearly growing weary of her well all righty then he began to turn away how did it come undone wing nuts worked loose he nodded up to the scaffolding dance said and i wonder why bobby fell not like it isnt marked yellow warning tape clearly indicated the edge of the stage over his shoulder madigan offered a dismissive lot of questions you betcha then a womans loud haunting voice from the back of the hall no no no the last time that word was repeated it became a scream despite the hot dank atmosphere of the hall dance felt a stinging chill slither down her back kayleigh towne sprinted down the aisle to the stage where her friend had so horribly died chapter dance had seen the young singer a half dozen times and shed always been carefully if not perfectly assembled but today she was the most disheveled dance had ever seen no makeup long hair askew eyes puffy from crying not lack of sleep theres a difference dance knew instead of her ubiquitous contact lenses she wore thin blackframed glasses she was breathless detective p k madigan instantly became a different person his fake smile of irritation at dance became a frown of genuine sympathy for kayleigh he stepped down the stairs and intercepted the young woman on the floor before she could get to the stage kayleigh dear no no you shouldnt be here theres no reason for you to be bobby im afraid it is they told me but i was praying it was a mistake then sheriff gonzalez joined them on the main floor and put her arm around the girls shoulders dance wondered if all friends and next of kin got this treatment or only celebrities and then decided the cynical thought was unkind kayleigh towne was the citys star yes but she was at the moment a woman in terrible distress im sorry kayleigh gonzalez said im so sorry it was him edwin i know it go arrest him hes parked in front of my house right now hes what madigan asked hes parked in the lot of the nature preserve across the street hes just sitting there in that goddamn red car of his frowning madigan made a call and told a deputy to check it out arrest him well have to see kayleigh may not be as easy as that dance noticed darthur morgan standing arms crossed in the back of the theater looking around carefully the hells that madigan grumbled catching sight of the man my bodyguard kayleigh said gasping from the crying oh dance returned to the edge of the stage and looked down the nausea rose again from the smell here concentrated but she ignored it and studied the scene carefully the strip light six feet long or so lay atop the scorched remains of bobby prescott dance knew the messages the body gave offin life and in death she now assessed the broken bones the claw shape of the hands partly due to the typical fire victims contractions the pugilistic attitude but also because hed been trying to drag his broken body out from underneath the edge of the stage he was headed away from the stairsnot the logical direction one would crawl if he was just seeking help he fell first dance said to the deputy standing next to her softly so kayleigh would not hear a few minutes before the lamp hit him whats that maam the man in his midthirties of rectangular build with a luxurious black mustache stepped closer he too was tanned like madigan though perhaps he also had a naturally dark complexion his tag said det d harutyun she nodded down into the hole as the crime scene men or women in jumpsuits moved the light away and began processing the body she said his legs the way theyre angled his hands he fell first he tried to get out of the way then the light fell the deputy examined the scene silently then the light teetered and fell he knew it was coming cause he tugged on the cord but the wire was plugged into an outlet on the stage not in the pit both she and the detective noticed this simultaneously bobby couldnt have pulled it down on himself she asked and whys it plugged into the wall there a light like thats mounted on the rigging above the stage thats where the power is and whys it plugged in at all thatd be worth mentioning too ill do that which he now did walking down the stairs offering some words to kayleigh and then pulling madigan aside whispering to him the detective nodded his face folded into a frown okay he called were treating the stage as a crime scene and the scaffolding where the light fell from yesterday clear everybody off and get charlies folks searching there hell weve already contaminated the damn place bad enough dance wondered if harutyun had taken credit for the observations probably had but that didnt matter to her as long as they got all the helpful evidence they could thats what was important gonzalez was fielding calls on her iphone concentrating dance now joined kayleigh standing alone in a frantic state looking in many different directions she began talking rapidly gesturing dance was reminded of her own unhinged behavior in the few hours after she learned of the death of her husband an fbi agentnot a victim of criminal activity but of a careless driver on highway dance hugged her hard and asked how she could help phone calls to be made rides to be arranged kayleigh thanked her and said no shed make the calls herself oh kathryn can you believe it i i cant believe it bobby her eyes strayed to the orchestra pit and dance prepared to stop her physically from looking at the body if she needed to but the singer turned instead to madigan and gonzalez and said that she thought somebody had been watching her yesterday here no been sure of it where pointing in those corridors there aliciamy assistantsaw something too but we didnt see anyone clearly dance said tell them about the phone call last night this contribution from the interloper at least got madigans attention in a trembling voice kayleigh said to dance god you think that has something to do with this what gonzalez asked kayleigh explained about the call shed received in the car someone playing part of the title song from the bands most recent album your shadow kayleigh added for what its worth the recording was very high qualitytrue fidelity with your eyes closed you couldnt tell the difference between someone really singing or the digital replay only a pro would have a recorder like that or a fanatical fan dance suggested she then mentioned what shed learned from tj about the mobile phone madigan didnt seem pleased that a law enforcer from another jurisdiction had already started to investigate his case though he wrote down the details at that moment another person joined them deputy c stanning from out front first names crystal madigan said coolly she said reportersre starting to show up chief theyll want a press you keeping people out of the crime scene deputy he didnt look toward dance but he didnt need to stanning did the job for him her oblique apology big area to keep track of lot of onlookers you know curious folks im keeping them back best i can im hopin you do let the reporters cool their heels this time the glance was at the large bodyguard in the back of the hall the sheriff asked kayleigh tell me againwhat exactly did you hear on the phone just a verse from my song he didnt say anything the caller or she no just the song sheriff gonzalez took another call herself had a brief conversation then disconnected congressman daviss here ive got to meet him and his security detail im sorry for your loss kayleigh this was offered sincerely and accompanied by two firm hands on the girls shoulders anything i can do let me know a look passed from the older woman to her chief of detectives meaning do what you need to on this case this is big news here and kayleighs our own nothing is going to happen to her nothing the sheriff scanned dance and said goodbye she left along with two of the other deputies dance said to madigan my specialtys interrogation and interviewing detective if you have a suspect or witness youd like me to talk to just give me a call she handed him her card i do a bit of that myself madigan offered well all righty then kathryn he pocketed the card like a used tissue oh wait that seminar harutyun said frowning in salinas body language right kinetics that was you kinesics yes he turned to madigan alberto and i went last year it was helpful you were funny too seminar madigan repeated funny well thats good to know heres a thought kayleigh you saw somebody here yesterday just a shadow the girl said he smiled shadowsre left by somethin or someone why dont you talk to people in the crew who were here kathryn any convention center workers too see what they have to say i could do that detective but thats more along the lines of canvassing im sure the people with the crew and anybody else here would cooperate im usually involved if theres reason for a witness or suspect to be deceptive or if they cant remember important facts and i sure hope we get somebody you can use those seminar skills of yours on kathryn but until then itd be a big help if youd see what the others have to say of course dont feel you have to seminar skills shed been outmaneuvered given a necessary but minor task to keep her out of their hair the dog had been sniffing around for juicy scraps at the picnic and got tossed a dry bone instead be glad to dance said she pulled out her iphone and got from kayleigh the names of the people with the crew and convention center employees who were here yesterday inputting them one by one the medical examiner arrived and approached the senior detective they had a quiet conversation dance called to kayleigh ill see you later the young womans eyes looked so mournful it was hard to keep contact dance started up the aisle when the thought slammed her jesus she turned back kayleigh last night the caller only played one verse right the first verse and the chorus and its about a concert hall dance said well yeah sort of its kind of about being a public person but it mentions a venue i dont know whos behind this dance said but if its a stalker like edwin i think hes going to keep killing oh kathryn kayleigh whispered again he might hurt somebody else committing murder was rare among stalkers but in her years as a reporter a jury consultant and a cop dance had learned that when it came to violent crime an outlier could kill you just as dead as a perp who fell smack in the middle of the bell curve the basis for stalking is repetitive obsessive behavior i think we should assume hes going to make more calls and more people will be at risk id get a wire on kayleighs phone and lets look at the other verses of that song and find out who or where he might attack again madigan asked but why would the perp do that whats in it for him dance replied i dont know some stalkers are simply psychotic sounds kinda farfetched madigan said mostly he seemed irritated that dance had upset kayleigh i think its important seems you do the chief detective took a call listened and said to kayleigh that was one of the patrols they cruised past your house and didnt see him or his car where is he where did he go kayleigh sounded panicked they dont know madigan looked at his watch he told harutyun to go outside and make a statement to the reporters dont give em anything specific only bobbys name being investigated apparent accident you know the drill and keep people outa here madigan apparently didnt think deputy stanning was up to the task he dismissed dance too in a stony voice impatient and now if you could get to that interviewing id sure appreciate it kathryn dance hugged kayleigh once more she then accompanied harutyun toward the exit thanks for talking to him about the light detective harutyun made some sense call me dennis kathryn i heard deadpan delivery they both nodded at a somber darthur morgan as they passed his eyes left kayleigh for a mere portion of a second in a few minutes the two were pushing out the front door of the facility dance was grateful to be in scorchfree air again even if it was searing hot harutyuns square face though registered distress the line of his shoulders had changed too he was looking at the clutch of reporters and tv vans dance understood hed rather be chasing down a perp in a dark alley than handling this duty public speaking perhaps a major and universal fear dance slowed typing an email into her phone she sent it on its way detective the columnar man stopped wary but seemingly grateful for any delay in confronting the media she continued i just downloaded a set of the lyricskayleighs song the one she heard on her phone last night he seemed unsure of where this was going and ive forwarded a copy to the detective division to your attention me id really appreciate it if youd look over the second versewell all of them but the second verse right awayand let me know if you can think of any places it could mean where a perp might decide to kill somebody else based on the words like the concert hall in the first verse it might be impossible to guess the scene in particular but if we can just narrow it down a little wed have a head start if he calls again a hesitation i could check with chief madigan about that dance said slowly you could sure harutyun not looking her way surveying the reporters the chiefs got the best forensic outfit in the valley better than bakersfields and his arrest and conviction rates in the top ten percent in the state i can tell hes good she said eyes still on the voracious journalists i know hed appreciate you getting him statements from those witnesses dance said firmly look over the lyrics please swallowing the big detective didnt respond but stepped forward reluctantly to meet the pack of hungry wolves chapter bobby prescotts trailer was an impressive doublewide a buccaneer company cole model about fifty feet by twentyfive or so kathryn dance guessed tan exterior white trim it was yes a mobile home but a crumbling cinderblock foundation certified that it wasnt very the dry ground around it was cracked and beige the grass losing the battle but some hydrangeas and boxwood putting up a good fight the scene wasnt crowded only law enforcers some curious children with bicycles or skateboards and a few older spectators were present most adults were either not interested or didnt want to draw attention to themselves it was that sort of neighborhood there were no other residents in the trailer tj had reported that bobby prescott was unmarried and had lived here alone it was pm the sun at a september angle but the air was still hot as july two fmcso cruisers were parked in the front and dance nosed past them to the carport and climbed out of the pathfinder chief detective madigan and dennis harutyun were standing together talking to the kids well they had been doing so now they were focused on her the mustachioed detective nodded noncommittally his boss said ah kathryn not even a faux smile from madigan beneath the leafthin veneer was angerat her and probably at himself for having to play the politics game and not being able to simply kick the cbi agent out altogether her impression was that he was surprised she hadnt done as hed hopedgot bored playing smalltown cop and just gone away no such luck dennis harutyun regarded her solemnly and she wondered if hed bothered to download and review the lyrics to your shadow probably not he brushed his mustache with the back of a finger and returned to interviewing locals he moved with the same calm demeanor she recalled from earlier his personal baseline but he was also cautious looking around frequently as if edwin lurked nearby armed with a handgun which she couldnt be sure wasnt the case voyeuristic perps like stalkers always set you on edge while the spying gives them comfort p k madigan continued so you didnt have a chance to talk to those witnesses i did yes but im afraid it wasnt very productive i talked to alicia kayleighs pa and tye slocum and the rest of the crew darthur morgan who her security guard that the big guy was there earlier thats right the facility had a security guard and two other people one was a gafferan electricianand a carpenter to help out the band they had to be present because of the union rules i interviewed them too their security man said three of the doors were unlocked but that wasnt unusual during the day if theres no show its a pain to keep finding him and unlocking the doors in front the side and back so they usually just leave them open nobody spotted anyone inside they didnt recognize on the scaffolding or anywhere else you got all that in three hours eighty minutes actually the rest had been devoted to learning where bobby spent timehiking in a state park nearby no leads there hanging out in a guitar store and a radio station with friends nothing helpful and sitting in a particular diner in the tower district where he drank copious amounts of coffee and nothing stronger suggesting he was in recovery ditto the lack of leads and finally discovering where he lived hence her presence here she chose not to mention this though howd your crime scene team do at the convention center a pause collected a lot of stuff dont know the results yet another fresnomadera consolidated cruiser arrivedcrystal stanning was at the wheel she parked behind dances nissan climbed out and joined the others she too looked around uneasily thats the thing about a crime like this you never quite know where the stalker is maybe miles away maybe outside your window stanning it seemed wanted to report to her boss about whatever her mission had been but would say nothing until dance was elsewhere or she had the okay the sweating madigan was impatient he snapped the phone service plus drugs in burlingame cash they dont have any videos maybe thats why he went there dance had told them all of this information but then stanning continued and you were right chief he bought three other phones at the same time a question dance had not thought to have tj scanlon ask madigan sighed so this boy may have more on his plate which was she guessed a backhanded acknowledgment of her farfetched concern four verses in your shadow dance reflected four victims and that song might not be the only template for murder kayleigh had written lots of tunes i got the numbers and the esns you needed both the phone number and the electronic serial number of a mobile in order to trace it we should get em shut off madigan said so edwinll have to buy one here easier to trace we dont know its edwin dance observed but said nothing sure detective stanning had three studs in one ear and a single silver dangling spiral in the other lobe a dot in her nose too marking where a ball might perch on off hours but dance said id keep them active like we havent figured out what hes up to and then put a locator notice on them if the perp calls again we can triangulate madigan paused then glanced at crystal stanning do that who should i call redman in communications he can do it motion from across the street where a more modest trailer squatted in sad grass a round woman stood on the concrete stoop smoking a cigarette sunburned shoulders freckles she wore a tight white strapless sundress with purple and red stains at toddler level she eyed everyone cautiously madigan told stanning to help harutyun canvass he walked to the shoulder and after two pickups had passed he crossed the road making for the heavyset woman dance following the detective glanced back at her but she didnt slow down the neighbor walked forward uncertainly to greet them they met halfway from her mailbox in a rasping voice she said i heard the news i mean about bobby i couldnt believe it she repeated fast it was on the news thats how i heard she took a drag the innocent usually act as guilty as the guilty yes maam im deputy madigan this is officer dancer she didnt correct him your name tabby nysmith tabatha bobby never caused any trouble no drugs or drinking he was just into music only complaint was a party one time kinda loud cant believe hes dead what happened the news didnt say we arent sure what happened maam not yet was it gangs like i say we arent sure the nicest guy really hed show tony hes my oldest these fancy guitars he had he had one that mick jagger played years ago he said bobbys daddy worked with them and the beatles too or thats what he said we didnt know how would you know but tony was in heaven did you see anybody here recent you never saw before no sir anybody he had a fight with loud voices drug activity nope didnt see anybody here last night or this morning didnt see anything youre sure yessir she pressed out her cigarette and lit another one dance noted from the butts by the door that she at least had the decency to step outside to smoke to keep from infecting the children she continued its hard for me to see his place she gestured at the windows in the front of her trailer obscured by bushes im after tony senior to trim the bushes but he never gets around to it a look toward dance a smile men would your husband have seen anything hes on the road truck driver been away for three days no four all right then maam thank you for your time sure officer will there be a funeral or anything couldnt say good day to you madigan was loping back toward the trailer but dance turned the other way followed the woman back to her trailer and her brood excuse me uhhuh if i could ask a few more things im sorry i really have to get back to the kids how many what children oh four i have two tabatha smiled i heard this like expression diminishing returns i dont exactly know what it means but i think of it having two kids sets the stage you know you can have ten more and its not a whole lot worser diminishing returns probably wasnt what the woman meant but dance grinned understandingly two is fine for me but you work the tiny sentence carried a lot then tabatha said i really dont know much else than what i told that man she looked at dances trim figure pressed jeans and her sunglasses whose frames were the color of canned cranberry sauce a whole different world and i work i left sheryl and annette watching the little one the woman kept walking fast for her bulky frame she drew hard on the cigarette then paused to crush it out carefully smokers did that in california the land of brushfires just one or two questions if the baby starts crying ill help you change him her whats her name caitlyn pretty mines maggie then they were at the screen door of her trailer tabatha peered through the dusty rusted mesh dance couldnt see much other than toys plastic tricycles castles doll houses pirate chests the house was dim inside but exuded still heat the tv was on one of the last remaining soap operas tabatha lifted an eyebrow just a few more details about bobby dance was continuing the discussion with tabatha because of an important rule in kinesic analysis the volunteering principle when someone answers a question then immediately offers what he or she anticipates will be the next question that person is often trying to deflect or diffuse a line of inquiry dance had noted that tabatha said she hadnt seen anybody here last nightor this morning why had she felt it important to mention that it made no sense unless she was covering up something dance removed her sunglasses i really need to get in to the children tabatha what did you see this morning at bobbys trailer nothing she said quickly effective kinesic analysis of witnesses and suspects involves conversing with the individual for a long period of timedays or ideally weeks initially nothing is said about the crime at all the interviewer asks questions and makes comments that relate to the subjects life all topics about which the truth is known this establishes the suspects baseline behaviorhow he or she speaks and acts when responding honestly its then that the interviewer segues into inquiries about the crime and compares the subjects behavior when answering those questions to the baseline any variation suggests stress and therefore possible deception however even without establishing a baseline there are a few mannerisms that suggest lying at least to an experienced investigator like kathryn dance tabathas voice was now slightly higher in pitch than earliera sign of stress a glance toward bobbys trailer in front of which madigan and his deputies were staring back at dance she ignored them and said calmly it would be good for everybody if you could give us a little more information everybody you too at least she wasnt a crier often at this stage when dance tipped witnesses or suspects into admitting theyd been lying many women and a surprising number of men began to cry it could take upward of an hour to convince them that they were not subhuman for being deceptive they were simply scared or concerned about their families or had other reasons tabatha gave no reaction other than a thoughtful furrowing of her thick eyebrows as she probably considered the risk to her children if she was honest dance assessed she was on the borderline well make sure youre looked out for but this is pretty serious a low voice woman to woman adult to adult you can say that its easy to say that i give you my word one mother to another a very long ten seconds passed there was somebody in the trailer this morning could you describe them i couldnt see the face causa the angle you know just the body chest and shoulders through the window like a you know silhouette not even clothes thats all i could see i swear often a deceptive flag that last sentence can also mean exactly what it says as dance now believed which window that one there in the front she pointed it was horizontal two feet high three wide you came out for a smoke and saw this person im aiming to quit i will worried about the weight you know that always happens when you quit smoking i try dont really want to gain any more pounds tony seniors commented on it and he should talk mr budweiser what time eleven eleventhirty did you see a car or when the person left no then she noticed to her alarm that madigan had given up shooting hate rays at her had turned and was nearly to the front door of bobbys trailer thank you tabatha go be with your children will i have to testify as dance sprinted toward the trailer she called over her shoulder well look after you promise then shouting detective stop chapter p k madigans hand was nearly to the doorknob his eyes slid dances way and she saw his face cloud with the irritation he mustered so well but he also seemed to understand instantly that she had a point about not wanting him to go inside or she deduced from his hand dipping toward his pistol maybe some risk awaited he stepped back so did dennis harutyun dance hurried across the street and joined them anybody inside the chief detective asked sharply dance steadied her breathing dont think so but i dont know the thing is the perpor somebodywas here this morning eleven eleventhirty you dont want to contaminate anything in here i think we should assume it was the killer she know that for sure the time a glance toward tabathas trailer probably the tv was on and it wouldve been all morning her husbands away a lot and shed keep it on for comfort shed know the time according to the show she was watching whod she see can she id em no and i believe her she didnt see a face or vehicle a deep sigh he muttered to harutyun get csu over here and tape off the property as much as you can all of the trailer the careful deputy made a call madigan and dance both stepped away from the trailer and stood on the crumbling walk whatd edwin or whoever be doing here afterward i dont know couldve been a friend one of the crew a friend maybe i talked to the crew they wouldve said something about being here or acted deceptive and none of them did silence for a moment as he stared at the door wanting to go in he rocked on his feet he asked her suddenly you like to fish no hm he studied the crisp jaundiced grass you dont fish or you dont like to neither but ive got a friend whod live on his boat in monterey bay if he could michael oneil was always out in the choppy water often with dances son wes and his own children sometimes dances father a retired marine biologist went along monterey bay hm salmon madigan looked around i like to fish you catch and release no seems crueler to me i catch and eat michael does that too michael my friend more silence dense as the growing heat as they watched harutyun and stanning string the yellow tape i told her tabatha that wed have somebody keep an eye on her we can do that its important we can do that he repeated with a bit of edge to harutyun get a car over here some rookie keep an eye on the place that trailer across the street too thanks dance said he didnt respond she sensed old spice or something cloveoriented rising from his large body he actually wore a gun belt with single spare cartridges stuck into loops pointing downward like a cowboys no speed loaders those accessories that contained a disk of six or eight rounds to be dropped quickly into an open cylinder of a revolver detectives in fresno probably didnt have much cause to shoot people much less reload quickly madigan stepped closer to the door examined the lock couldve been jimmied they waited in more silence for the crime scene unit to arrive and when they did dance was again impressed at the efficiency of the operation the team dressed fast in full jumpsuits masks and booties andshe was surprisedtwo of them with weapons drawn cleared the interior of the trailer making sure there were no threats most police outfits have swat or regular officersunswathed in evidenceprotective clothinghandle this job resulting in contamination of the scene csu proceeded to process the trailer dusting and using alternative light source wands for prints taking trace evidence samples electrostatic footprints on the front stoop and inside looking for tire treads and anything else the perp might have discarded or shed dances friend lincoln rhyme was perhaps the countrys leading expert in forensic evidence and crime scene work she herself was a bit skeptical of the extreme reliance on the art one case she knew of had nearly resulted in the execution of an innocent man because certain clues had been planted by the real perp on the other hand rhyme and his partner amelia sachs had worked miracles in identifying and convicting suspects on the basis of nearly nonexistent evidence she noted that madigans eyes grew animated for the first time since shed arrived as he watched the team scour the grounds and move in and out of the trailer he likes his forensics she thought hes a thing cop not a people cop an hour later theyd finished and carted out some boxes and bags both paper and plastic and announced that they were releasing the scene dance had a feeling she wasnt going to be welcome much longer despite the angling conversation she and madigan had had she made quickly for the trailer stepping inside the place which smelled of hot plastic furnishings she froze it was a museum shed never seen anything like this not in a residence posters record jackets guitars statuettes of musicians a hammond b organ parts of wind and string instruments ancient amplifiers and hundreds of vinyl records lps singles and ancient s reels of tape she found a collection of turntables and an old nagra reeltoreel made by the kudelski group the best portable tape recorder ever manufactured looking at all of these items it was like seeing beautiful but antiquated cars these analog devices had long ago lost the battle to digital still they were to dance as apparently they had been to bobby works of art she found hundreds of concert souvenirs mostly from the sixties through the eighties mugs tshirts caps even pensan item not surprisingly commemorating that most intellectual of singersongwriters paul simon whose american tune had inspired the name of her music website the majority of these artifacts though involved the country world photos covering nearly every square foot of wall space revealed the history of the genre which dance believed had reimagined itself more than any other musical form in america over the years she spotted photos of musicians from the traditional erathe grand ole opry and rockabilly stylesin the s and from the era of country rock a decade later followed by outlaw with the likes of waylon jennings hank williams jr and willie nelson here were photos and autographs of dolly parton kenny rogers and eddie rabbit who were part of the country pop trend in the late seventies and eighties the neotraditionalist movement in the eighties was a move back to the early era and brought superstar status to randy travis george strait the judds travis tritt and dozens of othersall of whom were represented here in the nineties country became international with artists like clint black vince gill garth brooks shania twain mindy mccready and faith hill on the one hand and a strong alternative movement that rejected slick nashville production values on the other pictures of lyle lovett and steve earl who were part of the latter stared down from one wall the present day was on display too here was a picture of carrie underwood yes of american idol fame and an autographed copy of the sheet music for taylor swifts fifteen which spoke not about truck driving or god or patriotism or other traditional country themes but about high school angst kayleigh townes career was of course well documented dance knew there were many historians of the music scene in the past fifty years but she doubted they had as many artifacts as bobby did no death is worse than any other but dance felt a deep pang that bobby prescotts devotion to archiving all aspects of country music in the twentieth century had died with him it was the entire worlds loss dance pulled herself away from the archives and walked carefully through the place what she was looking for she didnt know then she noted something out of the ordinary she stepped to a bookshelf containing a number of binders and manila folders of legal and other official documents like tax bills and boxes of cassettes and reeltoreel tapes including some labeled master tapes dance was studying this portion of the trailer carefully when she happened to pass the window where tabatha had said shed seen the intruder that morning dance blinked in surprise as she found herself staring eyetoeye at a very unhappy p k madigan a foot away on the other side of the glass his expression was come on out here to the woodshed but she summoned him first calling loudly ive found something he grimaced and hesitated then reluctantly joined her actually ive found something missing he looked around body language of the trailer tell you that madigan was being snide but dance said you could put it that way people have patterns in their gestures and speech and expressions they also have patterns in their living spaces bobbys a highly organized person people who are organized dont happen to be that way accidentally its a psychological drive look at those shelves she pointed theyre messy but so i got a teenage boy none of the others are and your crime scene unit marked where theyd taken things somebody else went through those boxes probably the intruder its near the window where tabatha saw somebody why do you say somethings missing im not sure its missing im making the deduction that if only those shelves were disturbed the intruder was looking for something and he found it so he stopped madigan reluctantly walked over to the shelves and pulling on latex gloves poked through the tapes the papers the pictures the tchotchkes he said some of these snaps of kayleigh theyre not souvenirs theyre personal that was one thing dance hadnt noticed madigan continued the sort of thing a sonofabitch stalkerd want for a souvenir that could be it yes madigan ran a finger over the shelf and examined it the coat of dust was thick bobby was organized but not particularly concerned about cleaning cement plant right up the road here looks like dust from there i know it we got a conviction in this trailer park cause of it placing the perp here that could be helpful a cool glance her way you find anything else no without a word he left the trailer dance after him he called to harutyun you guys find anything witnesses nothing stanning shook her head too wheres lopez just finishing up at the convention center madigan pulled a phone off his thick shiny belt and placed a call he stepped away from the others and had a brief conversation dance couldnt hear what was said his eyes swiveled around the yard as he spoke absently examining the deceaseds residence dance was included in his gaze as he disconnected madigan said to harutyun i want you to find edwin bring him in i dont care where he is or what hes doing i need to talk to him now arrest him no make it seem like itd be good for him to come in in his interest you know dance heard a harsh exhalation as madigan regarded her expression what you dont think thats a good idea she said no i dont id vote for surveillance madigan squinted toward harutyun do it sure chief harutyun climbed into his cruiser and left without a word to dance no she decided the deputy hadnt looked at the verses to kayleighs song madigan strode back to his car his round belly swaying as he looked over the scene he grunted crystal listen i need you to come with me have a talk about something in my cruiser well pick yours up later the woman dutifully climbed into the passenger seat of madigans cruiser a moment later they were headed out onto the highway without a word of farewell to dance no matter she fished for her keys and turned toward her suv she stopped closed her eyes briefly in frustration and gave a sharp bitter laugh crystal stannings squad car was tight on the rear bumper of dances pathfinder in front was a carport full of junk a v engine block weighing in at half a ton she guessed sat six inches in front of her suv she wasnt going anywhere chapter at the fresnomadera consolidated sheriffs office complex p k madigan stopped by the crime scene unit a block away after returning from bobby prescotts trailer he wanted to urge the unit to make this case a priority which of course theyd do anything for kayleigh towne the girl whod helped put fresno on the map and anything for chief madigan too but he was only half thinking about pep rallies he also pictured kathryn dance thinking about her beached car some people you needed to hit over the head to deliver a message hed send crystal back in an hour or two spring the gal from her automotive jail oh sorry kathryn i didnt know youd be stuck between a rock and hard placeha but hed simply had it with people using kayleigh like dance was if kayleigh hadnt been involved the likes of kathryn dance would never have come to fresno never have taken the time to even say howdydo to a soul here where was ms agent dance and the cbi when some ms wannabes took an uzi and sprayed it into the pizza place on herndon killing two children and missing the rival drug dealer altogether sorry they werent celebrities he expected better from the cbi thought theyd be above that publicitygrabbing shit but madigan had done his homework hed checked out dances boss charlie overby on youtube and the archives man was faster with a press conference than wild bill hickok with a sixgun dance worked for him which meant shed surely be just the same just happened to be in the area and a friend of kayleighs my ass you dont mind if i take over your investigation do you pk yeah shed come up with a few helpful things but she was in the case for the wrong reasons and that just wasnt acceptable to p k madigan besides he didnt believe much in that fishy mumbo jumbo of hers kinesics crap thatd be like learning about a trout from books and the discovery channelas opposed to catching cleaning and cooking one up in crisco no his approach was different cases were made nowadays on forensics not voodoo theyd have evidence from the convention center theyd have forensics from bobbys trailerthat cement dust about as unique as trace could bewas a godsend armed with that madigan would wear down the son of a bitch and get a confession in an hour or two he and crystal walked into the csu lab he enjoyed the smell of the chemicals and the aftereffects of the gas chromatograph which reminded him of the bunsen burner smell from high school a good time in his lifefootball his brother healthy a girlfriend who ran the yearbook charlie he called the pudgy rosycheeked director of the csu charlie shean looked up from a computer in his officethe only fourwalled space in the large room the rest of the place had cubicles and workstations and the uptodate forensic stuff that madigan had fought hard to get for his people hey chief sheans accent grounded him somewhere along the massachusetts coast just north or south of bean town madigan thought shean was the best forensic tech his budget could afford and he was one of the few employees on the force the detective was deferential to though of course hed get in a few good ones about the csu mans name from time to time despite the different spelling need you to push everything through on this towne case the round man shook his head poor thing shes got to be shook up and that big concert this weekend i got tickets the wife and me you going i am stanning said madigan wasnt he liked music but he liked music you could shut off with a switch when you wanted to whatve we got shean nodded toward several techs in goggles gloves and white jackets working with quiet intensity at several stations not far away nothing yet three scenes convention center bobbys trailer and sharps rental were processing about two hundred unknown prints we have what we think are sharps from his rental but hes not in aifis the fbis automated integrated fingerprint identification system was in madigans opinion one of the few things the federal government was good for but we arent sure theyre his im going to talk to sharp ill get em with the water bottle trick whos agent dance cbi madigan snapped why you asking she called called you here direct yeah she talked to kayleighs assistant alicia sessions and found out where she thought somebody was spying on kayleigh yesterday at the convention center we dusted the area didnt find anything cbis involved no cbi is not involved oh when madigan explained no further shean continued you were right thats the cement dust at bobbys trailer same stuff with the baniero convictions its unique to that area have you got a match from edwins place lopez said there was plenty of dust on the kayleigh pictures and memorabilia in his house lots of trace yeah but no results yet should know soon and one more thing the team found something in the orchestra pit some boxes had been movedthe manager said they usually kept stacks of them there to break somebodys fall in an accident you know theyre special cartons stunt men use them whoever moved them looked like he was wearing latex gloves and similar marks on the smoke detectors they had the batteries taken out bingo miguel lopez whod searched edwins rental had found a box of the gloves the same as we got from edwins place we dont know that yet either wrinkle marks and manufacturers tracell tell us good charlie interrupt me therere any breakthroughs madigan and stanning left and walked to the sheriffs office proper then inside and down a long corridor passersby going in the opposite direction nodded to him a bit cautious some downright intimidated he thought again about kathryn dance she hadnt been the least intimidated by him thinking of her baking in the heat he felt just a moments bad she could always put the ac on in that fancy pathfinder of hers besides soccer moms like her always toted round tons of bottled water tap wasnt good enough for them madigan pushed through a swinging door on which was painted a fading sign detective division detective gabriel fuentes a bulldog of a man who sweated furiously even in the winter stood near the reception desk unlike deputies in the department who were former military which was a lot of them fuentes had cast aside all trappings of the army and wore his black shiny hair as long as he could get away with edwin sharp was here too madigan recognized the gangling man from the photos kayleighs lawyers had sent them though hed lost a lot of weight he was standing over fuentes who at fiveeight or so was six inches shorter than edwin the stalker also had long arms and massive hands his eyes were sunken below thick brows which gave him an ominous look though he was pretty normal otherwise those eyes were curious madigan thought they werent the least troubled hell children on class field trips to the department looked guiltier than this boy his smile was the oddest madigan had ever seen a faint upward curving of the thin lips but mostly at the very ends those underpass eyes now turned to him detective madigan hi how you doing im edwin sharp ive got a name badge but this fellow hasnt once looked at it whats this about ill just be a second son thanks for coming in just for the record im not under arrest youve asked me here and ive come voluntarily i can leave at any time is that correct thats right you want some ice cream i what ice cream no thanks ill pass whats this all about you go by ed eddie the smile it was damn eerie no i like edwin pike madigan paused the fuck is he using my first name for and how the hell did he know it a lot of deputies here dont know what it is well then edwin it is be back in a second he nodded for fuentes to join him up the hall any problem madigan whispered no just asked him to come in and he didnt hesitate fuentes continued and i heard miguel and a crime scene team found some good evidence at his place after he left looks that way good fuentes said hows kayleigh holding up doing the best she can id say not great son of a bitch fuentes muttered and they looked back to see edwin watching the men he couldnt hear what they said they were too far away but it gave madigan a chill to see those eyes crinkle with amusement as if he could sense every word he sent fuentes back to the division and stepped into the lunchroom opened the fridge and scooped himself some ice cream dropped it into a paper cup he loved ice cream no taste for liquor other than a beer at a barbecue no chew or smokes but he loved ice cream not yogurt or sherbet or lowfat real honesttogod ice cream he carried an extra ten pounds due exclusively to the stuff but that was ten pounds he was willing to sacrifice for the cause people thought he ate ice cream to intimidate suspects or to win them over if he offered a scoop or two but fact was he just liked ice cream today he was having mint chocolate chip he returned to the detective division okay edwin just like to have a conversation with you youd be so kind a couple of big bites from the cup with a metal spoon he always used metal hated plastic paper and foam cups were okay but you needed to eat your ice cream with a real spoon theyd just started toward the interview room when the door to the division swung open once again and someone else entered the lobby oh jesus christ it was kathryn dance chapter shed taken a cab did they think she wouldnt the chief detective and crystal stanning had been gone from bobbys trailer for ten minutes when she gave up her futile backandforth attempt to free the widewheelbase nissan shed pulled out her mobile found a business search app and got a cab to pick her up and take her straight to the sheriffs office the stalker seemed the more amused of the two men she now walked up to agent dance hope youre well edwin said getting her title rightname tooand offering a modicum of respect madigans expression said so much for the improvised detention center at bobbys trailer she said firmly id like to talk to you deputy now using the less impressive of his job titles because she was really pissed off madigan replied im pretty busy now kathryn come on edwin that way say you want a bottle of nice cold water he said to the assistant well be in number three and they vanished down the hall after a frustrating five minutes dance noticed detective dennis harutyun of the solid shoulders rich complexion and supple mustache walking up the corridor toward her hed left before madigans little game with the cars and might not know she was persona non grata she made a decision taking her id card from her purse wedging the holder into her belt shield on display something she never did even on duty she approached harutyun he didnt seem to smile any more than his boss but nothing suspicious glimmered in his eyes if he seemed awkward it was probably because he hadnt bothered to drop everything and analyze kayleighs song your shadow for potential crime scenes dennis hello kathryn she remembered how madigan was referred to by intimates the chiefs interviewing edwin now wheres observation for interview room three i got lost the bluff worked without any reaction assuming that she was sanctioned to be here harutyun guided her up the corridor and even held the door open politely he flicked the light on in the small close chamber there was no worry that edwin or madigan might see a flash observation rooms were invariably light and soundproof even if everyone who owned a tv knew the mirror was fake and there were cameras cops and witnesses on the other side she felt a little bad using harutyun like this but dance was determined to keep kayleigh towne safe and while she didnt doubt madigans devotion to that same goal she wasnt at all sure of his competence when it came to a perp like edwin and oh yeah she was still pissed off she examined the interrogation room it was austere in the center were a large fiberboard table a half dozen chairs and a smaller utility table on which sat bottles of water and pads of paper no decorations on the walls no pencils or pens madigan she observed took a professional approach he sat forward in a focused but unthreatening manner he was confident but dropped the authoritarian imperious attitude shed seen earlier apparently reserved for interloping law enforcers he didnt engage in overt hand gestures which can distract the suspect he was respectful of edwin asking if he was comfortable was the temperature too hot too cold dance supposed the ice cream had to be prop of some sort every single word or gesture by an interrogator tells the subject something more about the questioner you should never say or do anything that doesnt further the session sipping coffee scratching your head frowning but apparently the confection wasnt part of the detectives plan he finished it with relish and tossed the cup away edwins eyes followed every motion madigan made a few mistakes though one was that he directed edwin to sit across from him at the table better would have been to sit facing each other without any furniture between them tables other chairs any prop gives the suspect a sense of security he made a clumsy show of offering the suspect water dance noted that madigan pointed at the clear spring rather than simply picking up a bottle and handing it to edwin it was probably an attempt to lift edwins friction ridge printsfingerprintsfrom the bottle and it seemed that edwin deduced this he didnt touch it the problem was that madigans offer gave away something of the interviewers strategy and intelligence but the big mistake in dances opinion came next can i ask what this is all about pike robert prescott wouldntve done that she thought oh kayleighs road manager edwin said nodding and rubbing his prominent eyebrow where were you last night at the time he died oh no dance realized she must have said this aloud because harutyun tilted his head her way what no hes dead edwin looked alarmed and you didnt know that no no thats terrible he and kayleigh were real close what happened got himself burned up so youre telling me you werent at the convention center last night he now leaned toward edwin ominously dance understood madigans approach it was referred to as a bluntforce attacka term borrowed from hackers who used massive supercomputers to run through all possible passwords to break encrypted messages with blunt force officers would inundate suspects with information about them and about the case suggesting knowledge they didnt actually possess and connections that were tenuous at best when delivered with confidence as madigan clearly had the details sometimes got suspects to confess quickly yes blunt force could be effective but if it didnt work right away you ended up with a subject who stonewalled any chance of getting helpful information would be ruined accordingly dance herself never used this technique her belief was that information was the most valuable thing an interrogator has it could be a steel trap it could be a weapon but to be effective it had to be fed out slowly to lure the suspect into revealing details that could later be used to trip him up madigan had just given away the most important key factsthat bobby was dead where the crime occurred and how it happened had she been conducting the interview she would have kept those details secret for the time being edwin looked over the deputy somberly well im very sorry to hear that about bobby thats sad for kayleigh madigan didnt respond he said quickly could you tell me where you were when prescott died midnight last night well im sure you know i dont have to tell you anything but im a little surprised at this really detective you clearly think i hurt bobby why on earth would i do that id never hurt anybody close to kayleigh but the answer to your question is i was home in my rental any witnesses maybe somebody driving by saw me i dont know i was in the living room listening to music most of the night i dont have curtains up yet i see okay then he sprung the trap madigan leaned closer and said firmly but what do you say to the fact that weve got two witnesses that place you at the convention center around the time he died and then at bobbys house this morning chapter what edwin sharp said in reply was probably not what madigan expected with a frown further blending his dense eyebrows he asked simply did they have clear views dont answer dance thought to madigan they sure did the house right across the road from the convention center stage door and directly across from bobbys house hell dance thought edwin could now figure out exactly who the witnesses were he said shrugging well theyre mistaken i was home dance said to harutyun tabatha didnt id anybody she couldnt was there somebody else there a pause not that i know of and is there really a witness by the convention center apparently harutyun explained then decided to tell her some woman lived nearby saw somebody around midnight she positively idd edwin i dont i dont think so the hesitation meant she hadnt dance decided she recalled the layout the house would have been across the parking lot two hundred yards from the stage door at night she wouldnt have been able to make out more than a vague silhouette well madigan just told a possible homicide suspect about two witnesses and it wouldnt be that hard to find out their identities they need looking after he said hed get some protection for tabatha do you know if he did tabatha yes the other one i dont know we need to okay and in the interrogation room the oneonone continued madigan was probably brilliant at getting confessions from the typical perp you saw in the central valley but edwin sharp was not a typical perp well under giles versus lohan the stalker listened patiently analytically as madigan said and weve just been through your house edwin we found a lot of interesting things including latex gloves the same sort that were used in the murder and trace evidence edwin said calmly i see my house hm did you get a warrant we didnt need one my deputy noticed some things in plain sight even from the sidewalk the stalker asked tough to see anything inside unless you entered on the property well i dont really think you had the right to take anything i want it returned dance turned to harutyun did he get a warrant no after we saw things were missing from bobbys the chief sent a deputy over theremiguel lopezand he saw things from the trailer through edwins window in plain sight whats the matter dance didnt reply inside the interrogation room edwin was saying well i havent been in bobbys trailer so oh how did you know it was a trailer madigan demanded triumphantly thats right you called it a house earlier i thought that was odd i know where he lived because of kayleighs song two years ago bobbys doublewide all about the history of country music sort of like don mcleans american pie surprised you dont know it being all gungho for kayleigh i mean madigans smile deflated and he seemed to be wrestling down his anger just confess edwin you want to i know you do a textbook line from bluntforce interrogation this is the moment when the perp might start to cry and indeed confess but edwin said can i collect my things now where are they in the crime scene unit thats in the building south of here right the detective blinked then he said look lets be realistic here work with me ill talk to the prosecutor im sure hell cut a deal maybe you were arguing with bobby you know that chest bumping that started at the cowboy saloon that afternoon it escalated these things happen we could be talking reduced counts and maybe hell cut out the stalking charge altogether stalking edwin seemed perplexed im not a stalker kayleighs a friend i know it and she knows it friend thats not the story according to her lawyers oh shes afraid of them theyre controlled by her father theyve all been telling her lies about me thats not the way it is madigan said youre in town to stalk her and you killed her friend because he threw you out of the cowboy saloon yesterday edwin remained completely placid no detective i came to fresno to get out of the seattle rain for a time to come to a public concert and to pay respect to a performer i like a woman whos been nice and frankly shown some interest in me one of the best musicians of our era by the way you accuse me of stalking but im sorry im the victim here you never did anything about my call madigans face revealed confusion what do you mean i thought that was why your deputy fuentes asked me here my complaint complaint you dont know i have to say that doesnt surprise me saturday night i called nineoneone and reported a peeping tom a trespasser behind my house but nobody did anything about it youve got what twelve hundred deputies i just needed one to come out and see where this guy was standing talk to the neighbors but did they no not for an outoftowner with a grim laugh madigan responded we have four hundred deputies in fresno and sixty in madera they cover over six thousand square miles of territory from the valley all the way up to the mountains im afraid a peeping tom if there really was one isnt going to be allhandsondeck dance noted that if the stalker was on a fishing expedition to get information about the limitations of the sheriffs office hed certainly succeeded edwin kept up the offensive easy as a june day your hometown girl is quote stalked and you think its the end of the world im a newcomer and nobody cares that somebodys casing out my house if bobby prescott was murdered and witnesses place me at his house or trailer then im being set up somebody had another reason to kill him and theyre using me as a fall guy you really have to understand detective i love her id never hurt anybody close to her you dont love her edwin youre obsessed with a celebrity who doesnt know you from adam i think love has to have some obsession to it dont you pike arent you obsessed with your wife some or werent you at one point edwin had spotted the wedding ring you will not talk about my family madigan sputtered im sorry edwin said frowning his eyes were enigmatic but belied contrition madigan said kayleigh doesnt love you at all youre way off base efforts to get suspects to admit they were wrong or that their beliefs were based on errors were usually useless especially in the case of fanatic or obsessionbased crimes like stalking edwin shrugged you say that but you know she sent me emails and letters she practically said she loved me with some difficulty madigan controlled his anger he said son you have to get real here she sent you the same emails she sent to ten thousand fans a hundred thousand weve been briefed by her lawyers you got a half dozen form emails and a couple of form letters thats what theyre telling you doesnt mean its true edwin a lot of fans feel that way about performers i sent a fan letter to a star once he sent me back an autographed picture and he edwin asked quickly madigan hesitated a moment we got you dead to rights son tell me the truth tell me you killed robert prescott and well work something out tell me and youll feel better believe me edwin said you know pike i think i dont want to say anything more id like to leave and id like to pick up my things now people versus williams you have to arrest me or let me go dance asked harutyun the evidence it places edwin at the scene she didnt even bother to wait for a reply harutyuns shift of eye away from her was all she needed he doesnt have any forensics does he we think itll probably match but no he doesnt have any yet dennis ask the chief to come in here what i need to talk to him its very important harutyun examined her glancing down at the id on her belt his mouth tightened beneath the mustache he realized that she had deceived her way inside im sorry dance said i had to do it he grimaced and sighed then snatched up a phone and dialed a number they could hear it buzz inside madigan looked at it with surprise and irritation edwin didnt pay attention but instead turned and looked into the reflective glass since he couldnt see the occupants of the room he wasnt focused on either dance or harutyun but the mere transit of his eyes in their direction was unsettling and his smile was wax that damn smile yes madigan said casually into the phone though dance noted a white thumb where he gripped the handset detective what im here with agent dance shed like to have a word with you if possible his incredulous eyes started to swivel toward the mirrored window too then he restrained himself at this moment thats correct it seems important wonder how she ended up in there did the stalker know what was going on dance couldnt tell but he continued to look at the mirror im busy dance grabbed the phone detective let him go dont arrest him after a moment madigan dropped the phone into the cradle edwin have some water i want to leave he repeated the essence of calm madigan ignored him and stepped outside it seemed like a matter of seconds before the door flew open in the observation room and he was storming up to dance what the hell do you think youre doing youve got to let him go if you dont have probable cause thiss my case not yours she knew shed embarrassed him in front of his people but she couldnt help herself you have to let him go just cause you figured out somebody dropped that light on bobby prescott doesnt mean i want or need any more of your opinions so she reflected dennis harutyun had given her credit for that deduction back at the convention center he has to be released a jagged edge in his voice madigan said so youre on his side now dance found she was quite angry its not a question of sides its a question of proving a case edwin may very wellve killed bobby but if he goes to trial and gets off thats double jeopardy hes gotten away with murder i answer to sheriff gonzalez not you let him go and monitor him its the only way to make a case and what if he gives the deputy the slip and decides its time to kill kayleigh like rebecca schaeffer the actress who was murdered in los angeles some years ago her tragic death at the hands of a stalker had led to californias enacting the first antistalking law in the nation well you saw hiswhat do you call it kinesics thats your expertise you were pretty quick to tell me was he lying when he said he was being set up youd trespassed into the observation room by then hadntcha i couldnt tell under those circumstances i didnt have time ah hes asked to leave and you havent let him thats a problem madigan looked at edwin in the room the young man had pulled out a pen and pad of paper and was jotting notes a lot of them madigan called to harutyun book him cuff him and get him to detention breaking and entering at bobbys only at this point i know theres evidence for that he turned to dance crystalll take you to your car and you better go now you being in heres trespass and as you can probably tell im in an arresting mood at the moment chapter after fifteen minutes of silent driving crystal stanning said to kathryn dance i didnt block you in on purpose i just parked there i know that in stannings personal car a sunfaded toyota they were just pulling into the drive of bobbys trailer the young detective stopped brakes squealing a belt needed replacing pretty soon too the grass here pale and thin looked dustier and more spiky than before heat ripples undulated like sheets of flowing water above the pathfinder stanning fished another set of keys from her purse and said yoursll be hot youll be wanting to mind the wheel peopleve gotten burns they climbed out ill take care and here it is september i dont know bout glaciers melting but ill tell you its hotter now than when i was a girl i hear you you can buy those windshield shades at rite aid they work pretty good though i imagine you wont be staying around dance wondered if madigan had asked his deputy to drop that into the conversation to see where it went she said only thanks just tween us sure kayleigh townes a big deal here fresnos not the glitziest place on earth we come in real low on niceplacestolive surveys and kayleighs made us famous i dont know maybe the chief thinks youre here to boost yourself up you and the cbi i mean take her away from us you might say with this investigation and if that happens the sheriffs officell lose out on the money maybe a lot of it money yeah if we cant handle the case hes thinking thatll go into the hopper when its budget time see he fights hard for us in the department the chief one time he was convinced we couldnt find this girl got herself kidnapped and killed because csu couldnt analyze some dirt trace at the scene he still feels bad about that so hes always fighting for more pennies i see he got his dirt machine whatever it is dont know that it gets used much but thats the way he is without another word the deputy drove off dance walked to her vehicle so what do i do even if she wanted to take on the case which would mean working with a wholly uncooperative local team she didnt think her boss or sacramento would go for it whatever madigan felt the cbi was the least political law enforcement organization shed ever had contact with even if the suspect had been after a much more famous star a stalking case wasnt the sort the bureau would take on yet kayleigh was a good friend other people were in danger she was convinced and madigan was outgunned by edwin sharp that odd smile the calculation the calm demeanor the research they were armor and they were weapons and what was beneath that smile what was in his heart and mind to a degree unlike any other suspect shed known edwin sharp was a mystery she simply couldnt read him she got into the pathfinder got out again immediately it had to be degrees inside she leaned in started the engine and rolled down the windows then turned the ac on full blast as she waited for the interior to moderate she walked closer to bobby prescotts trailer now marked with crime scene tape she thought again about the astonishing collection of music history inside brush and grass waved in the breeze and dust ghosts rose and vanished she realized it was completely deserted here now aside from the squad car in which a young asianamerican deputy sat in front on the shoulder with a view of both bobbys and tabathas trailers despite the absorbing heat dance felt another chill of unease shed thought of another implication of madigans arresting edwin sharp if someone else was the killer and he was using your shadow as a template then hed have free rein to carry out the next murder without fear the police were searching for him finally the pathfinder was cool enough to drive she put the vehicle in gear and drove away from the scene the yellow police tape fluttering cheerfully in the breeze behind her debating i dont want to do this itll be a nightmare but ten seconds later she made the decision and was on her phone to the cbi office in monterey on her bosss voicemail charles its kathryn i need to take over an investigation in fresno call me for the details she debated about explaining what kind of nuclear detonation this would provoke and the political nightmare that would ensue but she decided that was a conversation best had in real time chapter kayleigh townes twostory victorian squatted on a twentyacre plot north of fresno the house wasnt largetwentyfive hundred square feet or sobut had been constructed by artisan builders with one instruction make it comfortable and comforting she was a nestertough for a performer who traveled seven months out of the yearand she wanted a home that cried cozy cried family when she was twelve bishop towne had sold the house she and her sister had grown up in a ramshackle place north of fresno in the mountains he said it was hard to get to in the winter though the real reasons were that one his father had built it and bishop would do anything he could to separate himself from his old man and two the rustic family manse hadnt fit the image of the lifestyle hed wanted to lead that of the highpowered country superstar hed built a tenmilliondollar working ranch on fifty acres in the valley and populated it with cattle and sheep he had no interest in or knowledge about raising the move had been horrifying enough to kayleigh but worse was that hed sold the beloved family house and land to a mining company that owned the adjacent property and theyd bulldozed the structure planning to expand though the companyd gone bankrupt the unnecessary destruction was all the more traumatic to the girl shed written a song about the place which became a huge hit ive lived in la ive lived in maine new york city and the midwest plains but theres only one place i consider home when i was a kidthe house we owned life was perfect and all was fine in that big old house near the silver mine the silver mine the silver mine i cant remember a happier time in that big old house near the silver mine now the man responsible for this displacement walked inside kayleighs spacious living room and bent down and hugged her bishops fourth wife sheri accompanied him she too embraced kayleigh then sat after an awkward moment of debate about which piece of furniture to choose ash blond hair sprayed persuasively in place the petite yet busty woman was a dozen years older than kayleigh unlike wife number three who could have attended the same high school as bishops daughterin the class behind her no less kayleigh like bishop couldnt remember much about number two hulking bishop towne then maneuvered his massive frame onto a couch moving slowslower than a lot of people even older than he was the jointsre catching up hed complained recently and at first kayleigh thought he meant the dives hed played in his early drinking fighting years but then she realized he meant hips knees shoulders he was in cheap jeans and his ubiquitous black shirt the belly rolling over his impressive belt leaving the more impressive silver buckle only partly visible was he still there across the road kayleigh asked looking out noting darthur morgan vigilant as ever in the front seat of the suv pointed outward who bishop growled edwin who did he think didnt see anybody he said sheri shook her head edwinthe first damn thing she saw this morning looking out the window of her secondstory bedroom well his car the big red car thats what she saw which didnt make the sense of violation any less kayleigh lived on the way to yosemite and sierra national park just where the area started to get interesting geographically across the twolane road in front of her property was a public recreation area and arboretum filled with rolling hills jogging paths groves of trees and gardens the lot allowed twentyfourhour parking just the place for a sick stalker to perch she said he was there a while ago just sitting staring at the house she closed her eyes briefly shivering oh my sheri said well nobodys there now bishop repeated distractedly noticing a wad of tissues on the coffee table where kayleighd been sitting with her iced tea and mobile on which shed called friends and family about bobbys death hey sorry about bobby kt i know you i mean im sorry sheri offered its terrible honey i feel so bad for you for everyone kayleigh stepped into the kitchen got a milk for her father and an iced tea for sheri another for herself too she returned to the living room thank you honey the woman offered tentatively her father lifted the milk as if toasting daddy her eyes avoiding his kayleigh said quickly im thinking of canceling it was easier to stare toward where a murderous stalker had been spying on her than to make eye contact with bishop towne the concert the big man grunted his ragged vocal style was not a function of any emotion of course but was simply because thats the way he talked no lilting tones never a whisper just a guttural rasp it hadnt always been that way his voicelike his joints and liverhad been a victim of his lifestyle im thinking of it sure course i see sheri tried to deflect what might be an uncomfortable moment if theres anything i can do ill bring some dinners by tell me what youd like ill make you something special food and death had always been linked kayleigh now thought ill think on it thanks sheri the word mom had of course never been on the table kayleigh didnt hate her stepmother either you were a woman of steel like margaret her mother and you fought with andat timescorralled a man like bishop towne or you took the residual prestige and the undeniable charisma and you surrendered that was sheri though kayleigh couldnt blame her nor could she her father either margaret had been his first choice and despite the others along the way theyd still be together if not for fate there was no one who could take his first wifes place so why even try yet it was impossible to imagine bishop towne surviving without a woman in his life he grumbled you tell barry she nodded toward her mobile he was the first one i called hes in carmel with neil tall fidgeting barry zeigler her producer was full of nervous energy he was a genius in the studio hed produced some of the biggest hits of the nineties when country got itself branded with the adjective crossover and began to transcend its nashville and dallas and bakersfield roots to spread to mainstream tv and overseas if anybody had created a kayleigh towne sound it was barry zeigler and that sound had made her a huge success zeigler and the label hadnt escaped the shadow of edwin sharp either though the stalker had inundated the company with emails criticizing instrumentation choices and pacing and production techniques he never dissed kayleighs voice or the songs themselves but argued that zeigler the recording techs and backup musicians werent doing her justice that was a favorite phrase of his kayleighd seen several of the emails and though she never told anyone she thought edwin had a point on a few of the issues finally sheri said just one thing i mean a glance toward bishop sipping the milk he drank as religiously as he had once drunk bourbon when he didnt object to her getting this far she continued that luncheon tomorrowfor the fan of the month you think we can still do that it was a promotion alicia sessions had put together on facebook and on kayleighs website bishop had more or less shoehorned sheri into working on various marketing projects for the kayleigh towne operation the woman had been in retail all her life and had made some valuable contributions its all scheduled right bishop asked weve rented the room at the country club itd mean a lot to him hes a big fan not as big as someone i know kayleigh thought and therell be some publicity too no reporters kayleigh said i dont want to talk about bobby thats what theyll want to ask me alicia had been deflecting the pressand thered been plenty of them but when the steelyeyed personal assistant said no there wasnt room for debate bishop said well control it set the ground rules make sure they dont ask questions about what happened at the convention center i can do that sheri said with an uncertain glance toward bishop ill coordinate with alicia kayleigh finally said sure i guess she pictured the last time she had lunch alone with bobby a week ago she wanted to cry again good bishop said but well keep it short tell that fan itll have to be short having conceded one issue kayleigh said but i really want to think about the concert daddy hey baby doll whatever youre happiest doing bishop leaned forward and snagged one of the guitars his daughter kept in her living room an old guild with a thin neck and golden spruce top producing a ringing tenor he played elizabeth cottens version of freight train he was a talented syncopated fingerpicker in the style of arty and happy traum and leo kottke and damn if he couldnt also flatpick as well as doc watson a skill kayleigh could never master his massive hands totally controlled the fret board in pop music guitar was originally for rhythm accompanimentlike a drum or maracasand only in the past eighty years or so had it taken on the job of melody kayleigh used her martin for its original purpose strumming to accompany her main instrumenta fouroctave voice kayleigh remembered bishops rich baritone of her youth and she cringed to hear what hed become bob dylan never had a smooth voice but it was filled with expression and passion and he could hit the notes when at a party or occasionally at concerts kayleigh and bishop sang a duet together she modulated to a key he could pull off and covered the notes that would give him trouble well make sure its short he announced again what kayleigh wondered the concert then recalled the luncheon with the fan was it tomorrow or the next day oh bobby and well talk about it the concert see how you feel in a day or so want you to be in good form happy too thats what matters he repeated she was looking out the window again into the grove of trees separating the house from the road a hundred yards away shed done the plantings for seclusion and quiet but now all she thought was it would provide great cover so that edwin could get close to the house more arpeggioschords broken into individual notesrang out kayleigh thought automatically diminished minor sixth major the guitar did everything bishop wanted it to do he could get music out of a tree branch she reflected bishop towne had missed concerts because he was unconscious or in jail but hed never chosen to cancel one he racked the guitar and said to sheri got that meeting the woman who seemed to have a different perfume for every day of the week rose instantly and started to reach for bishops arm then thought better she tried to be discreet in his daughters presence she did work at it kayleigh reflected i dont hate you i just dont like you kayleigh wafted a smile her way you still got that present i got you a coupla years ago bishop asked his daughter i have all your presents daddy she saw them to the door amused that darthur morgan seemed to regard them with some suspicion the couple piled into a dusty suv and left petite sheri behind the wheel of the massive vehicle bishop gave up driving eight years ago she thought about making more calls about bobby but couldnt bring herself to she strode to the kitchen pulling on work gloves and stepped outside into her garden she loved it here growing flowers and herbs and vegetables toowhat else in this part of california she lived in the most productive agricultural county in america the appeal of gardening had nothing to do with the miracle of life the environment being one with the earth kayleigh towne just liked to get her hands dirty and concentrate on something other than the industry and here she could dream about her life in the future puttering around in gardens like this with her children making sauces and baked goods and casseroles from things she herself had grown i remember autumn pies in the oven sitting on the porch a little teenage lovin riding the pony and walking the dogs helping daddy outside splitting logs life was simple and life was fine in that big old house near the silver mine im canceling the fucking concert she thought she stuffed her hair up under a silly canvas sun hat and examined her crops the air was hot but comforting insects buzzed around her face and even their persistent presence was reassuring as if reminding that there was more to life than musical performances more than the industry but suddenly she froze a flash of light no not edwin there was no brilliant red color from his car what was it the light was coming from the south to the left as you faced the garden about one hundred yards away not from edwins hunters blind at the arboretum or main road in front it was from a small access road running perpendicular to the highway a developer had bought the adjacent land a year ago but gone bankrupt before the residential construction had started was this a survey team last year shed been glad the deal fell through shed wanted her privacy now perversely she was happy there might be crews aroundand eventually neighborsto discourage edwin and others like him but what exactly was the light on off on off flashing she decided to find out kayleigh made her way through the brush toward the stuttering illumination bright dark light shadow chapter kathryn dance was in south fresno trying to find a restaurant that crystal stanning had recommended her thoughts though were on how to handle the explosion when charles overby or more likely the cbi director in sacramento told sheriff anita gonzalez that dance was going to be running the bobby prescott homicide she actually jumped when her phone buzzed ah charles hope i didnt disrupt one of your leisurely lunches but the number on caller id was a local one hello kathryn yes its pike madigan she said nothing talk for a minute she thought she heard scraping of a spoon a smack of lips was he eating lunch the phone tucked between shoulder and ear more ice cream go ahead whatre you up to she said going for chicken mole at julios good choice only dont do the tamales lard city a pause on his part now i got a call from the head of our crime scene unit charlie shean spelled shean not like the actor takes some grief for that good man she recalled the efficient team at the convention center and at the trailer on a par with a bigcity csu all the forensics were negative none of the dust or other trace on the pictures and memorabilia in edwins rental matched what was in bobbys trailer and one of our people ran edwins credit card data he bought everything we found in his house on ebay and we got his prints when we booked him none of the ones at bobbys or the convention center match no footprints no nothin tire treads for his car zip was a washout you let him go yeah an hour ago and released everything we took this was dance supposed the best someone like madigan could do for a contrition but she was wrong i wanted to say im sorry and the apology wasnt over yet you were right i was wrong i got outgunned by that fellow it was like the only reason he came in was to find out information about the investigation if hes the perp then yes i think thats a possibility this guys pretty different from what ive been used to you have a handle on him better than me if youre still game would you be willing to help us out we sure could use you without hesitation i am yes shed be sure to call overby and withdraw her prior request thats much appreciated dance thought back to what stanning had said about madigans concerns one thing i wanted to say detective this is your case im a consultant only in other words the glory and the press conferences are all yours by the way i hate them as much as your associate dennis harutyun does well thank you for that now get yourself back here if you would oh and welcome to the fmcso deputy dance hey thats got a nice ring to it dontcha think but it was him after all the reason she hadnt seen any red was that the light was glare off the windshield which shot her way like a theater spot the crimson of the buick was below eye level from the house edwin sharp was fifty feet from her hed found a new vantage point his car was parked on the shoulder and he sat on the hood legs dangling as he stared directly toward her house that sick smile curving his mouth his rocking back and forth had created the intermittent flashing she dropped to her knees he gave no reaction though and she knew he hadnt seen her moving a few dozen feet to the side kayleigh looked out again through the brush he was wearing earbuds and tapped his hand on his thigh in time to the music it would be one of her songs which one occasionally his head would swivel scanning the property as if he were admiring a work of art or wait there was something about his face what was that expression and then she sensed it was pleasure almost ecstasy and not in a religious sense his eyelids would droop from time to time and his smile would deepen he seemed to be breathing hard too his chest rising it was like he was making love was he tapping his thigh to keep time to the music or my god was he doing something else with his hand she couldnt see clearly no he couldnt be doing that but the look on his face oh disgusting his halfopen mouth the lowered lids beneath the outcropping of eyebrows it was too much for her she stepped back fast and stumbled but the tree shed grabbed to keep from falling was a small pine sapling and bent sideways under her weight and caught edwins eye the motion stopped and he gazed toward where a horrified kayleigh now crouched on the ground did he see her was he coming toward her now his pants unzipped panicked kayleigh turned and fled sprinting all out dodging trees brush not daring to look behind her then the fence surrounding her precious garden loomed she slowed but didnt bother with the gate she stretched her hands out and vaulted the fence like she used to do the horse in gymnastics classalways game to take on the challenge but often like now landing in a sprawl on the other side heart drumming she was on her feet and scrabbling into the house slamming the door shut and wheeling about she looked over her garden it was ruined ruined forever she could never step into it again without thinking of him and what he had been doing she pressed her face against the window the flashing continued for a moment then it began to move toward the main road she caught a glimpse of red as the car proceeded slowly to the intersection turned right and vanished kayleigh jumped as her phone rang a steel guitar ring tone and a hum of vibration she approached slowly was it edwin or someone else calling with the second verse to your shadow announcing another killing she picked up the mobile looked down at the screen after a moments hesitation she hit answer chapter law enforcement briefing rooms are the same the world over scraped scuffed dented repaired with tape filled with mismatched furniture and cryptic signage grimy windows the fresnomadera consolidated sheriffs office was about average though the smell of sour garlic was a unique addition maybe from a lateshift chinese dinner dance stood in front of the greenlit room with p k madigan and dennis harutyun whose taciturn face had offered a faint quasismile beneath his opulent mustache at the announcement that dance was joining the team her ruse at using him to slip into the observation room earlier was apparently forgiven detectives crystal stanning and miguel lopez were here too they along with detective gabriel fuentes presently in the field would be the prescott homicidekayleigh towne stalker task force backed up by tj scanlon in monterey you have a very bizarre idea of taking a vacation boss two civilians were in the room as well dance had called kayleigh towne thirty minutes ago and asked her to join them the woman had reluctantly agreed and alicia sessions had come along for moral support kayleigh was blearyeyed and sallow her impressive honey hair tied back in a taut ponytail and protruding from a burgundy sports cap without a logo as if she were trying to disguise herself she also dance noted wore baggy jeans not the usual closerfitting numbers from her album covers and concerts and a thick longsleeved knit shirt which would be merciless in the heat the concealment would be futile though if that was the purpose dance could have told her to edwin sharp she was the sexiest most beautiful woman in the world whatever clothes she wore and however makeupfree her face kayleigh reported that edwin had been spying on her again forty minutes ago parked at a new vantage point apparently hed gotten tired of the police driving past and staring at him in the parking lot of the nature preserve across the road from her house so right after hed been released from the lockup hed headed to this new observation post for his high like an addict looking for meth the singers voice wavered as she told the story suggesting to dance that there was more to it than her just spotting him she wondered if thered been an actual confrontation between the two but whatever might have happened it was clear kayleigh didnt want to talk about it alicia sessions was dressed the opposite of her boss almost pickafight defiant tight jeans light blue cowboy boots a green tank top with bright orange bra straps showing significant muscles too dance wondered what the rest of the tattoo disappearing down her back might be her face was grim and angry some of that directed it seemed toward the deputies themselves as if they werent doing enough to protect her boss dance said chief madigans been kind enough to invite the cbi to assist in the prescott murder case and were going to be focusing on the possibility that its linked to the stalker whos been troubling kayleigh im not here to step on toes and if you think theres a conflict between your department and mine you can come to me or chief madigan at any time im helping because ive got some experience with stalkers personally lopez said everyone laughed theyre discouraged when they see a glock twentythree on your hip kayleigh was among those laughing but it was too loud poor things terrified dance assessed alicia watched warily first of all my associate in montereys found out that there are no warrants or court orders on edwinnothing federal or in california washington or oregon a few traffic violations thats it which is a little unusual for a stalker normally theres a history of complaints but on the other hand he could simply be very careful and we know hes smart now im going to tell you a little about stalking and where i think edwin fits into the diagnosis there are several types of stalkers the first type is known as simple obsessional these are usually domestic situations the stalker and his object have had some prior contact usually romantic or sexual relationships marriages or even onenight stands that go bad think of fatal attraction now that was a movie to keep husbands on the straight and narrow lopez said engendering uneasy laughter dance continued then there are erotomanic stalkers like sex perverts madigan wondered aloud no its more about love than sex traditionally erotomanic stalkers were women who fell in love with powerful men in higher economic or social classes like secretaries or shop clerks fawning over their bosses but now as many men fall into the category as women the profile is that theres been some minor completely innocuous contact that the stalker misreads they become convinced the subject of their obsession is in love with them but is too shy or reluctant to reciprocate the third type is called love obsessional these are the ones who go after celebrities people theyve worshiped from afar and come to believe theyre soul mates with i think edwin is a mix of erotomania and love obsessional he honestly believes that youre the woman for him he wants a relationship with you and he believes that you feel the same about him that damn xo kayleigh muttered it was just a form letter alicia said we send out thousands of them a week it didnt have anything personal about him except a nameand weve got an automail program that inserts that well you have to understand all stalkers are more or less delusional they range from serious neurosis to borderline personalities to truly psychotic schizophrenic or severely bipolar we have to assume that edwin has a reality problem and he doesnt want to fix that because he gets a high out of contact with youits as powerful as a drug to him crystal stanning asked but whats his motive for killing bobby prescottif hes the one who did dance said thats a good question detective its the one thing that doesnt quite fit erotomanic and love obsessional stalkers are the least dangerous statistically much less so than domestic stalkers but they can certainly kill madigan added i think we should remember too that bobby could just have been at the wrong place at the wrong time if that song was an announcement it was just about the concert hall maybe had nothing to do with bobby the perp might justve been waiting for anybody to show up good point yes dance said but what we should do is look into bobbys life a little more see what he was up to anything illegal for instance he wasnt kayleigh said firmly he had a problem a few years ago drugs and drinking but he was clean recently skepticism is part of being an officer but dance wasnt going to contest the girl it was important to her to preserve the memory of her friend and they could learn independently if bobby had been engaged in any risky activity from the comments by his neighbor tabatha it seemed that he wasnt but that doesnt mean somebody still wouldnt want him dead dance said and we have to remember some intruderlikely the killertook some things from his trailer the morning after he was killed i could look into his personal life his background harutyun offered in his low easy voice silken mustache bobbing dance glanced at madigan who nodded his agreement denniss our librarian mean that in a good way he does his homework he knew what google was when i thought it was a character on the cartoon network good cant you interrogate him alicia asked dance who didnt offer that the first interview had not been particularly successful possibly but im not sure how helpful it would be in her lectures dance talked about the difficulty of kinesically analyzing suspects like edwin people on the borderline of psychosis like stalkers might tell you facts that can be helpful in running a case and can lead to your uncovering their deception but such people are often impossible to analyze kinesically they dont feel any stress when lyingbecause their goal of getting close to the object of their obsession trumps everything she explained this now and added that they also had no leverage to bring him in alicia grimaced in frustration then asked isnt there a stalking law here thats rightcalifornias was first in the country madigan said dance paraphrased the statute youre guilty of stalking if you willfully maliciously and repeatedly follow or harass the victim and make a credible threat with the intent to place that person in reasonable fear for his or her safety or the safety of the immediate family she added it doesnt have a lot of teeth though some jail time and a fine well its something arrest him anyway kayleigh said it may not be that easy tell me about his stalking i mean my lawyersd know more i left it pretty much up to them but i know he sent me about a hundred and fifty emails and thirty or so regular letters hed ask me out hint about a life together write about what hed done that day not nearly as bad as some dance noted and he sent me some presents pictures hed drawn miniature instruments old lps we sent everything back you said he showed up at concerts but you never saw him right lopez asked disguises maybe could be dance said stalkers have a whole arsenal they use to get close to their objects and keep them under control they steal mail to find out who the victims know and where they might be they threaten witnesses into lying that theyve never been around the victims houses they get to be good at hacking phones and computers and some even go to locksmith school to learn how to break and enter thesere really desperate people their whole worth is tied up in their love for their object theyre nothing without that person in their life alicia said we threatened him with restraining orders and everything but he just ignored the letters and the lawyers said he was never quite across the line of legality they talked to the fbi about hacking into our computers kayleigh said and hired a private computer security firm but there was never any proof he did it madigan then asked the key question in all those letters was there any threat at all under the statute there has to be a credible threat isnt bobbys death enough of a threat alicia asked harshly we dont have proof he did it harutyun said please of course he did dance continued when were talking about an arrest for stalking under the statute detective madigan is right you need a threat against you or a family member it can be implied but if thats the case there has to be a reasonable belief that youre actually in danger of harm not you know mental or psychic harm crystal stanning asked no physical kayleigh was staring at a poster a cartoon of a police officer and a contrite teenage boy school patrol detail if its only pot talk to them a lot she turned back and reluctantly said no no threats its just the opposite really he was always telling me how he wanted to protect me how hed be there for mejust like in that song your shadow it was then that dances phone sang out with an incoming message it was from tj scanlon she read quickly then looked up you want to hear a bio of our stalker but the question of course needed no answer chapter dennis harutyun helped dance log on to her email from a terminal in the corner of the room and she printed out tjs document scanning disappointed there isnt much im afraid edwin stanton sharp had been born in yakima a town in eastern washington state his father was a traveling salesman his mother worked in retail to judge from her income she must have had several jobs this could mean that the boy spent a lot of time alone psychologists think stalking begins from attachment issues he was desperate to spend time with his parents mother particularly but she wasnt available now his grades were very good but he was held back a year in the seventh grade which is pretty old for that and his marks werent too bad so that suggests emotional problems in school but theres no record of disciplinary action other than for a few fights on the school yard no weapons were involved he also had no extracurricular activities no sports no clubs when he was sixteen his parents split up and he went to live with his mother outside of seattle he went to the university of washington for two years again he did fairly well but for some reason he dropped out just after the start of his third year no record of why again no interest in other activities that too is typicalstalking takes a lot of time he started working at jobs stalkers sometimes gravitate toward security guard landscaping parttime retail sales offering samples of food at grocery stores doortodoor selling theyre good professions for those with voyeuristic or stalking tendencies because you get to see a lot of people and are largely unsupervised and invisible good ponds for fishin madigan said well put dance reflected his mother died in july of last year cancer his fathers off the grid hasnt filed a tax return in six years and the irs cant find him edwin does no international travel according to the state department tj my associate in monterey has checked out his online activity his facebook page is filled with pictures and information about kayleigh he doesnt have many friendsat least not under his own username he might have a page under another one i sure didnt friend him kayleigh muttered tjs found four different screen names he usesnics theyre called like nickname edwins pretty active online but no more so than millions of other young men he posts to a lot of music blogs and is in a few chat rooms some sexual but theyre pretty tame and special interestsmusic mostly but movies and books too dance shook her head typically a stalker is more engaged in online activities than edwin isand a lot darker ones too she continued to read ah may have something here looks like he went through a breakup last year tj found a reference to someone named sally in one of the blogs he was talking about your song you and me thats right kayleigh said its about a breakup the posting was in december dance asked kayleigh not long before the stalking started right yes january trauma often precipitates stalking getting fired a physical injury death in the family or the end of a romantic relationship dance nodded toward tjs email he said the song really meant a lot to him it was a hard time in his life and he talked about the trouble he was having with sally he said its like you knew exactly what he was going through then a few days later he posted about a single youd just released near the silver mine he said hed been feeling bad because hed lost his house when he was about that age too but his girlfriend told him to get over it kayleighs lips tightened he knew about my house she explained about how shed loved the old house shed grown up in north of fresno but her father had sold it to a mining company when she was young i probably mentioned in an interview that i wished he hadnt shed be thinking isnt there anything private about my life anymore dance flipped through tjs homework again though nothing threatening or troubling in any way she read some more one thing to keep in mind hes smart for instance he wrote happy or sad you speak the truth the sentence is a bit of a dangler but look at how he set off the modifier happy or sad with a comma which is correct but a lot of people wouldnt do that his spelling and grammar are very good which tells me hes in control very in control is that bad crystal stanning asked it means that if hes the one who killed bobby hes going to be covering up his tracks and planning out the stalking very carefully hes not likely to slip up madigan finished his ice cream and surveyed the paper cup to see if he should scrape the sides dance supposed he pitched it away whatre you thinking about where we go from here first weve got to keep him under surveillance deputy fuentes is doing that where is edwin now seeing a movie in the rialto harutyun explained that this was an old movie theater in fresnos tower district an eclectic area of galleries restaurants tattoo parlors and shops his being at a movie didnt surprise her stalkers spend a lot of time in theaters and watching movies at homethe link between voyeurism and stalking is strong what about those prepaid mobiles from the drugstore in burlingame madigan said not traceable they mightve been destroyed or the perps taken the batteries out or who knows maybe he just bought a bunch to keep us busy and hes got another one here to make more calls dance then turned to kayleigh now some basic stalker rules you probably know them from darthur morgan and your lawyers but remember you have to have no contact with him at all nothing even threatening him or telling him to leave you alone gives him a highany contact at all is positive to him if he approaches dont say anything just walk away okay fine with me and i want to know more about him we need to find this former girlfriend sally lopez you handle that have her call agent dance sure chief the head detective then added we should identify other possible victims dont you think keep an eye on them whod be at particular risk dance said probably first is anybody he sees as a romantic rival to kayleigh you and bobby dated apparently this wasnt public knowledge kayleigh blushed and alicia turned to her with a hint of frown dance wasnt much interested in the delicacies of disclosure she lifted an eyebrow tacitly repeating the question well yes a while ago just casually it wasnt a big deal howd you know i wasnt even performing then it didnt make the press because dance thought when i saw you with bobby yesterday i noticed a decrease in the angle of your shoulders when you were speaking signifying relaxation and comfort bobbys leaning forward slightly when he spoke to you indicating that what he was saying was meant for you and you alone a faint smile at the reference to the word amplifier which had become a code word for some private joke between the two of you the way his eyes dwelt on your face the message abundantly clear that whatever had gone on between you two was not to him completely over kinesics in other words but what she said to kayleigh was a hunch crystal stanning said so anyone that kayleigh ever dated or men she was real friendly with are at risk yes possibly though women too stalkers are extremely jealous remember they have a very skewed sense of realityeven casual friends could be perceived as threats then she eyed the young singer again but youre not seeing anyone now no also a stalkers likely to target anybody whos a threat to you or even offended you hes taking real seriously his role as a protector i could see that yesterday can you think of any enemies you might have that hed know about kayleigh looked around not really alicia said shes a good girl she doesnt get into cat fights with other artists dance continued well keep in mind he could also consider going after critics whod dissed you or fans who were critical of your work then next he could target anyone he saw as keeping you two apart like darthur yes him but it could also be your lawyers she glanced at alicia or you you seem very protective of her the broadshouldered woman shrugged somebodys got to be a sentence with many possible implications and it could also be us the police truly obsessive stalkers have a different sense of right and wrong in extreme obsession cases the stalkers murdering a policeman is no worse than killing a fly my family the crew generally family and nonromantic friends are only at risk if they try to protect the object from the stalker though were not dealing with hardandfast rules stalkersre unpredictable i talked to some of the crew about what theyd seen yesterday but i think i should interview all of them assess if theyre at risk or potential perps dance thought but didnt say aloud the crews at the convention center now kayleigh said then added the bands in nashville still finishing up some studio work for our new album they wont be here till thursday or friday that was good news fewer potential victims to worry about fewer suspects too dance added finally theres the hinckley scenario killing someone of some notoriety to impress kayleigh she reminded them that john hinckley jr was obsessed with jodie foster he figured that by assassinating ronald reagan hed be linked forever to the actress and they are harutyun observed in a sick way he accomplished his goal madigan said ive talked to edwin you have too he doesnt seem like a psycho how could he possibly think killing people is going to get him closer to kayleigh oh he doesnt think about it not on a conscious level even if edwin seems functional on the surface theres more at work remember its his reality not ours madigan ive ordered a box on kayleighs phone and the service providers security unit is on standby and were still on those numbers of the other mobiles he bought in burlingame so if he calls again from any of those phones or even powers em up we can get a car there fast good harutyun said to kayleigh kathryn asked me to look into the verses of the song the one that was played to you the other night he passed out copies to everyone in the room ive been trying to think of where he might be planning an attack but cant come up with much so he had taken her request seriously she nodded her thanks your shadow you walk out onstage and sing folks your songs you make them all smile what could go wrong but soon you discover the job takes its toll and everyones wanting a piece of your soul chorus when life is too much just remember when youre down on your luck just remember im as close as a shadow wherever you go as bad as things get youve got to know that im with you always with you your shadow you sit by the river wondering what you got wrong how many chances youve missed all along like your troubles had somehow turned you to stone and the water was whispering why dont you come home chorus one night theres a call and at first you dont know what the troopers are saying from the side of the road then you see in an instant that your whole life has changed everything gone all the plans rearranged chorus you cant keep down smiles happiness floats but trouble can find us in the heart of our homes life never seems to go quite right you cant watch your back from morning to night chorus repeat chorus i dont know if hes going to keep going with that song or find a different one or give up on the idea altogether kayleigh took her glasses off and cleaned them on her sweatshirt ill bet hed use your shadow he thought it was the best song ever written miguel lopez looked over the lyrics you read it one way its a love song looking out for somebody could be a lover or even a parent or friend but from a stalkers point of view its pretty creepy dance focused on the second verse a river madigan gave a brief laugh we got plenty of those around here harutyun pointed out some dry beds some with water could be anywhere dance summarized ill be talking to the crew at the hall detective harutyun is getting information about bobbys past and detective lopez is tracking down edwins former girlfriend sally madigan regarded the song lyrics and ill tell patrol officers to pay special attention to riversides the public areas primarily and ones out of view of any roads good alicia gave the first smile dance could recall seeing on the tough womans face but i guess the good news is that kayleighs not at risk if hes that much in love with her thats true but only for a time remember his separation from reality hes been in the courting stage for a while she turned to kayleigh probably since he heard the first song that drew him to you or saw you in concert or on tv to him that was your first date and youve been going out ever since date crystal stanning asked at the moment hes still under the illusion that you care for him youve been brainwashed he thinks at some point though hell see your behavior as if youre breaking up with him and when that happens hell become simple obsessional like spurned husbands or lovers theyre the dangerous stalkers it could happen in an instant hell snap hell want revenge dance debated but decided there was no point in sugarcoating her assessment or hell just want to kill you so nobody else can have you chapter the convention center had been sanitized kathryn dance wasnt cynical about the world of businessshed been a consultant and journalist and music at kayleigh townes level was a very serious business indeed so she wasnt surprised that the crime scene had been cleaned as quickly as possible all traces of the death removed to make sure the concert could proceed as planned dance had prepared herself for the smell nothing lingers like the odor of burned hair and flesh but whatever commercial forensic cleaning operation madigan or charlie shean used had done a bangup job the perfume was of lysol and of all things cinnamon kayleigh was blocking out stage directions for the showwhat shed been doing when the light fell tye slocum the guitar technician was temporarily chief roadie until alicia could fill the job with a pro they needed someone who not only knew equipment but could mix sound at the console as complicated as an airplanes cockpit the quiet heavyset young man was distracted and not particularly confident but trying to rise to the occasion there were of course hundreds of decisions to be made sweating he kept glancing at kayleigh for direction which she provided along with smiles and nods of encouragement though she was clearly distracted to be near the place where her friend had died with kayleighs okay dance called tye over and explained what she neededto speak to all of the crew he rounded them upranging from their early twenties to forties and physically fit thanks probably to the demanding nature of their jobs dance spoke to them in the scuffed blackpainted wings of the hall she noted great camaraderie among them and kayleighthe whole operation was like a big familybut no one stood out as approaching bobbys level of closeness to kayleigh and therefore an obvious threat to edwin of any of them tye was the one who seemed to know kayleigh best but she felt merely a brotherly kind of affection shed deduced from the singers body language when speaking to him nor did dance sense that any of them might have a motive to kill bobby prescottanother reason for her mission here though she hadnt stressed that to kayleigh the only one dance didnt interview was alicia shed been here at the convention center earlier when dance arrived standing outside beside a ford f pickup with a trailer hitch on the back and a bumper sticker that announced i my quarter horse a cigarette had dangled from her lips and shed looked more like a local teamster than a personal assistantconsidering her muscular arms inkings and attitudinal visage of anyone on the staff alicia was probably the most at risk shed defied edwin the most at the cowboy saloon on sunday and would present an obstacle to the stalkers getting close to kayleigh dance however couldnt impart this warning in person only via a phone message the assistant had left the convention center by the time dance went to find her as she looked over her notes movement at the corner of her eye caught her attention dances gaze swept to the confusion of shadows throughout the concert hall shed counted two dozen doors and emergency exits recalled too the casual attitude of locking doors when there was no event in progress was he here now observing from the shadows was there a faint movement from that window that doorway her eyes were tricking her had to be a moment later dance noticed kayleigh freeze and pull her mobile from her pocket the look on the young womans face left little doubt it would be a call she didnt recognize she stared for a moment and then lifted the unit to her ear the woman gasped a wrenching sound clearly audible thanks to the acoustics of the center her head swiveled toward dance and she said its another call kathryn its the second verse chapter in a quarter hour dance was at the sheriffs office hurrying inside harutyun met her at the door she asked could the mobile providers triangulate on his phone harutyun said evenly it wasnt one of edwins prepaids or any mobile at all the call was from a pay phone on the fresno college campus schools not in session yet its pretty deserted there nobody saw the caller well wheres edwin thats the curious thing still in the rialtothe theater it must be somebody else they stepped into madigans office where both the chief detective and stanning next to her boss were on their phones madigan looked up he disconnected his mobile and ignored his desk phone when it rang after a glance at caller id he looked too at a halfempty ice cream cup and pitched it rocky road wheres kayleigh harutyun asked dance said she and the crew are at the convention center darthur morgans with her and the deputy you sent is outside alicias the only one not accounted for i called her on the way here and left a message i havent heard back the detective glanced toward his phone that was fuentes edwins still watching his movie harutyun asked any way he couldve called from the theater either the landline or another mobile and routed the call through the phone at the college good question but madigan had a good answer no we checked with the bell folks or whoever the hell they are nowadays the call was made from the phone at the school direct to kayleighs dance had to ask and theres no way he couldve gotten out of the theater no fuentes is in a restaurant on olive hes watching the front entrance the back doorsre alarmed he checked dance supposed that edwin was just what he seemed to be a sad lump of a young man without a life drawn to a woman who existed in an entirely different universe from his a common and boring story once you took the violence out of the equation and yet she couldnt help but recall his icy demeanor his calm attitude his laserlike focus on kayleigh that phony smile and his intelligence which prompted her to ask basements what madigan asked in that block are there connecting basements i dont know madigan said this slowly and hit a button on the landline a tone filled the room then the rapid eleven digits of a phone number being dialed fuentes without identifying himself madigan barked were thinking he mightve snuck out through the basement the hardware store next door they share a basement a pause let me check ill get right back three minutes later they got the news that dance suspected they would yep chief i went down there theres a door its unlocked evacuate the theater dance said we need to be sure evacuate fuentes asked madigan was staring at her then he said firmly you heard agent dance gabe get the lights on and evacuate the theater isnt really going to want to his voice faded and he realized this wasnt the time to be worried about business relations in economically challenged fresno ill get on it ten minutes later fuentes came back on the line dance knew from the first word chief what the story was going to be madigan sighed youre sure hes gone there werent that many people inside it being early yeah im sure damn stanning muttered but the limp in fuentess voice came from another source as well and i have to tell you while i was keeping an eye on the theater i was in the restaurant i know you told me what madigan growled somebody broke into my cruiser go on i wasnt thinking i had a glock in the backseat it was in a box and under my jacket i dont know how anybody couldve seen it or thought it was there dance knew from the way he volunteered the information that the gun hadnt been hidden at all goddamn it madigan shouted im sorry it shouldve been in the trunk but it was completely hid it shoulda been home thats your personal weapon it shoulda been at home i was going to the range tonight the deputy said miserably you know what i gotta do gabe dont have any options i know you want my service piece and shield need em yeah ill get the paperwork done today well have the inquiry as fast as we can but itll be three or four days youre out of commission till then im sorry bring your stuff in he stabbed the speakerphone button harutyun said in his low stressfree voice it could be one of the gangs its not one of the gangs madigan snapped its our fucking stalker at least if we find it on him hell go to jail for a long long time hell thiss one clever son of a bitch he got fuentes suspended and a nice big gun to boot dance looked at the lyric sheet they had pinned up on a badly mounted corkboard wheres he going to strike a river a river and crystal stanning added whos he got in mind for the next victim chapter marygordon stay off that see the sign its not moving mommy the sixyearold pointed out suellyn sanchez reflected what perfect logic that was the warning sign on the baggage carousel stay off the moving belt it could start at any minute but when the light comes on i can get off how they tested the limits the mother and daughter were at the arrivals area in fresnoyosemite airport their flight from portland having arrived twenty minutes early suellyn looked around for their ride saw no one yet and turned back to the girl and its filthy youll get your dress stained that risk apparently didnt carry much weight either but all it took was one marygordon uttered in a certain tone that very special tone and the cute blonde stepped back immediately funny suellyn thought she and her husband never laid a hand on the girl never even threatened spanking and their daughter was far better behaved than the children of neighbors who did wallop their kidsall in the name of raising them right sadists she thought and then reminded herself to chill bobby prescotts death had cast a pall over everything and how was kayleigh holding up she and bobby had quite a history of course and suellyn knew that her kid sister would be reeling from the loss the poor thing and the possibility that hed been murdered maybe by that gross stalker whod been bothering kayleigh for the past few months terrible she remembered bishops call that morning after shed learned the sad news from kayleigh the conversation with her father had been conducted in the clumsy way he bobbled nearly everything personal suellyn was thinking it was odd that hed called in the first place much less to ask if shed come to fresno to support her sister during this tough time until suellyn realized bishop would want to share the bereavement duty with someone else anyone else well no hed want to hand off the job completely if he could but who knew his real motive their father was both transparent and unreadable and where was the luggage she was impatient suellyn resembled her younger sister in a vague way she had a wholly unsupported theory that the greater the distance in age the less siblings looked like each other eight years separated the two and suellyn was taller of broader build and fuller face which couldnt be traced to the fifteen pounds she had on her sister her nose was longer and her chin stronger she felt though her light brown hair was of the same fine flowing texture light as air today she was prepared for the assault of a late fresno summer in a burgundy sundress cut low in front and back and brighton sandals whose silver hearts covering the first two toes fascinated marygordon even in this outfit though she was uncomfortably hot portland had clocked in at degrees that morning wheres aunt kayleigh shes getting ready to sing a show the one were going to on friday maybe her sister hadnt actually invited her to the concert good i like it when she sings with a blare of a horn and a flashing orange light the baggage belt started to move see you wouldnt have had time to get off yes i could and then i could ride around and see whats behind that curtain they wouldnt like that who suellyn was not going to talk about tsa and terrorists they she repeated firmly and marygordon forgot about the question as she spotted the first suitcase and gleefully charged toward it her white keds squeaking on the linoleum her pink dress accented with a red bow fluttering around her the luggage was retrieved and they both walked away from the belt and the crowds and paused in front of one of the doors her mobile rang she glanced down hey daddy youre in the man growled and hello and nice day to you too ritchies on his way to pick you up or you couldve come to collect your daughter and granddaughter in person bishop towne didnt drive but he had plenty in his crew to play chauffeurif hed wanted to come suellyn found a bogus smile on her face as often happened when she was talking to her father even though he was miles away bishop towne intimidated suellyn less than he did his younger daughter but it was still plenty i can take a cab no you wont you got in early ritchiell be there then as if he remembered he should be saying somethingor possibly had been prodded by wife number four sherihe asked hows marygordon she cant wait to see you suellyn told him is that passiveaggressive a little me too and he disconnected im taking a damn cab she thought im not hanging around do you need to use the girls room no are you sure itll be a while before we get to aunt kayleighs house no can i get some jelly bears therell be treats at your aunts house okay excuse me suellyn she turned to see bishops minion ritchie a young man looking every inch the member of a country musicians entourage im your chauffeur nice to meet you he shook her hand and smiled toward marygordon hello hello she said welcome to fresno youre marygordon ill bet he said my name right she beamed hers wasnt mary with gordon as a middle name it was a good doublebarreled southern name and the girl wasnt shy about correcting anyone who got it wrong let me get those for you he said and took both suitcases marygordon yielded up the bag without protest to the man who knew her name get ready for the heat a lot different from oregon you going to your fathers or kayleighs kayleighs were going to surprise her thatll be fun suellyn hoped so bishop had been adamant that suellyn not call kayleigh and tell her of the visitbecause the younger of the sisters would probably have told her not to come she wouldnt want any sympathy because of bobbys death bishop said but family had to stick together father knows best uhhuh kayleighs got a great swimming pool ritchie said to marygordon you going to go swimming i have two suits so one can dry and i can still swim in the other isnt that smart bishops associate said what kind of suits are they hello kitty marygordon wrinkled her nose im too old for hello kitty and spongebob one has flowers on it and the other is plain blue i can swim without floaties they stepped outside and the heat was as fierce as promised he turned around and glanced down at the girl with a smile you know youre cute as a button marygordon asked what does that mean the young man looked at suellyn and they both laughed he said i dont have any idea they waited for traffic then crossed into the lot he whispered its good youre here kayleighs pretty upset about bobby i can imagine do they know what happened not yet its been terrible for everybody he lifted his voice and said to marygordon hey before we go to your aunts you want to see something fun yeah its really neat and youll like it he glanced at suellyn little detour theres this park practically on the way please mommy all right but we dont want to be too late ritchie he blinked oh im not ritchie i came to fetch you instead they arrived at his car he took the suitcases and her computer bag and stashed them in the trunk of the big old buick it was bright reda color you didnt see much nowadays chapter at kayleighs house kathryn dance was talking to darthur morgan who was holding but being on duty not reading one of his old books youve got an unusual name she said means morning in german spelled different the huge mans still face didnt break character thats funny dance told him shed been referring to his given name used it before they were sitting in the living room all the shades drawn while kayleigh was upstairs changing clothes as if being in the place where bobby prescott had died had somehow tainted what shed worn the security man continued you know people think being black i was named darthur because my parents didnt know how to spell arthur or got confused you hear that sometimes you do true fact is they were both teachers and they like the classics he lifted his leatherbound book dickens he added malorys morte darthur was one of their favorites the king arthur stories he lifted an eyebrow not a lot of cops know that but then youre not just a cop not any more than youre just a bodyguard she didnt add that she was also a mother who helped her children with their homework she eyed the book in his hand great expectations she asked is kayleigh handling this okay borderline id say i dont go way back with her her lawyers and her father hired me when that fellow started popping up shes the best of the celebrities ive ever worked with nicest polite i could tell you some stories about clients ive had though he wouldnt he was a pro through and through when this assignment was over darthur morgan would instantly forget everything he knew about kayleigh towne even the fact that hed worked for her youre armed yes dance had been pretty sure but she was glad to hear the confirmation and glad to hear too that morgan didnt continue to chat about his weapon or how proficient he was much less whether hed ever used it professional it could be that edwins stolen a glock i know i talked to chief madigan the big man retired to the front door sat down in a chair challenged by his weight dance sipped the iced tea that kayleigh had brought her she looked around the room at the many awards and gold and platinum records hanging on the walls there was a framed picture from the cover of country times and dance had to laugh it was a picture of kayleigh holding the country music associations singer of the year award as shed been accepting it a young man a country singer with a selfpolished reputation for being a bad boy had leapt onto the stage and taken the microphone away berating her for being too young to win and not true to traditional country roots he railed that another singer should have won kayleigh had let him finish and then pulled the microphone out of his hand and said if he was such a supporter of traditional country then name the topfive lifetime hits of george jones loretta lynn and patsy cline or name any five of them kayleigh had challenged he did a deer in the headlights thing for a long ten seconds in front of a live tv audience of millions and then slunk off the stage his arm raised for some reason like a heavy metal rockers kayleigh finished her acceptance speech and to a standing ovation concluded by naming all the hits shed asked him to recite kayleigh now joined them wearing blue jeans and a thick dark gray blouse untucked and concealing as if edwin were observing her from the distance through highpowered binoculars and whos to say he wasnt the singer sighed and sat on a floral sofa in the middle of the spacious room dance said i just talked to the deputy at the convention center all of the crew are accounted for except tye and alicia oh she called ten minutes ago i told her about the second verse and made sure she was looking out for herself kayleigh smiled she almost sounded like she was hoping edwind try something with her shes pretty tough ands got a temper she called tye slocum and left a message i dont know why he left and all the while darthur morgan said nothing and didnt even seem to hear the conversation he simply scanned the house the windows he took a phone call and put the mobile away then stiffened the big man was on his feet looking out the front window visitors he paused hm whole entourage and it looks official chapter entourage described it pretty well kayleigh towne decided two suvsone dusty white lexus bishops and a big black lincoln navigator bishop and sheri climbed out and turned to the other vehicle four passengers first was security it was easy to tell a solid sunglassed man well over six feet a pale complexion he looked around and then leaned into the suv and whispered something the next to climb out was a slim thoughtfullooking man with thinning hair the third also in a dark suit white shirt and tie was much taller and had a politicians head of hair which made sense because kayleigh realized thats exactly who he was one of californias star congressmen william davis a twoterm democrat kayleigh glanced at dance who observed this all with a careful gaze a woman was the last to climb out of the navigator dressed also in a conservative matching navy jacket and skirt fleshcolored stockings the guard stayed with the suv and the others followed bishop and his wife into the house inside bishop hugged his daughter and as if in an afterthought asked how she was holding up kayleigh thought it was the way hed ask a gaffer whose name he didnt know how he was weathering the loss of an elderly parent he also didnt seem to remember that hed been here just a few hours ago what on earth were they doing here anyway bishop examined dance as if hed never met her and he ignored darthur morgan completely he said to his daughter this heres congressman davis and his aides peter simesky and myra babbage the slim unsmiling woman with squarecut brunette hair nodded formally she seemed a bit starstruck to be in kayleighs presence ms towne its an honor the congressman said hey call me kayleigh youre making me older than i want to be davis laughed and im bill its easy to remember ive sponsored a few of them in congress kayleigh gave a brief smile and she introduced dance and morgan we just flew into san francisco a few days ago and have been making our way south i was in touch with your father asking about getting to your concert oh im paying for tickets dont you worry im afraid we just need a little extra security bishop said weve got it all taken care of i was hoping for a chance to meet you and to say hi in person your father suggested bringing me along today before the concert so that was it kayleigh understood dammit her father had said theyd think about canceling the show and yet he was going to do whatever he needed to make sure it went forward anything to edge her career in the right direction hed be thinking that her knowing that the congressmanand accordingly more reporterswould be in the audience would pressure her not to cancel kayleigh fumed but smiled pleasantly or tried to as davis rambled like a schoolboy talking about songs of hers he particularly loved he really was quite a fan he knew every word of every tune it seemed myra babbage said i cant thank you enough for letting us use leaving home on the website its really become an anthem for bills campaign kathryn dance said i heard you on the radio congressman on the drive over herethat debate on immigration issues that was some heated discussion oh it sure was i think you won by the way you drove em into the ground thanks it was a lot of fun davis said with a gleam in his eye i love debates that was my quote sport at school less painful to talk than getting run into on the football field not necessarily safer though kayleigh didnt follow politics much some of her fellow performers were active in campaigns and causes but shed known them before theyd hit it big and they hadnt seemed particularly interested in animal rights or hunger before they started drawing the public limelight she suspected that a number had been tapped by their public relations firms or their record company publicity departments to take up a cause because it would look good in the press she knew though about us congressman bill davis he was a politico with an electric mix of positions liberal and conservative the most controversial of which was relaxing border controls to let in more foreigners subject to requirements like an absence of criminal conviction an englishlanguage test and guarantees of employment prospects he was one of the frontrunners for the next presidential campaign and had already started stumping peter simesky the aide said ill confirm hes a fan on the campaign buses youre right up there with taylor swift randy travis james taylor and the stones for our listening pleasure hope youre okay with that company ill take it you bet then the congressman grew serious your father said theres a bit of a problem at the moment somebody who might be stalking you this was half directed to dance as well kayleighs father must have mentioned that she was an agent afraid thats true dance said youre with fresno myra babbage asked weve been working with a few people there on security no cbi that she was here would normally mean the case was a major one but she added im based in monterey happened to be here unofficially and heard about the incident i volunteered to help we were just in monterey too davis said campaigning at cannery row thats why the traffic was so bad back at home before i left dance joked i wish it had been worse it was good turnout not a great turnout kayleigh supposed monterey and particularly carmel were bastions of conservative voters who would not be particularly happy about a proimmigration candidate the congressman nodded toward the agent im sure the cbi and the local authorities are doing everything they can but if you need any help from me just let me know stalking can be a federal crime too kayleigh thanked him dance did too and simesky gave the agent his card you need any help seriously the slim young man said earnestly give me a call any time ill do that dance replied and glanced down to her hip as her phone buzzed its a text from detective harutyun she looked up she sighed theyve found the next crime scene its another killing another fire but it was worse than at the concert hall he says there might be more than one victim they just cant tell chapter the fires still going harutyun told her over the phone he mustve used five gallons of accelerant its in a shed beside the san joaquin river you sit by the river wondering what you got wrong how many chances youd missed all along like your troubles had somehow turned you to stone and the water was whispering why dont you come home everyone in the room was staring at dance she ignored them and concentrated on her conversation with harutyun any witnesses no how do you know its related to the stalking well i dont know how to put it but out front we found a little shrine to kayleigh what yesm pretty sick a mound of rocks and a couple of her cds next to them in front of the shed and you know what was weird more than that dance couldnt begin to guess a twentydollar bill under a rock like an offering and no idea of the victim or victims he reminded the team got a look inside and saw a couple of legs thats about all that was left then the roof came down it was part of an old gas station so theyre being careful thinking there could be a buried tank nearby charlie shean has his cs people running the scene outside as close as they can its hot as hades out there one of the techs fainted from the heat the jumpsuit no tire treads or footprints weve found two shell casings ninemillimeter a click of the detectives tongue same as fuentess gun got stolen but that could be a coincidence at leasti pray this happenedhe shot em before he set em on fire we can hope no bloodstains but looks like he swept over the dirt with a branch or something theyre taking samples dna could be the only way to find out who he killed an altar to kayleigh well it was in keeping with stalker behavior charlies folks also ran the scene of the phone booth where he called kayleigh they got some trace but the fingerprintsclose to fortydont match anything else and theyre not in aifis any spotting of edwin nope ive got to go ill call you when i know more kathryn thanks she disconnected turned to kayleigh her father and the others and gave them a report bishop closed his eyes and muttered what mightve been a prayer dance recalled hed gone through a phase where he released a christian albumafter rehab it hadnt sold well whos the victim kayleigh asked breathlessly we dont know it could be more than one but because of the fire they couldnt get a good look inside but wheres alicia and tye kayleigh called and got through to both of them all the rest of the crew were accounted for too kayleigh reported after speaking to tye slocum jesus alicia was out riding her horse and tye he was picking up extra guitar strings weve got a thousand in the truck why did he need to do that drives me crazy the congressman and his entourage looked uneasy and davis seemed to be thinking that a visit at this moment had not been a good idea he said weve got some campaigning to do sorry to have bothered you not at all it was bishop not kayleigh who made this comment davis reiterated that hed help out however he could hed see her at the concert im not she fell silent looking at her father who gave no reaction hey thanks for your support hope i can say the same to you on election day peter simesky the aide stepped up to dance once more he shook her hand you have my card if theres anything else you need please just let me know kinesics is a skill that doesnt shut off when you leave the office the instant hed made eye contact with her earlier she knew that simesky wanted to get to know her better if circumstances allowed she gave him credit he wore no wedding ring and his first glance had been at her left hand he might very well be one of those men who was not interested in an extramarital affair he also exuded a comfortable but not blunt selfconfidence he wasnt put off by the two inches of height she had on him or abashed about his small frame and thinning hair ironically her present romantic partner jon boling shared those attributes but with kathryn dances complicated personal life there was no room or inclination for expansion she nodded politely to simesky and made sure the handshake was brief and professional she couldnt tell if he got the message then davis followed by simesky and myra babbage left the house and made their way to the suv the security man opened the doors for them in a minute they were speeding down the dirt and gravel driveway then kayleighs eyes flashed in shock and she began to cry wait he burned them she whispered thats right no no thiss my fault too her shoulders rose jaw tight she angrily wiped away tears my song hes using another one of my songs dance pointed out the crime scenes by the river just like the second verse no the fire first bobby and now these other people edwin sent me an email well a bunch of them saying how much he liked my song fire and flame she picked up the cd of your shadow and showed dance the liner notes love is fire love is flame it warms your heart it lights the way it burns forever just like the sun it welds two souls and makes them one love is fire love is flame bishop said to his daughter hey kt dont go blaming yourself you cant take into account all the damn crazies out there that boys a sicko and nothing but if it wasnt you itd be somebody else the sentences were wooden he wasnt adept at offering solace he burned those people to death daddy bishop didnt know what to say and he walked to the kitchen and got himself a glass of milk sheri stood uneasily beside one of the guitars dance called harutyun again but thered been no new developments when bishop returned he looked at the watch on his big ruddy wrist hey you heard from your sister well i talked to her this morning i called her about bobby why they shoulda been here by now or maybe kayleighs mouth actually dropped what do you mean daddy maybe shes headed to our place no what are you talking about been here why would she be here bishop looked down i thought itd be good for her to come moral support with bobby called her this morning they flew up landed an hour ago this would be how he delivered important news tossed out casually like a softball oh christ why didnt you tell me she has no business wait you said them is the whole family coming uhuhn robertos working its just suellyn and marygordon kayleigh raged why on earth would you do that with this madman around a little girl moral support he growled back flustered like i said oh jesus oh jesus kayleigh sat down thats not why you asked them but then her voice rose to a high pitch the fire the attack oh you dont think its not them settle there kt how would this sharp fella even know they were at the airport bishop asked and what flight they were coming in on kayleigh grabbed her phone and dialed she slammed the disconnect button voicemail who was going to pick them up why didnt you tell me why didnt you go had that meeting with the congressman i sent ritchie all right ill give him a call bishop found his mobile and placed a call hey me whats the story where are they who who dyou think i mean suellyn and her kid thats who what every eye in the room was locked on him when oh fuck he disconnected okay well what happened was he got a call from a friend of yours a glance at his daughter he was going to give them a ride here who kayleigh cried who the hell was it ritchie doesnt remember the name but whoever it was knew the flight number knew their names said youd rather he picked them up sheri said but if it was him edwin howd he know ritchie was going to pick them up bishops eyes bored into the carpet at his feet well shit what daddy what this morning we had breakfast at the herndon café sheri and me we were pretty much alone in the place pretty much had it to ourselves except there was somebody else sitting nearby his back to us tall fellow black hair couldnt see him he coulda overheard me talking to suellyn and calling ritchie giving him the information i doubt it but coulda happened what time dance asked i dont know ninethirty ten dance reflected edwin was at the movie theater about eleven the timing could work sheri towne stepped up to kayleigh and touched her shoulder tentatively dance noticed the singers lips tighten sheri stepped back but how would he know ritchie kayleigh asked to get his number and call him could he be connected to you on your site or in the press dance asked maybe hes listed on the last albums he was one of my assistants and drivers in the acknowledgments dance said with all the research edwin does sure he couldve found out kayleigh began to cry whatre we going to do dance called harutyun and told him their concern he said he was going to check something as she waited her eyes were on bishop he was fuming sheri kept a bit of distance dance wondered who the anger was directed at she guessed it would be ritchie bishop seemed the sort to blame everyone but himself for the problems in life harutyun came back on after an interminable five minutes video at the airport a woman in her thirties and little girl got into edwins buick about thirty minutes after the flight from portland landed dance looked at the expectant faces she told them what the deputy had said no kayleigh screamed no and agent dance kathryn harutyun was saying on the line just heard from the fire team theres only one body inside he hesitated not too big could be a teenagerboy or girlor a woman cant tell bodys burned down to the bone at least if it is the sister the little girls still alive but that also means hes got her and that i dont even want to think about chapter kayleigh placed yet another frantic call answer answer answer she whispered she grimaced suellyn its me call me right away i mean immediately theres a problem she looked at the screen how do i mark it urgent her voice broke i dont know how how do i mark it urgent dance took her phone examined the screen and hit a button and dance had given her opinion that stalkers tended not to target family members what was going on in edwins mind if he had in fact kidnapped the two had he been so incensed about the arrest that hed snapped had he started stalking bishop that morning to learn what he could and found out about the arrival of kayleighs sister and niece in the car maybe hed confessed his love for kayleigh and enlisted suellyns aid to win her over when the woman refused hed killed her and taken the girl maybe he intended to raise her treating her like a young kayleigh of his own dance was a tough policewoman yes but she was a mother too and she simply didnt want to face that scenario please kayleigh begged once more isnt there anything you can do track her phone or something that can be done it takes time but sure ill order it not sharing with anyone least of all kayleigh that if the body in the shed was suellyn there would be no phone left to track dance was speaking to tj scanlon about contacting the womans provider when darthur morgan called from the entryway another car coming well what on earths this dance wondered what that cryptic comment might mean a moment later there was the clunk of car doors closing and the sound of a vehicle accelerating away on the gravel drive then the front door opened and in walked a woman in her thirties and an adorable little goldenhaired girl of about six in a pink dress she held a stuffed plush toy she ignored everyone in the room except the singer whom she ran to and hugged aunt kayleigh look we went to this neat museum and we brought you a stuffed redwood tree chapter kathryn dance smiled a greeting to the woman shed been introduced tosuellyn sanchez kayleighs sisterand walked to the door she noted the big red buick speeding away it was him kayleigh whispered also looking out the window and struggling to put on a calm facade so as not to worry the little girl suellyn embraced her fathera seemingly pro forma gesture she greeted sheri too more affectionately than kayleigh had whats with the police is this about bobby kayleigh however glanced icily toward her father and turned her attention to marygordon honey let me show you some new games i got for the next time you visited just for you yay wheres freddie hes in the stable at grandpas house you and your mommy are going to be staying there i like freddie but i want to stay with you the girl announced oh im not going to be here much ill come see you at grandpas okay come on her arm around the girl kayleigh steered the girl to the bodyguard and this is mr morgan hes a friend of mine he hangs out with us he delicately shook the girls hand my names darthur you can call me that the girl looked at the security man with curiosity thats a funny name you bet it is the man said looking uncertainly at kayleigh but following gamely my names marygordon but its not two names its one mary and gordon with a line in between they call the line a hyphen its a very pretty name thank you i like you dance called harutyun and told him that the sister and niece were safe he reported they still had no id on the victim but the fire was out and the csu and medical examiners were about to go inside process the body and run the scene kaleigh and the girl vanished into the den and kayleigh returned a moment later steamed up to her sister and said what were you thinking what do you know who gave you that ride that friend of yours said his name was stan dance pointed out stanton middle name jesus christ kayleighs voice dropped its my goddamn stalker did you think to call hes the one who murdered bobby what oh my god but you said he was fat disgusting well he made himself unfat kayleigh snapped looking angrily into her sisters brown eyes she shook her head and relented sorry its not your fault you just you shouldnt be here a cold glance toward bishop dance said we arent sure whos behind it edwin sharp is a possible suspect but you should avoid any more contact with him where did you go kayleigh asked he asked if we wanted to see something marygordon might like he said it was on the way we went to the tree museum near fortyone and the bluffs he said he knew you liked to spend time hiking in the forest kayleigh closed her eyes he knew that too her hands were shaking i was so scared why didnt you pick up when i called the phone was in my computer bag he put that in the trunk i was going to keep it with me but he took it i mean im sorry k but he knew everything about you he said youd written a song about trees but it got coopted by greenpeace or some eco movement and you stopped performing it i didnt even know that he knew about everybody in the band he knew about sheri i thought he was a good friend morgan said so the other killing just now by the river that couldnt have been him dance considered the timing again she decided that edwin could have abducted and shot the victim set fire to the body and made it to the airport in time to pick up suellyn and her daughter oh jesus we were in the car with somebody whod just killed a man suellyn whispered bishop said well youre safe now thats all that matters but that fucker hes going down kayleigh wiped more tears suellyn said this is just so strange i almost got the idea he was your boyfriend he said he was worried about you you looked so tired there was a lot of pressure on you he wasnt even sure it was a good idea to give the concert he thought you should reschedule kayleighs eyes swiveled to her father once more but that topic remained buried he said suellyn struggled to get it just right he said sometimes kayleigh needed to think more about whats good for her too many people wanted a piece of her soul your shadow bishop turned to his older daughter asking casually how was the flight jesus dad really suellyn looked exasperated kayleigh said she didnt want marygordon here any longer she was afraid edwin would come back again to spy and might try to approach the girl they should go with bishop and sheri to their house outside town and they should leave now kayleigh blinked and then looked down realizing she was still holding the goofy stuffed redwood tree she started to throw it out angrily but changed her mind and set it aside on a shelf suellyn went into the den to get her daughter and the toys kayleigh had bought her at that moment dances phone rang dennis harutyun was calling she asked so youve identified the vic thats right is there any connection with kayleigh she asked yes and no you better come see chapter the stench was bad but so much rubber and plastic and oil had burned that at least the smell of human flesh and hair was largely obscured the wind helped too not that dance didnt need all her willpower to keep from gagging if not worse love is fire love is flame the scene was a broad dusty field a cracked and crumbling parking lot a longclosed gas station collapsed in on itself and the burned shed of which there wasnt much left the smoke was still rising in furious plumes the heat you could feel from the shoulder of the road not far away was the graybrown strip of low river that had inspired this location for the killing the csu team was still at work though the firefighters outnumbered the police fire was a much greater risk to the population of fresno than a single crazed stalker harutyun the senior detective on the scene explained what theyd found which wasnt much the shell casings the cds the moneythe altar to kayleigh but even the twentydollar bill seemed to have been washedliterally laundered and the fire had been such a serious threat that the men and women had charged onto the grounds with hoses to contain the flames surely contaminating the scene worse besides dance guessed if edwin was behind the killing he wouldnt have left much evidence he was too clever for that harutyun continued the explanation hed begun over the phone the victim had indeed known kayleighand about a thousand other performers his name was frederick blanton hes a crook harutyun summarized was a crook dance thought of the cds the altar and what she knew of the music business into illegal file sharing thats very good kathryn yes whats the story there were close to ten thousand computers on the network people would download songs music videos too kayleighs were among the most popular howd you id him dance glanced inside obviously no prints werent hardly even any hands or feet one hand mustve burned down to ash gone completely well have to confirm with dna but we found his wallet in a part of the shed that didnt burn so bad we checked his addresshe lived in the tower district about seven eight miles from here a teams going through his house now they found his door kicked and it was a messall his computers were wrecked we figured the perp probably forced him to destroy the filesharing servers then made him get into the trunk of his car if its edwin hes got plenty of room in that buick of his drove him here shot him and set the fire dance mused how easy would it have been for edwin to find him google torrent and kayleigh towne and download and his sitea nod toward the shedwas in the top ten some basic research and hedve come up with the address id guess our boy seems good at that and he left the altar as a warning not to steal from kayleigh a stalkers likely to target anybody whos a threat to you or even offended you hes taking real seriously his role as a protector and the crime scene at his house evidence nothing no prints foot or finger some trace but he shrugged an indication of its marginal usefulness they did find he had a partner whos feeling a little uneasy at the moment dance speculated well hes not in the area guess you dont need to be nextdoor neighbors with your coconspirator if youre doing computer crimes you could be in south america or serbia wheres he based salinas hm monterey county you have the guys nameand physical or computer address csud have it the detective made a call and asked that the information be sent to her phone she noted that hed memorized her number the unit chimed a moment later with the incoming message ill send it to some people i know there they can follow up with him she composed an email and sent it off harutyun then said im trying to keep an open mind i know it seems to be edwin but im still looking into motives anybody else would have had to kill bobby ive been getting a lot of information about him but so far nothing jumps out and now i guess i better add this guy into the mix but well thereve gotta be a lot of people whod like to murder a file sharer half the record companies and movie studios another squad car arrived crunching over the gravel dirt and bleached twigs that bordered the site of the blackened earth it parked near a faded conoco sign depicting a pale green dinosaur dances daughter maggie was presently in a jurassic phase her room was littered with plastic versions of the reptiles dance tamped down a pang missing her children p k madigan climbed out surveyed the scene with hands on his slim hips overshadowed by his belly then he joined dance and harutyun so he was stealing her songs thats right madigan grumbled never thought hed switch to landlines should have we all should have and where the hell is he hes got a car as big as my boat and its bright red to boot i dont see how he keeps losing my folks his phone rang and he regarded the screen lo you dont say naw ill go myself he disconnected well all righty then i cant tell you where edwin was when this fella died but i can tell you where he is now hes parked in front of kayleighs house again in the arboretum lot across the road whats he doing sitting on the hood of his car happy as a clam having himself a picnic i want to have a talk with him well actually id like you to have a talk with him kathryn you up for that you bet i am chapter that conversation did not however occur driving in tandem they were at kayleighs house fast in twentyfive minutes but edwin sharp had left by then he has a sixth sense dance thought though she did not believe in sixth senses was it her imagination or did she see a cloud of dust hanging over the spot from which he might have just sped off hard to tell there was a lot of dust in fresno the sky was clear but wind rose occasionally and a nearby vortex of beige powder swirled into a tiny funnel and then melted away dance and madigan both parked across the road from kayleighs house and climbed out this side of the road was lush thanks to the park kayleighs yard too was thickly landscaped in the distance south and west was a vista of low fields now just dark dirt whatever was grown there had been harvested the detective gave a knowing glance toward heracknowledging frustration at their missing quarryand leaned against his car to make a call from the brief conversation dance deduced it was to the deputy at kayleighs houseprovided to supplement darthur morgan when the manpower allowed he disconnected was jose at the house a nod edwin was here ten minutes ago they didnt see which way he went dance could understand why from here you could see only the second story of the house which was about three hundred feet away down the gravel driveway she wondered if the windows visible from herethe ones edwin had just presumably been staring at while he had his mealwere kayleighs bedroom silence for a time the sun was low and dance could feel the day shedding heat in layers madigan said had a snake in my backyard a couple three years ago big rattler i mean a big one saw him once and never again for the rest of that summer was he under the barbecue the house had he left altogether walked around with my sidearm all the time which i never do because of the kids dance said because of the kids we took to calling him the invisible snake but it wasnt funny ruined the backyard for the whole season and saw him one time only all right he stood with hands on his hips again looking over the park youre in town all alone you want to come over for dinner my wife shes a pretty good cook ill probably just get something back at the motel get some sleep we got good desserts ice cream a laugh naw judy bakes well ice cream ends up being involved think ill pass thanks good evening to you kathryn you too chief dance returned to the mountain view the locks on her suitcases were intact and nothing seemed to be disturbed dance glanced out the window at the park saw no surveillance and closed the blinds as soon as she did the hotel phone rang agent dance a pleasant male voice thats right its peter simesky congressman daviss aide he asked as if shed have no clue who he was yes hi hi actually im in the lobby of your motel the congressman was speaking at a farm nearby could i talk to you am i interrupting anything she could find no credible excuse and said shed be out in a minute in the lobby she found the man on his phone and he politely ended the call when he spotted her they shook hands and he grinned though the smile soon morphed into a frown i heard they confirmed another attack thats right homicide anyone connected to kayleigh not directly is there anything we can do so far no but appreciate that its this stalker pointing to him but we dont know for sure simesky tilted his head in a certain way and dance knew a related story would be forthcoming the congressmans had a few problems himself a couple of campaign workers and interns two women and a gay man too they got infatuated i guess you could say dance explained about erotomania fits the classic profile a powerful man and somebody in a lower professional position any physical threats no no just got awkward simesky had a large bottle of water and he drank it thirstily she noticed his white shirt was sweat stained he followed her glance and laughed the congressmans been delivering his ecofriendly speech at farms from watsonville to fresno the temperature was a lot more pleasant in your neighborhood watsonville just north of where dance lived was near the coast and she agreed a lot more pleasant weatherwise than the san joaquin valley you got a good turnout ill bet at the farms because of his immigrant position you mean oh you bet we considered it a successand there were only forty protesters maybe fifty and no one threw anything we get tomatoes sometimes brussels sprouts too kind of ironic a candidate in support of farmworkers getting pelted by vegetables from the antifarmworker contingent dance smiled simesky looked toward the motels bar how bout a glass of wine she hesitated this wont take long its important dance remembered his look her way at kayleighs house and his slightly overlong handshake was she the object of a stalker herself she said just to set the record straight im seeing somebody he gave a wistful embarrassed smile you caught that hm i do this for a living ive heard about you a grin i better watch my body language well agent dance kathryn yeah i was flirting a bitthen and just a few seconds ago and im disappointed to hear about your friend never hurts to ask never does edwin sharp should take some lessons from peter simesky but there was another point to this too completely innocent okay lets get that wine in the dim tacky bar she ordered a merlot and simesky a chardonnay what a case youve got yourself that stalker he said hes persistent and smart and obsessed the most dangerous kind of perp but you were saying youre not sure its him were never sure until we get a confession or the evidence proves the case i guess not im a lawyer but i never did criminal work well now my agenda the wine arrived and they sipped without tapping glasses about kayleigh towne no its about you me bill davis likes you oh wait not that way the aide added quickly the only person hes ever flirted with since college is his wife theyve been together twentyeight years no this is a professional interest do you follow politics much some i try to keep informed davis is somebody id vote for if i was in his district simesky seemed to take this as very good news he continued hes pretty liberal then you know and some people in the party are afraid that as a presidential candidate hes going to be perceived as soft on law and order itd go a long way ifyes you can see this cominga long way if somebody like you were aligned with him youre smart attractivesorry cant help myselfand have a great record with the cbi and im a woman that doesnt count the way it used to what does aligned mean what hed like if you were interested is to discuss a justice department appointment something pretty senior wed just like to broach it at this point no commitments on anybodys side dance had to laugh washington thats right her initial reaction was to dismiss the idea as absurd thinking that uprooting the children might be difficult also shed miss the fieldwork but then she realized that shed have the chance to spread word of her kinesic analysis techniques of investigation and interrogation around the country she was adamantly opposed to extreme interrogation techniques as both immoral and ineffective and she was intrigued by the idea that she might have influence in changing those practices at a very high level and reconsidering as for the kids what was wrong with exposing them to a different city especially the nations capital for a few years maybe she could commute between the two coasts peter simesky had to laugh i dont have your expertise but if im reading your face right youre considering it and then she wondered what would michael oneil think of this oh and jon boling too though as a consultant he could live anywhere she wouldnt do anything without talking to him first though this is completely out of left field i never in a million years thought about anything like it simesky continued therere too many career politicians messing up government we need people whove lived in the trenches theyll work for a while and go home to the back forty take up farmin again a smile or being cops is it okay to say cop not the least offensive simesky slid off the bar stool paid the check ive given you a lot to think about and you dont need to decide now not with this investigation going on just let it sit he stood up and shook her hand at the doorway he paused that guy you mentioned pretty serious huh yep tell him hes a lucky man and by the way i hate him a cherubic smile and then he was gone dance finished her winethis would be it for the evening she decidedand returned to her room laughing to herself deputy director of the federal bureau of investigation kathryn dance maybe just maybe she could get used to that it was now ninethirty hardly late but she was exhausted time for yet another shower and sleep but that too was interrupted her phone rang once more and she didnt recognize the caller id number let it go but the investigator within her decided to answer just as well it turned out that the caller was edwin sharps former girlfriend chapter sally docking was her name deputy miguel lopez had tracked her down in seattle and left a message to contact dance who now thanked her for calling a hesitant melodious voice like sure id like to talk to you about edwin sharp oh edwin is he okay odd question yes he is i wonder if you could answer a few questions for me i guess but like whats this about you were in a relationship with him correct yeah for a while we met in february a year ago we worked in the same mall we started going out and moved in for a few months it didnt work out we broke up around christmas whats i mean im kind of curious why youre asking sometimes you can be too evasive and the subjects clam up hes been showing some inappropriate interest in someone here in california he has really whats that mean were looking into whether or not hes guilty of stalking edwin she sounded genuinely surprised dance jotted this impression in her notebook have you heard from him lately no its been months and months sally tell me did he ever threaten you threaten no never did he ever threaten or show excessive interest in other women that you know about no i cant even picture it did you ever see him engage in any obsessive behavior well like i dont know what you mean exactly he got pretty intense maybe youd call it obsessive hed get into something like totally get excited about a wii game or some fantasy author and hed buy all their books how about people stars musicians he liked movies yeah he went a lot in theaters not on tv so much but his big thing was music yeah he really liked cassie mcguire and kayleigh towne and charlie holmes and mike normanyou know them yes i do the latter two dance noted were men and then this band from seattle the pointless bricks i know its a stupid name but theyre really really good edwin totally loved them if he was going to see somebody in concert hed get tickets way ahead of time and make sure that his schedule let him get away hed be at the concert hall like three hours early even if he had reserved seats and hed stand in line afterwards hoping to get an autograph and hed get their souvenirs on ebay it was a waste of money i mean to me thats pretty obsessive after you left him did you have a problem with him calling you following you harassing you no i mean hed call sometimes about something hed left at my apartment and wed taken out a loan together and we had to talk about that sign some papers but stalking no nothing like that only one thing you said when i left him thats not what happened he left me dance could have kicked herself and earlier shed been mentally chastising p k madigan for leading edwin during the interview here she was doing exactly the same tell me what happened he just said the relationship wasnt working i was pretty bummed he wasnt you know real ambitious he never wanted to be more than a security guard or work retail but he was romantic and he was dependable he didnt drink and hed pretty much given up smoking when i was with him so he used to smoke dance said thinking of her own voyeur in the park near the motel yeah but only when he was stressed so he left and i was pretty bummed out for a couple of months did he go out with anybody else not really he dated a few girls i dont know who we fell out of touch one last question did you ever see him get violent or lose control a pause yeah i did tell me sally explained okay once me and my girlfriend and edwin were walking down the street and this drunk guy came up i mean way way drunk and he called us sluts and edwin goes up to him and shouts apologize right now you asshole and the guy did dance waited that was it he never hit this man oh no edwind never do that i mean hes scarylooking sure those eyebrows you know and hes big but hed never hurt anybody look theres a lot edwin doesnt get you know what i mean hes kind of like a kid thats part of what makes him so charming though hardly a word dance would use but shed given up trying to figure out what made couples click dance thanked the young woman and disconnected she jotted a summary of the conversation into her notebook so what do i make of this a relatively normal relationship with one woman didnt mean he couldnt stalk another but stalking was habitual for sally to be involved for a year and to live with him for part of that time yet not see any danger signs was significant on the other hand hed exhibited some obsessive interest in music and performers but then dance admitted so did she hence her trip to casa de villalobos with her tape recorder here in beautiful downtown fresno during the dog days of september after a furtive examination of the park revealed no cigarettesmoking surveillance dance took a shower she dried off and slipped into the mountain view bathrobe which the sign announced ironically she was free to take with her for dance curled up in the sumptuous bed who needed views of snowy peaks when the furniture was so opulent she now wished jon boling were here with her she was thinking of the recent overnight trip theyd taken to ventana the beautiful surreal resort in the cliffs near big sur south of carmel the trip had been a milestoneit was the first time shed told the children that she and boling were going away overnight she offered nothing more about the trip and the news was greeted with no interest whatsoever by either wes or maggie at their ages though the broader implications had probably been lost on them but their bored response was a huge victory for dance whod stressed about their reaction to the fact mom was traveling with another man wes worried her most maggie wanted her mother to get married again so she could be best woman the weekend away had been wonderful and dance had been pleased that the last holdout of widowhoodthe discomfort with intimacywas finally vanishing she wanted boling here now and was thinking it curious that they hadnt spoken for two days theyd traded messages but voicemail had reared its head at every instance she was involved in a murder investigation so she had an excuse she reflected but boling was a computer consultant she wasnt quite sure why he was so inaccessible dance called her parents chatted with her father for a few minutes then asked to speak to the children it was a pure comfort pure joy hearing their voices dance found she was smiling to herself as they rambled on enthusiastically about their days at camp she laughed when they signed off with a loveyoumom maggie and gottagoseeya wes verbal signals perfectly defining the differing parentchild relationships at the moment then her mother came on the phone edie reported that dances father was finishing up some work at her house in pacific grove to get it ready for the party she was hosting this weekend house guests would be staying for a few days after driving down from san jose on saturday and then there was a pause dance tried not to practice her profession in her personal life nothing ruins a date faster than a man saying hes divorced as he leans forward and looks her in the eyea complete deviation from his earlier baseline behavior one of her favorite kayleigh towne songs the truth about men was a hilarious look at how that gender tends to be well less than forthright but now she noted that something was up hows it going there edie dance offered some clumsy verbal padding good fresnos actually kind of interesting parts of it are theres a realestate development built around a runway you get a hangar for your plane instead of a garage well maybe you get a garage too i didnt look throughout kathryn dances life her mother had been kind and fair but also resolute opinionated unyielding and at times exasperating get to the point dance thought theres something i found out i wasnt sure what to do if it werent for the kids of course those words are like gasoline on the candle of motherhood and dance now said bluntly what tell me the tone was unmistakable dont screw around im your daughter but im an adult i want to know and i want to know now jon brought some computer games over for the kids and he got a phone call honey he was talking to a broker about property i heard him say hed gotten a job and wanted to take a look at a house this was interesting but why the concern in her mothers voice and its in san diego hes moving in a couple of weeks oh weeks dance now understood what edie meant about the children they were still vulnerable from the death of their father for them to lose the new man in their life would be very hurtful if not devastating and then theres me what the hell was he thinking of not telling me anything here i was just offered a job in dc and the first thing i think of is talking to him about it weeks so thats why he hadnt picked up the phone but used the cowards hideout of voicemail but the first rule of law enforcement was not to make assumptions are you sure you couldnt have misunderstood no no he was alone in the back by the pool he thought i couldnt hear and when wes stepped out he changed the subject completely he basically hung up on the broker dance could say nothing for a moment im sorry honey yeah thanks mom just need to think about this a little you get some sleep now the kids are happy we had a fun dinner they love camp she tried to be light and more important can you believe it theyre looking forward to school were going book bag shopping tomorrow thanks night im sorry katie night a moment later dance found she was still holding her phone disconnected in front of her face she lowered it the loss of her husband was like a digital event to kathryn dance as jon boling the computer genius would describe it on or off yes or no alive or dead but jon bolings leaving it was analog it was maybe it was partly was he now in her life or not the big problem though was that hed made this decision without her it didnt matter that the job had probably happened quickly and hed had to move fast dammit she was a part of his life he should have said something she recalled that edwin sharp had referred to a song of kayleighs at the restaurant yesterday mr tomorrow it was about an abusive straying man who swears hell get his act together and mend his ways he promises hell change of course the listener knows he never will as dance lay in bed now the lights out she stared at the ceiling and that song looped through her mind until she fell asleep you know me by now youve got to believe youre the numberone girl in the world for me ive sent her the papers and shes promised to sign itll just be a while these things take some time and his words are so smooth and his eyes look so sad cant she be patient it wont be so bad but sometimes she thinks falling under his sway she got mr tomorrow she wants mr today tuesday tuesday chapter dance was in the sheriffs office with p k madigan and dennis harutyun there was another law enforcement jurisdiction present too monterey county via skype michael oneils calm eyes looked back at them from miles away he was the person shed tapped to look into the salinas partner of frederick blanton the murdered file sharer she might have sent the request to tj scanlon in her own office but on a whim shed decided to contact oneil instead madigan was briefing the monterey deputy edwin never went home last night kayleigh said that about tenthirty she heard a car start somewhere in the park out in front of her house her bodyguard said he thought he heard it too the invisible snake kathryn and i want to interview him but hes not answering his phone we dont even know where he is this morning a deputy spotted his car on fortyone a pretty major road here he tried to follow but edwin mustve seen him and wove around in traffic and got away oneil said tough to follow with just one car and i havent got a lot of people to spare what with protecting witnesses and kayleigh madigan muttered we cover more than six thousand square miles grand total of about four hundred and sixty patrol deputies oneil winced monterey wasnt small but that county didnt embrace nearly as much territory with such little manpower he asked kathryn told me hed picked up kayleighs sister and niece at the airport any charges possible there kathryns going to interview them some more madigan said but doesnt look like it edwin was the boynextdoor didnt do a thing wrong the little girl loved him and the sister thought he wasget thisthe nicest of kayleighs boyfriends in recent years dance regarded the man on the screenstrong and solid but not heavy oneil was wearing his typical outfit light blue shirt no tie and a dark sport coat most detectives in the monterey county sheriffs office like here wore uniforms but oneil didnt he thought casual clothing got you further in investigations than khaki and pointed metal stars dance briefed them about the interview with sally docking edwins former girlfriend i have to tell you that his behavior with her doesnt fall into a stalkers profile she explained that it had actually been edwin who broke up with the woman still dont trust him madigan said no its just odd oneil continued i paid a visit to josh eberhardt the filesharing partner in salinas how polite a visit dance asked i talked amy into going with me amy grabe the fbis special agent in charge in san francisco they decided thered been enough federal copyright violations to justify a raid joint task force which meant it wasnt very polite feet apart spread em had probably been involved dance and oneil shared a smile it was hard to say given the optical mechanics of skype but it seemed to dance that he winked at her of course he hadnt then she admonished herself again concentrate good job sir madigan said and enjoyed a bite of what dance believed to be pistachio ice cream shed missed breakfast and was thinking of asking for a cup of her own the monterey detective continued they did find some file sharing going on out of his house but eberhardt was more of a researcher he keeps track of hundreds of above and underground fan sites for musicians looks like hed comb through them and get potential customers for illegal downloads it really wasnt all file sharingit was file stealing and selling too they charged a fee for the songs theyd ripped off albums of about a thousand artists theres this really dark underground of websites out there they have to do with cultural things mostly books movies tv shows music a lot of them are about stealing the artists workbootlegs for instance but most of them are about the celebrities themselves stephen king lindsey lohan george clooney carrie underwood justin bieber and kayleigh towne and its all off the radar the people posting use proxies and portals and anonymous accounts none of this shows up on google theyve worked around that oneil gave them the list of websites whose addresses were only numbers or letters ekcom was typical once inside them there were various pages that seemed nonsensicalthe seventh level for instance or lessons learned but navigating through the links he explained you got to the true substance of the sites the world of celebrities tj scanlon had found none of these oneil said it looks like thats where edwins getting a lot of his information in fact he posted plenty about the file sharer who got killedthe vic in fresno madigan asked anything thatd implicate edwin in the killing no he just urged people not to use file sharing of course he wouldnt slip up not clever mr edwin sharp oneil turned away for a moment and typed dance received an email containing several urls harutyun took her phone when she offered it to him and he set to work typing them into a computer nearby oneil asked the room youre monitoring all her calls thats right but were trying to buy some time make it harder for him to contact her with another verse harutyun said weve given her and her family new phones all unlisted hell probably find the numbers eventually but by then we hope well nail him on the evidence or witnesses id dig through those sites oneil advised you should be able to get some good information about him looks like he spends a lot of time online oneil took a brief call and turned back to the screen he said he had to leave an interrogation was on the schedule his eyes crinkled with a smile and though skype didnt allow for a clear image of where he cast his gaze dance believed it was to her you need anything else just let me know madigan thanked him and the screen went dark they turned to the second monitor on which miguel lopez had called up one of the underground sites oneil had found lookit that crystal stanning said the site which boasted more than fans was a stalkers paradise it had pages for several hundred celebrities in all areas of entertainment and politics kayleighs was one of the most popular it seemed within her pages was one headed kayleigh spotting and was a realtime hotline bulletin board about where she was at the moment she cant fool us contained pictures of kayleigh in various outfitsdisguises almostso fans could recognize her when she was trying to remain anonymous other pages contained extensive bios of the crew and band members fans stories about concerts theyd attended discussions of which venues were good and bad acoustically whod tried to scalp tickets other pages gave details of kayleighs personal life down to her preferences about food and clothing the page wwlk we who love kayleigh offered information about famous fanspeople who had commented in the press about their affection for her music as dance scrolled through she found congressman daviss name mentioned hed been quoted at a campaign rally about how much he appreciated kayleighs talent and her stance on immigration in her song leaving home dance followed a hyperlink to his own page and noted that he had reproduced the lyrics in fullwith kayleighs permission dance remembered hed thanked kayleigh for this earlier at her house in the know offered press information thousands of photographs announcements from kayleighs record company and barry zeigler her producer there was also a feed from her official site giving updatesfor instance about upcoming events like fridays concert and the luncheon today at a local country club for the fan of the month dance read the press release written by kayleighs stepmother sheri noting to her relief that edwin was not the winner other links led to even more troubling pages which offered bootleg albums recorded illegally at concerts and links to file sharing services one page gave gossip about disputes within celebrities families kayleighs included though aside from tepid public spats with bishop sheri and a few musicians like the man whod interrupted the award ceremony her gossip page was pretty sparse shes a good girl another page offered for sale items of kayleighs clothing including undergarments undoubtedly not really hers there were risqué pictures of her too though it was obvious theyd been manipulated with photoshop this explained edwins innocuous and infrequent online activity that tj scanlon had found earlier that was the public side of edwin sharp this was the stalkers real internet life though they couldnt tell for certain a number of the posts with initials es or ess in the username were probably his dance assessed that the grammar syntax and construction of many of these posts were reminiscent of the ones they knew he had done dance hoped they could find even a hint of a threat to kayleigh towne so they could invoke the stalking statute but no this trove of edwinrelated activity wasnt much more helpful than the other as with the more public sites most of the posts that were or might be his didnt appear threatening in the least if anything he staunchly defended kayleigh nor were they able to identify particular potential victims other fans were far more insulting than he was some viciously so edwin came across as nothing more than a loyal if strident fan dance reflected that it was likely edwin sharp was not the only obsessed fan kayleigh towne had indeed reading the posts suggested that he might be among the more innocuous there wasnt a single aspect of these celebrities lives that was private kathryn dance leaned away from the computer screen she actually felt unclean from the imperious invasive attitude of the postersas if the entertainers and celebrities that were the objects of their interest were simply fodder for amusement and selfgratification it was as if the more successful you were at pleasing the populace the more they felt entitled to suck your soul from your body crystal stanning took a phone call dance paid no attention to her until she noticed the deputys shoulders rise and her brow furrowa configuration often signaling bad or at least perplexing news you sure she asked by now the others in the room were watching her she disconnected grimacing that was my husband he took taylor thats our son to football practice the early one before school starts and it was weird i told him about the song the perps playing kayleighs song and he said somebody got into the pa system at the high school field and rigged the tape player so the third verse played over and over oh hell madigan muttered hes not using the phones thinking ahead of them once again and what were the clues in the lyrics dance looked over the sheet that harutyun had printed one night theres a call and at first you dont know what the troopers are saying from the side of the road then you see in an instant that your whole life has changed everything gone all the plans rearranged dance did a double take at the verse which spoke to her personallythinking about the death of her husband a troopers call was how shed learned of the accident then she forced the thought away where did the perp have in mind for attacking next somewhere by a roadside a glance at the map of the maderafresno area revealed what had to be a thousand miles of roads another thought occurred to her the assault on bobby prescott and on the file sharer followed closely on the calls to kayleigh they had perhaps an hour or so to identify and save the next victim chapter madigan said remember road could mean more than just a highway dance nodded road crew like bobby lets call them i told them to be careful but we ought to let them know hes played another song and alicia sessions at the cowboy saloon i could see edwin didnt like her any more than he did bobby she opened her notebook and displayed the numbers she had for everyone in the crew dance harutyun and stanning notified them all half of the crew were at the convention center the other half at the luncheon venue being held at a nice country club in the northern part of town kayleigh would be singing a few songs so theyd set up a small performing space tye slocum was en route to the venue but dance alerted him about the danger alicia it seemed had run out of gas on the way to kayleighs luncheon but was safe she was waiting in a coffee shop for a service truck dance bent toward the screen and was reading through one of kayleighs unofficial sites which gave details of the luncheon a lot of posters wished they could have gotten tickets but theyd sold out quickly madigan was speaking into his phone come on how hard is it the fucking car is a mile long and goddamn bright red he glanced at the others with a shrug meaning the snake remained invisible dance called kayleigh whod just arrived at the luncheon on the singers new mobile number and told her of the possible threat no not again are you sure afraid we are we havent said anything to the press about using the song verses as announcements so we have to assume its really a threat where are your sister and niece theyre at home with daddy and sheri darthurs with you yes and therere about a dozen people here now were expecting a hundred or so theres lots of security you need a ticket to get in dance continued to read the screen an idea occurred to her kayleigh this fan of the month who is it i think his names hold on sam gerber do you think hes in danger oh kathryn what are we going to do so hes not there no we dont get started for another fortyfive minutes or so i came early for a sound check should we call him do you have his number ill find it as she waited dance looked down and her eyes caught a series of posts on the fan site theyd been made just that morning who is this gerber is he worthy of our wonderful kayleigh he hasnt posted much about her hardly anything doesnt seem fair to some of us that hes going eskayleighfan just chill edwin theres room for more than one fan musiqueman yeah come on he won a contest whats the big deal im happy for him he gets to have lunch with kayleigh suzi he doesnt deserve it other people do thats my point eskayleighfan kayleigh came back on the line with gerbers number dance jotted it down thanks were doing everything we can ill call you back she called sam gerber and got voicemail it was a local area code and exchange so maybe not a mobile she left an urgent message he lives in madera madigan said ill get a car to his house if were lucky he may not have left yet the road dance mused lets assume edwins going to try something on the route from madera here she realized that despite sally dockings report and the ambiguous evidence otherwise she was making the assumption that edwin was the killer still she couldnt help herself and she continued to scroll through the fan site trying to put herself into the young mans troubled mind what she wanted most was for kayleigh to love her sheri towne knew she started from a disadvantage of course no she wasnt like wife number threethe child as sheri cattily thought of her or number two the tarot card reader yet sheri was a lot younger than bishop and in her own opinion didnt bring a lot to the table she was insecure and knew she was worlds away from margaret the strong woman who was kayleighs and suellyns mother sheri knew about her not because anyone in the towne family talked about margaret in front of her least of all bishop but because shed listened to and memorized all of kayleighs songs many of the early ones were about her mother despite the tension though sheri liked kayleigh a lot independent of being her stepmother and she liked suellyn and her husband roberto and marygordon too oh what a cute kid just the sort of child she wished shed had whom she would have had if life had gone just a bit differently sheri wanted badly to fit in she loved bishop loved the odd mix of his power and his neediness loved his talentbrilliant in the past and still glimmering now and maybe it would blossom again in the future he talked sometimes about returning to performing this was a secret that hed shared with no one but her still her connection with her new husband wouldnt be complete if she couldnt form a real relationship with kayleigh and not that superficial cordiality hey there sheri how ya doing you have a good day now take care hell to kayleigh im like the most anonymous fan she sees at a concert she finally turned off the long drive from their house on the route to the highway the car bounded along the road though paved wasnt much better than gravel and yet maybe just maybe things could change thered been crumbs of hope kayleighs sending sheri the occasional greeting card a present on her birthday and then a half hour ago shed gotten an email from kayleigh saying when she came to the luncheon could she bring a couple of dozen of her cds from bishops house as giveaways to fans kayleighd forgotten them thanks sheri youre a star the woman had been hurt that kayleigh hadnt even asked her to the event which she herself had helped put together but shed noted the word when she came to the luncheon so the girl hadnt snubbed her at all maybe shed assumed alicia had asked her or maybe kayleigh had just assumed all along sheri would be attending or was the invitation a backhanded apology reflecting the girls cooling anger the two had had an embarrassing fight at the show in bakersfield not long ago it had been minor stupid really but some asshole had recorded a minute or two of their harsh words and the video had gone viral sheri had been mortifiedeven if in her opinion kayleigh had started the fight all might be forgiven though maybe sheri wasnt doomed to be the evil stepmother forever the condition of the road improved and she pressed the accelerator of the mercedes down further speeding along the deserted highway groves of trees on either side maybe she should get kayleigh a present thanking her she the flat happened so fast she couldnt respond before the car was careening along the shoulder sheri gave a faint scream and struggled to control the heavy vehicle swerving perilously close to the trees streaking by at seventy miles an hour but sheri marshal towne had grown up in the midwest and started driving at fourteen snow and powerful engines conspired to teach her how to handle skids she now steered into the swerve easing off the gas but never touching the brake slower slower the car fishtailed went straight fishtailed some more spewing gravel and leaves and twigs from the tires but she managed to keep it from flying over the thirtyfoot cliff to the right or slamming into the row of pines close by the opposite side fifty miles an hour forty in the end though the ground was too slipperygravel and pebbles on hardpackand she couldnt quite prevent the crash as the big merc slid off the road toward the trees wedging itself into a ditch and shuddered to a stop her hands sweaty her heart thudding sheri rested her head against the steering wheel lord lord lord she whispered thankful shed been to church that sunday god had looked out for her she was thinking about him when there was a loud crack and the windshield spiderwebbed fragments of glass hit her in the head she blinked more startled than hurt and touched the small wound how would a rock then again a crack and flying glassand this time she heard a loud bang outside oh god no somebody was shooting at her these were bullets she saw motion from the shadows between a tall stand of trees another flash and the car resounded with a ringing thud hed missed the windshield this time hunters or was it that crazy man obsessed with kayleigh sheri popped the seat belt and slithered down to the floor as best she could searching for her phone where where where one more shot this wasnt aimed for the windows either but like the other for the rear of the car a resonating bang as it hit why would somebody shoot there sheri wondered manically and then realized shit he was aiming for the gas tank the stalker edwin sharpit had to be him why was he doing this she hadnt done anything she tried to roll down the side window of the passenger seat but the power was off and the doors were wedged closed by the ditch then the sweet rich smell of gasoline grew thicker reminding her of spending hot hours at the wannabe nascar track where her first husband raced every saturday and as she sobbed kicking futilely at the windshield another thought occurred to her the email about the luncheon hadnt been from kayleigh after all it was edwin sharp whod created an email address with kayleighs name in it and sent the message to sheri through the girls website to lure her here kayleigh hadnt wanted her at the luncheon after all chapter kathryn dance had left the sheriffs office fifteen minutes earlier after word that your shadow had been played at the football stadium during practice the task force had split into three groups one was trying to intercept sam gerber others were at the luncheon at the country club in northern fresno thinking that edwin might try to find gerber or maybe another victim there and yet others were trying to find edwin and his car coordinating with highway patrol harutyun had also alerted medical teams that there might be an assault in progress a burns center had been put on notice too fire seemed to be one of the perps preferred weaponsinspired perhaps by kayleigh herself love is fire love is flame it warms your heart it lights the way it burns forever just like the sun it welds two souls and makes them one love is fire love is flame kathryn dance was en route to the luncheon too she didnt know the roads in the area so it would have made little sense for her to participate in the manhunt she thought it was best simply to be the point person at the country club and to reassure kayleigh with her presence but as she piloted the suv quickly through traffic a thought occurred this happened sometimes a little tapping a hiccup in her mind something she just couldnt explain a jump from thought a to thought b to thought z michael oneil had recently described it as her brain doing one of its little dances no no this isnt right edwin would be aware of the logistical difficulties of targeting a victim at the luncheon but the event would provide a good distraction and draw off the police and was sam gerber really a likely target no edwin wouldnt go after somebody hed commented on in a posting it was too obvious besides why kill gerber one of fifty thousand harmless fans he didnt fit the profile of a stalkers victim the crew was safe alicia was among people so who else might the target be dance asked herself again the basic question if edwin was the stalker what was his goal killing someone who threatened to keep them apart whom edwin was jealous of who was perceived as kayleighs enemy or whose death would bind them together forever dance had recalled the gossip pages in the underground websites oneil had found involving sensational stories reported by fans a hot topicsince there werent many of themwas the tension between kayleigh and her stepmother there was even an embarrassing mobile phone video about a recent argument in bakersfield this wasnt a fullblown feud kayleigh seemed incapable of either the pettiness or the mean spirit that would involve and from what dance read sheri towne seemed like a decent woman solid loyal to her new husband and even helpful in kayleighs career but sheri was the most recent in a long line of stepmothers and she and kayleigh never seemed to get along the young woman hadnt even invited sheri to the luncheon she herself had helped with thought z dance now called bishop towne and identified herself sure officer dance the man grumbled whats going on with that asshole heard hes played another song wheres your wife gone off to that luncheon thing kayleigh invited her after all an alarm pinged within dance though shed half expected that answer when did she leave bout twenty minutes ago did kayleigh call her no she emailed wanted her to bring some cds to the lunch giveaways also said itd be better if her sister and marygordon didnt come cause that asshole sharp so shes alone right bishop i think sheri might be in danger edwin mightve sent that email no maybe which way would she go oh no no which way from the house have to be los banos road to fortyone youve got to do something please dont let anything happen to her it was unnerving to hear the gruff man sounding so desperate so vulnerable give me her number dance memorized it then told him ill call you when i know something whats she driving i think shes in yeah its the mercedes silver dance first tried sheri but the woman didnt answer she then called kayleigh and learned after a brief awkward pause that no kayleigh hadnt really wanted sheri at the luncheon and hadnt emailed her dance hit disconnect with her thumb and the brake with her foot skidding to a stop on the shoulder she punched los banos road into her gps and raced back onto the highway los banos was a narrow winding line leading into the foothills toward yosemite it would be the only place where edwin could attack sheri if shed gotten to fortyone a wide multilane road then she would probably be okay but dance knew edwin wouldnt let her get that far he would have planned out the perfect site for the attack she tried sheris number again no answer in two minutes she was speeding through the forests on los banos it was then she saw the smoke maybe a half mile ahead she gripped the phone and started to dial madigan jamming the accelerator down even harder as she took a curve nissan makes a great suv but it doesnt corner like a sports car and she nearly went off the shoulder and into a ravine forty feet below youre a bad driver to start with she told herself dont be stupid she brought the skid under control and slowed a bit she called madigan and left a message telling him where she was and to get cars there immediately fire trucks too soon she was speeding along a straightaway toward the smoke which had gone from gray to black burning tires she wondered oil a car wreck dance skidded around this turn too and saw the horrific scene before herthe silver mercedes had gone off the road and was in a ditch near the asphalt the back end of the car was burning though the front not yet the angle of the accidentwith the cars hood in the airmeant the gasoline from the ruptured tank was flowing backward still the flames were spreading toward the passenger compartment there seemed to be movement from inside the car dance couldnt see clearly but knew it would be sheri whose feet were kicking desperately against the windshield no dance thought youll never break through a windshield the side windows dance brought the pathfinder to a skidding stop on the shoulder and leapt out opening the back door and reaching behind the seat to snag the small fire extinguisher she pulled it out and turned toward the merc but dropped the heavy canister she bent to pick it up which is what saved her from a bullet no as it turned out two or three of them jesus she gasped dropping to the ground earning a scraped elbow the bullets slammed loud into the sheet steel of the pathfinder a foot or so from her head and shoulders where was the shooter she couldnt tell he was somewhere in the pine forest in shadows of course reaching for her phone which sat on the passenger seat to call she rose the shooter fired again and a slug snapped over her head then another dance flattened herself on the ground as another bullet loudly punctured the side of the drivers seat a cry echoed from the mercedes move move move crawling fast cradling the extinguisher dance made it to a fallen tree about forty feet from the mercedes she risked a look the flames were rising faster now and from the gap in the dense pine forest she saw a ragged flash of gunshot a bullet snapped over her head before she could duck the attacker would have gotten a look at her and if it was edwin he would recognize her as a cbi agent which meant he might assume she was armed if it wasnt edwin or if he decided she didnt have a weapon the assailant could casually stroll a hundred feet in her direction and shoot her dance then heard another wailing scream from the mercedes a flash bloomed from the woods and six inches from her face a bullet blew a handful of dry rotting wood into the air chapter i should check in with my people p k madigan said angrily nodding toward his office weve got an operation going here possible homicide its urgent the bewildered chief was feeling panicwhich was not a sensation he was used to two california department of justice officers stood in front of him in the lobby of the detective division back a bit out of deference maybe one was redheaded and one had black hair they otherwise looked similar trim in suits polite very polite madigan was so shaken hed forgotten their names the redhead said yessir im afraid callsll have to wait same procedure you have in an arrest im sure fmcso sheriff anita gonzalez stood nearby her face too a mask of dismay more than anger this is nonsense gentlemen utter nonsense ive got a call in to the sacramento office which had not madigan noted returned that call the two officers obviously didnt consider their present assignment as nonsense utter or otherwise their two suspects didnt either detectives madigan and miguel lopez who were being arrested for breaking and entering false imprisonment misuse of legal authority criminal trespass madigan said look this is part of a plan by a perp were investigating hes trying to get some of us out of commission he explained to them what kathryn dance had said about how stalkers target people who are protecting the object theyre obsessed with the state officers werent much interested in that either the reason for the arrest was madigan knew before theyd even mentioned the charges his decision to keep edwin sharp in the interrogation room longer than he should have and to have miguel lopez go to edwins house and gather evidence the darkhaired agent was saying heres how itll work detective well take you in and im sure the magistratell expedite arraignment probably recognizance cant imagine hell go for bail youll be out in a few hours i dont care when ill be out the problem is ill be suspended until its resolved thats procedure like gabriel fuentes the detective so careless with his gun gonzalez said to the officers we cant afford to have the chief down nownot with the perp on the streets the redhead said we know how you feel about this singer of yours but he didnt add thats not enough to bend the law over madigan wanted to hit him the panic swelled hell this could be the end of his careerthe only career hed ever cared about what would he tell his family and hed bent the rules just a bit done it for kayleigh this singer of yours goddamn edwin sharp the officers were debating but it was only the cuff issue oh please madigan said sounding as desperate as he felt you cant look gentlemen sheriff gonzalez said this is a critical operation we think a murder could be occurring at any moment madigan looked back into his office again the redhead offered to gonzalez you understand a warrant has been issued for his arrest im sorry we dont have any choice they took his colt and id and badge madigan repeated at least let me check in with some of my people he was growing more agitated they debated a moment but settled for youll be out in an hour two tops and they also decided yes on the cuffs chapter dance huddled behind the fallen pine tree thered been no more shots was the assailant still there waiting for her to show it would make more sense for him to leave hed have to assume that dance had called in reinforcements and would have fled he couldnt risk staying any longer or could he clutching the fire extinguisher she debated if i dont do something now sherill die shell burn to death dance looked up cautiously then ducked down again no gunshots she thought of her children how she couldnt stand the idea of their being orphans thought too that shed specifically gone into kinesic analysis and investigations to avoid tactical situations that might put her life in danger and here im not even on duty she thought another cry from the car but muted sheri towne was losing the battle now it has to be now she leapt to her feet and began to sprint to the mercedes just as the flames were reaching into the passenger compartment waiting for the bullets none came her way but still she dove into the ditch out of the line of fire of the shooter in the woods and crawled fast to the car inside sheri was pounding on the windshield with bloody hands she was retching and coughing as the smoke roiled into the interior dances skin prickled in the heat from a grass fire surrounding the car the woman inside turned desperate eyes to her and mouthed something dance gestured for her to move back and she slammed the extinguisher base into the passengerside window it shattered easily dance tossed the extinguisher awayit wasnt going to do any good on a fire like thisand reached inside to yank the woman out sheri was convulsing in spasms and coughing hard spittle flying from her mouth tears streamed down her sooty face the agent dragged her thirty feet from the car crouching in case the attacker was still there with his gun they sprawled on the ground in a depression by the roadside the woman dropped to her knees and vomited hard and tried to stand no stay down dance said starting for her suv and her phone to see if madigan had gotten her message and if not to call which was when she heard a loud bang behind her and felt something slam into her lower back she pitched forward onto the hard sunbaked earth chapter dennis harutyun was standing over the gurney kathryn dance lay on face down the medic was on the opposite side from the deputy laboring away on her back no leads yet the detective said with her perpendicular view of the scene dance could see the everefficient csu team scouring the grounds where the attacker had nearly killed sheri towne and dance herself but there wasnt much left the fire had spread and taken out some of the trees and brush where hed been standing that hurt the med tech asked a bit hm he continued working on her without otherwise acknowledging her answer after a few minutes you almost through there dance asked irritated that the doctor was taking so long and that he hadnt responded to her comment about the pain she should have said yeah hurts like hell butcher i think thatll do it she pulled her shirt down just a scratch wasnt deep at all dance was sure shed been shot in the backher immediate thought was of her friend the crime scene expert lincoln rhyme who was a quadriplegic paralyzed from the neck down how can i be a good mother if i cant walk shed thought tumbling over sheri towne from the impact in fact what had happened was that the fire extinguisher shed tossed aside had landed in the burning grass and exploded sending either a rock or a piece of its own casing flying into her back shed lain stunned for a moment then had turned to see on the ground a big disk of white foam or powder from the detonated extinguisher and shed understood then crawled on to the suv and retrieved her phone andgiving up on madigancalled a quarter hour later the police and fire and medical teams arrived the medic took his bad bedside manner and wandered off to tend to his other patientsheri towne who was sitting next to her husband she was breathing oxygen and staring at her bandaged hand her long nails were coincidentally the color of fresh blood its a real mess harutyun said he explained that edwin had complained to the state doj about his detention and the illegal search madigan and miguel lopez had just been arrested though released right away no bail required but they were no longer activeduty law enforcers oh no dance said in a harsh whisper hes out of commission sure is harutyun added bitterly the perp took out gabriel fuentes stealing his gun now its the chief and miguel the whole team nows crystal me and you any sightings of edwin dance asked no sign of him or that bullseyered car of his the luncheon went on as scheduled kayleigh didnt look too good to hear the stories she sang a few songs had lunch with the fan and then left people were saying she wasnt really there not mentally dance nodded toward the smoldering mercedes pretty dangerous to be on kayleighs bad side still have trouble seeing that for a motive for murder its a stalkers reality not our reality she reminded harutyun looked toward sheri and bishop she nearly burned to death but what she took hardest was that kayleigh didnt really ask her to the lunch whats the story on the email he used to invite sheri to the party dance asked set up an anonymous account this morning something like ktowne and some numbers sent from an internet café in the tower district one of the deputies checked but nobody recognized edwins picture course the baristas said theyd had about two hundred people in over the course of the morning and sent it to sheris address that was what on bishops website kayleighs own sure there was silence for a time hey charlie harutyun nodded to a round pinkish man approaching in a jumpsuit you know kathryn dance cbi thiss charlie shean head of our crime scene unit he nodded to her then frowning that true about pk hes suspended and miguel too afraid so and this stalker fellows the one orchestrated it we dont know bullshit and a half shean muttered and dance got the impression that he wasnt a man who cursed much whatd your folks find charlie business cards phone bills with edwins name on it dennis harutyun of the thick mustache and unflappable face seemed to be loosening up a bit hes good whoever heor sheis no footprints tire treads or trace other than the five million bits of trace youre going to find in a forest though we did get a little cigarette ash thats recent just past the perimeter of the burn analysisll take time dance explained about seeing the person smoking outside her motel room window i didnt catch anything specific though she added edwin did smoke still may but i dont know for sure the crime scene chief said the gun was a ninelike gabriels glockbut we dont have any casings or slugs from his so we dont know if theres a match no immediate prints on the casings we found and i didnt get any description here either dance muttered he was in the shade of the trees stalkers were not only good at disguises they were good at camouflage too anything that helped them observe their target undisturbed and unobtrusively for as long as possible did sheri see anything havent been able to interview her smoke inhalation was pretty bad it was then that a vehicle sped up to the scene dance instinctively reached for her absent glock once again but then saw it was kayleigh townes dark green suv driven expertly by darthur morgan they hadnt stopped completely before the singer was out of the suburban and running toward bishop and sheri she bypassed her father completely and bent down and threw her arms around her stepmother morgan didnt seem happy his charge had come to the site of a shootout but dance supposed that aside from relations with her father kayleigh could be pretty singleminded dance was too far away to hear the conversation but there was no doubt about the messages in the body language apology regret and humor a heartfelt reconciliation was under way bishop towne stood and embraced them both family is about love and affection but about friction and separation too yet with work and luck the distancesgeographic and emotionalcan be shrunk even made to vanish what struck dance at the moment was not what she was witnessing in this reunion but a very different thought about her and jon boling and the children and what her mother had learned about bolings move to san diego once again kayleighs lyrics echoed from the very verse that had inspired the attempt on sheri townes life one night theres a call and at first you dont know what the troopers are saying from the side of the road then you see in an instant that your whole life has changed everything gone all the plans rearranged is that what would happen to her was everything changed the life shed tacitly hoped for for herself and her children with boling and where she thought with some bitterness is my shadow someone looking out for me someone to give me the answers chapter a pleasant if hot september evening in fresno it was a quiet time in the tower districtfeaturing the famous art deco theater at olive and wishon which boasted an actual if modest tower though the neighborhood had probably been named for another tower some distance away tonight locals were returning from early suppers at mexican taquerias or boutiquey cafés or were visiting art galleries tattoo parlors discount stores ethnic bakeries maybe headed for the movies or an improv comedy club or community theater it wasnt san francisco but you werent in fresno for art music or literature you were here to raise a family and work and you took what culture was offered tonight teenage boys had come to the district to cruise the streets in their pimpedout subarus and saturns enjoying the last few evenings free from homework tonight girls had come here to gossip and sneak cigarettes and to look toward but not at boys and sit over sodas for hours and talk about clothes and looming classes and tonight kayleigh towne had come to the district to kill a man shed formulated this plan because of one person marygordon sanchez the little girl edwin sharp hadwhatever the police saidkidnapped oh god she was furious kayleigh had always looked forward to being a mother but those plans had been delayed by her own father who felt that a career wasnt compatible with a home life hell kt youre a child yourself wait a few years whats the hurry kayleigh had gone along but the maternal urge within her only grew and to think that marygordon had been in dangerand might be in the futurewell no that wasnt acceptable edwin sharp was going down the sheriffs office wasnt going to do it so kayleigh would all by herself id prefer together id hoped for two not one you and me forever with a daughter and a son it was tough that didnt work out but now its plain to see when it comes to things that matter all i really need is me with these lyrics which shed written years ago rolling through her mind kayleigh towne climbed out of the suburban which darthur morgan had parked on olive avenue they were in front of a victorianstyle auditorium it was parker hall a small theater and lecture venue from the nineteenth century she noted the brass plaque that read kayleigh our home towne girl gave her first concert here shed been thirteen the first concert part was not exactly trueshed done churches and sporting events since she was nine or ten but this was yes the first performance in a concert hall though shed shared the stage with a few other kids from the childrens choir of george washington middle school about a half hour she told morgan ill be here he said and began immediately to study the street for signs of edwin sharp or any other threat kayleigh found the key to the hall and slipped inside the musty place that afternoon shed contacted the foundation that owned it and explained that she was thinking about giving a concert there could she borrow the key to check the place out theyd been delighted and shed had politely to decline the several invitations by the staff to give her a tour of the venue her time was so limited shed said that she wasnt sure when she could get there inside the murky hall resonated with its own brand of creaks and snaps but this time unlike at the convention center she wasnt made the least uneasy by the atmosphere she knew where the danger was and it wasnt in the shadows that surrounded her kayleigh headed straight for the loading dock in the back opened the door and stepped outside looking over the street which ran parallel to olive a few minutes later she saw the red buick driven by the man who had killed bobby and tried to kill sheri and who had kidnapped marygordon and suellyn he cruised past the theater to the stoplight one of the sheriffs deputies was following hell she hadnt counted on that she couldnt have the police near when edwin died what was she going to do give up she was furious at the thought the buick waited for a light signaling left a block away the deputy trying to be clever slowed and turned left apparently hoping to pick up the buick after edwin turned she nearly laughed to see edwin floor the accelerator and speed right into a largely residential neighborhood hed eluded the deputy completely it was tough that didnt work out but now its plain to see when it comes to things that matter all i really need is me stepping back inside she opened her purse and slipped on leather gloves then unfixed the twist ties securing the eightinch filleting knife to the cardboard backing she wrapped the blade in a tissue and slipped it into the inner pocket of her denim jacket and then she doubleno triplechecked the other thing shed brought with her you still got that present i got you a coupla years ago i have all your presents daddy kayleigh was now thinking of the song edwin sharp had played on the jukebox at the cowboy saloon yesterday me im not a cowgirl i havent got a cowgirl hat to shield me from the sun my boots they have high heels i dont own a single gun for kayleigh towne that last sentence was not exactly true the present her father had given her was a colt revolver hed bought it for her for protection when she was in her teens suellyn was away at college their mother dead and he was spending insane amounts of time on the road trying futilely to salvage his career shed fired it a few times but hadnt liked the recoil or the noise even with the earmuffs and shed thought what a joke the idea of taking a human life was impossible for her to imagine and yet two years ago she recalled spotting a coyote twitchy and probably rabid in her garden behind the house hissing and baring yellow teeth kayleigh had matteroffactly blown the ragged thing away with a single shot to the head thats all edwin sharp was to her now not human a mad coyote she tore up and flushed the packaging materials for the knife and the receipt down the toilet in the staff bathroom determined yes but nervous as hell and where is the fucker did he leave no he wouldnt of course because kayleigh the center of his universe had called him a half hour agofrom a pay phone at the hospital where sheri had been examined and released shed asked to meet him here the stuffed redwood tree that edwin and marygordon had bought for her at the museum had sported a label on which edwin had written a phone number and the words call me shed nearly thrown it out yesterday but had decided not tobecause this plan had begun brewing in her mind the moment she saw his number standing at the grimy window in the service door to the dock she now wiped her hands on her jeans then finally edwin sharp appeared walking in that eerie gait of his not a care in the world as if the murders and kidnappings were nothing to him he made a beeline for the auditorium carrying his camera with him he paused and began to take some pictures if he snapped one of her shed have to steal his camera and get rid of it remember that kayleigh took a deep breath through the thick denim of her jacket she felt the knife in her inner pocket against her belly the gun not you not him not her not them in the end were all alone whatevers needing to get done i can do it on my own thats all i need just me chapter from the window she could see the flash from his camera as he took pictures of his shrine coming to fresno she realized would be a pilgrimage to edwin sharp more sweat spreading on hands and forehead heart pounding in vivace tempo steady girl you can do this think of everybody at risk think of marygordon think of sheri hes a rabid coyote thats all he is she paused no dont do it get the hell out of here before you fuck up your life forever but kayleigh towne decided i can do this i can do this for my sister for marygordon for anyone else whod be at risk for me your shadow she stepped out onto the loading dock and looked toward edwin he turned that skewed smile contorting his face she gave a cautious nod and looked down at the asphalt crumbling and cracked and sprouting dry weeds another brief nod as if shy as if uncertain as if innocent well lookit this he glanced behind her and around no darthur morgan youre alone yeah only me wheres darthur up the street i gave him the slip he said good he looked up at the theater you know i wish that concert of yoursd been recorded thirteen years old and you had the whole house in your hand nobody cared about the other students it was just you only you kayleigh the show had been written up in one of the tiny local papers he mustve read about it there edwin followed her inside were thinking of filming a concert here a video cool excellent when we dont know yet like recreating your first concert thatd be so neat youll have to do walking after midnight like you opened with back then jesus he knew that too edwin studied her again wow youre looking spectacular today your hair its so beautiful after your voice your hairs probably my favorite part about you kayleigh struggled to remain placid as she recalled his request to send him a lock of her hair from her pillow would have been best oh lord i dont have much time she said i know theyre always watching you they he put his hands on his hips and smiled his jeans were tight she thought about the incident outside her house tapping out the music or doing something else he peered down at her adoringly from under those overhanging brows kayleigh towne wondered if she was going to be sick oh my god he whispered hearing your voice on the phone it just made my whole day my whole year i was sitting at earl and marges having dinner and feeling kind of bad then to hear you after all these months finally hearing you thats a good diner the pies looked nice i like cherry pie if theres milk with it but i cut all that out he patted his belly staying trim you know mr today thats such a great song i hope it becomes an anthem for women dont settle for abuse dont settle for less than you deserve you know what i mean of course she did shed written the song it was odd though how many fans didnt get the meaning as obvious as it was look at that an old percolator he nodded toward an ancient coffeemaker thats what my motherd use her eyes stayed on the canister as she said listen edwin what i wanted to talk to you about i was pretty upset you picked up my sister and niece shed decided she couldnt make it sound like he was her new best friend hed be suspicious if she was too nice she looked at him now sternly oh that sorry i didnt know what else to do i was worried worried about ritchie whos that ritchie hampton the guy your father was going to send to pick up suellyn and marygordon you dont know about his record record what was he talking about well no okay what happened was i was in a café your father and sheri happened to be there happened kayleigh asked suspiciously the smile seemed to deepen slightly okay ill admit i followed them there i thought they were going to meet you for breakfast its been hard to park out in front of your house i keep getting hassled by the deputies well yeah he was actually complaining as if he honestly didnt get it that somebody might object to his spying still her role required her to say nothing but just nod sympathetically edwin examined the coffee percolator lifted the lid with a glass dome in the center and replaced it i heard bishop call ritchie and ask him to pick up suellyn and marygordon i know your father doesnt drive anymore but sheri couldve driven him to pick them up why couldnt her grandfather come to pick up that little girl kayleighs very thought at the time bishop though had been too busy with congressman davis but anyway he asked ritchie you know ritchies had three speeding tickets and one reckless in the last year licenses been suspended a couple of times and even your father doesnt know he was pulled over at a dui roadblock he was let go but hed been drinking kayleigh stared how on earth does he know these things your father was going to have your sister and that precious little niece of yours in the hands of a man who drives that badly im sorry i couldnt let that go by and if id come to you or to him and said anything youdve called the cops right and ignored me i wasnt going to let anything happen to the people most important to you in the world i even used my middle name in case the lawyers or your father had told them to look out for somebody named edwin lawyers or father but not me he was truly delusional you know you really come on too strong dont you see that i guess i get a little carried away was his smile genuine or a leer she couldnt tell despite the dry heat kayleigh towne shivered he added youll feel more comfortable when you get to know me another look at her hair i like you alone what i mean instead of at the cowboy saloon all those other people around wasnt natural you know no she didnt know well kayleigh said uncertainly he grew somber im really sorry about bobby i know you guys were close you went out right what an actor he was sorry you killed him and then she reflected wait how does he know bobby and i were close yeah thanks he was a good friend friend yeah its pretty tough oh its gotta be his face screwed up like a funeral directors i feel so bad for you and all his other friends and family kayleigh reminded trying to keep an edge from her voice sure do the police have any leads you prick pull out the gun and blow the motherfucker away put the knife in his hand later but no be smart i dont think so you want to get that iced tea he asked your fave she said i really cant i better get back i love you kayleigh he said this casually as if he were saying the earth is round or the dollar is us currency well its okay i know the situation im amazed they let you out on the town by yourself they you know who i mean everybody from the song everyone wants a piece of your soul he was exhaling hard shaking his head i worry about you so much insane pathetic and completely insane now if you wait any longer you wont be able to do it hey let me give you something you have something for me he asked surprised she stepped forward smiling convinced that as she got close shed be overwhelmed by a repulsive smell but all she could detect was faint deodorant or aftershave was it what her father used okay thats weird kayleigh reached into her jacket and gripping the knife blade wrapped in tissue she slipped the handle into his palm quickly he instinctively closed his fingers around it she backed up fast whats this a pen he asked maybe thinking it was something for him to write her letters with then he realized what it was edwins smile faded and he looked up to see the girl of his dreams holding a large revolver pointed at his chest she pulled the hammer back it seated with a loud click chapter the knife drooped in his hand his eyelids and shoulders sagged too kayleigh no dont move oh kayleigh smiling again but sorrowfully do you know what kind of trouble youll get into you do this she stayed strong thisd be terrible so terrible dont do this to yourself please think of your fans think of your family as if he was genuinely worried for her not himself its the first thing the policell look for setting me up they wont want to believe you did it theyll hope it isnt true but the deputies have been there before it happens all the time domestic stalking it happens all the time you killed bobby thick brows knit further making him even more ominous i didnt do that of course not and i heard about the attack on sheri im sure they told you i was behind that too but id never hurt anybody close to you its all lies shoot him she told herself and yet her finger remained outside the trigger guard the gun wavered for a minute then she thrust it forward edwin sharp didnt even squint and you kidnapped my sister and niece maybe i saved their lives from ritchies driving like i told you she looked around but held the gun steady youre a smart woman kayleigh and she had flashback of a recent conversation shed had with her father whod called her a smart girl you called me from a pay phone but can anybody place you where you made that call itll be in my cell phone records thatll be easy to find and im sure you used gloves or a paper towel when you were handling this a glance at the knife and you probably bought it at a store with a selfcheckout but theyll link it to you kayleigh thats what they do for a living shut up im going to kill you he examined the knife its new so theyre going to check every store in town that sells this brand there wont be that many of them youd pay cash but all they have to do is look at the datamined records of anyone who bought this model knife in the past few days with cash theyll figure out the exact store and register fast because you probably only bought this one thing right thats a giveaway theyll get a warrant to collect the cash paid into the checkout machine theyll fingerprint the bills and theyll trace serial numbers of the bills you got from an atm thats all recorded you know of course it isnt is it dont listen to him scream for help then pull the trigger there could even be a video or still picture of the selfserve transaction itll take them all of five minutes to link you to this knife and meanwhile therell be rookies searching the trash around the area here to look for bags and packaging and the receipt he glanced toward the toilet which trickled as it continued to fill or the sewer pipes here theyll get you in an interrogation room and kayleigh youre such a good honest person you wont hold up theyll have a confession in ten minutes madigan wont want to but he wont have any choice he glanced at her hand can you even carry a concealed gun legally ill do it on my own except i cant im a fucking coward the gun lowered oh kayleigh theyve brainwashed you so badly im not the enemy theyre the enemy here im going to set the knife down he wiped it on his shirtsleeves removing his own prints and then he rested it on the floor that way therell be no connection between us you take it and use it or throw it out this never happened he sounded so sincere kayleigh wished kathryn dance was here to look at the stalker and nod that he was telling the truth or shake her head that he was lying he stepped back and she eased forward picked the knife up and slipped it back into her jacket think about this kayleigh sure youre being stalked but not by me maybe its the reporters and photographers maybe its your father he claims he wants whats best but does he im not so sure and what about the others maybe i dont knowalicia tye slocumoh keep an eye on him ive seen how he looks at you and barry zeigler hes holding on to you pretty tight who else does the label have as big as you neil watsonbut come on hes like a bad tribute act to himself and who else is out there watching you stalking you fans and strangers people who dont even know your music but only that youre beautiful and famous and rich and they figure why should you have all those things and not them they dont get how hard you work for them how much you sacrifice she whispered cant you just leave me alone please oh kayleigh you dont want me to leave you alone you just dont know it yet chapter leaving home her hit song about the middleaged immigrant woman being deported back to mexico the lines kept running through kayleighs mind as she packed several suitcases and lugged them downstairs to the living room of her house where darthur morgan took them from her and placed them in the suv alicia sessions was there too helping her with the temporary move in her ford f kayleigh hadnt wanted her to go to the trouble but the woman insisted on schlepping guitars amps and boxes of provisions from whole foodsthe store where organicminded kayleigh shopped as opposed to safeway the source of the staples in the household where she was bound i can really manage no problem at all alicia said well stay for dinner at least im seeing some friends in town as efficient as she was as important to the operation alicia remained largely a mystery to kayleigh the band and crew she was a loner whod lived on the periphery of the professional music scene for years performing alternative and postpunk in new york and san francisco without much success shed get her job done for kayleigh and the business and then disappear in the evenings and on weekends for horseback riding and listening to music who the friends she was meeting tonight might be kayleigh had no idea she assumed alicia was gay while the singer didnt care one way or the other aside from hoping she was in a loving relationship in the country world the taboos were falling but slowly the genre was still the sound track of middle conservative america and kayleigh guessed alicia wasnt comfortable bringing up her preferences after the suv and alicias pickup were loaded kayleigh turned and looked over the house as if for the last time leaving home she climbed into the drivers seat of the suv morgan in the passenger for a change and gunned the engine then headed down the long drive alicias truck following expecting to see him him in the lot of the park she rolled fast through the turn onto the road skidding morgan grabbed the handhold and gave a rare smile kayleigh glanced around and into the rearview mirror but there were no red cars its for the best he said i suppose she realized that he was looking at her face closely something happen at the theater what do you mean kayleigh kept her eyes pointed fiercely straight ahead avoiding his as if hed think oh i know she lured edwin into that hall to kill him i recognize that look just checking to see if everythings all right he said placidly you get an odd phone call or run into somebody there no everythings fine kayleigh reached for the radio but her hand paused then returned to the wheel they drove all the way to bishop townes house in complete silence she parked in the drive and morgan helped alicia carry the boxes musical equipment and suitcases to the porch then the guard strode into the night to check out the perimeter the two women went inside the small ground floor might have been an exhibit in a wing of the grand ole opry there were pictures and reviews and album coversmostly of bishop towne and his band of course some were photos of women singers whom bishop had had affairs with long agoand whose albums had been nailed up only after wives two through four appeared unlike margaret they wouldnt have known about the earlier indiscretions and would have assumed the women were professional associates only but there were also a lot of pictures of bishop and margaret hed never taken those down whatever the later wives jealous concerns might have been marygordon came running up to kayleigh and flew into her arms aunt kayleigh yay youve gotta come look were doing a puzzle i rode freddie today i wore my helmet like you always say kayleigh slipped to her knees for a proper hug then rose and embraced her sister suellyn asked how you doing k the singer thought considering i could be in jail for murder not bad hanging in there kayleigh introduced her and marygordon to alicia who smiled and shook their hands wow the girl whispered looking at alicias tattoos those are neat uhoh suellyn said i see trouble the women laughed kayleigh greeted her father and sheri whose voice was still ragged from the smoke oddly she now sounded much like her husband her skin seemed pale though that might have been only because she was wearing none of the makeup she usually applied in swaths kayleighs attitude toward her stepmother had changed degrees since the attack and she regretted her pettiness toward the woman she now hugged sheri in whose eyes tears appeared at the display of affection alicia gave bishop and sheri some details of the ad plans for the upcoming canadian tour and then she glanced at her watch and headed off better youre here bishop said to kayleigh i told you you shouldve come right at the beginning i told you sheris got the room made up for that guard too where is he kayleigh explained that morgan had remained outside to check the property hed be in in a moment i did a picture for your room aunt kayleigh ill show you marygordon gripped the handle of one of the wheelie suitcases and sped off down the hallway kayleigh and her sister smiled in here here it is aunt kayleigh shed seen this guest room before and it had been functional stark now the bed had new blue gingham linens frilly pillow cases matching towels candles some cheap decorations from michaels craft store like geese in bonnets and framed pictures of young kayleigh and her familyphotos that had been in shoe boxes when last seen before sheri it was really a very comfortable space shed be sure to thank her stepmotherwho of course had done all this work while injured kayleigh admired marygordons picture of the pony and set it prominently on the bedside table can we go riding tomorrow well have to see marygordon its a busy time but well have breakfast together grandma sheri and mommy made pancakes they were pretty good not the best but pretty good kayleigh laughed and watched the little girl help unpack the suitcases and with an expectant gaze toward kayleigh put away each article of clothing or toiletry where directed as the girl made decisions about how to stow everything she was absorbed and seemed to get huge pleasure from the simple tasks a tap in kayleighs mind like a finger flicking a crystal glass an idea for a song i could learn a lot from you a parent to a child how the mother or father has gotten some things wrong in life and its the child who rearranges the adults perspective it would have a twist the first three verses would make listeners believe that the child was singing to the parent only in the last would it be revealed that the parent was narrating the story a melody came almost immediately she sat down and wrote out the words and music on improvised staff paper whatre you doing aunt kayleigh writing a song you inspired me whats inspired i wrote it for you oh sing it to me its not finished but heres part of it she sang and the girl stared raptly at her thats a very good song marygordon announced with a furrowed brow as if she were the artists and repertoire director of a major label passing judgment on a young songwriters submission kayleigh continued to unpack pausing momentarily to look at a picture of the family from fifteen or so years ago bishop margaret suellyn and kayleigh on the porch of the old family house in the hills an hour north of here ive lived in la ive lived in maine new york city and the midwest plains but theres only one place i consider home when i was a kidthe house we owned the girl turned her bright blue eyes toward the singer are you crying aunt kayleigh the singer blinked well a little marygordon but you know sometimes people cry because theyre happy i didnt know that i dont think i do not everybody where does this go she asked picking up a pair of jeans and placed them carefully in the drawer at which kayleigh pointed tides turned dance heard the mans voice behind her in the lobby of her hotel she wasnt alarmed she knew his voice by now though for a moment she didnt recognize p k madigan he was wearing civviesblue jeans a plaid shirt cowboy boots and a tan cap embroidered on the crest with a hooked fish flying out of the water chief she was headed outon her way to bishops house to continue the interviews of kayleighs familybut she diverted and walked up to him she glanced into the bar she almost asked you want some ice cream but decided coffee soda naw the big man said see youre on your way out had to stop by and talk to you sure dance noted his slumped posture very different from the inyourface pose when shed met him at the scene of bobbys death heres the thing anitas playing it by the rules nobody in the division can talk to mefor their sake too im cut out completely and youre in charge now ah the meaning of the turned tide she realized not exactly in charge more than anybody else damn wish id listened to you back in that interrogation room and let that son of a bitch go then her heart went out to the detective he seemed lost i asked the sheriff if i could consult or anything but she said no itd look bad might prejudice the case he gave a laugh harsh and cold didnt know whether she meant the case against the killer or the case against me so im sidelined im sorry it worked out that way he waved his hand nobody to blame but myself i feel worse for miguel hes got a wife doesnt work and three kids wont have any savings he was awkward now ive got to stay off the radar kathryn but im just wondering is there anything i can do i dont know chief im interviewing charlies working on the evidence dennis is still looking into if anybody else has a motive to kill bobby and the others yeah sure i understand you could just take some time off get some fishing in funny about that madigan said yeah i like it been going out every weekend for years but fact is i spend more time thinking about cases than i do about the fish you get some good ideas floating around oh you bet i do a grim smile but the thing is until now id get outa the boat put my uniform back on and do something about it sorry chief got it thats okay just thought id ask he was halfway to the door when dance called chief wait madigan turned and she said there is one thing im thinking nobodyd have to know but its not the well most pleasant job in the world a fraction of a smile well all righty then lets get to it chapter it was about eightthirty in the evening when kathryn dance got to bishop townes house she greeted kayleigh and the family who flocked around her and thanked her for saving sheris life dampeyed hoarse the stepmother hugged dance hard and bled gratitude bishop offered his thanks too and then asked that sheriff or deputy madigan he got suspended thats right two other deputies too that son of a bitch daddy suellyn warned but marygordon was in the kitchen and out of hearing well he is and mgs going to learn words like that sooner or later its going to be later kayleigh snapped dance now explained were not making any progress putting together a case against edwin hes either innocent or very very smart we dont have any leads at all id like to get a few more details from sheri andwith a glance at suellynfrom you and your daughter about when he picked you up at the airport she was hoping to find something that she could use to infer threatening behavior which would in turn justify an arrest for stalking that would give her access to edwinwith his lawyers approvaland she hoped to conduct a full kinesic analysis at the least it could help get a restraining order to keep him at a distance oh id love that kayleigh said dance noted shed been crying recently because of bobby todays attack or some other reason bishop escorted her to a small dimly lit den which smelled of pipe smoke and pine sheri and marygordon her blue eyes sparkling brought in cookies and a pot of coffee the little girls golden hair was tied back in a ponytail the way dances daughter maggie would often wear it and for some reason dance thought how on earth am i going to tell maggie and wes that jon boling is moving but then sheri ushered the girl from the room and sat down across from dance who forced aside her personal thoughts and began the interview which however proved to be singularly unsuccessful the woman could provide no more information about the attacker shed seen flashes of gunshots and that was all not even an outline of the assailant dance then met with suellyn sanchez the matteroffact woman tried hard to recall something helpful but she confessed to dance that she was still astonished that edwin was the suspect he was just so nice and easygoing and it sounded like he knew kayleigh so well they had to be friends and there wasnt anything he said that could be taken in any way as threatening when the sister hesitated dance said youd have to testify to it under oath the woman got it deciding not to tell the lie shed been about to no nothing at all just the opposite he sounded so protective i actually felt good that somebody was looking out for her your shadow strike one next marygordon joined them dance showed her pictures of her own children and the dogs the agent sipped her coffee and ate the cookies and chatted with the little girl who meticulously set her place for her own cookie and milk and ate precisely with children deception isnt uncommon of course kids lie about as frequently as adults but their motives are clearer missing candy broken lamps but the main problem with children as witnesses is that they dont know how to characterize what they observe behaviors that seem suspicious to them might not be and theyll often miss the most egregious crimes because they dont know theyre crimes dance slowly shifted the conversation to the drive from the airport but this talk too was futile all the little girl remembered was a nice man who told her lots of neat things about the area and really liked her aunt her bright blue eyes sparkled as she talked about stan edwin sharps pseudonym she liked it that he was so helpful in picking out a present for kayleigh he wanted me to get something shed like it was really neat a stuffed tree thank you marygordon dance said youre welcome will we see that man again mr stan i liked him i dont know honey you can take a cookie with you if you want or two i think ill do that dance wrapped them up in a pink napkin they were really good as they left the den suellyn said not much to use right dont think so but appreciate the help after knocking and being waved in by sheri darthur morgan walked inside his own bag in one hand and two books in the other marygordon took his suitcase no ill show you your room mr morgan you dont have to get ill take it the little girl said and charged off drawing a look of amused confusion from the huge man dance said goodnight to bishop and sheri and then stepped outside she found kayleigh on the front porch swing the two women were alone dance sat on a creaking rattan chair next to the swing the singer lifted her hands indicating her fathers house look at this she said with an edge to her voice look whats happened peoplere dead livesre ruined im hiding out with my father for gods sake my lifes a mess and we dont even know for sure hes behind it he is dont you think dance sensed that something had happened recently something kayleigh did not want to share she knew kayleighs baseline behavior pretty well and there were now deviations in her eye contact and shoulder position it would have to do with something internalthoughts she was having memories that she didnt want to share with dance something shed done wrong and recently i honestly dont know we always build cases slowly but generally theres some definite evidence or clear witness testimony to tell us were headed in the right direction at least with edwin its all ambiguous kayleigh lowered her voice its all too much kathryn im really thinking of canceling the show on friday my heart is totally not in it and your fathers okay with it dance asked because shed noted the swivel of her eyes toward bishop towne and the decrease in volume when she used the word canceling yes she said but uncertainly he seems to agree but then he goes on like i never mentioned anything sure i understand but if you dont cancel when you play drifting i think you should modulate up to d for the third and fourth verses she waved her hand indicating where they sat remember what i was telling you after you recorded the group at villaloboss this is all the stage id like my front porch cook big dinners get fat play for the kids and family have a bunch of marygordons and henrys dont know why i picked that name i dont know a single henry in the world you could have a family and still be a pro i dont see how that kind of life takes its toll loretta lynn did it nobodys loretta lynn shes one of a kind dance had to agree and yet despite kayleigh townes protests she suddenly dug into her pocket and pulled out a pen and small pad of lined paper and jotted words and musical notes a song just cant stop you have to write your songs you mean kayleigh laughed well thats true but what i mean is thats a line that just occurred to me just cant stop spending hours with you first it was spending time with you but it needed the other syllable in hours ill write it up tonight the whole song hank williams said any song that takes more than twenty minutes to write isnt going to be any good sometimes it takes me a day or two but for that one its pretty much done she hummed a very hummable few bars you record it ill buy it dance said you her voice faded as lights appeared through the trees a car was approaching slowly kayleigh stiffened she whispered it cant be him i mean it cant we werent followed im sure not and when we left edwin wasnt at my place he doesnt even know im not there though dance wasnt so sure about that it made sense for her to come here largely so she wouldnt be alonebishop always had plenty of his crew around and they could hope edwin wouldnt figure it out but hed proved persistent to say the least when it came to finding kayleighs whereabouts the lights seemed to stop then continue on as if the driver wasnt sure of the route or didnt want to be seen should we get darthur kayleigh asked not a bad idea dance decided but before she rose to summon the guard twin lights crested a hump in the drive and the car they were attached to stopped kayleigh frozeliterally in the headlights dance eyed the vehicle carefully but it was impossible to see anything specific what was the driver doing was it edwin was he going to jam the accelerator to the floor and crash into the house in a bid to kill kayleigh and then take his own life dance stood up and pulled kayleigh to her feet just as the car bucked and started forward chapter but the vehicle turned out to be a very unthreateningand slow movingpowder blue ford taurus and one did not need to be a kinesics expert to note the sea change in kayleighs body language when she saw the driver oh its barry she cried offering a smile a very tall man lanky and longfaced handsome was climbing out he had a shock of black curly hair and round glasses kayleigh ran down the stairs and embraced him hard she said i didnt expect you for a couple of days glancing once toward dance zeigler said really i called bishop earlier and told him i was driving in tonight oh that man kayleigh muttered never said a word i was in carmel seeing neil i got your message about bobby terrible im so sorry its the worst barry kayleigh turned to dance and introduced them zeigler kayleighs producer at her record label was based in los angeles dance realized he looked familiar and recalled at kayleighs house seeing him in a half dozen framed pictures with the singer going back years in one they both held a recording industry association of america platinum record award signifying that shed sold more than a million of one of her songs or albums in jeans a white tshirt and dark jacket zeigler seemed a bit nineties to dance but it was a reasonable look for a record producer from any decade except for a touch of gray and only at the temples he didnt look any different from the man in those photographs and sheri was attacked too she was hurt but shell be all right do you have any leads he asked dance is it that guy sharp kayleigh nodded and explained barry knows all about our friend edwins sent plenty of letters to the label complaining about production standards orchestration technical quality pain in the ass zeigler grumbled the law enforcement disclaimer were just gathering information at this point but tell me did he ever threaten you or anyone like physically yes dance replied zeigler shook his head hes been more insulting i mean bhrcs the third oldest record company in la weve been producing kayleigh for six years shes had eight gold and four platinums we must be doing something right but not according to sharp just last week he sent us a twopage email about the acoustic dynamics on the download of your shadow he said it was off in the high ranges why was delmore playing dobro and not pedal steel he said kayleigh deserves better than this and then he said we should issue her on vinyl hes an analog hound but dance didnt think comments about acoustic tonal quality however harsh rose to the level of threat under california penal code section zeigler said to kayleigh bobby was the greatest guy in the world i cant believe somebodyd hurt him on purpose and to die that way you must be then he grew silent apparently deciding he shouldnt be further revisiting the horror aaron and steve said if theres anything anybody at the label can do you let us know youve got the whole company behind you barry i think hes going to keep doing this he picks verses of my songs and plays them and then kills somebody or tries to thats what bishop was telling me the producer turned to dance cant you arrest him she demurred but kayleigh said hes too smart they havent been able to find anything hes done that quite breaks the law oh this is just terrible the anger was gone and her eyes welled with tears then she tamed the emotion and the same stillness came over her as it did onstage control zeiglers voice dimmed as he said to kayleigh i want to say hi to bishop and sheri but could i talk to you for a minute alone sure to dance she said be right back the two rose and walked into the living room the producer ducking automatically as they approached the doorway arch he had to be six feet seven inches tall dance estimated she gave it a minute then rose quietly and moved to the swing kayleigh had just occupied which was next to a halfopened window from there she could hear their conversation whatever zeigler was going to tell kayleigh might have something to do with the case even if neither of them realized it provided she could make out the conversation as it turned out their words were plenty loud enough to hear dance remembered that her children when younger believed that if they couldnt see their parents they were invisible and produced no sound whatsoever look this is a terrible time to bring this up but i im sorry i have to ask what barry tell me come on ill worm it out of you you know i can are you talking to jbt global what jbt global entertainment the threesixty outfit i know who they are and no im not talking to them why are you asking zeigler was explaining how a friend of a friend of a friend in the complicated world thats entertainment had told him that global really wanted to sign her you were in discussions id heard barry we get calls all the time live nation global i dont pay attention to them you know id never leave you guys youre the ones who made me hey whats this all about it was odd to hear someone half the age of the producer talking to him as if he were a child with troubles at school i told you i was in carmel seeing neil you said neil watson one of the superstars of the pop music world of the past twenty years yeah to get fired no hes going with get this savmore yep the big box store like target and walmart theyre producing him and backing his road shows im sorry about that barry but im not talking to global really dances website flew below the radar of the big business of music but she was aware of what barry zeigler was talking about a complete shift in how people got that most addictive of drugs music before the nineteenth century music was something that one generally experienced liveat concerts opera dance halls bars in the s the powerhouses of the industry became the publishers of sheet music which people would buy and bring home to play themselves on the piano mostly then thank you mr edison wax cylinders came about played on phonographs a needle in an etched groove of the cylinder vibrated and reproduced sound through a flowerpetallike speaker you could actually listen to music in your home anytime you wanted the cylinders became disks to be played on various windup machinesphonographs gramophones originally an edison phonograph competitor victor talking machines victrolas and others soon the devices were powered by electricity and in the late s the miracle substance of vinyl became the standard for the records which were differentiated by the speed at which the turntable revolved originally rpms then for singles and for longplaying or lps later in the twentieth century tape became popularsoundfaithful but inconvenient reeltoreel models followed by cassettes perpetually looping eighttracks and then cds optical compact discs and though the media changed over the years people could be counted on to spend millions and millions of dollars to bring music into their homes and cars artists often performed of course but concerts were mostly a form of promotion to sell the albums some artists never set foot on a stage and still grew rich from their music but then something happened computers on which you could download and listen to any song or piece of music ever recorded in the new world order disks and tapes werent needed and the record labels which made fortunesfor themselves and artistsby producing pressing and distributing albums werent as important either no longer did you have to buy a whole album if you liked only two or three songs on it and wasnt that always the case you could pick what you wanted its a mixedtape universe nowadays thanks to dirtcheap download and streaming companies like napster amazon itunes and rhapsody and other servicesand satellite radiothat let you listen to millions of tunes for a few dollars a month and you could even have most of your hearts desires for free with music as with so many other creative arts in recent years a sense of entitlement has grown pervasive the little inconvenience of the copyright law shouldnt stop you from getting what you want youtube the pirate bay bittorrent limewire and dozens of illegal filesharing arrangements make virtually any song available free as air record companies used to sue file shareswinning judgments of hundreds of thousands of dollars against broke college kids and housewives and earning a public relations black eye in the process now theyve largely given up their police work and presently many artists were giving up tooor more cleverly were recognizing the value of offering some content at no charge to the public under the open source model the theory is that free music downloads can generate new fans who will buy future albums and attend concerts where all the money is being made all of which renders the traditional record stores and labels relics of the past people like barry zeigler are still needed as producers but as forfee technicians only with revenues from downloads tumbling its hard for some of them even to make a living at their craft dance had heard of jbt global entertainmentit was a competitor of live nation which owned entertainment arenas and concert halls and ticketmaster and had contracts with many rock pop rap and country superstars these companies were typical of the model as in degrees global covered all aspects of a musicians professional lifeproducing the albums pressing the few cds that were still sold cutting deals with download services and big corporations for exclusive promotions andmost importantbooking musicians into live performances and arranging lucrative deals for movie sound tracks and advertising known as synchronization ironically the music world has come full circle in a mere two hundred years from live performances prior to the nineteenth century to live performances in the twentyfirst barry zeiglers world was vanishing fast and dance understood his desperate concern that kayleigh might leave him the drama of the music industry was of course important to zeigler and the singer but the subject had virtually vanished from dances mind now that she knew the private conversation had nothing to do with the edwin sharp case dance gave up her eavesdropping and collected her purse from inside deciding she wanted to get back to the motel as she waited on the porch for kayleigh to return she looked out over the darkening pine grove surrounding bishops house she was concentrating once more on how best to find a killer as invisible as a snake who could be stalking them anywhereeven from the thousands of shadows surrounding the house at that very moment chapter an hour later kathryn dance was doing some stalking herself shed returned to the mountain view where shed called her motherthe kids had gone to bed dance had dialed the number with some uneasiness afraid shed learn something more about jon bolings impending departure but edie dance said nothing further on the subject explaining that the children were doing well and stuart dances father had her house ready for the guests and the party planned for this weekend after disconnecting she debated calling boling then decided not to partly because she was a coward she chided herself but she also had work to do stalking she turned on the tv a commercial network with a lot of commercials so the many random flickers from the screen on the window shade would suggest someone was inside she pulled on the only nightop camouflage she had a navy sport coat black jeans and a burgundy tshirt the outfit would have to do for shoes aldo pumps she had no tactical boots finally ready dance slipped outside and stepped into the parking lot her mission was to find out who might be the person with the bad habits of nicotine and possibly espionage shed just seen the glow of the cigarette again in nearly the same place that shed seen it earlier in the park across the road the smoker was still there she glanced out from behind a caravan filled with dog show paraphernalia and a bumper sticker bragging that the driver was the proud owner of a german shepherd smarter than your honor student dance focused again on the tiny orange glow in a recess between two thick stands of pine was the cigarette just a coincidence dance might have thought so except for the fact that sheri townes attacker had possibly been smoking and that edwin might still have the habit in any event she wanted to get a glimpse of the person if it was a teenage boy sharing a cigaretteor a jointwith his buddies that would be that if it was edwin sharpor someone else she might have come in contact with recentlythat would be a different matter dance waited until a car entered the lot and drove past her parking at the entrance then she stepped out of the shadows and made her way to the fourlane road and hurried across very aware of the lightness on her hip where her pistol normally was she circled wide and entered the park through one of the half dozen gaps in a rusty chain link fence she stayed close to the treesthe path through the playground would have offered a good view of her approach in the cool moonlight she waved away lethargic but persistent late summer insects and bats dipped close dining on them keeping her eyes down to spot noisy vegetation and food wrappers she moved forward steadily but slowed as she approached the culdesac where the spy or an innocent citizen was ruining his health twenty feet farther on she smelled cigarette smoke and she slowed even more crouching she couldnt see him yet but noted that the place where he was sitting seemed to be a picnic area there were several tables nearby all of them chained to thick concrete posts in the ground was table theft from public facilities a big problem in fresno she moved closer yet one careful step at a time the orange glow was evident but thick pine boughs completely obscured her view of the smoker about twenty feet away she reached out and gripped the bough moving it aside squinting oh no dance gasped the lit cigarette was stuck into a fork of a sapling near a picnic table that meant only one thing edwin or whoever it might be had seen her leave the motel and drawn her into a trap she spun around but saw no attacker she dropped to her knees fast remembering that his weapon of choice was a pistol probably gabe fuentess stolen glock she wasnt much of a target in the moonlight but you can spray ten or twelve rounds very quickly with a weapon like that and all you needed to do was point in the general direction of your victim still no sign of him where could he be or had he lured her here to get into her room steal her computer and notes no hed be coming after her she couldnt wait any longer she rose and turned feeling a painful tickle of panic on her back as if he were actually rubbing the muzzle of the gun along her spine but instead of returning in the same direction shed come she decided to head directly for the motel this route was closer though it required her to vault the sixfoot fence still she felt she had no choice and she headed that way now turning away from the lone cigarette and moving as fast as she could keeping low toward the road thinking about getting across those four lanes which would expose her to it was then that he sprang the trap or rather she sprang it herself tripping over the fishing lineor maybe guitar stringhed strung across the route hed anticipated she would take back she fell hard slamming into the packed dirt there were none of the many pine needle beds here which would have broken her fall she lay gasping breath knocked from her lungs damn oh goddamn that hurts cant breathe she heard footsteps not far away moving in closer closer she desperately tried to scramble toward the road where at least a car might be driving past discouraging him from shooting but the asphalt was at least forty or fifty feet away through the woods she tried to rise but couldnt there was no air in her chest then through the still humid night she heard behind her the double snap of an automatic pistols slide back and forward chambering a round chapter kathryn dance tried once more to get to cover but there was no cover nothing here but skinny pine trees and anemic brush then a firm voice a mans from not far away called in a sharp whisper kathryn she glanced about but could see no one then the speaker called you by the gym set i have a weapon im a county deputy do not move dance tried to see who this was she couldnt spot her attacker either there was an eternal pause and then from behind her she heard fleeing footsteps as the attacker escaped then her rescuer was running too in pursuit dance rose unsteadily tryingstill largely unsuccessfullyto breathe who was it harutyun she expected to hear gunshots but there was none only the sounds of returning footfalls and a man saying in a whisper kathryn where are you the voice was familiar here he approached finally she sucked in a solid breath and wiped tears of pain from her eyes she blinked in surprise walking through the woods holstering his weapon was michael oneil she barked a laugh which contained part relief part joy and a dash of hysteria they sat in the bar drinking sonoma cabernets dance asked that was your car that i saw pulling in fifteen minutes ago yeah i saw you crossing the street you looked furtive i was trying not furtive enough so i followed she lowered her head to his broad shoulder oh michael i never thought itd be a trap who was it edwin probably yes no we just dont know what did you see nothing a shadow she gave a faint laugh at the word sipped her wine thats the theme of the case shadows hes still using that song you told me about right she gave him an update of what had happened so far including how the information on the website hed found from the file sharers partner in salinas had let them save the life of kayleighs stepmother so hes targeting family oneil as a major crimes detective had some experience with stalker cases too thats rare yes it is she added theres one verse of your shadow left but kayleighs written a lot of songs shes convinced hes using fire because of her hit fire and flame who knows what else he could decide to do each verse in shadow has a theme but theyre also pretty vague so we cant figure out just who hes going to target next how does the last verse go dance recited it you cant keep down smiles happiness floats but trouble can find us in the heart of our homes life never seems to go quite right you cant watch your back from morning to night maybe its a love song but its plenty creepy to me and right it doesnt exactly give gps coordinates about where hes going to attack so dance asked looking him over you just jumped in the car and drove three and a half hours after supper oneil was not big on eye contact even with those close to him and he examined the bar and the rubycolored ellipse of the light refracted through his wineglass with that fellow in salinas there was a monterey connection it made sense i come on over here she wondered if hed have made the journey because hed learned jon boling wasnt here the detective continued and i figured i should bring you a present the sort i couldnt send fedex tj said you came here unarmed i checked out a glock for you from cbi does overby always insist on filling out so many forms yes the head of her office would be worried that protocol involving firearms might end up with bad publicity for the bureau well for him charles is a triplicate kind of guy she said smiling and adjusting her position on the seat as some pain from the tumble shot through her side he reached into his computer bag and handed her a black plastic gun case fifty rounds if you need more than that well were all in trouble she took his arm squeezed it wanted to rest her head against his shoulder again but refrained this was a vacation thats all it was just then dennis harutyun walked into the bar and dance introduced themthough the local deputy remembered oneil from the skype conference call it was midnight but the detective looked as fresh as if it were the start of his daily tour uniform shirt perfectly pressed he said to dance charlies folksve been through the park nothing other than the cigarette and the fishing line used as a trip wire well send the cigarette in for dna but there probably isnt any if he was smart which he seems to be he just lit the end probably wore gloves the line is nylon the sort youd buy in any one of a hundred sports or big box stores oneil reported what hed seen which was very little dance had heard the weapons receiver but neither of them had actually seen a gun much less the attacker himself the monterey detective said could be the weapon he stole from that deputy of yours the one whos out of commission now yeah could be oh and it gets worse you tell him harutyun asked dance who said no the head of the detectives here and another officer were a little casual in a search and seizure edwin filed doj complaint and theyre suspended too hell oneil muttered pike madigan thats right you saw him in our skype conference dance glanced out the window and noted a few cars slowing as they drove past the now brightly lit park filled with crime scene officers and uniformed deputies flashing lights from cruisers dance wouldnt have been surprised to see the big red buick but of course she didnt i think i better get some sleep a glance toward oneil you must be tired too havent checked in yet either no he came to rescue me as dance signed the drinks to her room her mobile dinged with an incoming text shed turned it back on after her disastrous mission into the park what is it michael oneil asked noting she was frozen staring at the screen its a text she barked a laugh from edwin sharp what hed like to see me why to talk he says he wants to meet me at the sheriffs office her eyes rose and she glanced at oneil and then harutyun he also asked if i had a pleasant night harutyun exhaled in surprise that man is something else she texted back that shed meet him at nine he replied good look forward to spending some alone time with you agent dance wednesday wednesday chapter at nine on the dot kathryn dance met with edwin sharp in an apparently littleused office in the fmcso not an interrogation room no intimidating decor no mirrors the location was dances idea to put edwin at ease though it wasnt exactly comfy the room was windowless and featured a gray battered desk propped up by books where a leg was missing a trio of dusty dead plants and stacks of boxes containing files on the walls were a half dozen bleached pictures of a family vacation at a lake circa the imposing man entered ahead of her and sat slumping in the chair and regarding her with amused curious eyes she noted again his outsized arms hands and eyebrows he was wearing a plaid shirt tight jeans and a thick belt with a large silver buckle an accessory that somehow had come to be a stereotypical element of cowboyness though she wondered if anyone had ever really worn one on the plains of kansas or west texas in the s his boots with pointed toes tipped in metal were scuffed but looked expensive you mind if i take notes she asked not at all you can even record this he looked around the room as if he knew they were doing just that dance wasnt obligated to tell him since theyd gotten a magistrates okay given that he was a suspect in the murders dance remained placid but was troubled by his perception or intuition and his utterly calm demeanor that false wisp of a smile added to the eeriness any time you want to take a break for some coffee or a smoke you just let me know i stay away from coffee he said and gave no reaction to the other offer was he being coy dance had been fishing to find out about his current smoking habit but whether hed outmaneuvered her or just hadnt thought to refer to the vice didnt matter shed raised the issue once and couldnt bring it up again without giving something awayas madigan had done throughout the first interview he then surprised her further by asking casually how longve you been in law enforcement agent dance just the sort of question she herself would ask early in an interview to establish a baseline for kinesic analysis for some time now but please call me kathryn now what can i do for you he smiled knowingly as if he had expected such a deflecting answer some time ah you seem seasoned thats good oh and you can call me edwin all right edwin you enjoying fresno i am little different from monterey isnt it dance wasnt surprised that she herself had been the subject of edwins own investigation though she wondered how far his knowledge of her life extended he continued its pretty there i dont like the fog much do you live near the water so what can i do for you edwin youre busy i know lets get to the nut of it that was an expression of my mothers i thought it was about squirrels hiding nuts i never did find out what it meant she had all sorts of great expressions she was quite a woman his eyes scanned her face dipped to her chest and belly though not in a lascivious way then back to her eyes i wanted to talk to you because youre smart smart i wanted to talk to somebody involved in this situation whos smart therere a lot of good people here on the sheriffs office staff she waved her arm wondering if hed follow the gesture he didnt he continued to study her intently soaking up images and that smile nobody as smart as you thats a fact and a half and the other thing is you dont have an agenda he grimaced and his brows furrowed even more dont you hate phrases like that having an agenda sending messages drinking the koolaid clichés i regret saying that about the agenda sorry put it another way youll stay focused on the truth you wont let your lets say patriotism for kayleigh mess up your judgment likes happened with the deputies here she noted he was articulate which she recalled was true of his emails as well most erotomanic or loveobsessional stalkers were above average in intelligence and education though edwin seemed smarter than most lord knew if he was behind the killings he was clever this of course had nothing to do with a completely skewed sense of realitylike believing kayleigh would actually be touched that hed murdered her stepmother or a file sharer stealing her songs he continued officers here they wont listen to me end of story well ill be happy to hear what you have to say thanks kathryn basically its real simple i didnt kill bobby prescott i dont believe in file sharing but i wouldnt kill anybody because they did it and i didnt attack sheri towne he would have learned about the second and third attacks in the press and she noted that he didnt say or anyone with her the stories had not reported dances own presence at the incident involving sheri you tell me that edwin but everyone i interview denies the crime even when we have them dead to rights hey another expression of my mothers i dont really know you well enough to determine if youre capable or inclined to hurt anybody or not tell me a little about yourself again a knowing look eerie but he played along and for five minutes or so he went through facts that she largely knewhis unfortunate but not tortured family history his jobs in seattle his impatience with formal education he said he often got bored in class his teachers and professors were slower than he waswhich might explain his checkered record at school he downplayed but didnt deny his skill at computers he didnt mention his romantic life past or present you have a girlfriend that caught him a bit off guard as if he was thinking obviously i do kayleigh towne last year i dated somebody in seattle we lived together for a while sally was okay but she wasnt into doing anything fun i couldnt get her to go to concerts or anything i had to break up with her felt kind of bad about it she really wanted to get married but it wouldntve worked out i mean is it too much to ask to have fun with somebody to laugh to be on the same you know wavelength not at all dance reflected but gave no response she asked when did you break up around christmas im sorry about that it mustve been tough it was i hate hurting people and sally was real nice just you know with some people things click some not she now had enough information and decided it was time to start her kinesic analysis she asked him again what specifically she could do for him noting his behavior closely okay im not the brightest bulb on the tree another mom expression ha and im not very ambitious but im smart enough to figure out that im the victim here and im hoping youre smart enough to take that seriously somebodys setting me upprobably the same people who were spying on me last weekend behind the house checking me out my car even my trash i see look im not the ogre everybody says i am deputy madigan and lopez im sorry i had to have them arrested but i didnt start it they broke the fourth and fourteenth amendments and some other state statutes by detaining me and searching my house those souvenirs were important to me if you break the law there have to be consequences thats exactly what your job is all about i read that article you wrote when you were a reporter a few years ago about the justice system in the paper in sacramento that was a good article all about presumed innocence again dance struggled to keep the surprise off her face did you get a look at who was watching you no they stayed in the shadows did his smile deepen at the word shadows just a faint reaction she couldnt tell why didnt you call the police why do you assume i didnt shed known that he had hed told madigan about the incident when shed been observing in the interrogation room when edwin was detained shed wanted to see his consistency you did his eyes narrowed nineoneone and they asked me if the man was trespassing and i guess technically he wasnt youre sure it was a man a hesitation well no i just assumed his odd smile thats good kathryn see thats what i mean youre being smart why would somebody make you a fall guy i dont know its not my job to prove my innocence all i know is i havent hurt anybody but someones going to a lot of trouble to make it look like i have his eyes scanned her face closely now heres where i need your help i was by myself when bobby was killed and the file sharer too but when sheri towne was attacked i have an alibi did you tell the deputies no because i dont trust them thats why i wanted to talk to you now i wasnt sure it was a good ideabecause youre a friend of kayleighsbut after reading that article you wrote after meeting you i decided you wouldnt let your friendship interfere with your judgment maybe that comes from you being a mother he dropped that sentence without adding anything further or even looking for a response dance wondered if her face ticked with the alarm she felt tell me about the alibi she calmly asked i was going to go to the luncheon for the fan i didnt think theyd let me in but i thought i could watch from a distance i didnt know maybe hear kayleigh sing anyway i got lost around cal state i stopped and i asked directions it was twelvethirty yes just around the time of the attack whod you talk to i dont know her name it was a residential area near the sports stadium this woman was working in a garden she went inside to get a map and i stayed at the door the noon news was just finishing at the time i was dodging bullets and being hit by fire extinguisher shrapnel the street name dont know but i can describe her house it had a lot of plants hanging from baskets the bright red little flowers whatre they called geraniums i think so kayleigh likes to garden me not so much as if he were talking about his wife my mother did too she hadcliché alerta real green thumb dance smiled anything more about the house dark green on the corner oh and the house had a carport not a garage she was nice so i moved some bags of grass seed for her she was in her seventies white thats all i remember oh she had cats all right edwin well look into that dance jotted down the information will you give us permission to search the yard where you saw that intruder of course sure she didnt look up but asked quickly and inside your house too yes a microsecond of hesitation she couldnt tell he added if deputy madigan had asked in the first place i would have let him dance had called his bluff which may not have been a bluff at all and said shed schedule a time for deputies to come by and she asked herself the big question what did the kinesics reveal was edwin sharp telling the truth she frankly couldnt say as shed told madigan and the others in the briefing on monday a stalker is usually psychotic borderline or severely neurotic with reality issues that meant he might be reciting what he believed was the truth even though it was completely false therefore his kinesics when lying would be the same as his baseline adding to the difficulty was edwins diminished affecthis ability to feel and display emotion such as stress kinesic analysis works only when the stress of lying alters the subjects behavior still interviewing is a complex art and can reveal more than just deception with most witnesses or suspects the best information is gathered by observations of first body language then second verbal qualitypitch of voice and how fast one talks for instance the third way in which humans communicate can sometimes be helpful verbal contentwhat we say the words themselves ironically this is generally the least useful because it is the most easily manipulated and prone to misunderstanding yet with a troubled individual like edwin where kinesics werent readily available looking at his verbal content might be the only tool dance had but what had he offered that could be helpful he shook his head as if answering her silent question and the smile deepened it was unprofessional but she wished hed lose the grin the expression was more unnerving to her than the worst glare from a murderer you think im smart edwin but do you think im straightforward he considered this as much as you can be you know with everything thats been happening dont you think it might make sense for you to get back to seattle forget about the concert you could see kayleigh some other time she said this to prime the pump see if hed offer facts about his life and plansfacts that she might use for contentbased analysis she certainly didnt expect the laugh of disbelief and what he then said i can hardly do that now can i no you know that song of hers your shadow there wasnt a single clue in his face that this song was a calling card for murder she said casually sure her big hit you thought it was the best song she ever wrote edwins grin for once took on a patina of the genuine she told you that did she he glowed his lover had remembered something about him well its about her you know about her kayleigh thats right the first verse is about how people take advantage of her as a musician and then theres a verse about that car crashwhen her mother died kayleigh was fifteen you know bishop was driving drunk no dance had not been aware of that he spent eight months in jail never drove a car after that then that other verse about the riverside at last the smile faded i think i dont know but i think something pretty bad happened to her when she was about sixteen she disappeared for a while i think she had a breakdown tried to kill herself drowning you know thats the lyrics in the song was that true dance had never heard of this either now the uncomfortable smile faded how sad is that writing a song to comfort yourself because nobody else is there for you awful eyes focused intently on his interviewer kayleigh sent me a dozen emails and a few real letters and you know what i read between the lines in every single one she needs me agent dance she needs me bad if i left who else would look out for her chapter deputy crystal stanning michael oneil and kathryn dance were in the briefing room of the fmcso acting chief detective dennis harutyun too dance was reporting about the interview with edwin ill have to be honest hes very hard to read kinesically hes coming off as completely nondeceptive which either means hes telling the whole truth or hes completely delusional the son of a bitch did it stanning grumbled it seemed the woman had grown more selfconfident and edgier as the case had progressed or maybe it was just madigans absence a call to the joint county emergency communications headquarters revealed that edwin had in fact called to report a peeping tom it was saturday night pm he was complaining about somebody watching him from the backyard no details the dispatcher said to call back if the perp actually trespassed or threatened him charlie sheans crime scene team had just gone out to the place and conducted a search for where the intruder might have been he was due any moment with the results oneil asked saturdaythe night before bobby was killed who couldve been watching him who knew he was in town harutyun said we got the notice about a week agofrom kayleighs lawyersthat he might be in fresno and could be a problem but dance pointed out anybody couldve found out where he was hows that harutyun asked the monterey detective added that on the fan websites sharp had posted that he was going to fresno for a while harutyun took a call spoke for a few minutes and then disconnected patrols canvassing the area around bulldog stadium cal state lotta people its slow going this was to find the woman whod given edwin directions at the time of sheris attack dance was calling her alibi woman a moment later charlie shean walked into the office he greeted them all and briefed them about the scene in his thick boston accent rare in these parts he said we went through his house and collected some trace but it was clean i wonder if he scrubbed it down after he gave you permission to search a glance toward dance she recalled the faint hesitation before edwin gave his okay cigarettes dance had asked them to check no no lighters or matches or ashtrays no odor of cigarettes either now i know from before that the latex gloves in edwins kitchen probably arent the same as at the bobby prescott homicide the wrinkle patterns are different outside where the alleged perp was spying on him well we found some shoe prints in the dust cowboy boots it looks like not the sort that garbage men or workers back there would wear they were distorted because of the wind but at least it hadnt rained and washed the damn prints away cant tell size male female or age and we collected about thirty samples of trace but the preliminaries are pretty useless sorry dennisif theres anything there i dont know how it can help now we confirmed that the cigarette from last night at your motel is a marlboro we have ash from the site of the sheri towne attackcigarette ash i meanbut we dont have the equipment to analyze it proper to tell what brand it is or how long ago it was left it was then that dennis harutyuns assistant came to the door and handed him a sheaf of papers thesere those emails you were waiting for about bobby prescott they finally came in the deputy read them over laughed subdued but for him a significant outpouring of emotion he said to the officers one of the things i was looking into was another motive for killing bobby prescott by somebody other than edwin right dance said well i mayve found one go ahead he said you ever hear about these guys john paul george and ringo chapter dance and oneil conducted the search themselves it felt good being with him again working with him some of this was simply the comfort of being with a person you were close to whose subtle looks and smiles and gestures communicated perfectly without the need for words but part of the pleasure was their combined skills as law enforcers a gestaltthe whole greater than the sum of the parts policings a tough business and cant be done alone the job can be a nightmare when you arent connected with your partnerand that not only makes for a tough working day but it also means the bad guys are less likely to get caught police investigation can be an art form like ballet a choreography of technique purpose and she felt this in near perfection with michael oneil the scene where they were practicing their harmonies was bobby prescotts trailer and what had inspired the search here was the revelation by harutyun about the fab four dance believed she now knew what had been stolen the morning after the roadie had been murderedby the person tabatha nysmith had seen in bobbys trailer and the object of this theft wasnt kayleigh towne memorabilia indeed it had nothing to do with the singer at all or with the stalkerexcept to the extent that yes edwin sharp probably was a fall guy as hed claimed all along well she said somewhat breathlessly examining a binder from the shelves where shed noted something missing several days ago when she was here with p k madigan oneil stepped closer and together they looked over a spiral notebook in which bobby prescotts father had jotted details about the recordings hed helped engineer at abbey road studios in london during the s and s dance recalled that tabatha had mentioned bobbys fathers illustrious career it was a breathtaking list of talent from the era cliff richard connie francis the scorpions the hollies pink floyd and of course the beatles who recorded yellow submarine and abbey road there much of the mans scribbling was crypticnotes about synthesizers and amplifier dynamics and acoustic baffles and instruments but the most relevant was a carbon copy of a letter to bobbys father june bob prescott hey mate thanks for the great job youre the best engineer we mean it loved working with you so in appreciation for all those sleepless nights the tapes to those songs we did playing around after abbey road are yours all the rights everything the lists below cheers wait oneil said are those dance said in a whisper i think they are my god i think they are at the bottom of the letter were the titles of four songs none of them was a known beatles song she explained that the composing and recording of the songs on the abbey road album began in the spring of it was the groups last studio album let it be was released a year later though that song was finished by january of dennis harutyunthe librarian of the fmcso as madigan dubbed himhad indeed done some impressive research into the life of bobby prescott and his family to see if anyone other than edwin might have a motive to kill him the deputy had found some rumors buried on the internet that his father might have had some outtakes of beatles songs hed helped engineer in london years ago but these werent outtakes they were complete songs original and unreleased never heard in public and the beatles just gave them away oneil asked the band was breaking up then they were rich maybe they just didnt care about them or maybe they just didnt think they were any good the letters not signed by any of them dance shrugged a handwriting expert could verify which of the four wrote it but they talk about after abbey road who else could it be they mustve stayed around the studio afterward and just thrown a few songs together doesnt matter theyre still beatles songs bobby got the tapes from his father right dance said gesturing at the shelves the perp found out and has been waiting for a chance to kill him and steal them waiting for edwin or somebody like him to show up as a fall guy exactly oneil said so its somebody who knew bobby and his archives and would have heard the rumors about the beatles songs he regarded the lyrics could the perp sell them though id think at the least he could work out a finders fee in the millions or maybe he could sell them to a reclusive collectorlike that japanese businessman who got busted for spending fifty million for a stolen van gogh he was going to keep it in his basement never let anybody see it oneil pointed out well we know the motive the second question is whos the perp you have any ideas i dont know the cast of characters here dance thought for a moment looking round the trailer a to b to z i need you to do something sure the detective said evidence crime scene youre a better interrogator than i am but im game no she said she took him by the shoulders and walked him backward five feet she then stepped away and examined him closely just stand right there and dont move as she walked out the door oneil looked around and said i can do that a half hour later dance and oneil along with a contingent of fmcso deputies sped through the hazy latesummer afternoon toward a motel off highway it was a red roof inn decent clean but surely far below what the guest they were about to arrest had been used to at certain points in his life the four cars approached silently there were jurisdictional considerations of course but dance and oneil werent here to claim the trophy merely to help out they were happy to let the local constabulary handle the arrest she had after all agreed to let madigan take the collar and corner the publicity though it would be fmcso in general whod get the credit since he wasnt on active duty the three police cars and dances nissan slipped silently up to the motel and parked with a shared smile and tacit understanding dance and oneil glanced at each other and wandered to the back of the place while harutyun stanning and four other deputies sprinted through the halls to the room where surveillance had revealed the suspect was staying as theyd guessed the nervous perp had been anticipating the visit hed seen the cars approach and he literally leapt out the window of his room onto an unpleasant patch of grass reserved for dogs doing their business he righted himself fast wrapped his computer bag strap around his chest and poised for a sprint then wisely chose to stop as he glanced at the guns in the hands of dance and oneil both of the muzzles pointed steadily at his head two other somber deputies one latino and one anglo joined them in the back they were the ones who slapped the cuffs on kayleighs producer barry zeigler and led him toward the parking lot around front it was kathryn dance who took possession of the computer bag that would contain the priceless songs that hed stolen from bobby prescotts trailer the morning after hed killed the roadie chapter your height dance explained to him zeigler sat miserable in the backseat of a sheriffs office cruiser the door was open and he was facing outward hands shackled behind him she continued to elaborate answering his question about how she knew it was he the perp would know bobby pretty well and had probably been in his trailer before and hed been somebody who was very familiar with everyone connected with the band the deciding factor was what she told him next and he was tall tall she explained about her interview with tabatha across the street several days ago she said shed seen somebody inside that morning except she couldnt see the intruders head only his chest this was why shed put oneil in front of the window of the trailer a half hour ago recalling that shed been eyetoeye with p k madigan outside when shed searched the trailer shed positioned the monterey detective about where tabatha had seen the intruder shed then stepped outside and walked across the street looking back shed clearly seen oneils face which meant that the intruder monday morning had been well over oneils height of six feet the only person shed met recently with an interest in kayleigh towne who knew bobby and who fit that stature was barry zeigler shit the man muttered utterly defeated im sorry i dont know what to say im sorry dance heard that often as an interrogator sorry of course what it meant ten times out of ten was im sorry i got caught when i met you at kayleighs house you said youd just driven there from carmel but we talked to the desk clerk here you checked in the morning after bobby was killed i know i know i lied im sorry that again dance said and then there was the recording of kayleigh singing your shadow that you played to announce the attacks it was done on a highquality digital recorder the sort that pros usepros like you producers and engineers recording he asked frowning she glanced at dennis harutyun who ran through the miranda warning he added youre under arrest for murder for murder what do you mean dance and harutyun exchanged glances youre being arrested for the murder of bobby prescott sir the fresno detective said and frederick blanton and assault and battery on sheri towne and agent dance do you wish to no no i didnt kill anyone i didnt attack anyone the producers face was shocked dance had seen a lot of performances from suspects this was one of the best id never do that why would i do that yessir youll have your day in court do you understand your rights bobby youre thinking i killed bobby no and id never hurt sheri this is do you understand yes yes but do you wish to waive your right to remain silent sure yes this is ridiculous this is a huge misunderstanding harutyun asked did you drive up here on sunday and kill bobby prescott that night no no i drove in on monday morning about eleven after i heard from kayleigh that bobby had died yes i broke into bobbys trailer but it was just to get some personal things the songs harutyun said we know all about them songs the beatles songs what are you talking about the quality of his confusion seemed genuine so she decided to add bobbys father was a technician at abbey road in the sixties and seventies right a pretty famous one but what does that have to do with anything the beatles gave him four original songs they wrote after they finished abbey road barry zeigler laughed no no no oneil said you killed him and stole the songs theyre worth millions the producer continued its an urban legend all those rumors about outtakes and secret recordings all that nonsense about paul is dead no rumor spreads faster in the music world than ones about the beatles but theres nothing to it there are no undiscovered songs dance was sizing up behaviors zeigler seemed more or less credible she said what about this she showed him the plastic envelope containing the letter to bobbys father zeigler looked at it and shook his head those arent beatles songs it was some local group from camden town in london i dont even remember the name they were nothing after the beatles wrapped abbey road this group booked studio time they laid down fifteen or sixteen tracks and used twelve or so for their album i guess they liked bobbys father so much they let him have the ones they didnt use nothing ever came of the group fact is they wrote pretty sucky songs dance looked at the language of the note again so in appreciation for all those sleepless nights the tapes to those songs we did playing around after abbey road are yours all the rights everything the lists below cheers yes it could simply refer to studio time after the beatles had finished recording their album but you just admitted you stole something from bobbys trailer that morning zeigler was debating he looked to oneil and the other deputies leave us alone agent dance and me i want to talk to her alone she considered this its all right the others walked away from the squad car dance crossed her arms and said okay talk you cant tell a soul you know i cant agree to that the mans long face screwed into a disgusted knot all right but take a look first and then decide in the bag theres a zipper liner some papers thats what i took from bobbys dance opened the computer bag and found the compartment she withdrew an envelope and opened it reading through a fourpage document oh my god she whispered happy now zeigler muttered chapter what hed stolen was a letter from bobby prescott about how he wanted his property distributed in the event of his death most of it would go to one person the child who was his and kayleigh townes marygordon apparently kayleigh had had the child at sixteen and suellyn and her husband roberto sanchez had adopted the little girl within weeks of her birth the envelope included a copy of the adoption papers and some personal messages to the girl for her to read when she was older he told me a few years ago that hed written it zeigler said i couldnt let it become public dance recalled the close relationship shed sensed between bobby and kayleigh at the restaurant and the other things shed noted marygordons blond hair color the girls forthright demeanor her eyes were kayleighs bright blue while suellynsand presumably her latino husbandswere brown she thought too about edwins comment in the recent interview i think something pretty bad happened to her when she was about sixteen dance asked but how come no one knew she was pregnant oh kayleigh didnt start performing professionally until she was seventeen she wasnt on the press radar before then but bishop had big plans for her he pulled her out of school when she was about two months pregnant got a tutor for homeschooling he kept it secret and spun the story pretty well to friendskayleigh was real upset her mother had died she was depressed made sense for her to disappear for eight nine months he suggested to people shed had a breakdown dance was appalled and he forced her to give the baby up zeiglers long face moved up and down bobby was twentytwo she was six years younger okay thats bad no question on the other hand he was a really nice guy and if anybody would fall for a father figure itd be kayleigh her mother had just died she was living in a house she hated with her father on the road most of the time she was vulnerable and it wasnt just a fling they wanted to get married they were in love but when bishop heard he flew back to town right after a concert and said if they didnt agree to the adoption he was going get bobby arrested for statutory rape he did that sure did kayleigh agreed to the adoptionbut only to placing the girl with her sister so she could still see her and she insisted that bobby stay with the band bishop figured that was the best he was going to get and he agreed dance recalled her own observations about bobby and what kayleigh had told her thats when bobby started drinking and got into drugs right zeigler lifted an eyebrow you caught that hm yep that was it he was really upset it didnt work out between them but why couldnt she keep the baby dance asked i know she wants children oh that wouldnt work zeigler said bitterly bishops own career was dying at that point all he had left was kayleigh and he was convinced that she needed to build her career on a goodgirl image to be successful exactly he was ahead of the curve there like he usually was look at those twilight vampire books my daughter loves theyre about kids being in love but not having sex thats kayleigh towne and parentsthe ones with the credit cardslove that image if word had gotten out that she was pregnant at sixteen that could have been the end of her career dance didnt know if that was true or not she had a lot of faith in the intelligence and discernment of audiences she said coolly but it was about you too right you cant afford to lose her not with the way record labels are headed nowadays zeiglers shoulders high above dance slumped okay okay kayleighs my only major act left everybody else is gone if i lose her its all over with im fortyfive and all ive ever done is produce albums i cant afford to be a freelancer besides kayleighs an amazing talent i love working with her shes a genius one of a kind dance looked at the adoption paperwork the letter marygordon doesnt know no bishop forced suellyn and her husband to sign a nondisclosure agreement if they said a word they might lose custody dance closed her eyes briefly and shook her head at this news about bishop towne which disturbed but didnt surprise her one bit zeigler gave a bitter laugh im not the only desperate person in this business she slipped the documents back into the envelope and put it into her purse ill think about it for now you were looking for some personal papers at bobbys what you found and took had no value and had nothing to do with the case she looked him over coolly but youre still a suspect in the murders i was in carmel at a hotel when bobby died can anybody verify that he thought for a moment then said i was by myself i was really upsetid just been fired by my other major artist the only contact i had with anybody was a message i left for my wife he glanced up at dance with miserable eyes is that any gooda voicemail where youre sobbing like a tenyearold that your career is probably over it could be dance told him chapter no beatles dennis harutyun asked visibly disappointed the news wasnt true this was the most emotional shed seen him doesnt look that way dance had phoned martine her website partner and a true musical historian who made some calls and reported back about what zeigler had said yes thered been rumors for years of undiscovered fab four songs but the consensus was just as the producer explained dance harutyun and crystal stanning stood in a cluster in the parking lot of the red roof inn the lights of the patrol cars were flashing urgently maybe this was procedure but dance wished theyd shut them off oneil was on the phone finally he ended the call and looked up his alibi its good the cell phone data and the voiceprint of the sobbing tenyearold confirmed that at the moment bobby prescott was being murdered in the fresno convention center barry zeigler was over two hours away whyd he break into bobbys trailer harutyun asked what was he after dance shrugged apparently its personal nothing to do with the case i believe him oneils eyes swung toward her amused was her behavior deviating from her baseline which he of all people would know very well the fresno deputy said hardly seems worth the trouble collaring him for that but ill tell you bad judgment ought to be a misdemeanor he walked over to his car got zeigler out and uncuffed him dance didnt know what transpired between the two but she assumed it involved a stern talkingto with a glance toward dance the producer collected his computer bag and returned to his room rubbing his wrists dance decided to give the documents to kayleigh and let her decide how to handle the matter so harutyun said returning to them no leads no suspect we have the evidence crystal stanning offered from the crime scenes and what we collected in edwins backyard evidence harutyun muttered a sour tone that dance counted as yet another shred of emotion from the reserved detective lifes not like csi im sorry charlies folks are good but you need more than finding you need figuring out yet another dust devil whirled up nearby dance cocked her head as she stared at it what oneil asked perusing her face he sensed something was up the miniature cyclone vanished kathryn dance pulled out her phone and made a call chapter two hours later this foursome reconvened in the sheriffs officein the digs of ousted p k madigan specifically it was the largest in the detective division the only one with room for more than two or three people at one time dance noted with some sad poignancy that the chief detective had been clipping coupons from safeway maybe he did the family shopping only one coupon was for ice cream buy one pint get another free she received a text read it and then asked the deputies can you show me your service door harutyun and stanning regarded each other and she said sure i guess follow me dance and others did and after a brief walk stopped at a wide doorway in a delivery area at the back of the main building opening onto a ramp that led to the parking lot good thisll do she made a call and gave directions to this entrance dance disconnected and explained im having some houseguests this weekend theyve been in san jose at a conference i took the liberty of asking them here i had our san francisco office lend them a set of flashing lights they made better time than i thought just then a white van pulled up and stopped the side door opened and a disabledpassenger ramp extended to the ground a moment later a handsome man with dark hair and a fleshy nose drove a red motorized wheelchair quickly down the ramp and through the doorway of the service area wearing tan slacks and a longsleeved burgundy shirt he was pale as befits someone who does not get outside very much joining him was a tall redheaded woman in jeans black tshirt and black jacket and a slim younger man with perfectly trimmed hair he wore welltailored slacks a white shirt and a striped tie lincoln dance bent down pressing her cheek against that of the man in the wheelchair amelia she embraced the redhead amelia sachs lincoln rhymes partner hello thom she said to rhymes caregiver who also hugged her warmly been way way too long the aide said kathryn and michael oneil rhyme said casting his eyes quickly on the detective surprised oneil said thats right hed never met rhyme howd you know a few observations youre carrying a weapon so youre public safety and those fresnomadera folks therea nod toward harutyun and stanningare in uniform but their name badges show theyre detectives so the policy here is that even detectives wear uniforms youre not so youre probably from another jurisdiction theres a car outside with a monterey county wharf pass on it youre tanned and pretty fitthe way somebody who boats or fishes in the ocean would be i know you and kathryn work together frequently therefore you were michael oneil or maybe i could tell that from the body language between the two of you this was delivered like most of lincoln rhymes wry comments without a smile rhyme made a slight movement of his neck and his right arm extended smoothly he shook oneils hand dance knew hed recently had some surgery to improve his conditionhe was quadriplegic mostly paralyzed from the neck down hed been injured on the job as head of the nypd crime scene unit some years ago the operation had been successful and hed regained nearly all the use of his right arm and hand which he controlled by subtle gestures of his neck shoulder and head muscles he similarly greeted harutyun and stanning and sachs introduced thom reston rhymes caregiver harutyun continued kathryn said shed called in an expert but i never thought itd be someone like you well thanks for coming youre based in new york i heard what brings you to california came for a visit the man said shortly and let it go at that he was not a conversationalisteven less of one than michael oneil sachs filled in hes been lecturing at a forensics conference in san jose then we were going to spend a few days with kathryn and her family in pacific grove dance had known and worked with rhyme for several years shed been after him and sachs to come for a visit rhyme was disinclined to travelcertainly there were logistical issues and he was naturally a bit of a reclusebut he was in demand as a consultant in forensics and crime scene work and he decided to accept a lecture assignment on that subject in san jose the preparations for her house that her father was taking care of in anticipation of the visit involved building a ramp to let rhyme motor up to the front door and some modifications to a bathroom rhyme had told them not to bother theyd stay at a motel but retired stuart dance loved any excuse to use his many woodworking tools harutyun said well its a true pleasure to meet you detective rhyme a fast lincoln is fine im decommissioned he revealed a hint of pleased irritation at the mans comment amelia drove i assume dance said with a wry glance at thom this was a reference to the timing it was about miles from san jose to fresno and theyd made the trip in an hour and a halfand in a disabledaccessible van no less unlike dance the policewoman from new york was a car aficionadoshe actually worked on them herselfand would take her muscle car out to the track to relax at miles per hour sachs smiled it was pretty much a straightaway the flashing blue lights always help too rhyme looked around the storage facility with a grimace as if he expected this to be the crime lab now you have some things youd like me to look over the criminalist was never one for socializing dance recalled we have a pretty good lab harutyun offered do you now there was cynicism in his voice dance had been to rhymes town house on central park west in manhattan hed turned the parlor into a wellequipped forensics lab where he as a consultant sachs and other officers would run the crime scene side of major cases in the metro area not picking up on the sardonic tone stanning said proudly yes sir sheriff madigans fought pretty hard to build up our csu officers as far away as bakersfield send samples here and i dont mean just rape kits pretty complicated things bakersfield rhyme said even more ironically drawing a sharp glance from thom a reminder that condescension was not necessary dance guessed his attitude had nothing to do with a prejudice against small towns though rhyme was a nondenominational curmudgeon he gave the nypd scotland yard and the fbi a lot of crap too the new york governors and mayors offices had not escaped his wrath either well we better get to it you dont mind lets go this way harutyun said and led them inside then out the front door as they walked and wheeled toward the crime lab dance briefed them on the case explaining that their main suspect had proved to be very slippery his names edwin sharp he could be the perp he could be a fall guy could be completely innocent harutyun said the unsub announces the attacks by playing a verse from one of kayleighs songs this clearly intrigued rhyme interesting good he said then decided he was exhibiting too much glee and hes smart right he started with phones then switched to other ways to play the song like radio callin requests very good sir stanning said not callins but most recent he played a song over a highschoolstadium pa system rhyme frowned didnt think of that one interesting like i said dance added were tracking down a witness now maybe an alibi and he claims somebodys been conducting surveillance on him presumably to set him up for the crimes thats part of the evidence we need you to look at sachs asked youve interviewed him yes but the kinesics were inconclusive i can say though that hes got a stalkers personality reduced affect attachment issues reality problems the woman from new york nodded kathryn dance glanced down she loved shoes and she couldnt help but admire amelia sachss black highheeled boots which sent the tall womana former fashion modeleven further into the stratosphere rhyme asked samples from edwins house or apartment dance said house he gave us permission though he mightve scrubbed the place down before the team searched harutyun added that an earlier search without a warrant had resulted in getting the chief of detectives and another deputy suspended the perp had also stolen the gun of another detective temporarily removing him from the force crazy like a fox rhyme commented and seemed oddly pleased at this newsmaybe because he liked adversaries who were particularly smart and challenging his numberone nemesis was boredom then they were entering the lab and meeting charlie shean if harutyun was impressed that rhyme was here shean was beside himself having a crime scene legend in his modest abode rhyme though was visibly impressed at the sophistication of the operation despite his apparent misgiving earlier some people dance knew are easier to read than others and although his body language was obviously severely limited rhyme was to her an open book charlie shean now briefed the criminalist on where they needed his expertise weve searched and weve done the analysis but most of the resultsre just raw data we dont know what to make of it if you could offer some thoughts itd be much appreciated rhyme was taking all this in as his eyes swept the ceiling then abruptly sachs lets get a chart going rhyme used graphics in running his caseshaving someone write down the evidence that had been gatheredin front of which he would then wheel back and forth frowning and muttering to himself as deductions and conclusions came or didnt come shean explained what theyd found and she wrote sunday

lincoln rhyme regarded the chart closely not good not bad lets get to work chapter entrance and exit routes from the convention center shean explained therere twentynine of them including the windows and infrastructure access doorways and loading docks there were thousands of prints and samples of trace lincoln rhyme said yes yes sometimes the problem is too much evidence rather than not enough im glad you know the number of exits charlie good searching thank you sir lincoln he corrected absently absorbing the chart rhyme and shean got to work dance had wondered if being a guest would temper rhymes edge but clearly no when he learned that there were two different places behind edwins house where an intruder might have stood to spy he asked which trace came from which area the tags on the half dozen collection bags reported only trace evidence from behind e sharps house woodward circle west well we didnt really differentiate them from rhyme oh it was the same as a loud dressingdown might want to think about that in the future rhyme had once told dance where you find the clue is critical vital a crime scene is like real estate its all about location location location on the other hand shean had satisfied rhymes numberone requirement when it came to trace isolating unique material that might have been shed by the perp this was done by taking many samples from spots nearby samplars they were called if certain materials differed from these indigenous ones they might have come from the perp sheans officers had collected hundreds of samplars at all the scenes for comparison that was competent rhyme said one of his more enthusiastic compliments he then said and now the cigarette ash stanning asked wed like to know if the samples of ash match yes well they wouldnt match of course he turned to the young woman matching is when two or more items are identical rhyme muttered very few things actually match friction ridgefingerprints and footprints of course dna andgoing out on a limbthe lands and grooves on slugs and extractor marks on the brass tool marks under rare circumstances but as for trace i could make the argument about some substances matching by analyzing halflife but thats on a nuclear level he turned his wheelchair and faced stanning lets say you find cocaine thats been cut with eighteen percent baking soda and two percent baby powder and you have another sample thats cut with exactly the same substances in those proportions they dont match but theyre associated and a jury can infer they came from the same source of course in our case its possible that somebody could smoke the same cigarette at two different locations miles apart on different days but the odds of that are rather low wouldnt you say i would definitely stanning looked as if shed decided not to make any more comments you get a lot of convictions when you testify id imagine shean offered nearly one hundred percent rhyme said with only a veneer of modesty of course if the odds arent good up front i recommend not going to trial though im not above bluffing somebody into a confession now i need to run an inductively coupled plasma test shean said mass spectrometry well we can do that im so pleased butwell just curiouswhy that if youre analyzing ash for the metals of course amelia sachs pointed out the csu head tapped his forehead trace metals in cigarette ash brilliant i never thought of that rhyme said absently its the most definitive way to determine the brand and origin of cigarettes when all you have is ash i vastly prefer a fleck of tobacco itself too because then you can factor in desiccation and other absorbed trace substances that can pinpoint location of storage and time he added a caveat up to a point shean prepared the sample and ran the test and a short time later they had their answer looking over the computer screen rhyme offered zinc iron and chromium no arsenic yep thats marlboro you know that harutyun asked a shrugone of the few gestures the criminalist was capable ofand one that he used with some frequency he announced ill say its likely that the same person was at both scenes but remember person a could have been at the first site smoking a marlboro person b could have bummed one off him and set up the trap at the mountain view motel not likely but it could be how long for the dna another few days a grimace but its not any better in new york of course i dont think youll find any though your perp is smart he probably lit it by blowing on the tip not holding it in his lips so does this edwin sharp smoke he used to dance said still may sometimes but we dont know they couldnt draw any conclusions from the boot printreally just the toe sachs studied the electrostatic print agree that its probably a cowboy boot pretty common in new york a few years agoline dancing was all the rage she added that rhyme had compiled a footwear database but the electrostatic image was too fuzzy to give them a brand name all right the fishing line nothing there im afraid generic is a word i dislike very much lets look at the shell casings shean reiterated that he thought the gun at both the blanton shooting and the sheri towne attack was probably the same you can say match rhyme said wont bite you in this context but where did the gun come from stolen from one of your officers you were saying possiblygabriel fuentes hes been suspended i heard i wish we could tell it might help incriminate sharp he was near gabes car when the gun was stolen but we dont know for sure no let me have the closeups of the extractor marks and scratches rhyme said and the ones of the lands and grooves on the slugs shean placed them on a table for rhyme to examine but we dont have known samples from gabes glock i asked him and i know you dont oh right otherwise we would have identified the gun exactly rhymes brow furrowed as he examined the pictures sachs dance recalled that though they were both romantic and professional partners they tended to refer to each other by their last names which she found rather charming sachs studied the pictures too apparently she knew exactly what he was interested in id say four thousand good rhyme announced then i need the serial number of fuentess gun a fast computer search revealed it rhyme glanced at the number okay the gun was made four years ago by our talented friends in austria call this fuentes and ask him when he got it and how often he fired it harutyun made this call he jotted notes and looked up you need anything else from gabriel lincoln no not now maybe later dont let him wander too far from his mobile the answer was that hed bought the weapon newthree years agoand took it to the range twice a month or so he would typically fire fifty rounds rhyme gazed into the air over the local officers fifty rounds every two weeks for three years means its been fired about thirtynine hundred times from the pictures of the shells and the slugs sachs estimated they came from a gun that had been fired about four thousand times good eye he glanced at her sachs explained to the others the distension of the brass cracks around the neck and the spread of the lands and grooves are typical of a gun fired with that frequency shean was nodding as if memorizing this so it is gabes weapon most likely sachs said rhyme called microscope charlie i need a scope well the scanning electron no no no obviously thats not what i need were not at the molecular level optics optics oh sure the man had a tech wheel over two heavy compound microscopesone a biological which illuminated translucent samples from beneath and a metallurgic model which shone light down on opaque samples shean was setting it up when rhyme shooed him away using his right hand he prepared several slides from the trace and examined them one by one using both of the scopes and good job with the analysis of the trace charlie let me see the original printouts shean called them up and rhyme studied the screen and then some of the samples visually peering through the eyepieces he was muttering to himself dance couldnt hear everything he said but caught an occasional good good what the hell is that oh bullshit hm interesting good rhyme set slides out and pointed fungi database on that one and i need a fast reagent test on those a tech ran the reagent tests but charlie shean said we dont exactly have a fungus database really rhyme said and gave the man a website user name and pass code in five minutes shean was browsing through rhymes own database on molds and fungi jotting notes eyes on the chart rhyme said harutyun armenian the detective nodded big community here in fresno i know and how did rhyme know that dance wondered but speculating about the criminalists encyclopedic mind was useless some facts that even children knew he was completely ignorant of others far more esoteric were stored front and center the key she knew was whether they had helped him analyze evidence or might help him do so in the future she wouldnt have been surprised to learn that he didnt know the earth revolved around the sun finally the results from the new tests were compiled and rhyme reviewed them as well as the results from the earlier analysis that sheans techs had run it was raw data only but no one was better at turning raw data into something useful than lincoln rhyme now outside edwins house the fungus is often used in place of traditional toxic chemical pesticides and the mineral oil is also found in alternative pesticides also at his house and at the convention center the triglycerides with that color temperature and melting point id say its neatsfoot oil thats used for treating baseball gloves and leather sports equipment equestrian tack and gunslings snipers buy a lot of it used to be made from cattle bonesneat is an old word for oxen or cowbut now its made mostly from lard hence the triglycerides he consulted the chart frowning i dont know about the ammonium oxalate thats going to take more digging but the limonite goethite and calcite its gangue whats that gangue oneil asked its byproductgenerally unused materials produced in industrial operations those particular substances are often found in ore collection and processing i also found the same materials in the trace at the public phone at fresno college where he called kayleigh to announce one of the attacks and something else here rhyme said with some excitement in his voice he glanced at the evidence bags from the pa system control room the phone and from behind edwins house calcium powder but its not what you suggested charliemedical or dietary supplement its bone dust well couldnt people still take it like a supplement rhyme frowned dont think theyd want to i forgot to mention its human chapter the bone material was quite minimal and to confirm the source would require a confocal laser scanning microscope rhyme explained looking around the room as if one of these magical devices were nearby in the lab charlie shean said that while he was aware of the machine and had wanted to acquire one the fmcso could not in fact afford it well im ninetynine percent sure the morphology of the particles and the geometry of the dust almost guarantee its human id be very surprised if it wasnt what they could do with that information though rhyme wasnt positive cant quite see how it fits into the big picture he admitted anybody among the cast of characters here have a job that might involve bone surgeon dentist no undertaker harutyun suggested they dont do much bone work i could see medical examiners pathologists wait fresno collegewhere he made the calldoes it have a medical school yes harutyun reported ah that could be it human skeletons in the classrooms and then procedures too involving bone saws until we get more information i think well go on the assumption that he picked up the bone dust at the school and then continued his surveillance at edwins oneil said at least we know that the person who was behind edwins house was the perp so that means it isnt him harutyun said unless dance pointed out edwin himself was the source of the bone dust and he left the trace when he walked back to see whod been spying on him exactly kathryn rhyme said harutyun muttered thats the way this cases been going all alonghes guilty hes innocent guilty innocent rhyme wheeled back to the microscope hm still a few things i want to look at ammonium oxalate scotch crystal stanning broke her vow of silence you you found some traces of liquor no no i want some scotch oh well we dont actually have any in the sheriffs office really rhyme sounded surprised lincoln thom said i was simply asking he returned to the microscope dance and

walked outside and into the parking lot of the sheriffs office she nearly laughed to see p k madigan undercoverhe was now in khakis a plaid shirt and tan vest the fishing cap and mirrored aviator sunglasses dance smiled hi i but madigan interrupted and said urgently weve got a situation i mean youve got a situation go on ive spent the last sixteen or so hours online looking up everything i could find about edwin kayleigh fans everything this was the assignment dance had given p k madigan the job shed described as unpleasant since it involved sitting at a desk not the greatest job in the world for an active law enforcer like the chief detective who seemed to enjoy fieldwork unlike a lot of his counterparts but dance believed it was important to continue to monitor edwins online activity and to find any new posts and sites he visited with their limited manpower shed enlisted madigan wheres edwin now he under surveillance he was ill check dance replied and placed a call she posed the question to dennis harutyun who was probably a bit mystified by dances disappearance but he didnt query her he just said hold on a moment later he came back on the line she heard frustration in his voice this is odd edwin went to the mallfashion fair on shaw parked in the lot near east santa ana the deputy thought edwind lose him in the stores so he stayed with the car that was two hours ago he hasnt been back he knew he was being tailed and he jumped probably okay ill be back in a few minutes after she disconnected she told this information to madigan who grimaced hard hell then he asked you had any evidence suggesting hed become violent no dance explained that shed interviewed him then added but people like that keep a tight lid on their emotions something can push them over the edge real fast well madigan said urgently im pretty worried about something a half hour ago there were some postings on some of kayleighs fan sites anonymous but they were sites where edwin has posted in the past the posts were the same saying something to the effect of watch the news kayleigh maybe youll finally understand how much i love you john hinckley yep i remember what you told us in the first briefing that occasionally a stalker had a total break with reality and when he gave up hope that hed be with his love hed kill someone to cement himself in her thoughts forever heres the urls of those sites madigan handed her a sheet of yellowlined paper have computer crimes track em down and see where they were made from thanks chief no he said offering a wan smile thank you deputy she returned to the office and handed dennis harutyun the sheet of paper whats this he asked dance explained without mentioning madigans name about the threatening posts we need to trace them edwins name doesnt appear but thesere blogs and sites he posts to regularly whered you get the sites amelia sachs asked just some outside research but harutyun looked at the handwriting and frowned perhaps recognizing it and deducing the source was his ousted boss still he said nothing and called the offices computer crimes operation and ordered them to locate the posts and try to trace them crystal stanning went online and reviewed the posts oneil said it may not be him kayleigh has to have other obsessive fans we cant forget that but a moment later harutyuns phone hummed he looked down its computer crimes he took the call and listened for a moment okay thanks he disconnected and slipped the phone away the posting was from java hut harutyun said at fashion fair thats where edwin is right now maybe hes still there amelia sachs said and harutyun called dispatch to order deputies to the shopping center to find edwin he reminded them that he could be armed stanning asked hes thinking of a mass shooting at the mall sachs said that could be it but the typical stalker killing profile is more oneonone an assassination true dance said and its usually somebody famous so that hell get the attention of his object but whos the planned victim harutyun wondered aloud oneil continued to read the posts they dont mention anybody in particular dance joined him arm against arm and they stared at the posts there that one dance muttered pointing she read it aloud ive seen all your postings about kayleigh you claim you like her you claim you love her music but you use her like everybody does you stole leaving home to keep the hispanics happy your a fucking hypocrit lincoln rhyme asked you have any idea who hes talking about i know exactly who he means dance replied chapter itll be all right congressman peter simesky said davis didnt need reassurance he needed his family taken care of he called suze again and left another message for her to stay in the house with the kids there was possibly a little security problem stay put lock the door call me love you please have jessie find my wife peter ill do that sir but theres no indication that this sharp wants to hurt anybody but you besides i dont think theres any way he could get to la he was at a mall here in fresno this morning according to the police and everybodys looking for him he actually thinks im exploiting kayleigh using herwell and that song leaving homejust to increase your latino voter base thats bullshit ive been a huge supporter of hers all along ive been posting on her site and the blogs for a couple of years before she even wrote the song simesky reminded oh hes a psycho bill agent dance said he has no sense of reality she said he could be like hinckley could be jesus theyve got to find him if he cant kill me maybe hell just go on a rampage the men were in the coronado one of the nicer hotels in fresno and to davis it seemed plenty secure if you stayed away from the windows but daviss aides simesky and myra babbage and the police thought he should move to a more secure location if it wasnt for his familys safety davis would have been amused he was extremely unpopular in certain circles and had been threatened a number of times for his positions on various issues just mention relaxing immigration laws at a cocktail party and see what happens imagine the consequences when its a campaign position of a potential presidential candidate and yet here he was being threatened not by any rabid rightwingers but by a crazy guy who probably didnt even know what the word immigration meant a knock on the door davis stepped forward but the aide waved him back and called yes kathryn dance and deputy harutyun are here the campaign staff security man traveling with them a massive fellow named tim raymond called from outside simesky opened the door and the two entered the aide gave dance a smile davis had been amused at simeskys flirting earlier with dance at kayleigh townes house there was no reason why a single man who was witty and charming shouldnt turn his attentions toward an attractive single woman about his same age but at this meeting they were both pure business congressman peter dance said her green eyes quickly but calmly took in all the rooms presumably for security threats lingering briefly on the windows davis noted that she was now armed she hadnt been before this made him a bit more uneasy simesky asked where are we with all this what do we know dance said were still trying to find edwin michael oneila deputy from montereyand the others are back at the sheriffs office working on that hes vanished from the mall where he sent the website post his cars still there but he could have other wheels until we have a better idea where he is we want to get you to that safe house as soon as possible are you ready to leave now sure where is it harutyun said a place we use about a half hour north of here in the woods yes all right he grimaced i just dont want to be seen as running from this guy simesky said we go through this a lot bill people arent going to care theyd rather have a live candidate than a dead martyr i suppose davis thought of something kathryn dance was with a statewide agency so he said to her could you get police to my house in la im worried about my family of course ill call our office and have a cbi team there with tactical lapd we work with them a lot thank you he said feeling some relief tepid though it was he gave her the address and susans phone number dance made the call and then disconnected officers she said were en route davis was all the more impressed with her for her cool efficiency and decided that as peter had suggested shed be perfect in his administration then thank you lord his wife called honey the woman blurted jess came to the school whats going on are you all right yes yes davis explained the situation adding that there would be some police or troopers at the house in just a minute or two theres a little security thing probably nothing dont open the door for anybody but the police theyll be from the lapd and the california bureau of investigation what is it another threat from those isolationist idiots no this is just a crazy guy looks like were ninetynine percent sure hes not down there but i just want to make sure you and the kids are all right youre sounding too calm bill susan said i hate it when you sound that way it means youre not calm at all he laughed but she was right he was too calm dance tapped her wristwatch im fine ive got police here too i have to go ill call you in a bit love you oh honey he reluctantly disconnected simesky called daviss other aide myra babbage who was at the local campaign headquarters and told her to join them at the safe house then with dance and harutyun leading and tim raymond in the rear davis and simesky moved quickly through the hotel corridor and down into the garage where they climbed into a sheriffs office tahoe suv dance said to harutyun who was driving id say lights no sirens for two or three miles bust it really move and use side streets and alleys then flashers off and normal stream of traffic to the safe house sure thing you think hes nearby simesky asked looking out the windows uneasily hes invisible dance said cryptically we just dont know as the big vehicle accelerated fast the cbi agent gripped the hand rest and looked queasy davis reflected that if she did join his administration she would not do well on one of his speedboat outings on the other hand he sensed she and susan could become good friends ten minutes later when it seemed clear that edwin was not following they slowed and entered a highway after a half hour of driving the deputy turned down a deserted road drove for another mile or so and passing no houses along the way finally approached a fancy log cabin the onestory rambling brown structure was in the middle of a large cleared areagood visibility of the grounds should anyone try to assault the house and there were also davis could see only a few windows and all of them shuttered or shaded although he was perhaps more of a target than some politicians anyone whos run for office instinctively considers security particularly lines of fire and snipers vantage points everywhere all the time thank you second amendment chapter kathryn dance gratefully climbed out of the suv and inhaled the pleasant astringent smell of pine the nausea from the rocky drive persisted but was fading she watched harutyun approach the house and punch keys on a number pad and a green light came on he stepped inside and deactivated another security system then he turned some switches and lights clicked on revealing a functional interior with no personality whatsoever brown shag carpet that smelled of old automobile interiors stained photographs in cheap plastic frames mediterraneanstyle lamps and furniture with excessive scrolls a ski resort rental the ancient dodge smell was supplemented by that of musty upholstery mold and cooking fuel all that was needed to complete the kitsch was a mounted bear or elk head the place was big it appeared to have four or five bedrooms and several offices behind the living room and kitchen dance exchanged mobile numbers with tim raymond the security man who remained outside harutyun shut the door and locked it then the mustachioed detective walked through the house to make sure it was secure simesky accompanied him a few minutes later raymond called dance and told her that everything seemed fine along the perimeter dance looked around the austere facility and then at davis who now that his wife was protected seemed simply irritated that a security issue was taking time from his campaign and his congressional duties he confirmed this a moment later when he muttered that he was due to meet workers at another farm soon but that clearly wasnt going to happen hed have peter or myra cancel for him pisses me off i have to say he sat and rubbed his eyes with his knuckles then scrolled through his iphone simesky and harutyun returned all clear windows and doors secure and armed the deputy told them and passed out bottled water thanks davis drank one down dances phone hummed with an incoming email rather than read it on the small screen she opened her computer and went online she smiled at the header bird shit the message was from lincoln rhyme and had to do with some additional analysis of the trace outside edwins house finally managed to isolate the other trace in the ammonium oxalate they were phosphates and residue of animal matter its bird shit exactly what kind it is i cant say i didnt bring my bird shit recognition kit with me nor have i been able to gin up support for a bird shit genome project but i can say the excreting birds were most likely resident in a coastal region fish had been the mainstay of their diet for what its worth heres the whole list dont understand why nobody drinks in this department he included the entire evidence chart and dance read through it again amused to note that when someoneamelia sachs presumablyhad added the recent discovery shed been a bit more delicate in her description wednesday edwin sharps house outside boot print probably cowboystyle unable to determine size male or female no vehicle tread marks unique trace materials triglyceride fat lard k color temperature yellowish melting point degrees f specific gravity at c determined likely to be neatsfoot oil treatment for leather sports equipment tack and gunslings chemicals limonite goethite and calcite determined likely to be gangue ore collection and processing byproduct fungus determined likely to be used in place of chemicalbased fertilizers mineral oil with lime sulfur determined likely to be organic pesticide calcium powder determined likely to be human bone dust ammonium oxalate determined likely to be bird excrement probably from coastal area she read through the list several times more and then a to b to z dance closed her eyes and let her mind wander where it would then she went to the website theyd looked at earlier containing the threat to davis she scrolled through the posts harutyun asked anything helpful about where edwin might be maybe she answered absently lost in thought simesky sighed doesnt this guy know that if he killed the congressman hed get arrested and in this state probably end up on death row eyes still on her computer screen dance explained that doesnt matter to him not at all a glance at davis by killing you hes honoring her the congressman laughed sourly so basically im a sacrificial goat hes offering up to his goddess which described the situation pretty well dance reflected and returned to the browser chapter plan your acts and act your plan peter simeskys analytical mind continued to measure the actual milestones of his plan against the projected ones and he found it proceeding apace in general the events were in harmony with what he and myra babbage had been working on for the past ten months he now stood in a den behind the living room reviewing text messages on one of his many anonymous and untraceable accounts he peeked out into the living room where the irritatingly smart kathryn dance congressman davis and deputy dennis harutyun sat looking atthough probably not really watchingan old tv some game was on davis wasnt happy to be here but he didnt look particularly scared simesky turned and walked into the kitchen in the back of the safe house the plan whose goal was quite simple to eliminate the traitor to america congressman william garrett davis the politician who would sell the country out to people who didnt belong here who used it for their own gain who despised the red white and blue but were happy to rob this glorious nation blind how difficult it had been for simesky to feign admiration and undying devotion to davis and get a job on the staff then work his way into the mans inner circle he had however done a damn good job of it spending more hours than virtually anyone else on daviss team hed done whatever was necessary to ingratiate himself into the mans inner circle and gather as much information as he needed so they could stop the traitor whoif elected president as might very well happenwould ruin our great nation a little over a year ago when daviss popularity began to surge simesky was with a think tank based in texas with offices in washington new york chicago and la it was part of an informal association of wealthy businessmen in the midwest and south who ran companies and nonprofits and even a few universities this group of menand yes they were exclusively men and by the way whitehad no official name but informally and with some wry humor theyd adopted one which had been bestowed by some demonic liberal media blogger the journalist had referred to the cabal contemptuously as the keyholders because he reported the senior leaders believed they held the key to curing all of the nations woes the group loved it the keyholders funneled huge sums to candidates they thought would best uphold proper ideals to keep america strong reduced federal government limited taxation minimal participation in world geopolitics and most important the elimination of virtually all immigration curiously the keyholders had little patience for what they considered in their opinion unfocused and often simpleminded movements like the tea party the religious right and those railing against abortion and homosexuality no the main issues that mattered to the keyholders were the death of american selfreliance through socialism and the dilution of the purity of the nation through immigration leaders like bill davis would drive the country straight to bankruptcy and moral corruption generally the keyholders efforts involved financial support for candidates publicity misinformation campaigns against traitorous politicos and reporters personality smears and stings but sometimes more was needed and thats when peter simeskys obscure think tank would receive a call asking him to handle a particularly critical matter however he thought best however extreme the solution the keyholders knew that whatever the mission simesky would create an effective and careful plan so it was obvious that the death of this muckraking liberal journalist had to be an accident or of that environment activist was a suicide or of that reformer congressman was an assassination spawned by a stalkers love for a famous singer and those clever plans often involved a fall guy hello edwin using the stalker came to mind last winter after he and myra babbagehis business partner and occasional loverhad infiltrated daviss ranks doing his typically exhaustive research peter simesky had learned that davis was a huge fan of kayleigh towne the congressman had used the bitchs proimmigration song leaving home at rallies and in campaign ads simesky reviewed kayleighs websites and learned of a fanatical fan named edwin sharp who posted hundreds of comments about the singer and was described by other fans as a weirdo perfect the keyholders had quite some significant resources and it took only a day to get into the internet service providers handling kayleigh townes and edwins email accounts unfortunately there didnt seem to be anything particularly threatening about edwins letters and posts but he was clearly unhinged and troublingly persistent and that would be enough for simeskys plan he and myra sent edwin emails and letters posing as kayleigh reporting that she was flattered by his attention and even suggesting that shed like to get together with him but she had to be careful put on a facade of indifference or her father would cause terrible problems delete all the emails burn my letters you have to edwin im totally afraid of my father the notes suggested that whatever she said in public shed enjoy seeing him at the concert on friday if possible shed see him later too in private edwin i was thinking about you last night you know girls have those kinds of thoughts too myra babbage had come up with those lines and edwin had done just what theyd wanted descended on fresno in all his psychotic glory far more of a nut job than theyd hoped he and myra babbage had conducted surveillance at edwins rental in fresno to learn his routine and steal some evidence that could be planted at the site of daviss assassination to implicate the stalker then today it was time to act myra had called edwin pretending to work for kayleigh she explained the singer had decided she wanted to see him but they had to be very careful he should go to the fashion fair shopping mall and lose the police then wait at macys loading dock myra had cruised past and waved the poor fool had jumped into the stolen suv grinning in anticipation when he turned to put his seat belt on shed hit him with the stun gun injected a sedative and taped him up shed then gone into the mall and uploaded the announcement from java hut that someone was about to do something that would make kayleigh remember him forever the context made clear that bill davis was to be the victim and now myra and a barely conscious edwin sharp were en route to the safe house in a few minutes the plan would be completed myra would arrive smile at the security man tim raymond and then blow him away with her pistol at the same time simesky would step into the living room and shoot the congressman and the others then he and myra would drag edwin into the room shoot him in the head with harutyuns gun and dust the stalkers hand with gunshot residue simesky would make a panicked call begging for help and an ambulance explaining that hed gotten the gun away from the stalker and shot the psycho himself plan your acts and act your plans but sometimes there were variations kathryn dance her appearance could help smooth over one matter hed been worried aboutthat there might be some suspicion if only he and myra were left alive if dance survived too the scene would seem a bit more legitimate though hed have to orchestrate it so that of course she couldnt see him as the shooter simesky would shoot dance in the back paralyzing but not killing her then hed murder davis and harutyun after they were dead simesky would call out something like edwin no what are you doing ideally dance would be conscious and shed hear his cry shed later report the story to the police confirming that edwin was the sole shooter if not and she died well no huge loss after all simesky thought angrily you couldve gone out to dinner with me bitch what would itve hurt chapter simesky glanced at his rolex three minutes to go myra babbage would be heading toward the safe house now moving up the drive easing closer to the living room simesky couldnt detect the sound of the tires because of the thick walls but over the noise of the game on tv he could hear dance saying whats that you hear something a car i think so wait no im not sure the voice was daviss two shots in kathryns spine two in harutyuns head two in daviss what should simesky shout my god its him that stalker was that credible maybe edwin jesus no in the living room daviss phone trilled hello hi yeah were inside then to the others its myra she just got here harutyun said you know we didnt tell her to make sure she wasnt being followed simesky thought he heard dance say something to the effect that edwin did a lot of research but it would be pretty unlikely that he even knew who myra was let alone been able to find and follow her ah if you only knew one minute according to the rolex dance was saying no congressman please stay back from the window we know who it is still lets just be on the safe side out of sight in the den simesky pulled on latex gloves opened his computer bag and removed the pistol a cold onestolen that was one thing about this great country if you wanted an untraceable gun you could get one real easy he knew it was loaded and he knew exactly how it worked and hed already fired it a dozen times to extract some gsr gunshot residue now in a baggie which hed plant on edwins hands but he checked the weapon again two shots then two then two peter the congressman called from the living room simesky replied be there in a sec anybody want coffee no thanks davis said absently myras here good kathryn dennis coffee they both declined simesky slipped closer to the doorway to the living room pressing his back against the adjoining wall staying well out of sight waiting for myras gunshots killing raymond harutyun said we had a real president stay here once hed come for a conference with the governor had to sign something so i wouldnt tell who it was can we play twenty questions to find out dance asked the detective laughed davis said i was at camp david last week its not as fancy as youd think would those be his last words and what was edwin sharp thinking as he was enduring though probably not enjoying his final moments on earth hey look the game davis said triple play the volume on the tv went up spectators roared a glance at the rolex right about now myra would shoot simesky would step into the doorway and do the same two then two and two more edwin no my god he wiped his hand on his slacks and took the pistol again now but no shots sounded another minute passed silence except for the televised crowd and baseball game announcer on the tv what was going on sweat on simeskys brow and then at last gunfire from outside a half dozen shots the snapping clatter of a firefight small arms shit simesky thought whats this about he considered his plan and how the rattle of weapons might fit into it had there been another deputy on the scene whod gotten here earlier or had a local cop happened by and noticed a woman with a weapon or a hogtied edwin sharp now all was silent act your plan simesky thinking sometimes you couldnt though sometimes you needed to improvise but to do that you needed facts only there were no facts he decided to go ahead anyway the three in the room would be focused on what was happening outside the windows staying down staying silent two two and two kill raymond when he walked inside if he was still alive then clean up as best he could too bad about myra he assumed she was gone but there were larger issues at stake simesky gripped the gun firmly slipped the safety lever forward and took a deep breath he turned fast and stepped through the arched doorway into the living room aiming at where harutyun and dance had beenthe most immediate threats he was adding poundage to the trigger when he froze the room was empty the alarm pad was blinking green someone had disarmed the system so davis dance and harutyun could leave silently what the hell was this he walked further into the room and then he saw the side window was up thats how theyd escaped simesky noticed too in the middle of the floor a pad of yellow paper on it was scrawled a message plot against your life simesky involved myra too maybe others we leave now side window now oh no who he thought but then realized why even ask kathryn dance of course a fucking liberal soccer mom from a small town had outthought him and the keyholders how shed done this was beyond a mystery to him but she had shed probably texted for backup and alerted raymond whod fired on myra when she got out of the car and presented a threat and could he heard a mans voice from behind him dennis harutyuns simesky drop the weapon and raise your hands over your head the deputy would have snuck through the back door dance probably was covering the front simesky assessed the situation he reflected that harutyun was a true rube hed probably never fired his weapon in the line of duty simesky on the other hand had killed eight people in his life and gone to bed each night afterward with a clear conscience he glanced back what are you talking about im just trying to protect the congressman from that killer i heard gunshots i havent done anything are you crazy im not going to tell you again drop the weapon simesky was thinking i have my cayman islands account i have any one of the keyholders private jets at my disposal just fight your way out turn and shoot hell be totally freaked out hell panic fucking smalltown cop simesky started to turn keeping the gun low unthreatening i just he heard a stunning bang felt a burn in his chest the sensations were repeated a moment later but both the sound of the second explosion and the tap on his skin were much softer than the first chapter both dead thats right harutyun told sheriff anita gonzalez ten people were in her office at the fmcso which made it pretty cramped p k madigan was back though still unofficially because it had after all been his information that had led to uncovering the plot also present was a public affairs officer from the county dance noted that harutyun seemed infinitely pleased at thissomebody else to handle the press conference which was going to be big very big lincoln rhyme thom reston and amelia sachs were here too along with michael oneil and tim raymond the congressmans own security man in the interest of safety congressman davis was onboard his private jet heading back to los angeles anita gonzalez asked any other perps working with simesky and babbage dance replied im sure there are but they arewell werethe only active participants on the scene so far our office and amy grabe the fbis agent in charge in san francisco are tracing associates and connections michael oneil said there seems to be some affiliation with that outfit they call the keyholders some political action group political action hell theyre assholes madigan muttered digging into his ice cream wackos lincoln rhyme said but rich and wellconnected wackos did either of them say anything before they died gonzalez asked tim raymond said no myra was walking toward me when i got the text from agent dance to treat her like a hostile he shrugged matteroffactly i lifted my weapon when she was about thirty feet away she was hiding a fortyfive under her coat and she engaged afraid i couldnt take any chances he was shaken but not dance assessed from the shootout rather by the fact that hed missed the threat posed by the assassinswho had also been masquerading as his friends and coworkers harutyun said and simesky didnt seem to believe me when i said im not telling you again he was as calm as ever displaying no effects whatsoever from killing the congressmans aide and edwin the sheriff asked we found him in the back of the suv myra stole the stun gun that she used was pretty powerful and hes doped up but the medics said hes fine howd you figure it out kathryn madigan asked it wasnt just me she nodded toward lincoln rhyme and amelia sachs the criminalist said offhandedly combination of things your man charlie by the way is pretty good dont let him come visit me in new york i might steal him away hes done that before thom reston said earning a raised eyebrow from rhyme which told dance that he was quite serious about offering shean a job since the criminalist wasnt explaining his contribution further dance did there were some questions raised about what charlies crime scene people found at the convention center and behind edwins house where he claimed somebodyd been spying on him yeah edwin told me madigan said with a grim visage and i didnt believe him dance continued one was bird droppings from seagulls rhyme corrected the actual phrase was shit from quote birds most likely resident in a coastal region not indigenous mind you i had no idea where they came from or where they were going my only point was that the birds in question probably spent time recently on the coast dining on oceanic fish and then we also identified some oil and fungus used in organic farming a nod toward sachs she has a pretty decent garden by the way i dont get the point of flowers myself but the tomatoes she grows are quite good dance elaborated i remembered that congressman davis simesky and babbage had been in monterey campaigning which is on the coast where they mightve picked up the birddo trace and theyd been stumping in ecofriendly organic farms from watsonville to the valley here but whyd you get suspicious enough to consider that maybe edwin wasnt the killer in the first place madigan asked dance laughed bird shit again in a way see in the header lincoln wrote just that bird shit but in the evidence chart he sent me he used the word excrement that was sachs rhyme grumbled well that made me think of the website post threatening the congressman i realized it just didnt sound like edwin the kinesics of language oneil said exactly she showed them the post that had raised some alarms ive seen all your postings about kayleigh you claim you like her you claim you love her music but you use her like everybody does you stole leaving home to keep the hispanics happy your a fucking hypocrit thats not edwins tone ive never heard him say or write an expletive and therere grammatical mistakes commas that werent necessary and the misspelling of hypocrite and youre which he never did in his emails to kayleigh oh and in his emails when he referred to one of her songs he put the title in quotation marks in the post that threatened congressman davis the title wasnt set off at all it struck me that it could have been written by somebody who thought thats what a crazy stalker would post then there were some questions that came up during my interview with edwin she explained about using contentbased analysis in looking at what edwin had said rather than kinesics and body language since i couldnt use traditional kinesic analysis i looked at the facts he was telling me and some of them were inconsistent like the number of letters and emails edwin received from kayleigh she and her lawyers said edwin was sent a half dozen repliesall form emails or snailmail letters but in the interview edwin told me hed received more than that and he suggested to pike that hed found them very encouraging i thought at first that was a product of his problems with reality awareness but then i realized this was different see stalkers may misinterpret the implications of facts but theyll know what those facts are however edwin misconstrued kayleighs message in the letters hed know for certain exactly how many letters he received did that mean somebody else posing as kayleigh had been sending him emails and letters and thenshe delivered this with a wry smile at michael oneili wondered why was peter simesky so interested in me he said the congressman wanted to bring me on board and maybe he did but i think simesky put that in daviss head it gave simesky a chance to see how we were coming with the investigation and what we knew myra also seemed very interested in who i worked for and the two of them and davis had flown into san francisco the other day they mightve bought the prepaid mobiles in burlingame then its near the airport madigan muttered so they killed bobby and the file sharer to establish the pattern of edwins guilt as tough as it is to consider that dance said yeah i think thats the only reason they died she glanced rhymes way after i got your text in the safe house about the bird excrement i got suspicious about people close to davis i emailed my associate tj scanlon to run deep background checks on everyone on daviss staff everybody was cleanbut simesky and myra were too clean they were perfect models of political aides textbook and theyd joined the campaign on the same day and it was impossible to find out anything about them before they joined tj thought that was odd and kept digging and found some connection with the keyholders groupwho were on record as condemning many of daviss positions but were especially vehement about his stand on easier immigration i decided to play it safe and we got out through the side window of the safe house just as myra arrived and engaged tim a nod toward raymond we know what happened next p k madigan pointed his spoon at the man in the wheelchair you sure you dont want any ice cream not my vice of choice the criminalist said crystal stanning walked into the sheriffs office we just found the good samaritan who madigan asked in blunt impatience apparently forgetting he was a civilian the woman who gave edwin directions when he got lost ah alibi woman edwin was right it was at the same time sheri towne was attacked and she positively identified him madigan sighed well we got this one wrong boys and girls get sharp in here i for one am going to apologize a moment later edwin was escorted into the office and he looked around a little bewildered his hair was askew he seemed a bit dizzy though he was fascinated with rhyme and the wheelchair gonzalez explained what had happenedwhich included the revelation that most of the emails hed received from kayleigh were fake not from her at all dance noted his face fall she didnt send them thick silence for a moment and dance said she sent a few but im sorry edwin the ones actually from her were just form letters like she sent to everybody edwin slipped his hands into his jeans pockets i never wouldve gotten so you know funny about her if i knew think about it somebody as pretty and talented and famous as her tells you shes interested in you that you mean a lot to her what was i supposed to think i understand edwin dance said kindly madigan said im sorry too son edwin said nothing for a moment eyes again on the wheelchair so im not a suspect or anything nope harutyun said he nodded and then focused on madigan well then i dont have much interest in that complaint i made against you detective and deputy lopez i was just doing what i needed to it was like selfdefense you understand i do and thats good of you edwin fact is when it comes to kayleigh we all get a little overly enthusiastic id kind of like to leave now is that okay sure is son well get a statement from you later or tomorrow about what happened with simesky and the womanthe kidnapping ill have somebody get you home now youre in no shape to drive you can pick up your car tomorrow thanks detective shoulders down chest collapsed he headed out the door despite the fact he was hard to read kinesically dance could see genuine sorrow in his posture chapter in the service area of the sheriffs office lincoln rhyme aimed for the ramp leading outside he was accompanied by his new york companions as well as kathryn dance and michael oneil time for a drink id say then back to san jose time for coffee in the van thom corrected his boss im not driving rhyme replied acerbically i can drink but his aide countered fast im sure its illegal to have open containers of liquor in a moving vehicle even if youre not driving its not open rhyme snapped my tumbler has a lid on it the aide said thoughtfully we could of course stay here talking but that just means well get to the bar in san jose that much later rhyme scoffed but the expression vanished as he said goodbye to the law enforcers and with a smooth gesture lifted his working right arm to dance and gripped her hand she kissed his cheek then embraced sachs oneil added ill see you both sunday im bringing the kids over he glanced at sachs youre interested we just got the new h k mp the little bullet right smaller than a bb seventeencaliber you want to come out to the range and put some holes in paper on monday you bet i do sachs said enthusiastically kathryn oneil asked ill pass i think ill hang out with lincoln and thom and with jon boling too she wondered then stepped on that thought the trio from new york headed out the door oneil too said goodbye to the locals and dance walked with him outside into the sultry air you in a hurry to get back she found herself asking hadnt planned it she was thinking they might have dinner just the two of them a pause she could tell he too wanted to stay but then he shook his head thing is annes driving down from san francisco picking up some things i ought to be there he looked away and the papersll be ready tomorrow the settlement agreement so soon she didnt want much also a woman who cheats on her husband and abandons her children probably isnt in much of a position to demand much dance reflected you doing okay one of those pointless questions thats usually more about the asker than the askee relieved sad pissed off worried about the kids as lengthy a discussion of his emotional health as shed ever heard from michael oneil silence for a moment then he gave a smile okay better go but before he turned dance found herself impulsively reaching up one hand behind his neck her arm around his back and pulling him close she kissed him hard on the mouth she thought no no what the hell are you doing step back yet by then his arms were enveloping her completely and he was kissing her back just as firmly then finally he eased away came in for one more kiss and she gripped him even harder and then stood back she expected an oblique glancehis waiting statebut oneil stared easily into her eyes and she looked back just as comfortably their smiles matched brother what have i done now kissed the man i truly love she thought and that unexpected thought was more stunning than the contact itself then he was in the car ill call you when i get back see you on sunday drive carefully she said a phrase that had set her on edge when her parents would tell teenage kathryn the same as if oh right i was going to drive off the road until you reminded me but as a woman whod lost one husband to the highway it was a sentence she could not stop herself from uttering occasionally he closed the door glanced at her again and lifted his left palm to the inside windshield and she pressed her right to the glass outside he put the car in gear and pulled out of the lot if that dont beat all bishop towne said sipping his milk right dance said to him and his daughter on the front porch of his house edwin was innocent didnt kill a soul totally set up hes still a shit daddy hes a little fucking shit and i wouldnt mind if he went to jail for something but its good to know hes not going to be a problem anymore the grizzled musician squinted at dance hes not is he i dont think so hes mostly sad that kayleigh didnt send him those personal emails and letters the ones simesky made up we should sue those bastards bishop said the keyholders the fuck are they about daddy really come on kayleigh nodded toward the kitchen where suellyn and marygordon were helping sheri bake something fragrant with vanilla but the mans raspy voice probably hadnt carried inside kayleigh said im not going to sue anybody daddy we dont need that kind of publicity well were going to get publicity whether we want it or not ill talk to sher about spinning it then he patted his daughter on the shoulder hey lookit the good news kt the bad guysre dead and edwins out of the picture so no more talk about canceling any concerts speaking of that ive been working on the song order again and i think weve got to move leaving home everybody wants it encored be best and id get the kids choir to sing the last part in spanish dance was aware that kayleighs shoulders had risen in tension at these comments clearly she herself still wasnt so sure about the concert just because the killers had been stopped and edwin absolved didnt mean she was in the mental state necessary to put on a show in the shadow of the recent crimes and then dance noticed the young womans posture collapse subtly which meant surrender sure daddy sure the tone of the evening had changed quickly but oblivious to it bishop towne rose like a buffalo climbing out of a stream hed just forded and ambled inside hey mg whatcha baking kayleigh looked after him grimfaced dance used the opportunity to fish into her purse and hand her the sealed envelope that contained bobbys intheeventof letter and a copy of the adoption papers the singer weighed it in her hand dance said softly that turned up in the investigation im the only one who knows you handle it however you want what youll see the woman stared down at the slim envelope clutching it as if it weighed ten pounds dance realized that she knew what it contained you have to understand i just dance hugged her its not my business she whispered now im going to get back to the motel ive got a report to dictate kayleigh slipped the envelope into her pocket thanked dance for all shed done and went into the house dance walked down to her suv she happened to glance back into the house and could see a bit of the kitchen suellyn and sheri at the island looking at a cookbook kayleigh scooted up onto a stool nearby lifted marygordon to her lap no kinesic analysis was necessary to tell from the girls amused squirming that the embrace was particularly strong driving down the lengthy dim driveway dance was thinking not of the towne clan but of the potential train wreck her personal life might be headed for she thought back to kissing oneil and felt a twisting in her bellyradiating a perfect balance of joy and alarm she scrolled through her ipod playlist on the suvs entertainment screen to find the song that had just come to mind one of kayleighs not surprisingly is it love is it less the lyrics rolled out through the pathfinders resonant sound system is it left is it right is it east is it west is it day is it night is it good or the best im looking for answers im looking for clues there has to be something to tell me the truth im trying to know but i can just guess is it love between us is it love is it less thursday thursday chapter gracias señora dance de nada in the garage of jose villalobos dance clicked off the digital recorder and began to pack away the cables and the microphones shed spent the day not as a law enforcement agent but as a recording engineer and producer and los trabajadores had just finished the last tunea son huasteco in the traditional style of music from northeastern mexico featuring a resonant eightstringed instrument like a guitar a jarana and a fiddle the violinist a wiry fortyyearold originally from juarez had played up a storm even slipping into stéphane grappelli hot club de france improvs dance had been delighted at the bizarre captivating journey of the music and had to force herself to keep from clapping time to the speedy infectious tunes now just after pm she shared tecates with the band and then wandered back to the pathfinder her phone hummed and she saw madigans text asking if she would come in and review the transcript of her report about the peter simeskymyra babbage case which shed dictated last night she debated a momentshe was exhaustedbut decided to get it over with scrolling through her iphone she saw a missed call too jon boling she debated again about the san diego situation as shed taken to calling it and the first thing in her thoughts was the kiss with michael oneil i cant call jon her mind told her as her finger hit redial a trill of numbers then voicemail disappointed angry and relieved she disconnected without leaving a message thinking that would be a good title for a kayleigh towne song straight to voicemail a half hour later she arrived at the sheriffs office she was now an official honorary deputy and she strode past the desk sergeant and security without any challenges several law enforcers she hadnt met waved friendly greetings to her she stepped into madigans office the chief detective had been officially reinstated edwin had dropped the charges dont you ever do sprinkles she asked sitting down on the battered couch eyeing the cardboard cup he was enthusiastically excavating what madigan asked on your ice cream or whipped cream or syrup naw its a waste of taste calories too like cones ill give you my theory of ice cream sometime its philosophical you ever make it make ice cream right she said the world is divided into people who make ice cream and yogurt and pasta and bread and those who buy it im a buyer im with you there thiss yours he produced another cup chocolate chip a metal spoon too no i you say no too quick deputy madigan grumbled you want some ice cream i know you do true she took it and ate several big mouthfuls it was nice and melty good course its good its ice cream theres the statement you want to take a looksee and let me know what you think he slid the papers toward her and she read crystal stanning had transcribed it from dances tape and it was pretty accurate she expanded on a thought or two then slid it back even at this hour the san joaquin valley heat permeated the building hell im going to macys pick up a onepiece and float in the mountain view pool until i wrinkle dance stretched and stood up about to say good night to the detective when his desk phone rang and he hit speaker yeah dance finished the ice cream thought about asking for some more but decided against it course its good its ice cream hey chief its miguel lopez you worked for me for four years i know your voice the man snapped examining the volcano core of his own cup maybe tallying up how many bites he had left what something kind of funny you gonna tell me what or just let that hang you listen to kdht the radio sometimes get to the point whats your point the deputy said well okay i was listening on my way home and theres a callin show bevo in the evening lopez okay so hes the dj and they do requests what happens about five minutes ago is some listener requests a song i mean part of a song one of kayleighs dance froze she sat down madigan barked and the request was in an email signed a kayleigh fan it was for your shadow the last verse only the dj thought it was kind of funny just the one verse and played the whole song but i got to thinking oh christ dance whispered nobody ever played the fourth verseto announce congressman daviss killing she thought of lincoln rhymes comment and hes smart right he started with phones to keep you busy then switched to other ways to play the song like radio callin requests shit madigan was nodding he asked lopez if the email had said anything else no just that madigan disconnected without saying goodbye he immediately called the station and got put through to the studio told bevo it was police business and asked that the email be forwarded to him as they waited he muttered and hell you know were still looking for the connection between simesky and myra babbage and the other killingsbobby and blanton that file sharer the attack on sheri towne but nobodys found anything yet a moment later a flag popped up on his computer screen the email request to the studio from a cryptic account of random letters and numbers was nothing more than what lopez had already told them madigan called the computer crimes division and forwarded it a few minutes later they learned that it was an anonymous free email account and had been sent from a hotel in the tower district lets get the list of guests staying there madigan said but dance frowned wont do us any good he wont be a guest he wouldve just picked up the wireless signal in the lobby or even from the parking lot probably hes got some connection with the area but not the hotel you think that the assassination plot was just a coincidence and there really is a stalker well we know it cant be edwin he has an alibi and it doesnt need to be a stalker it could be anybody trying to frame edwin to cover up the attacksof bobby the file sharer or sheri towne she shook her head or maybe those were just to establish a pattern and the real intended victims next on his list shit howd we miss this but whos the new vic whats the fourth verse dance recited you cant keep down smiles happiness floats but trouble can find us in the heart of our homes life never seems to go quite right you cant watch your back from morning to night madigan sighed kill somebody in their home thats like the other verse about the roadnot very fucking helpful theres the reference to floating another river pool some other body of water i dont have a clue weve got a dozen lakes around here nothing big close to town though hundreds of miles of riverbanks and must be a thousand pools more okay maybe theres some connection with the tower district but weve got to narrow it down more dance thought for a moment you know there was some physical evidence that charlies people found that we never really looked at because we had enough to figure out what simesky and myra were up to madigan called charlie shean at csu had a conversation with him and jotted notes after hanging up he said what wasnt accounted for was gangue industrial byproduct stuff or whatever it is never heard of that before human bone dust too and marlboros did simesky or myra smoke i never saw them the chief glanced at his notes also the boot print with the really sharp toe and some neatsfoot oilleather treatment for baseball gloves maybe the dearly departed peter simesky played on a fascist softball league a to b to z dance cocked her head thats not all its used for chapter finally kayleigh towne was back in her own house her sanctuary if only for a few hours alicia had texted that she wanted to see her about some matters having to do with the concert but she didnt want to meet her at bishops house i hear you there sister and when alicia suggested they meet at kayleighs she readily agreed darthur morgan had driven her back here and then hed collected his own car and said goodbye tell you maam been real good working with you still maam after all weve been through thats right kayleigh maam and hed cracked what she believed was his first smile she laughed and hugged him which he responded to stiffly but with good humor then hed driven away and kayleigh was alone but the relief she felt because edwin wasnt really a dangerous stalker was fading and ill ease seeped in to replace itwhich had nothing to do with the events of the past few days and those horrible people using her as an excuse to kill the congressman no it was a discomfort that struck closer to home hey lookit the good news kt the bad guysre dead and edwins out of the picture so no more talk about canceling any concerts why hadnt she said no to her father just insisted that they cancel didnt he get that danger wasnt the reason she didnt want to go ahead with the concert it wasnt even that bobby was dead that sherid nearly died she just plain and simple didnt want to get up onstage im not superwoman daddy your goals arent my goals why was he so oblivious to that the whole industry was a huge bulldozer pushing forward forward and if somebody got crushedbobbys life kayleighs joyso what it was unstoppable no of course bishop towne didnt get that all he got was that kayleigh had to make money had to feed her staff and family had to feed the voracious fans had to keep the record label and promoters happy and she suspected keep the memory of bishop towne aliveeven among younger people whod never heard him sing hell never heard of him at all and screw his daughters own peace of mind screw what mattered most to her just having a simple life hm she reflected a simple life not a bad song title she wrote it down a few other phrases then she glanced at her watch alicia wasnt due for another half hour kayleigh walked upstairs to her bedroom through her mind went a verse from the now infamous your shadow you sit by the river wondering what you got wrong how many chances youve missed all along like your troubles had somehow turned you to stone and the water was whispering why dont you come home oh what a time that had been just sixteen missing her mother so terribly missing her baby her father just out of jail for the car accident pressuring her to appear at some of his shows and launch her own career which she wasnt even sure she wanted overwhelmed depressed shed driven to yosemite by herself gone hiking and suddenly everything was too much for her shed looked down at the clear river and walked into it on impulse no plans not really intending to hurt herselfor maybe she had been kayleigh didnt know then and she didnt know now a minute later another hiker had plucked her out and sped her to the hospital she was in danger more of hypothermia than drowning but not even much threat of that now kayleigh sat on the bed and read once more the copy of bobbys letter which expressed his desire that most everything he had go to marygordon a few things to kayleigh she didnt know if this was legal as a will but if she took it to a lawyer she supposed the news would become public about marygordons parentage bishop would explode and the fans would they desert her kayleigh could honestly say that she didnt much care about either of those happening not in her present frame of mind but there was also a chance that the girl herself would find out shed have to learn at some point of course but not now at this age suellyn was her mother and roberto her father kayleigh would never think about disrupting the girls life she slipped the envelope away in her top dresser drawer shed work out something to make sure the girl received what her biological father wanted her to have yes it was too late for kayleigh when it came to bobby and marygordon but it wasnt too late for the life she dreamed of find a man get married have lots of other babies play music on the front porcha few concerts now and then of course there was that little part about finding a man since bobby thered been no one she felt really intense about shed been only sixteen then but she decided that the yardstick of love at that age was the best standard you could have the purest the most honest the least complicated a single note in her minds ear a c sharp followed by five other notes and they carried a phrase how i felt at sixteen she sang it good meter and there was a lot that rhymed with sixteen that was a key consideration in writing music what rhymed with what orange for instance was not a word you ended lyric lines with silver was tricky too though kayleighd managed to work it into one of the songs on her recent album she sat down at the dressing table she used for her desk here in the bedroom she pulled out a yellow pad and a few sheets of music staff paper in three minutes shed written the melody and a number of phrases and portions of the song i still recall how i felt at sixteen you were a king and i was your queen love was so simple way back when i wish life could be like that again when i was sixteen oh bobby kayleigh cried for a full five minutes then grabbed some more tissues and dried her face shed used nearly two whole boxes this week okay enough of that she cranked up the bose ipod player tapped the loretta lynn playlist in the bathroom she filled the bathtub pinned her hair up and stripped then sank into the deep water listening to the album it felt wonderful chapter they had their answer dance dennis harutyun and pike madigan were in the tiny apartment of alicia sessions and they were surveying the evidence theyd just uncovered cowboy boots with needlesharp toes like those that made the prints behind edwins house and in the kitchen was neatsfoot oil for treating alicias equestrian tack dance recalled her quarter horse bumper sticker and her love of riding they found cartons of marlboros in her apartment the dwelling also was in the tower district near the hotel from which the email request for the fourth song had been sent but far more incriminating were the two garbage bags full of edwin sharps trash stolen from his house in fresno including receipts and some mail addressed to him in seattleto plant at kayleighs to convince the police and jury that edwin was the one behind the attacks and that he had killed kayleigh and hidden under alicias bed was deputy gabriel fuentess pistol casewithout the weaponstolen from near the theater when the cop was tailing edwin alicia knew where gabriel was dance had reminded them she was in the briefing at headquarters at first theyd been unable to come up with a motive for setting up edwin sharp but a moment ago dance had learned the answer to madigan and harutyun she was displaying two dozen sheets of paper all pretty much the sameattempts to forge kayleighs handwriting on a note that read to who it may concern just want to say a few things to the people close to me if anything happens to me on the road cant help but thinking about patsy cline in that airplane well if anything does id like alicia to take over as front for the band she knows the songs as good as me and can hit those high notes better and one more thing i want you to have one hell of a party and make sure she sings im in the mood for rock n roll which she inspired me to write i see you in heaven luv you all kayleigh jesus madigan muttered kayleighs the fourth victim the last verse trouble can find us in the heart of our homes alicias going to kill her in her house dance ripped her phone from the holster and punched in the singers number i should write a song about things like this kayleigh thought thoroughly enjoying the bath the soundtrack of loretta lynn the violet scent of the candle shed lit the small pleasures she sang no the little pleasures scans better the extra syllable helped it would be about how the tragedies in life the things we cant control are often diminished if not cancelled by the small things an antidote to pain nice line she thought nobodyd ever used antidote in a song that she knew of good but then wait hold on you dont have to write a song every five minutes but she didnt actually write them she never did that was the secret they wrote themselves in the other room she heard her phone ringing kayleigh debated ignore it four rings then voicemail i love the summer rain its an antidote to pain hm she thought wryly awful just because some lines come fast doesnt mean theyre any good but part of being a pro is knowing what sucks and what doesnt shed work on it then hearing the mobile trill again she thought of marygordon was suellyn calling because she was sick did she want kayleigh to bring a special toy from the house concern for the little girl was what prodded kayleigh out of the tub she dried off and dressed fast in jeans and a blouse pulled on socks and her glasses maybe it was alicia calling back what exactly did she want to talk to her about out of bishops hearing could be anything she decided the assistant and bishop had never really gotten along her father liked women who fawned alicia did what she was supposed to for himhe was the head of the companybut there was always some tension between them because she would not kowtow to the big man she picked up the phone ah kathryns number she hit the callback button as it rang she glanced out the window it was dark now but she made out alicias blue pickup truck sitting in the drive kayleigh hadnt heard her arrive but she could let herself in she had a key dances phone clicked kayleigh started to say hey howre but the agent said urgently kayleigh listen to me i dont have time to go into the details alicia sessions on her way there shes going to kill you get out of the house now what just get out downstairs the kitchen door opened and alicia called out hey kayleigh its me you decent through her phone kathryn dance heard kayleighs voice catch then she whispered shes here shes downstairs alicia oh no how to handle it dance harutyun and madigan were in the fmcso cruiser speeding away from alicias apartment in the tower district dance told the men that alicia was already at kayleighs house and then said into the phone is darthur there no hes gone we thought it was all over with with simesky dead get out can you run into the woods i no im upstairs i dont think i can jump and id have to go past her if i went downstairs can i talk to her why does she no you have to hide stay away she has a gun well have troopers there as soon as we can but itll be twenty minutes are you in a room with a lock my bedroom yes but its not much what about a weapon my guns downstairs locked up just barricade yourself in the room and stall oh jesus kathryn whats going on barricade yourself as best you can well be there soon the siren spread outward on the hot dry air and the urgent blue and white lights ricocheted off cars and signs and windows as they raced through the evening kayleigh alicia called again from downstairs where was she kayleigh wondered still in the kitchen the den down in a minute she stared at the door close it girl whats the matter with you buy time lock it barricade it at the door she called just out of the shower ill be down in five she closed and locked the door but the chair she tried to wedge under the knob was too low her dresser was too heavy to move the vanity table wouldnt stop marygordon find a weapon anything a nail file a lamp dont be an idiot jump she ran to the window below her was not only concrete but a wroughtiron fence if she didnt break her back shed be impaled listening at the door again ear against the wood kayleigh be down soon have a beer or make some coffee jump out the window its your only chance then kayleigh thought suddenly no fucking way im fighting she grabbed the vanity stool and ripped off the laura ashley padded covering the furniture was five pounds of hard wood not much but it would have to do ill lure her up here and bash her head in kayleigh moved to the door listening she took a firm stance gripping the stool like a baseball bat then her phone rang squinting at the screen the number was vaguely familiar wait it was edwin sharps she recalled the number from the label of the redwood tree toy hed helped marygordon pick out hello edwin he said tentatively hey kayleigh listen im almost there alicia asked me not to call you just to come over but i dont know whats this all about is it some kind of settlement thing i dont want anything from you it wasnt your fault what that guy with the congressman did and with a heartshaking jolt kayleigh understood for whatever reason alicia had set up edwin shed asked him here too and was going to make it look like he killed her oh edwin theres a problem you sound funny whats the matter i mean stay away alicias here shes going to kill me she wants to a pause youre not like serious shes setting you up shes here now ill call the police she said i did theyre on their way im five minutes away no edwin dont come here go to bradley road the minimart stay there stay with people that way nobody can blame you for whatever happens it was then that kayleigh smelled smoke edwin was saying something she ignored him and turned her ear toward the door yes the crackle of flames was coming from downstairs no no my house my guitars shes burning them like bobby and the file sharer and sheri shes going to burn me too kayleigh kayleigh edwins voice rose from her phone theres a fire edwin call the fire department too but dont come here whatever you do i she disconnected and the bitter stinging smoke began to seep under the bedroom door chapter the smoke and flames were growing love is fire love is flame my house my house kayleigh thought as tears of sorrow of pain from the smoke of fear rolled down her cheeks my guitars my pictures oh this cant be happening the door was hot to the touch now and outside the window reflections of the flames from downstairs flickered across trees and the lawn kayleigh debated where was alicia she couldnt stay downstairs in the flames of course shed probably left well fuck her im saving my house kayleigh ran into the bathroom and grabbed a fire extinguisher years old but according to the gauge still charged she unlocked the bedroom door and eased it open the fire was concentrated in the hallway on the ground floor and on the stairs themselves the carpeting it gave off thick clouds of astringent smoke from the flaming nylon sparks zipped through the air kayleigh caught a full breath of the foul stench and retched she lowered her head and got a breath of more or less clean air another she stood the fire wasnt out of control yet if alicia had left she could put out enough of it to get to the kitchen where there was a much bigger extinguisher and the hose in the garden she eased out just then a huge bang from downstairs resounded through the house a flash in the smoke a bullet plowed into the door near her head two more screaming she dove back into her room and slammed the door locked it kayleigh decided she had no choice but to risk a twentyfivefoot jump to the ground would she break her legs and just lie there in agony until alicia shot her would she get speared on the fence and bleed out but she wouldnt burn to death at least running to the window she flung it open and looked out toward the road not a single flashing light yet then she gazed down trying to judge angles and distances she found a place she might land just past the fence but then she saw at the exact spot shed land alicias shadow moving back and forth almost leisurely she was at the front door and probably anticipating kayleighs jump and aiming at that very spot shadows kayleigh sat down on the bed grabbed a picture she had of marygordon and hugged it to her chest so this was it mama bobby ill be with you soon oh bobby she thought of the song shed written for him years ago the only one for me more tears but just then another gunshot resounded from downstairs then two or three more kayleigh gasped could the police be here after all she ran to the window and looked out no no one was here the driveway was empty except for alicias truck and there were no flashing lights on the horizon two more shots and from downstairs a voice calling her name a mans voice kayleigh come on hurry she opened the door cautiously and peered down jesus through the smoke she could just make out the form of edwin sharp beating down the flames on the stairs with his jacket alicia lay on her back on the marble of the hallway eyes gazing up unseeing her face was bloody shed fallen onto a patch of burning wood floor and her clothes were on fire kayleigh understood edwin had ignored her warning and continued to the house anyway hurry he cried come on i called the fire department but i dont know when theyll be here you have to get out his slapping at the flames wasnt doing much to stop the spread though hed beat out a narrow path down the stairs to the ground floor she made her way along this now he was pointing into the den we can get out that way through the window but she said you go im going to fight it no we cant go she shouted and turned the small extinguisher on the flames edwin hesitated coughing hard and returned to flailing away with his jacket ill help you she gave him a smile and called in the kitchen theres another extinguisher beside the stove choking edwin staggered through the arched doorway and returned a moment later with the extinguisher much bigger than kayleighs and started to douse the flames too with a horrified glance at alicias burning body kayleigh ran out the back door and returned a moment later with her garden hose she began attacking the stubborn fire as edwin next to her blew bursts of foam from the big extinguisher they both retched and coughed and tried to blink away tears from the smoke the singer and her stalker held their own but only for a time soon edwins extinguisher ran out and an outrider of fire melted her garden hose too late no my house but then sirens sounded and outside the evening darkness filled with flashing lights as the first fire trucks arrived men and women in their thick yellow outfits hurried into the house with hoses and began battling the flames one fireman bent over alicias body no longer burning but smoldering badly and felt for a pulse he looked up and shook his head another ushered kayleigh and edwin toward the front door and they staggered outside kayleigh made her way down the stairs into the yard coughing and spitting the terrible bits of soot and ash from her mouth she paused on the lawn and vomited painfully then she looked back realizing that edwin was lagging behind she saw him on his knees on the porch his hand was at his throat he lifted his fingers away and looked at them kayleigh saw the digits were dark but not stained with soot as shed thought blood was flowing from a wound in his neck alicia had shot him before he wrestled the gun away from her he blinked and looked at kayleigh i think i think she his eyes closed and he collapsed backward on the wooden deck chapter kathryn dance was sitting next to kayleigh towne on the steps of her house they were bathed in a sweep of colored lights blue and red with flashes of white beautiful and troubling the young woman was diminished her posture collapsedchin tucked shoulders slumped she was smeared with edwin sharps blood from trying to staunch the bleeding in kinesic analysis kayleighs carriage could be read as defeat and acceptance the goal of every interrogator but the pose was also an indication of exhaustion or disbelief p k madigan was directing the fmcsos crime scene team in their search of the house and the fire department was making sure there was no chance of the flames sprouting up again i dont understand any of this kayleigh whispered dance explained what theyd learned about alicia and found in her apartment and in her truck there was a baggie filled with things she stole from edwins rental she was going to plant them here dance then explained the why there was a note too shed forged your handwriting and did a pretty good job of it if anything happened to you you wanted her to take over the band she asked edwin here tonight too so itd look like hed killed me he gets arrested and nobody believes him when he claims hes innocent exactly kayleigh rubbed her face her jaw tightened alicia wanted to be me she wanted fame and money and power thats what this fucking business does to people it twists them seduces them im sick of it im so sick of it she looked toward the medics i told him not to come i knew hed get blamed if anything happened but he came anyway as some emts got edwin into one of the two ambulances another approached them agent dance ms towne mr sharps lost a lot of blood weve stabilized him as best we can but im sorry to say its not looking good we have to get him to the hospital for surgery as soon as we can is he going to live kayleigh asked we dont know at this time was he a friend kayleigh said softly in a way hes a fan of mine chapter two hours later a tiredlooking surgeon a south asian man in green scrubs walked slowly down the bleachedlit hallway of fresno community hospital toward the waiting area dance looked at kayleigh and together they rose the man didnt seem to know whom to deliver the news to the famous fresno singer or the tall woman with the gun on her hip he spoke between them as he said edwin sharp would survive the blood loss was bad but he would ultimately recover fully the bullet missed the carotid and his spine edwin would be coming out of the anesthesia now they could see him for a few minutes if they wanted they found the recovery room and stepped inside to find edwin staring groggily at the ceiling hey he mumbled hey blinking feels like it did when i had my tonsils out his voice didnt seem to be affected he spoke softly though and a bit garbled and he seemed completely drained kayleigh said you look pretty good all things considered though the bullet hole would be fairly smallabout nine millimeters of coursethe eggplantcolored bruise extended well beyond the thick bandage covering the wound doesnt uhm you know hurt much yet he studied an iv drip probably morphine he added and im getting some pretty nice pills after im out the uhm doctor tells me the doctor you know im getting discharged tomorrow he had a loopy grin on his face and for once the smile wasnt the least bit weird i thought id be here you know for a week maybe more than a week his eyelids dipped and dance wondered if he was slipping off to sleep they then opened once more a week he repeated drunkenly im glad youre feeling better kayleigh said i was pretty worried he frowned speaking slowly didnt bring me flowers i notice no flowers afraid id misinterpret it then he laughed joking kayleigh smiled too edwins face grew somber alicia what was that all about did she go crazy i mean alicia what happened dance said she was going to kill kayleigh and plant some things she got from your house so youd get blamed for it she forged a note saying that kayleigh wanted alicia to front the band she did that killed bobby prescott too and attacked your stepmother edwin asked kayleigh nodded then echoing the singers comments of a few hours earlier he added she did it focusing again she did it to be famous everybody wants that i guess its like a drug like writing harry potter being daniel craig they want to be famous her eyes damp kayleigh whispered i dont know what to say edwin what a mess thiss all been he tried to shrug but winced from the pain you didnt need to come to the house edwin i told you it was dangerous yeah he said maybe being sardonic maybe not quite grasping what shed said he was really drugged what happened back there dance asked he tried to focus back there at kayleighs oh at kayleighs well she told me about alicia and the fire so i called the fire department but i couldnt stop you told me to stop right i did but i couldnt i kept going to the house when i got there i parked on the shoulder so alicia wouldnt see me i went through the trees and got to the house the kitchen door was open and i saw alicia by the stairs she didnt see me i tackled her she was really strong i mean you know really i didnt expect that the gun went off before i got it away from her she jumped at me and i shot her i didnt think i just pulled the trigger i didnt even know i got shot all i remember is we were trying to put the fire out you and me and then i woke up here his eyes closed slowly then leveraged open and he looked at kayleigh i was going to mail you something before i left theres a card i was going to send you a card theres a present inside too my jacket look in the pocket wheres my jacket dance found the garment in the closet kayleigh fished through the pocket she extracted a stamped envelope addressed to her open it she did looking over her shoulder dance noted the silly drugstore card with a mournfullooking dog on the front the balloon above its head reporting im doggone sorry kayleigh smiled and im sorry too edwin look in the tissue she opened the square of thin paper inside were three small guitar picks oh edwin i got a deer antler in this pawn shop in seattle i made them out of that theyre beautiful she showed them to dance who agreed i his eyes floated in an arc around the room and he remembered what he was going to say i sent them to you before but you sent them back i mean somebody sent them back but if you want you can have them now of course i want them thank you so much ill use them at the concert in fact ill thank you in person for them there oh no im headed back to seattle i was packing up when alicia called a wan smile leaving better for you i think he laughed better for me too you know you think a famous star kind of likes you then next thing some crazy people want to use you to assassinate a politician and some psychos stolen your trash to frame you for murder never thought being a fan could be so dangerous both dance and kayleigh smiled think im think im better off in seattle his head eased toward his chest and he muttered its not as hot either its really hot in its hot here kayleigh smiled but said earnestly edwin you cant drive like this wait a couple of days please come to the concert if youre feeling up for it ill get you a ticket front row center he was fading fast no better its better if i then he was sound asleep kayleigh looked over the picks and seemed genuinely moved by the gift she and dance then left the hospital they were in the parking lot when kayleigh gave a laugh the agent lifted an eyebrow hey you hear the one about the blond country singer tell me she was so dumb she got dumped by her stalker friday friday chapter the day of the show the band had arrived from nashville at nine am and come straight here the convention center where kayleigh and the crew were waiting they got right to work after a couple of hours kayleigh had called a break backstage she had a tea and called suellyn then spoke to marygordon she was going to take the girl shopping that afternoon for a new dress to wear to the concert after she disconnected she picked up her old martin again and practiced a bit more with the picks that edwin had given her she liked them a lot top flatpickers like doc watson norman blake tony rice and bishop towne would never use big flexible triangles the real virtuosos used small hard picks like these kayleigh was more a strummer but she still liked the control that a voice startled her hows the action tye slocum asked appearing silently from nowhere despite his size his eyes were on the instrument kayleigh smiled the guitar tech was referring to the height of the strings above the fret board some guitars had a bolt or nut that could be turned to easily alter the action martins didnt to make that adjustment required more effort and skill little low i was getting some buzz on the d ive got a saddle i can swap he said i just found some bone ones real old theyre pretty sweet the saddle vital to a guitars tone was the white bar on the bridge that transmitted the sound from the strings to the body acoustically the best material was hard ivory from forest elephant tusks soft ivory was the next bestfrom large african elephants bone was the third best material both types of ivory were availablesome legally and some notbut kayleigh refused to use ivory and wouldnt let anyone in her band do so either tye though had good sources for vintage bone which produced a sound nearly as good a pause just wondering is he going to be mixing tonight a glance toward the control platform in the back where barry zeigler sat with hardshell earphones on hands dancing over the console yeah tye grunted okay sure hes good bobby prescott had not only been the chief roadie but handled the demanding job of sound mixing his fathers profession at the live shows anyone on the crew could do a decent job on the massive complex midas xl mixing consoletye was pretty good himselfbut she had decided to ask zeigler as long as he happened to be in town her producer had started in the business as a board man when his own dreams of being a rock star hadnt come to pass nobody was better than barry at getting right both the fohfront of houseaudio along with the foldback the sound the band heard through their monitors slocum wandered off to his workstation of tuners strings amps and tools kayleigh walked out onstage and the rehearsal resumed her band was made up of artists whose whole professional lives had been devoted to music there are a lot of talented people out there of course but kayleigh had worked hard to assemble folks who understood her and her songs and the tone she strived for folks who could work silkenly together oh that was important vital there are few professions as intimate as making ensemble music and without complete synchronicity among the performers the best songs in the world and the most talented front person will be wasted kevin peebles was the lead guitarist a lean laidback man in his thirties whose mahogany scalp glistened with sweat under the lights hed been a rocker for a few years before turning to his real lovecountry a genre in which his race had not been traditionally well represented bass player and backup singer emma sue granger was one of the most beautiful women kayleighd ever seen with shoulderlength ravenblack hair decked out with occasional microbraids and a flower or two granger wore tight sweaters she knitted herself and leather pants kayleighs audience was percent female but for the sake of the other forty emma sue got a lot of frontstage time in a battered straw cowboy hat brims rolled into a near tube plaid shirt and ancient blue jeans buddy delmore manned the bands pedal steel guitar the smooth seductive instrument that kayleigh for all her talent had never been able to play she thought anybody who could master one well was a genius he also would play the distinctivesounding dobro and national steel guitars with their pieplate resonators the sixtyfiveyearold was from west virginia and played music to support his true love chicken farming he had eight children the youngest of whom was two the drummer was new to the group alonzo santiago had come out of the barrio in bakersfield and could make rhythm with anything he could pick up or touch this too was magical to kayleigh who could perfectly follow a beat but relied on others to create and sustain it santiago was one of those crazy parents whod actually given his young children drum sets only to be disappointed to learn his daughter dreamed of being a nascar driver and his son a comic book artist the other band member a sturdy roundfaced redhead in her forties was the orchestra sharon bascowitz was one of those people who could pick up an instrument even one shed never seen and play it like a virtuoso sousaphone cello harpsichord marimba native american flute anything sharon could get it to sing always decked out in three or four colorful layers of tiedye and lace and dangling with glittering fake jewels the woman was as brash as emma sue was shy the rehearsal was informal theyd performed most of the material so often it probably wasnt even necessary but there was a new song order and kayleigh had added patsy cline and alison kraussrobert plant covers and had written two new songs which shed faxed to the band last night one was dedicated to bobby alicia would not be mentioned kayleigh had decided they finished the raucous and fun im in the mood for rock n roll and she looked toward barry at the mixing board he gave her a thumbsup he was satisfied she was satisfied kayleigh announced to the band and crew okay i think thats it for now reconvene at six for the final sound check according to the god of performances bishop towne you could never rehearse too frequently but you could rehearse too much they needed a break now to let the new ideas bake she handed off her martin to tye slocum to fit with the new saddle slugged down another iced tea and picked up her phone debating a moment then a moment longer finally she did something she couldnt have imagined until today kayleigh towne called edwin sharp hello he still sounded a bit groggy hey its kayleigh well hi are you in the hospital still he laughed didnt think id really hear from you no i got sprung how you feeling sore sore sore well i hope youre well enough to come to the show she said firmly i got you a ticket there was silence and she wondered if he was going to refuse but he said okay thanks ive got it now meet you for lunch she could have left it at the willcall window but that seemed petty considering what hed done for her shed reconciled with sheri she could do the same with edwin he said im supposed to go see deputy madigan to give them a statement but thats not till two i guess sure he suggested a diner hed been to she agreed and they disconnected kayleigh headed for the stage door glancing at tye slocum who had already destrung her martin and was filing away on the new bone saddle as lost in his task as a sculptor completing his masterwork her eyes then rose and looked into the murky heaven of the convention center kayleigh had wakened that morning at her fathers house thinking that the concert was the last thing she wanted shed even considered using the smoke from the fire at her house as an excuse to cancel reporting that her throat still stung even though it was fine but once shed arrived here greeted the band members tuned up and walked out onstage her attitude changed completely now she couldnt wait for the concert nothing was going to stop her from giving the audience the best show theyd ever seen chapter the case was over but one consequence of that resolution for kathryn dance was that a greater problem loomed one shed have to face soon and shed decided today was the day shed had a decadent brunch of huevos rancheros and was now back in her mountain view motel room on the phone with her website partner martine discussing the songs shed recorded of los trabajadores shed emailed them to the woman and theyd spent hours deciding which of the two dozen theyd make available on their site the decisions were hard they were all so good but from time to time as the women spoke that greater problem intruded the one dance was now resolved to deal with the question about the men in her life no thats not correct she reminded herself there was only one man in her lifein that way jon boling that he was close to ending the relationship was irrelevant she had to keep michael oneil out of the equation for the time being this was between her and boling so whatm i going to do hey you there martines voice nudged her from her thoughts sorry they returned to the task and finished the los trabajadores song list then she disconnected the call flopped down on the bed and told herself call jon have it out dance stared out the window eyes on what might have been a true mountain view had the day been exceedingly clear which it definitely wasnt not in this dead end of summer she then scrutinized her mobile which she turned over and over in her hand the photo skin on the back depicted two children with giddy smiles and two dogs in the oblivious joy of dogness the other side was her phones address book window jon bolings number highlighted and ready to be dialed back to the pictures eyes on a bad painting on the wall of a harbor did the interior designer think all californians owned sailboats even those three hours from the coast flip the phones address book her french braid tickled her left ear she absently flicked the strands aside call or not call or not her intent was to ask bluntly why he was moving to san diego without talking to her first odd she reflected she had no problem slipping on her predator specs sitting down across from snarling salinas gangbanger manuel martinez to learn where hed buried a portion of the remains of hector alonzo specifically the head but asking a simple question about her lovers intentions was paralyzing then a wind shear of anger what the hell was he thinking becoming friendly with the children easing into their lives making himself a part of the family fitting in so seamlessly she grew analytical maybe this was the answer on the surface jon boling had been perfect for her fit funny kind sexy theyd had no harsh words no fights no fundamental collisions of any kindunlike for instance as with michael oneil wait she reminded herself oneil did not exist for the purposes of this equation with boling did the absence of friction mean the gears of love werent truly engaging could there be more love in sweat than in laughter that just didnt seem right clutching the phone turning it over over over call not call children screen children screen children screen maybe ill flip it like a coin on the bed and let fate take charge children screen children screen chapter kayleigh met a slowmoving edwin sharp in the front of the diner she liked the choice of restaurant it was in a quiet part of town and she suspected she wouldnt have to deal with autograph hounds that was something even minor celebrities like her always had to consider he greeted her at the door with a smile and let her precede him into the airconditioned brightly lit restaurant which was nearly empty the waitress grinned noting their famous patron but kayleigh was an expert at categorizing fans she knew the woman would be efficient and cheerful but far too nervous to utter a word beyond order taking and comments about the heat they sat at a booth and ordered iced teas and for kayleigh a burger edwin got a milkshake the wound in his neck made chewing painful he explained i love em but i havent had one for months hey if nothing else you got me to lose that weight id been trying to for years wow that bruise is something he lifted the chrome napkin holder and used it as a mirror i think its getting worse hurts a lot yeah but the big problem is i have to sleep on my back which is something ive never been able to do their meals came and they ate and sipped he asked hows your house ill need new carpets have to replace a lot of floor and a wall the big problem is the smoke damage it got into everything theyre talking about a hundred thousand dollars half my clothes have to go too they stink sorry then an awkward silence arose and it was clear edwin didnt want to talk about the terrible events of the past few days fine with her he started chatting about music and some of the founding women of the country scene he talked about the records in his collectionhe still listened to a lot of music on lps and had invested in an expensive turntable kayleigh too thought that vinylanalog recordingsproduced the purest sound better than the highestquality digital edwin mentioned hed just found some kitty wells singles in a used record shop in seattle you like her kayleigh asked surprised shes one of my favorites have almost all of her records you know she had a billboard hit when she was sixty i did yeah wells who started singing in the s was one of the first women inductees into the country music hall of fame they talked about country music back thennashville versus texas versus bakersfield she laughed when edwin quoted loretta lynn who fought her way up through the maledominated recording industry a womans two cents worth is worth about two cents in the country music world in edwins opinion country represented the best of commercial music much better than pop and hiphop it was well crafted used appealing tunes and incorporated themes about important issues in everybodys lives like family love work even politics and the musicians were top craftspeople unlike many folk alternative hiphop and rock artists on the broader issue of the music world he wasnt happy about the decline of the recording industry and thought that illegal downloads would continue to be a problem and erode the quality of performances if artists dont get paid for what they do then whats the incentive to keep writing and making good music ill drink to that kayleigh tapped her iced tea glass to his milkshake when they were through with lunch kayleigh gave edwin his ticket front and center ill wave to you oh and those picks are the best glad you liked them her phone buzzed a text from tye slocum the martins ready to go how you doing curious he rarely texted much less about something as mundane as the status of an instrument everything okay yeah just she didnt finish and put her phone away shed respond later the bill came and edwin insisted on paying well this is a real treat i never thought id be in the front row at a kayleigh towne concert they walked into the parking lot as they approached her suburban edwin gave a laugh and pointed to his old red car a few spaces down from hers buick would be pretty tough to rhyme with good thing you picked cadillac toyota wouldve been worse kayleigh joked hey now that you know im not the crazy person you thought i was how about dinner sometime maybe after the concert i usually go out with the band oh thats right well sometime maybe how bout sunday you dont leave again for two weeks the vancouver show well werent you leaving he pointed to his throat taking those pain pills you were righttheyre pretty heavy duty probably better if i dont do any longdistance driving im back in the rental for a few days oh sure you have to be careful they were at her suv okay thank you again edwin for everything you did im sorry for what youve been through she nearly hugged him and kissed his cheek but decided not to xo id do it all again he said smiling the title of one of her first hits kayleigh laughed after a moment he said hey heres a thought i could drive up to canada vancouvers not that far from seattle i know some great places theres this beautiful garden in the mountains where she smiled you know edwin its probably best if we dont get together just i think its best a grin crossed his face sure only well after everything i just thought its probably best she repeated goodbye edwin she extended her hand he didnt take it so youre breaking up with me he asked she started to laugh thinking he was jokinglike his reference to the flowers in the hospital last night but his eyes narrowed focusing on hers and the smile morphed into the one she recognized from before the faint twisting of his lip fake after everything he repeated in a whisper okay you take care she said quickly and gripped her key fob unlocking the door dont go he said in a breathy whisper kayleigh looked around the parking lot was deserted edwin he said quickly wait im sorry look lets just take a drive and talk we can just talk nothing more than that for now for now what did he mean i think i should go just talk he said stridently thats all im asking she turned fast but edwin stepped quickly forward boxing her in please im sorry just a little drive he looked at his watch you dont have to be at the concert hall for six hours and thirty minutes no edwin stop it get out of my way you like men who talk remember your song you never say a word thats not me come on you liked talking to me at the restaurant just now he gripped her arm that was so much fun the best lunch ive ever had let go of me she tried to push him away it was like trying to move a sack of concrete he said ominously you understand i was almost killed he pointed to his neck i was almost killed saving you did you forget that oh jesus lord he shot himself alicia was innocent he set her up edwin killed bobby he killed alicia i dont know how but he did it please edwin he released her relaxed and looked contrite im so sorry look this isnt going well heres the thing you need a place to stay the fire at your house you could stay with me until its fixed was he serious she spun around and tried to bolt but his massive hand went around her face and pinched hard an arm gripped her chest and squeezed as he dragged her to the back of his buick and opened the trunk the struggle for air became more and more hopeless as her vision crumbled to black she heardshe believed she hearda voice singing in a whisper always with you always with you your shadow chapter kathryn dance didnt play coin toss with the phone she decided to be an adult about the whole san diego situation she rose and hit call as she pitched out her starbucks carton her eyes were on the motel room trash can as bolings phone rang once twice three times she disconnected fast not because shed lost her nerve about talking to him no another thought surfaced a to b to z how did edwin sharp know that alicia sessions had stolen his trash thats what hed said in the hospital yet shed never mentioned the fact dance had said only that alicia had taken some things of his that she had garbage bags in her apartment was never mentioned slow down she told herself think could he have learned about it some other way she decided no at kayleighs house last night he was unconscious for most of the time and only the medics spoke to him not madigan or harutyun the only others who knew about the trash and kayleigh and dance were the first ones to visit him in the hospital a logical deduction on his part if alicia was going to plant something of his it made sense for her to have taken his trash surely possible but another explanation was that edwin had put the two bags of his trash in alicias apartment along with the notes supposedly forged by the assistant but that he himself had produced hed then planted the evidence outside his own house like the neatsfoot oil trace and the boot print to implicate alicia suggesting shed been spying on him last saturday no no this was absurd the shooting incident at kayleighs house that surely had been alicia or had it rethink the scenario dance told herself what had kayleigh told her madigan and harutyun about the attack last night was there any possible way edwin had orchestrated it think a to b to z come on you get into the minds of killers plenty do it now how would you have set it up and the ideas began to form edwin goes to alicias ties her up he plants his own trash gabriel fuentess gun case and the forgeries of kayleighs note there uses her phone to send texts to kayleigh and to his own phone about meeting at kayleighs house and he goes to the hotel near alicias and uses her computer to send the request for the fourth verse to the radio station but there were two cars at kayleighs his own and alicias well maybe he pays a teenager or field picker to drive his car to the shoulder in front of kayleighs house and leave it there then vanish then he drives to kayleighs in alicias pickup with her tied up in the back or maybe she was already dead at that pointthe time of death with a badly burned body would be close enough but kayleigh heard alicia calling her name in the house a tape recorder edwin could have threatened her back at the apartment to say kayleighs name into a highdef digital recorderthe same one used to play your shadow to announce the impending murder with your eyes closed you couldnt tell the difference between someone really singing or the digital replay only a pro would have a recorder like that dance recalled her reply to kayleigh or a fanatical fan hed probably planned out several scenarios for the rescue of kayleigh townedepending on where the singer was in the house when he arrived if she was downstairs or on the porch maybe the fight with alicia would have occurred in the driveway or out by the road but when hed gotten to the house he would have seen her in the bedroom that gave him the chance to get inside and masquerade as aliciaall thanks to dance herself of course whod called kayleigh and told her to barricade herself upstairs and edwins wound well if he was mobile now the gunshot may have been dramatic but obviously it wasnt that serious the bullet missed the carotid and his spine dance pulled a portion of her own skin away from her neck yes he could easily have shot himself and missed anything vital she tried to consider any other items of evidence that were unaccounted for the bone dust was the first thing that came to mind human bone dust the guitar picks made not from a deer antler but from the hand of frederick blanton the file sharerthe body part hadnt been burned away edwin had cut it off before he set the fire hed lied about sending the picks to her earlier how would kayleigh know her assistant returned everything hed sent probably unopened grim justice for a singer using picks made out of the bone of a man whod stolen her music its a wild theory but close enough for me dance decided and called kayleigh no answer she left a message telling her what she suspected then called bishop towne and told him the same oh fuck the man growled shes having lunch with him right now sheri was at the convention center for the rehearsal she left an hour ago to meet him where well im not sure hold on after an excruciatingly long time he came back on the san joaquin diner on third do you if she calls you have her get in touch with me right away dance hung up and debated calling or the sheriffs office which would be the shorter explanation she dialed madigan came the voice chief its kathryn no time now but i think edwins our perp after all what she heard a tap an ice cream cup being set down but alicia later listen he and kayleighre at the san joaquin diner on third we need a car there now know it sure he armed all the firearms we know aboutre accounted for but its pretty easy to buy a piece in this state gotcha ill get back to you dance paced along the carpet then hurried to the rooms desk where her notes from the case sat there were dozens and dozens of pages if shed been working one of her own cases especially a taskforced operation she would have organized and indexed them by now but since it seemed that the case had been resolved and others would be handling the prosecution she hadnt yet bothered now she spread the pages out on the bedher conversation with the witnesses the evidence lincoln rhyme and amelia sachs had analyzed the notes from the interview with edwin but as it turned out kathryn dance didnt need to parse her handiwork to determine if edwin was or was not the perp p k madigan called back and in a voice uncharacteristically rattled blurted she and edwin left the diner a half hour ago but her suvs still in the lot and her keys were on the ground nearby she dropped them to let us know hed snatched her her phone batterys out or its been crushed no signal to trace i sent lopez to edwins house and the buicks there but the place is empty looks like hes moved out hes got new wheels yep but i checked either stolen or bought private nothing at dmv in his name no rentals at any of the companies in our database he could be driving anything and going anywhere chapter alibi woman had lied when dance had spoken with her on the phone twenty minutes before seventytwoyearold mrs rachel webber had once againand very quicklyverified edwins story about the time hed been at her house on tuesday but it took the agent only three minutes of trim questioning to learn what really happened edwin had found her in the garden early that morning hed forced her inside with a gun and gotten the names of her children and grandchildren and said that when the police came to ask her she was to say he was there at twelvethirty now dance and dennis harutyun were listening to madigan having a conversation with the crime scene unit boss finally he grunted and slammed the receiver down backyard of edwins charlies folks found some human bones and some tools buried deep so csu wouldnt find them when they searched the other day you were right kathryn he made those guitar picks himself outa that file sharers hand dance rocked back and forth in a cheap swivel chair in madigans office a cup of ice cream soup sat coagulating beside his phone and she thought again how did i miss whatd gone wrong she hadnt been able to read his deception but shed known that body language analysis of someone like edwin sharp would be difficult if not impossible so shed looked at the facts hed mentioned tried to analyze not his kinesics but his verbal content well think about it was there anything that might help them find where edwin would go with his love and what would happen when they got there dance believed she knew the answer to that question and she did not want to consider it harutyun asked why didnt he just snatch her a few days ago dance gave her thoughts oh he didnt want to snatch her at all its why he set up alicia as the killer so he could rescue kayleigh and win her over with his heroism like some arsoniststhey set fires and then rescue people to be heroes which is exactly what he did he probably pitched his case to her at lunch reminding her that hed saved her life why didnt they go out on a date or something like that she said no that was his last chance to be close to her in private so he did what he had to kidnapped her but its not impulsive believe me hes known this was a possibility and hed had it all planned out as a last resort something was eating away at her something elusive facts again verbal content facts were not meshing what is it she sighed the thought vanished before it solidified then wait yes thats it she grabbed the phone and placed a call to her friend and colleague amy grabe fbi special agent in charge san francisco the womans low sultry voice said kathryn saw the wirekidnapping and possible interstate flight thats why im calling its really the singer kayleigh towne im afraid so a stalker well what can we do you think hes headed this way thats not why im calling what i need are a couple of field agents in the seattle area i have to conduct an interview with a witness and i dont have time to get up there its got to happen now cant you do it over the phone the sac asked i tried that it didnt work chapter well thought kathryn dance staring at the computer screen look at this the woman she was gazing at presently in seattle and connected via skype could have been kayleigh townes sister not an identical twin but real close straight blond hair a petite frame a long pretty face edwins former girlfriend sally docking stared nervously at the computer screen her voice broke as she said these people i dont understand i didnt do anything wrong there were two fbi agents behind her in the living room of her seattle apartment dance smiled i just needed them to bring one of their computers so you and i could have another chat actually they were there because she didnt think sally would voluntarily go onto skype for a second conversation dances voice was casual despite the urgency she felt youll be all right provided you tell me the truth not tell me the truth this time that was too confrontational sure a discrepancy had occurred to kathryn dancecertain facts were not lining up now that edwin sharp had been revealed to be the perp his behavior with sally docking didnt ring true her earlier account of life with edwin had been more or less credible over the phone but a kinesic expert needs to see her subject not just hear to spot deception and so amy grabe had called the seattle field office of the bureau and sent two agents to sally dockings apartment in a workingclass section of the city they brought with them a very expensive laptop which incorporated a highdefinition webcam dance was in a conference room in the sheriffs office the overhead lights off but a desk lamp not far from her face shed adjusted the illumination carefully she needed sally to see her very clearlyand under ominous lighting sally was lit by ambient rays but the lens and software rendered the image perfectly it looks like a nice apartment sally dance wore her pinkrimmed glasses the nonthreatening ones unlike the steel or blackrimmed predator specs she put on when she wanted to present an aggressive image its okay i guess i like it rents cheap dance asked a number of other questions about the girl her family her job as she drew a baseline of the womans behavior she caught only one microburst of stress when sally said she didnt mind the commute to her job at a mall fifteen miles from where she lived good she was getting a feel for the woman who tended to appear nervous and uncertain even when she was being asked simple questions and answering truthfully after ten minutes of this dance said now id like to talk to you about edwin some more everything i told you was true her eyes bored into the camera this was awkward a blunt denial quickly delivered dance couldnt over or underreact it might tip her hand its just routine we often follow up to get more information when theres been a change in developments oh we need your help sally see the situation down in fresnos difficult edwin may have been more involved in a crime than it originally seemed im worried that he might be going through a bad phase and could hurt somebody or hurt himself no thats right dance had made certain that not a single soul leaked to the public the news that edwin had snatched kayleigh sally docking wouldnt know and we need to find him we need to know where he might go places that are important to him other residences he might have oh i dont know anywhere like that her eyes whipped to the computer screen a baseline variation it confirmed that she did have some ideas but dislodging this nugget would take some work well you might know more than you think sally but i havent heard from him for a long time nonresponsive and the vague adjective didnt mask the fact that this was probably a lie but dance let it go for now well not necessarily someplace he wanted to move to just someplace he mentioned when you were together no no sally was thinking quickly i mean he was pretty much into seattle he didnt travel much he was like a homebody kind of guy never mentioned anything really a glance at the sheet in front of her sally caught the glance as long as you tell the truth i mean he talked about going on vacations some you know but i didnt think thats what you meant where did he want to go nashville was one place the grand ole opry and then maybe new york so he could go to some concerts edwin sharp probably did say that but he was not going to run off to nashville or manhattan with kayleigh towne and set up housekeeping however skewed his sense of reality but dance said good sally thats just the sort of thing were looking for can you think of any other places maybe you were watching a tv show and he said hey that looks neat something like that no really eyes on the web camera lie dance grimaced well i appreciate you trying i dont know what im going to do you were really the only person we can turn to me i broke up with him a while ago uhm nine months about that i just mean you had a very different relationship with edwin than some people you wont believe it but he can be very abusive and obsessive no really dances heart tapped faster she was on the trail of her prey and closing in still easy as could be she continued thats right when people reject him that pushes a button edwin has issues about abandonment and rejection he clings to people since he broke up with you youre not a negative in his life in fact he told me he still feels bad about the breakup you were talking about me with edwin like recently delivered fast like spilled water thats right funny you could get the impression from what he said that he kind of misses you dance crafted her sentences very carefully she never intentionally deceived her subjects but sometimes let them do it for her i wouldnt be surprised if he was curious what youre up to sally swallowed and with tentative fingers tipped in blue polish she brushed at her long hairan echo of kayleighs though not as long not as fine when she tilted her head dance noticed the roots she was not a natural blonde the young woman asked in a slightly higher pitcha stress tone what did he want to know just general things intentionally evasive she swallowed again dance glanced down at a blank sheet of paper then up once more she noted a faint glistening of sweat on sallys forehead as she strained to see it the fbi has some really good equipment dance again glanced down at the sheet and sallys eyes dropped toward the desk in front of her as if the paper were two feet from her dance asked your brother in spokane and your mother in tacoma i just my brother my mother edwin was close to them the stalker had not said more than one or two sentences about sally docking and nothing at all about her family dance had looked up the details through washington state and federal records after she suspected the true relationship between the two did he say anything about them sally asked they were friendly werent they close i what sally would you be concerned if edwin showed some interest in your family ah the power of the hypothetical some interest in what did he say she blurted please tell me whats the matter sally dance tried to appear perplexed i the tears began what did he say behind her one fbi agent shifted perhaps sensing the edge of hysteria as was dance edwin what did he say about my family dance said evenly why are you troubled tell me her brow furrowed hes going to hurt them he wont understand that i did what he wanted if he mentioned them to you it means hes going to hurt them to get back at me please you have to do something wait dance looked troubled i hope youre not telling me that youre the one who wanted to break up i oh no that changes everything i mean what i told edwin she stopped speaking and peered at sally uneasily please no what did you tell him where is he is edwin going to tacoma spokane we dont know where he is sally i told you that let me think okay this is a problem dont let him hurt my mama she was sobbing now please and my brothers got two babies the scenario was playing out just as kathryn dance had planned the agent had needed to plant the seeds of fear within the woman to get her to open up and had formed her questions to give the impression that edwin was practically en route to kill her family and possibly then her breathless with tears i did what he wanted why is he going to hurt us dance said sympathetically we can help you sally but we cant do anything for you or your mother or brother if youre not honest in fact shed already talked to the local authorities and made sure that both sallys mothers and brothers houses were being guarded though the family members didnt know it at this point sally struggled for breath please im sorry i lied he told me i had to he told me if anybody asked i was supposed to tell them that he was the greatest guy and never stalked me or anybody and he broke up with me not the other way around im sorry but i was scared send the police to my mothers and my brother hes got the babies please ill give you the addresses first tell me the truth sally then well see about the police whats the real story between edwin and you okay the woman said wiping her face with tissues one of the agents behind her provided last year edwin was a security guard in the mall where i was working and he saw me and it was like bang he got totally obsessed with me because she looked like kayleigh towne he started this campaign to win me over and one thing led to another and we started going out only he got weird i wasnt allowed to do this couldnt do that sometimes he just wanted to sit and look at me hed just stare or lie in bed and stroke my hair it was so fucking creepy hed tell me how beautiful i was over and over the fact is he thought i looked like this singerthe one he liked i think i mentioned her before kayleigh towne sally scoffed we had to play her music all the time he talked about her every day mostly it was poor kayleigh this poor kayleigh that nobody understood her her father sold the family house she loved her mother died the fans dont treat her right the label doesnt record her right he went on and on i couldnt take it i just left one night it was sort of okay for a month he stalked me yeah but it wasnt terrible but then his mother died and he freaked out i mean totally the stressor event that had pushed him over the edge he came over crying and acting all weird like his life was over with i felt bad for himand i was scaredso we got back together but he just got stranger and stranger he wouldnt go out at all he made me drop all my friends he got jealous of men at work he thought i was sleeping with every one of them there as if all he wanted was for me to be at home with him look at me and watch tv and have sex hed play her music when we did that it was horrible finally sally debated and pulled her sleeve up and displayed a scar on her wrist it was the only way i could get free but he found me and got me to the emergency room i think that convinced him to back off when was this december last year the second stressor event the one that had initiated his stalking kayleigh dance made a decision hes kidnapped her sally who kayleigh towne she whispered and yet she didnt seem too shocked well protect you and your family sally i promise and well get him and put him in jail for the rest of his lifehes also killed some people oh no my god no but we can only do that if you help us do you have any idea where he might go another debate raged within her she knows something come on dance thought come on i well get the police to your family sally but you have to meet us halfway well he said he had this like religious experience seeing kayleigh sing for the first time an outdoor concert a couple years ago he said if he could live anywhere thats where it would be in a cabin in the woods near there where dance asked some town in california on the ocean monterey i dont know exactly where it is dance finally looked away from the screen and caught madigans eye she looked back at the tearstained face of her subject thats all right sally i do chapter as they drove along edwin sharp was singing loud and more or less in key she gets gallons to the mile not the other way round and the tailpipe it really makes a pretty nasty sound the heater hardly works at all and forget about the air duct tapes been involved in most of her repairs but shes big and fast and solid and i know i can depend on her to always be there unlike a lot of men shes my red cadillac my red cadillac she gets me where im going and she always gets me back i love her like a sister shes my red cadillac we had to say goodbye to her he called into the back of the van my red buick sorry kayleigh was concentrating on not crying this was a survival not an emotional issue her nose was already perilously stuffed up and she was sure if she started sobbing shed suffocate the tape on her mouth was a tight seal she wasnt blindfolded but she was in the far back of the windowless van on the floor hed pulled her boots off lovingly smelled the leather sick they were about an hour from fresno though she didnt know which direction probably in the foothills toward yosemite or the sierras because the road seemed to be at an incline west or south the landscape was flat they stopped once after edwin had glanced into the rearview mirror at her and hed frowned he pulled off the road and climbed into the back shed shied away hed said no no made a mistake there a thick strand of her hair had been imprisoned by the duct tape and edwin had carefully loosened it and worked the hair free from the adhesive cant have that and he recited again how long it had been since shed cut it ten years four months you could write a song thatd be a good title then to her horror hed pulled a brush from his pocket and run it through her hair gently meticulously youre so beautiful hed whispered then the drive had resumed he now sang she gets me where im going and she always gets me back shes my red cadillac love it just positively love it kayleighs hands were cuffed in front of her shed hoped she could grab one of the rear door levers open it and tumble out taking her chances on the road and traffic but there were no door levers hed removed them edwin sharp had planned this carefully as he continued to sing she felt the van turn off the main road and drive for a time along a smaller highway one in bad condition definitely going up ten minutes later the tires began to crunch over dirt and gravel then the surface got even rougher and the vehicle strained uphill for several miles finally the van leveled off and ten minutes later came to a stop edwin climbed out then there was silence for a long moment this isnt fair she thought it just isnt goddamn fair you walk out onstage and sing folks your songs you make them all smile what could go wrong hey there edwin was opening the rear door revealing a field surrounded by a pine forest he helped her out and pulled the tape off her mouthgently though she was thoroughly repulsed once more by the touch of his skin on hers she smelled his aftershaveyes definitely her fathersand his sweat she inhaled hard shivering with relief she felt like shed been half drowned edwin stepped back and stared at her adoringly but there was no artistic admiration in his gaze now his eyes lingered on her breasts and crotch my boots she said naw i like you barefoot a glance down well have to do something about that polish its a little too red you know then he was gesturing at a small singlewide trailer covered with camouflage netting it sat in the middle of the clearing familiar look if you let me go you can have a head start six hours ten hours and ill arrange to get you money a million dollars doesnt it look familiar he repeated irritated that she wasnt understanding she gazed around it did yes but what was oh my god kayleigh realized stunned where she was standing this was the property shed grown up on that her grandfather had cleared and where hed built the family house edwin had put the trailer pretty much where the manse had been thered been a lot of clearing over the years but she could easily recognize landmarks from her childhood she remembered that edwin had been aware that shed been upset bishop had sold the propertyjust as hed lost his own childhood house how had he found the land a deed search she supposed kayleigh knew too that because the company that had bought up all of the private property here had gone bankrupt there wasnt a soul around for twenty miles edwin said with a sincere intensity i knew how much this meant this property i wanted to give it back to you youll have to show me where you rode your pony and walked your dogs when you were a little girl we can go for the same walks thatll be fun maybe well do that before supper tonight she supposed she should play along pretend she was touched and then when his back was turned grab a rock and break his skull and run but she couldnt feign revulsion and anger swirled within her how the hell can you say you love me and do this he grinned and gently stroked her hair she jerked her head away he hardly noticed kayleigh from the first time i heard your opening number at that concert in monterey i knew we were soul mates itll take you a little longer but youll figure it out too ill make you the happiest woman in the world ill worship you he covered the van with a camouflaged tarp secured it with rocks and slipped his arm around her shoulders very firmly he guided her toward the trailer i dont love you he only laughed but as they approached the trailer his gaze morphed from adoring to chill he fucked you didnt he bobby dont say he didnt he eyed her carefully as if asking tacitly if it was true and wanting to hear that it wasnt edwin i have a right to know we were just friends oh i dont know where its written friends dont ever fuck do you know where thats written so the sanitized language from earlierin conversation and emailshad been phony just another part of the innocent image he created and she now knew that he hadnt been simply tapping his leg in time to the music the other day they were at the trailer door now he calmed and smiled again sorry i get my hackles up thinking about him edwin look i should carry you over the threshold the wedding night thing you know dont touch me he gazed at her with some pity it seemed then pushed the door open and swept her up into his arms like she weighed nothing at all he carried her inside kayleigh didnt resist one of his massive hands firmly cradled her throat chapter were on our way kathryn dance said into her phone speaking to michael oneil she then gasped as dennis harutyun nearly demirrored his cruiser as the passenger side of the car came within inches of the truck he was passing he skidded back into the lane and sped up are you okay oneil asked are you there yes im yes she closed her eyes as harutyun took on another tractortrailer oneil was at his desk in his own sheriffs office dance opened her eyes briefly and asked whats in place two helicopters around point lobosthats where edwin first saw kayleigh at the concert two years ago and another choppers covering the area from moss landing up to santa cruz concentrating on the deserted areas chps setting up roadblocks around pacific grove pebble beach and carmel weve got about forty monterey county and city uniforms involved good and your boss is doing his thing the head of the monterey branch of the california bureau of investigation charles overby the consummate artist at press conferences was enlisting the aid of the public to be on the lookout for edwin sharp and kayleigh towne the many fan sites too were abuzz and included pictures of the suspect and his victim though dance supposed that anyone with a tv or itunes subscription knew what kayleigh towne looked like howre you doing oneil asked echoing his earlier question a curious inquiry but not so curious in the context of where theyd left their personal lives just before he returned to monterey but now was not the time for those considerations fine she said which didnt mean fine at all but was like a fencers parry she hoped oneil got it he seemed to he asked whats your eta she glanced at harutyun and posed the question half hour he said dance relayed this to oneil and added better go michael were doing about two hundred miles an hour here drawing a rare smile from the mustachioed deputy they disconnected she leaned back against the headrest you want me to slow down harutyun asked no i want you to go faster dance said he did and she closed her eyes once more what do you think edwin asked cheerfully he waved his arm around the trailer which was perfectly neat and scrubbed it was also stifflingly hot standing in the kitchenette still cuffed kayleigh didnt answer look a highdef tv and ive got about a hundred dvds and plenty of your favorite foods he opened cabinets to show her whole foods organic of course and your favorite soap too yes it was she noted her heart sank at this foresight on his part she also noticed several lengths of chain in the trailer fixed to the walls ending in shackles apparently edwins idea of thoughtfulness was to glue lambs wool to the metal clamps that would fit around her ankles and wrists mr today then once again his smile faded if youd gone out with me like i asked edwin said we wouldntve had to go through all of this just dinner and stayed in my rental for a few days while they fixed your house what was the big deal kayleigh sensed he was shivering with anger edwin has a reality problem all stalkers do his voice grew cold again i know youre not a virgin im sure you didnt want to fuck anybody it just sort of happened you did fuck bobby didnt you no i dont want to know he reflected for a moment and im sure you didnt do anything weirdyou know disgusting sometimes the good girlsthe ones in glasses and buttonedup blousesthey can do really sick things but you wouldnt he looked at her closely but then like a light switch clicking on his face warmed and he was smiling hey its okay youre mine now its going to be okay he showed her the trailer more closely the place was a shrine to her of course posters and memorabilia clothing and photos kayleigh towne everywhere but no weapons no sharp knives in the kitchenthe first thing she looked for also no glass or ceramic it was all metal and plastic she noticed a pack of cigarettes and looked for a lighter but there was none he followed her gaze edwin said quickly dont worry i dont smoke not anymore just needed a few of those to point the finger at that bitchy alicia for you kayleigh no cigarettes and no liquor im clean and i never did drugslike that friend of yours mr bobby prescott sweat poured her skin crawled this is hopeless edwin you dont think ten thousand people are going to be looking for me maybe not they might think you ran off with somebody you realized loved you and cared for you theyll still be thinking alicia was behind it all killed bobby and tried to kill you was he that far removed from reality but even if they are looking they arent going to find us they think were in monterey hiding out two hundred miles away this bitch i went out with for a while told them thats where wed be i knew shed turn me in i set that up a long time ago were completely alone here on the drive there wasnt a single helicopter or roadblock all the way from fresno if they thought we were headed here they couldve shut down fortyone in a minute no kayleigh theyll never find us you put this all together to what win me over to make you see reason who else would go to all this trouble except somebody who loved you but the congressman i dont understand he laughed oh yeah that was interesting i learned a lesson there ive stopped posting things online thats how simesky found out about you and me you didnt believe me when i said the whole world was trying to exploit you you and me but something good came out of that i did see somebody outside my house on saturday night it was simesky or that babbage woman but at the time i thought it was just kids but that got me thinking id set it up so that it looked like alicia had been spying on me i planted some evidence thatd make the police think she was the stalker sometimes its lucky how things work then edwin grew impatient he looked at her hair her breasts her legs well come on you know what its time for he glanced toward the rumpled bed beside which was a bose ipod player you see that ive got fifty of your concerts i recorded i have a nice recorder i saved up to buy it well play your concerts while we you know his face blossomed with concern oh dont worry yeah i recorded them but i never sold the songs or shared them with anybody it was just for me and now for us please no edwin please he stared at her hair then leaned against the kitchen sink you shouldnt be so you know standoffish i did you a favor fred blanton was a shit who stole your music and alicia well she probably did want your career and sheri oh please you deserve a better stepmother than her shes a store clerk who got lucky with bishop shes not worthy of you kayleigh they deserved to die and bobby all he wanted to do was fuck you and once more he stared at her awaiting confirmation of her infidelity then he seemed to control himself she said at least let me clean up just a shower please i dont feel comfortable like this i dont think so she snapped and you say youre mr today bullshit i just want to take a fucking shower and you wont let me he frowned all right only dont say words like that dont ever say words like that again all right i wont you can take a shower but you know i have the only keys and therere no weapons here and all the windows are barred i figured that i really just want to clean up he undid the cuffs and she rubbed her wrists shoulders slumped she walked through the narrow space into the bathroom oh kayleigh wait she stopped and turned he was awkward was his face reddening about that woman i was telling you about the one in seattle you dont have to be jealous it wasnt serious between us i never slept with her really honest kayleigh could see he was lying but what shocked her was that he seemed honestly to believe that his fidelity was important to her he smiled hurry back love and he walked into the bedroom to wait chapter edwin couldnt decide which of her songs was his favorite but then he realized that that debate was a clunker another of his mothers terms it was like you didnt have a favorite kind of food you liked everything well he did at any ratehe would have weighed three hundred pounds if kayleigh hadnt been in his life to keep him trim he clicked the air conditioner on a little higherwith the camouflage tarp covering the trailer it was beastly hot inside but he still kept the temperature warm kayleigh hed noticed before she headed to the shower had been sweating the beads on her skin had turned him on even more he imagined licking her temples and scalp and grew even more aroused it had been okay fucking sally with kayleigh townes voice singing through the speakers but this would be a thousand times better the real thing hey that was a pretty good title for a song the real thing hed mention it to her he had this idea that they could write songs together hed come up with the words and shed write the melodies edwin was good with words he thought again wedding afternoon not wedding night afternoon that was pretty funny that got him wondering if shed ever made out with anybody when she and her family had lived here there was that line in her song where she referred to a little teenage lovin at the old house which had made him absolutely furious when hed first heard it then he remembered bishop had sold the place when she was about twelve or thirteen and because she was a good girl he doubted that shed done anything more than kiss a boy and maybe do a little petting which nonetheless also stabbed him with jealousy bobby he hoped the fucking roadie had felt a lot of pain as he died at the convention center he hadnt screamed as much as edwin would have liked edwin listened to the running water pictured her naked inside the shower he was growing hard he remembered the article in rolling stone about her good girl makes good and he decided to relent hed forgive her for fucking bobby hed ask her again and insist she be honest he had to know but whatever she said hed forgive her he stripped his shirt off and kneaded his belly still a bit of excess skin from where he lost all that weight but hed kept the fat off at least anything for kayleigh should he take a shower too no hed taken one that morning besides shed have to get used to having him on top of or behind her whenever he was in the mood whether he was clean or not she was his wife after all he turned on the radio and caught the news it seemed the police hadnt gone with the innocent interpretation of kayleighs disappearance pike madigans voice was explaining solemnly about the kidnapping and alerting people that it was likely that edwin sharp and kayleigh towne were on their way west heading toward the monterey area we dont know the vehicle theyre in but go to the website weve set up and you can find sharps picture ah i knew i could count on you sally you lying little slut he wondered momentarily whod gotten her to talk kathryn dance came to mind had to be her of course the diversion about monterey would buy them only so much time theyd have to move but this place would be safe for a month or so kayleigh had said she liked austin maybe theyd go there next it was texas there had to be wildernesses to hide out in but then she also had commented in her on the road blog that she liked minnesota that might be a better place especially when she had the baby the weather would be cooler tough to be pregnant in the heat he imagined babies edwin had googled that cycle thing about womens bodies he wondered where kayleigh was with that then decided it didnt matter theyd make love at least every other night if not more hed hit the target sooner or later he undid his jeans slipping his hand into his jockeys though he didnt need any preparation there then the shower water stopped shed be toweling off now he pictured her body he decided to establish a rule that they had to walk around the trailer naked theyd only get dressed when they went outside inhaling deeply he smelled the sweet scent of shampoo fragrance on the humid air edwin kayleigh said a playful tone i made myself ready for you come look grinning he walked to the doorway and found her in front of the bathroom door fully clothed edwin sharp blinked then the smile vanished and he cried out in horror chapter no no no whatd you do shed found tiny bluntend fingernail scissors in the vanity kit hed bought tsa approved for air travel and therefore safe but they would still cut and thats just what shed done with them shed sheared off all her hair no he stared in horror at the pile of glistening blond strands on the bathroom floor as if looking at the body of a loved one kayleigh a two to threeinch mop of ragged fringe covered her head she hadnt showered at all shed spent the ten minutes destroying her beautiful hair in a mad singsong she mocked whats the matter edwin dont you like me now dont you want to stalk me anymore it doesnt matter does it you love me right it doesnt matter what i look like no no of course not its just he thought hed be sick he was thinking how long does it take for hair to grow ten years four months she could wear a hat no he hated women in hats i think it looks like you care a lot in fact you look real upset edwin why kayleigh why did you do it to show you the truth you love the girl on the album covers on cmt on the videos and the posters in entertainment weekly you dont love me at all remember that day we were alone in the theater in fresno you said my voice and hair were the best things about me maybe he could find somebody to take her hair and make a wig until it grew back how could he do that though theyd recognize him theyd report him no no no no no what was he going to do kayleigh taunted you want to fuck me now now that i look like a boy he walked forward slowly staring at the pile of hair here she screamed and grabbed a handful flung it at him it flowed to the floor and edwin dropped to his knees desperately grabbing at the strands i knew it she muttered contemptuously backing into the bathroom you dont know me you dont have a clue who i am and then he got angry too and the answer to her question was yes i do know youre the bitch im going to fuck in about sixty seconds he started to rise then saw something in her hand what oh it was just a cup it had to be plastic there wasnt anything inside that could be broken or made into a knife hed thought of that but one thing he hadnt thought of what the cup held ammonia from under the sink shed filled it to the brim the cut hair wasnt a message or a lesson it was a distraction he tried to turn away but kayleigh stepped forward fast and flung the chemical straight into his face it spread up his nose into his mouth he managed to save his eyes by half a second though the fumes slipped up under his lids and burned like redhot steel he cried at the pain pain worse than any hed ever felt pain as a creature an entity a thing within his body screaming falling backward wiping frantically at his face anything to get away choking gasping coughing it hurts it hurts it hurts then more pain as she hit him hard in the throat the wound where hed fired the bullet into his own neck he screamed again doubling over paralyzed he felt her rip the keys from his pocket he tried to grab her arm but she was quickly out of reach the bitter biting chemical flowed deeper into his mouth and nose he sneezed and spit and coughed and struggled to catch his breath edwin staggered to his feet and shoved his face under the faucet in the kitchen sink to rinse the terrible fire away but there was no water kayleigh had run the supply dry edwin stumbled to the refrigerator and yanked it open feeling for a bottle of water he found one and flushed his face the cold liquid little by little dulling the sting his vision though fuzzy returned he stumbled to the front door which shed closed and locked but he took a second key from his wallet and opened the door then hurried outside wiping his eyes he looked around he spotted kayleigh running down the road that led to the highway as the pain diminished edwin relaxed he actually smiled the road was three miles long gravel she was barefoot she wasnt going to get away chapter edwin started after her jogging at first then sprinting the terrible burn of the chemical had diminished his passion but not eliminated it he was all the more driven to fling her to the ground rip her jeans off then over onto her belly make her cry the way he was crying teach her who was in charge he saw her disappear around a curve in the road only a hundred feet away he was closing fast seventy feet fifty teach her that she was his and then he turned the corner he ran for ten more steps five three slowing slowing and then edwin stopped his shoulders sagging coughing hard from the run and the ammonia and he laughed he just had to kayleigh stood with two people a uniformed deputy and a woman who had her arm around the singer edwin laughed once more a deep hearty sound the sound his mother made when she was happy and sober the man was a deputy he recognized from fresno the one with the thick black mustache and the woman of course was kathryn dance the deputy held a pistol aimed squarely at edwins chest lie down he called lie down on your belly hands to your side edwin debated if i take one step ill die if i lie down ill go to jail thinking thinking in jail at least hed have a chance to talk to kayleigh possibly to see her shed probably come visit him maybe shed even sing for him they could talk he could help her understand how bad everybody else was for her how he was the man for her how he was mr today edwin sharp lay down as kathryn dance covered him with her pistol the deputy circled around cuffed his hands and lifted him to his feet could i get some water for my eyes please theyre burning the officer got a bottle and poured it over edwins face thank you other cars were arriving edwin said the news i heard on the newsyou thought we were in monterey why did you come here he was speaking to the dust and gravel but the person his words were intended for answered dance holstered her pistol and replied we have teams in monterey true but mostly for the press so youd think youd fooled us if you listened to the radio or went online to me it didnt make sense for you to go there why would you tell sally docking anything about a location unless you figured shed tell us eventually that is a pattern of yours you know misinformation and scaring witnesses into lying as for here csu found trace evidence near your house that could have come from a mining operation i remembered kayleighs song near the silver mine you knew she was unhappy bishop sold the place and it made sense you wanted to bring her back here we looked at some satellite pictures of the place and saw the trailer camouflage netting doesnt really work edwin reflected that kathryn dance was impressive but she quickly vanished from his thoughts entirely as he looked toward kayleigh standing defiant feet apart staring back coldly still he had the impression that there was a spark of flirt in her eyes as soon as her hair grew back shed be beautiful again god did he love her chapter at seventhirty that night kathryn dance was backstage at the convention center thered been talk about canceling the concert but curiously kayleigh towne was the one who insisted that it go on the crowds were rapidly filling the venue and dance sensed the same electricity that she remembered from her times on stage as a folksinger years ago there really was nothing like that utter exhilaration the power of voice and music in unison streaming from the speakers the audience yours the connection consuming once youve been up in front of the lights its easy to understand the addiction of having thousands of people in your spell the power the drug of attention affection need its why performers like kayleigh towne continue to climb up onstage despite the exhaustion the toll on families despite the risk from people like edwin stanton sharp the singer was dressed for the concertin her goodgirl outfit of course the only difference was that tonight she was the good girl whod just been playing softball with friends on her head a cal state fresno bulldogs cap covered her shorn hair at the moment she was off to the side banging in a new guitar she wouldnt perform on her favorite martin until it had been restrung and completely cleanedbecause of the human bone picks edwin had given her dance as unsuperstitious as they came couldnt blame her one bit she herself mightve thrown out the instrument and bought a new one well p k madigan wandered up accompanied by a short round woman of about forty she had a pretty face rooted forever in her high school years with big cheerful eyes and freckles framed by pageboycut brown hair dance found it charming that they held hands he introduced dance to his wife the cbis welcome in fresno anytime madigan told her provided youre the point person its a deal lets just hope you dont get any more cases like this one were gonna hear the concert he added dubiously or some of it long as it doesnt get too loud oh here he thrust a box into her hand dance opened it and laughed it was a fresno madera consolidated sheriffs office badge tin star she thanked him and resisted the urge to pin it to her green silk blouse madigan looked around grumpily and then said all righty then he led his wife to their seats it might have been dances imagination but he seemed to be looking for something in the back of the hall was it shadows or stalkers or ice cream vendors dance turned her attention back to kayleigh whod handed off the new guitar to tye slocum with some instructions the singer then spoke to the band about some lastminute changes in the order of who would take instrumental solos and when shed changed a verse in one of her original songs one that was meant for bobby now it included a few lines for alicia shed told dance that she was praying that she could get through the number without crying tye slocum shyly approached and told her the action had been adjusted as she wanted she thanked him and the big man waited a moment his generally evasive eyes snuck a glance or two at the singers face and then he headed off one might infer something suspicious from the expressions and kinesics but to dance all they revealed was a sheen of adoration which would forever remain unrequited but it was clear that he would never act on his secret hopebeyond microsecond glances and making sure her guitars were ready for battle tye slocum defined the difference between the normal and the mad it was then that a man in chinos and starched dress shirt without tie came up to kayleigh and dance he was in his midthirties and had a boyish grin curly black hair was losing the war against a shiny scalp kayleigh hi nothing more for a moment other than a polite nod to dance im art francesco both dance and kayleigh regarded him cautiously until his allaccess badge dangled forward hi kayleigh said absently dance assumed he was a friend of bishops she thought shed seen them talking earlier that night in the parking lot im so sorry about everythings that happened your dad told me what a terrible time but that guys in jail right yes thank god well just wanted to say how happy i am were going to do business together uhhum and who are you again he frowned art art francesco a pause and when she gave no reaction the man added your father mentioned id be coming tonight didnt he afraid he didnt he laughed isnt that just like bishopa genius you know sometimes details elude him a card appeared dance didnt have to be a kinesics expert to note the shock that went through kayleighs body the agent glanced at the singers hand the card was jbt global entertainment what do you mean doing business francesco licked the corner of his mouth well im sorry but what is this kayleigh snapped well i thought your father he didnt say he hadnt told you i just talked tell me what jesus christ look im sorry he said he was going to tell you this morning after we signed up everything but with that crazy man maybe he forgot or was distracted signed up what well you signed up you hes im sorry kayleigh oh shit i really thought you knew francesco looked miserable look why dont you talk to your father the singer stepped forward shed just survived a homicidal stalker she wasnt going to be put off by a suit from la you tell me now he just signed you with global hes not renewing with barry zeigler and your label what can he do that dance asked jaw set in anger kayleigh muttered yeah he can it was set up that way when i was a minor i never changed it but he never did anything that i didnt agree with until now francesco said oh but its a great deal kayleigh and the money you wont believe the money youve got hundredpercent creative control bishop and his lawyers drove a really tough bargain its a threesixty deal well handle all your concert tours your recordings production cds download platforms marketing advertising everything youll go international bigtime weve already got commitments from cmt and mtv and hbo is interested in a special that all happened just today after he signed up and starbucks and target both want exclusive albums this is taking you to a whole new level well get you into amphitheaters vegas london youll never have to play little places like this again this little place happens to be my hometown he held up his hand i didnt mean it that way its just thisll expand your career exponentially im sorry it happened this way kayleigh lets start over he extended his hand she ignored it bishop towne had seen the exchange and with a disgusted look on his face ambled over he said artie im sorry bishop i didnt know i thought youd told her yeah he growled stuff happened today didnt get around to it as dance expected bishops eyes dipped to the stage and remained focused there give us a minute artie sure im sorry kayleigh turned on her father how could you i told barry we werent talking to global i told him that kt he said in a soft rasp barrys part of the past that world is gone now record companies its the past he was loyal he was always there he made me platinum and in a few years there wont be any platinum not like there used to be its going to be downloads and tv and concerts and deals with retailers and airlines and ad agencies the industrys always been changing thats the way it works were in a new era thats a nice speech sounds like youve rehearsed it plenty her eyes narrowed and dance saw within them an anger and defiance that had never been present when speaking with her father she laughed coldly you think i dont see whats going on here this isnt about me its all about you isnt it me you fucked up your career you let your voice go to hell and now you cant sing or write your way out of a paper bag so what do you do you become the great impresario whats globals tagline going to be now appearing bishop townes daughter kt of course not thats whats barry going to do barry as if bishop hadnt thought about it hell change with the times or hell get into a new line of work or well have art find a place for him at global we still need producers so thats how you treat your friends its sure how you treated me isnt it you made me give up my she tailed off dance knew what was in her mind but the young woman wasnt going there now you made me give up so much just so you could stay in the industry it was the only way you could hang on she wheeled around and walked away he shouted kt she paused you wait just a minute there kayleigh turned back defiantly and bishop approached he regarded her not as a child but as a peer oblivious to onlookers he muttered youre acting like a spoiled little girl all right you want the truth yeah i asked your sister and congressman davis here to discourage you from canceling and yeah i cut the deal with global but why i did that its not about me and its not about you either you want to know what its about do you yeah tell me she snapped bishop pointed to the filling seats its about them kt the audience they are the only thing in the universe that matters i dont know what the hell youre saying what youve got comes along once or twice in a generation your voice your music your stage presence your writing do you know how rare that is you know how important his voice softened musics the truth nowadays kt we dont get answers from religion or politicians we sure as hell dont get em from tv news we get answers from music the whole world walks around with those little earplugs feeding songs into their brains why so they can learn the truth they need people who can put into words and music the answers they need people who take away their sadness make em understand everybody goes through lousy times too show em theres hope make em laugh and for you doing thats easy as fallin off a log it wasnt for me but it is for you tell me kt how many songs you think up in the last coupla days without even trying how many a dozen ill bet kayleigh blinked and dance saw that he was right thats a gift honey a mournful smile pushing you was never about me it was cause i knew you had that gift i knew youd be everybodys shadow kt im sorry you dont like it but thats the hand you got dealt you gotta play it he pointed out to the audience they need you then theyre gonna be pretty disappointed tonight because this concerts going on without me with that she was gone the two dozen people backstage were now all staring silently at the old man hed screwed up probably intentionally not telling her about the global deal so shed go ahead with the concert but dances heart went out to him he looked shattered but dances meditations on the towne family vanished at that moment she heard a familiar voice behind her hey there she turned well jon bolings common greeting just like his personality was easy friendly and more than a little sexy dance had always felt until now she stared blankly he gave a surprised laugh apparently assuming she was caught up in whatever drama was going on backstage at the momentall the somber faces and he stepped forward wrapping his arms around her she returned the pressure anemically feeling the weight of the blunt realization that hed come all the way herethree hoursto tell her he was leaving her and moving to san diego at least hes got the balls to tell me facetoface a line dance reflected wryly that had a good country beat to it though she guessed it wasnt the sort of phrase that would ever appear in a kayleigh towne song chapter you look more surprised than i thought you would boling said stepping back from the embrace he looked around an exaggerated frown on his face your secret lover must be here somewhere and dammit i bought a ticket you probably got him comped dance laughed though the sound only made her feel worse a reminder of the many good times theyd shared they walked to a deserted part of the backstage area boling looked around whats going on everybody okay hard to say she couldnt avoid the cryptic response he looked her over weve had the worst phone luck ive been doing tenhour days and you your mom said you were working on that kidnapping case some vacation you had hm my mother my spy and lincoln and amelia were here couldntve done it without them she told boling about the minute bits of trace that gave her the idea that edwin had taken kayleighs song to heart the one about growing up near a silver mine thats how we traced him boling leaned forward and kissed her quickly his lips firmly against hers her phone vibrated a glance downward it was michael oneil well hows that for some irony you have to get that ill let it go dance said good turnout he said i listened to one of kayleighs cds on the way here i cant wait for the show about that there may be a rain check situation and she told him about the blowup between father and daughter no you mean cancel the whole show looks like it the crew kayleighs band the local backup musicians a childrens choir everybody was standing around awkwardly heads and eyes pivoting engaged in a radar search for the centerpiece of the evening the sense of dread was evident kayleigh was the least temperamental performer on earth if she stormed out it was not diva drama with her in the trailer waiting to be coaxed back her absence probably reflected the sentiment in one of her early hits gone for good and its good to be gone bishop towne alone wiped his hands on his slacks it was five minutes past showtime the audience wasnt restless yet but they soon would be dance found her shoulders in a terrible knot she glanced back at bolings handsome face his thinning brown hair his perfect lips but she told herself feeling the spring steel of her soul flex within her shed lost one man to tragedy and she would far rather lose one this wayeveryone going forward in life healthy and with some vestige of affection something might work out in the future at least there wasntshe assumedsomebody else in his life she would make sure that boling and the children stayed in touch thank god they hadnt actually moved in together here snuck this in he handed her a starbucks cup and she smelled immediately that it contained red wine and since boling was the barista it would be a good one yes a nice malbec she deduced from a sipone of the varieties theyd been exploring lately at wine tastings in monterey and carmel theyd had so much fun on those nights kathryn dance told herself no tears that was nonnegotiable everything okay she explained tough case i was worried about you when we kept missing calls quit doing that she silently raged make me hate you he sensed her tension and backed off let go of her hand gave her space and that conscientiousness irritated her even more but then he decided it was time she could easily tell from his stance yes he probably wanted to wait before delivering the bad news but preferred to get it over with men did that either they never said anything personal and serious or they blurted it all out at the wrong moment boling said hey wanted to talk to you about something oh that tone god how she hated that tone she shrugged sipping some of the wine a big sip okay i know this is going to seem a little odd but for gods sake jon get on with it ive got my children to get back to my dogs my guests from new york and a friend here whos about to become the nemesis of people sorry im a little nervous about this jon its okay she said finding her voice surprisingly warm go on i know weve had a well sort of policy of not traveling with the kids not overnight well he seemed to realize he was stammering and now just blurted im thinking id like all of us to take a trip he looked away for this consulting gig they need me down in san diego for two weeksla jolla the company rented me a place near the beach its a month rental and they said i could keep it for a week or two after the jobs done so i was thinking we could all drive down see hearsts castle then go to lego land and disneyland for the kids well actually i want to go there too not lego land particularly but disneyland so what do you think a week in san diego all four of us a week he grimaced okay i know its hard for you to get off especially after you took some time now but if theres any way you could see its a fourbedroom place wed have separate rooms all of us you and me too but still its a good step forward with the kids i was thinking traveling together but not together together you know what i mean a week dance was stammering herself too hed be thinking i said that didnt i oh godthe move was temporary her mother hadnt gotten all the information he sensed her hesitation and said stoically no problem if thats too much time maybe you and the kids could fly down and we could spend a few days together i mean you could always come down alone but i dont know i thought it might be nice to take a family vacation those last two words were like lace trim flimsy yet hopeful i hey he stumbled back as she threw her arms around him both euphoric and utterly ashamed of her assumption which was based on the worst thing a law enforcer can be swayed byfaulty information she kissed him energetically yes yes yes well work it out id love to then she frowned but a favor sure of course she whispered can you and i get adjoining rooms sometimes the kids go to sleep early that can be arranged she kissed him once more just as her phone chirped this time oneil had sent a text signed the divorce papers enjoy the concert see you soon i hope oh brother she thought oh brother another ding she looked down xo michael she slipped the phone away and took bolings hand a problem he asked no she said no problems at all then the hulking form of bishop towne was approaching he paused and ignoring boling grunted to dance guess this is it he took a deep breath times like thesere when i really miss a drink guess i better go make a slew of people real unhappy he ambled out onstage there was of course a resounding thunderclap of applause and shouts this was mr country himself greeting them about to introduce his even more talented daughter he waved pandemonium dance and boling walked into the wings to see better as the spotlight found towne he looked diminished and old and in pain he squinted slightly hesitated and continued to an active microphone he scanned the crowd and seemed surprised there were so many people there though dance suspected that the savvy businessman would know the exact head count and box office receipts he rasped good evening yall i his voice caught and he started again i surely do preciate you coming out tonight bishop dance had noted had no southern accent when he was engaged in regular conversation now a twang of appalachia tinted his words more whistles and shouts and applause listen up listen up uhm i have an announcement id like to make there was a beat as the crowd grew silent expecting something was wrong perhaps related to kayleighs kidnapping earlier in the day and the other events of the past week collective dismay was starting to brew again we preciate your being here and appreciate all the support youve shown to kayleigh and the band and her family during this difficult time he cleared his throat once more as he said i gotta tell you the applause began again and kept going and kept going swelling swelling and became a force of its own within two or three seconds the entire crowd was on its feet howling clapping whistling bishop was confused what was this about dance too didnt have a clue until she looked stage left and saw kayleigh towne walking forward carrying a guitar and waving to the crowd she paused and blew them a kiss more unearthly sounds filled the concert hall glow sticks waved back and forth flashes from the prohibited cameras exploded like sunlight on choppy water dance noticed that suellyn and marygordon were now standing with sheri towne in the wings opposite watching kayleigh stride up to her father they werent alone art francesco from global entertainment was now with them and chatting warmly with sheri and her stepdaughter onstage bishop bent down hugged his daughter and she kissed him on his cheek kayleigh lowered a second microphone to her mouth and waited until the crowd grew silent thank you all thank you my daddy was going to tell you we have a big surprise for you tonight but i decided i couldnt let him get away with hogging the spotlight like he usually does huge laughter anyway what we want to do tonight is open the show with something we havent done for years a fatherdaughter duet a bit of south was in her own voice now more otherworldly applause she handed bishop the guitar and said yall probably know my daddys a better picker than me so im going to let him have the gitfiddle and sing and im going to do a bit of harmony now thiss a song that daddy wrote and used to sing to me when i was a little girl i think it was probably the first song i ever heard its called i think youre going to be a lot like me a glance his way and he nodded the faintest of smiles curling into his weathered face as the surge of applause and hoots settled bishop towne swung the guitar strap over his broad shoulders strummed to test the tuning and he and kayleigh adjusted the microphones then he looked behind him toward the band now in position noted that they were ready and turned his attention back to the thousands of expectant fans silent as thought he started tapping his foot leaned forward and counted out into the microphone one two three four your shadow you walk out onstage and sing folks your songs you make them all smile what could go wrong but soon you discover the job takes its toll and everyones wanting a piece of your soul chorus when life is too much just remember when youre down on your luck just remember im as close as a shadow wherever you go as bad as things get youve got to know that im with you always with you your shadow you sit by the river wondering what you got wrong how many chances youve missed all along like your troubles had somehow turned you to stone and the water was whispering why dont you come home chorus one night theres a call and at first you dont know what the troopers are saying from the side of the road then you see in an instant that your whole life has changed everything gone all the plans rearranged chorus you cant keep down smiles happiness floats but trouble can find us in the heart of our homes life never seems to go quite right you cant watch your back from morning to night chorus repeat chorus is it love is it less a warm autumn night the state fair in full swing we walked back to my place and sure enough one thing led to another and at dawn you were there your breath on my shoulder your hand in my hair just a week later it happened again i was sure that wed move to lovers from friends but that time i woke to a half empty bed and at least two months passed till i saw you again chorus is it left is it right is it east is it west is it day is it night is it good or the best im looking for answers im looking for clues there has to be something to tell me the truth im trying to know but i can just guess is it love between us is it love is it less i saw you and some girl on the street one day oh look heres my friend i heard you say but the friend that you meant wasnt her it was me and you took her hand pleased as could be then just a month later we meet for a beer we got to talking and then i hear you wonder out loud how life would be if you got married to someone like me chorus i read blogs and the papers i watch cable news but the more that i hear i get more confused which reminds me of us i simply cant tell if im immune or im under your spell chorus near the silver mine ive lived in la ive lived in maine new york city and the midwest plains but theres only one place i consider home when i was a kidthe house we owned life was perfect and all was fine in that big old house near the silver mine chorus the silver mine the silver mine i cant remember a happier time in that big old house near the silver mine i remember autumn pies in the oven sitting on the porch a little teenage lovin riding the pony and walking the dogs helping daddy outside splitting logs life was simple and life was fine in that big old house near the silver mine chorus it stewed in the summer and froze in the winter the floors were sure to give you splinters a little wind and wed lose the lights but nobody cared it just seemed right life was cozy and all was fine in that big old house near the silver mine chorus wed go to the mine and sneak up close to watch the train fill up with loads and wonder which nugget of shiny silver would become a ring for some girls finger the future was bright and life was fine in that big old house near the silver mine chorus there was always kin and pickers too from daddys band playing country and blues theyd clear a table to be a stage and get me up to sing and play life was good and all was fine in the big old house near the silver mine chorus my sis was born there and i was too and grandpa passed at eightytwo asleep upstairs neath grandmas quilt in the house that he himself had built to give his family a place real fine that big old house near the silver mine chorus the truth about men listen up sonny boy ive got some shocking news we girls we got some problems sure we sometimes get the blues we get a little crazy we fall head over heels we live to shop and drive for miles just for a good deal but one thing you can count on we tell it to you straight im overdrawn im leaving you ill be two hours late maybe its from playing cards but you guys sure do bluff dont you know that commandment thou shalt not make stuff up chorus men lie clap hands five times men lie last time that i looked one and one do not make three if thats your kind of math its not good enough for me men lie clap hands five times men lie youll call me in the morning youll be back home by eight youre gonna have just one more beer my mom and dad are great youve never touched a single joint you swear you sent that text you just need to cuddle the last thing you want is sex chorus you boysre cute you take us out you can make us laugh and nine times out of ten youre just big pussycats no i cant deny that most of you are fun you just got to work on problem number one chorus i found a note from stephanie you said you dated her but it was years and years ago the time was just a blur so i called her up and chatted about you and her of course when were you going to tell me you never got divorced chorus then fading out you fib you prevaricate you tell tall tales you fabricate it must be something in your genes or in your jeans men lie clap hands five times men lie another day without you i see you on the street holding someone elses hand shes acting like she owns youand thats more than i can stand i know that youre unhappy i see it in your eyes its clear that you dont love her that youre living in a lie chorus and its another day without you oh such lonely time but in just a little while im going to make you mine ever since we met im twice the girl i was nothing keeps me going the way your smile does we have our time together but its really not the same the thought you share a bed with her is driving me insane chorus ill steal you away i will steal you for good ill never have to share you well live the way we should it wont be too much longer until i set you free then ill never let you go ill keep you close to me chorus repeat chorus my red cadillac one saturday a while ago i went out for the night the music it was playing loud everything seemed right you smiled my way across the room and moved up really near we talked and laughed and then you said hey lets get out of here we walked outside and found my car i sped into the street the night was really perfect till i saw you werent too pleased whats wrong i asked slowing down before we got too far you said just wondering if you ever thought bout getting a new car chorus she gets gallons to the mile not the other way round and the tailpipe it really makes a pretty nasty sound the heater hardly works at all and forget about the air duct tapes been involved in most of her repairs but shes big and fast and solid and i know i can depend on her to always be there unlike a lot of men shes my red cadillac my red cadillac she gets me where im going and she always gets me back i love her like a sister shes my red cadillac this caddies got a history that goes back lots of years my daddy gave her to me as soon as i could steer shes the one whos moved me to a half a dozen states and come with me to weddings and funerals and dates she hasnt got a gps the windshields none too clear theres no pine tree freshener hanging from the mirror i dont reserve my sundays to polish wax and clean shes a wash and wear galan awful lot like me chorus this caddie is america made for fast and far i feel a patriotic spirit when im driving in this car weve been from north to south from sea to shining sea shes part of that tradition that made this country free that saturday a while go if youre wondering how it went i pulled up to the curb turned to that boy and said so long friend i think you better hitch a ride on back theres no better judge of men than this here cadillac chorus fire and flame im drawn to you like a moth to flame once we met i was never the same to reach that light moths fly for miles thats what id do just to see your smile chorus love is fire love is flame it warms your heart it lights the way it burns forever just like the sun it welds two souls and makes them one love is fire love is flame i know some boys as smooth as ice i cant deny some look real nice but i dont care if theyre slick and cool they dont ignite me like you do chorus some folks hook up not to be alone or they want babies and to make a home nothing wrong with that for them its fine but i like my furnace turned up high chorus you can keep those days in early spring a gentle autumns not my thing no i want sun and blaring heat sweaty love just you and me chorus the puzzle of your heart a quiet sunday the rain comes down hey you want to play a game i look around theres a jigsaw puzzle on the shelf a country scene some oldtime art of farms and fields and stacks of hay we pour some wine curl up and start chorus one piece there and one piece here some fall in place and some wont fit its just not clear how i can take these mismatched parts and put together the puzzle of your heart you want to stay you have to go i think i love you but im confused i just dont know sometimes you stay sometimes you run the past is good but the future looms lets have a baby or maybe not lets buy this place no we should move chorus the hours pass theres not much done the middles harder than we thought its been fun but the rains let up lets take a walk weve got an hour before its night oh youd rather watch the game i understand no its all right chorus i get back home and in the hall i find a note youre outside jogging after all i try a jigsaw piece or two but finally i admit defeat i guess thats how it often goes some puzzles we just cant complete chorus leaving home packing up the suitcase filling boxes to the brim years and years of memories trying to fit them in i never really thought that there might come a time when everything would change and id have to say goodbye chorus now im starting over starting over once again to try to make a new life without family or friends in all my years on earth theres one thing that i know nothing can be harder than to leave behind your home this room it was my daughters whos grown and lives nearby shes got babies of her own oh ill miss them till i cry this room is the one where my man and i would sleep or sometimes never sleep at all if you know what i mean chorus and heres the porch wed sit on after dinner every night my husband talked about his job and id tell him bout mine then dishes and some cleaning some homework and to bed and the joy of seeing sunrise as the day would start again chorus oh we had quite some parties to mark those special times christmases and easters and the fourth of july any cause for celebration but the best at least for me was my daughters graduation when she got her degree chorus we worked hard at our jobs and bought ourselves this home we gave back what we got and never hurt a soul but i guess i was just naïve and i didnt see the truth why judge people by their hearts its simpler to use rules now the bus drives through the gate at the border line and drops me off in juarez deported for the crime of loving the great usa as if she were my own i turn and say goodbye to whats been my only home chorus then in spanish america the beautiful o beautiful for spacious skies for amber waves of grain for purple mountain majesties above the fruited plain america america god shed his grace on thee and crown thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea o beautiful for pilgrim feet whose stern impassiond stress a thoroughfare for freedom beat across the wilderness america america god shed his grace on thee and crown thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea mr tomorrow you know me by now youve got to believe youre the numberone girl in the world for me ive sent her the papers and shes promised to sign itll just be a while these things take some time chorus and his words are so smooth and his eyes look so sad cant she be patient it wont be so bad but sometimes she thinks falling under his sway she got mr tomorrow she wants mr today love that new dress youre looking real hot lets go out dancing oh wait i forgot me and my buddy we got something to do but next week i promise its just me and you chorus hey i hardly know her shes only a friend weve had lunch once or twice and that was the end i wouldnt have left that receipt in my pants with something to hide why would i take that chance chorus what happened last night i was a fool i didnt mean it i was in a bad mood i wont drink again i promise youll see to think that i hit youyou know thats not me chorus sure i want babies i swear that its true pretty girls growing up to look just like you but waiting a whilethats what id prefer until were both ready what can it hurt chorus im in the mood for rock n roll slow tempo weve got a night together were sitting on the couch this doesnt happen often alone inside our house you open up a real nice wine the candle light is low were both thinking of romance and where the night might go chorus now baby baby babyyou better know its true im in the mood in the mood in the mood for rock n roll tempo and volume way up sometimes its the only way only way to fix your achin soul ditch the soft crank up the loud and go with rock n roll rock n roll rock n roll when youre down and when youre out and just cant be consoled get yourself in the mood the mood for rock n roll you know that im a good girl i dont do too much wrong i treat folks right work real hard playing tunes and writing songs but theres another side to me that you dont see a lot i like to kick my shoes off and get crazy and get hot chorus my ipods filled with pop and jazz and motown and with blues and soul and folk and hiphop not to mention country tunes but theres times i just cant help it i need a concert hall filled with glam and spotlights and speakers twelve feet tall chorus way up high in heaven the choir sits on clouds and plays their harps and trumpets and makes angelic sounds but i just have this
