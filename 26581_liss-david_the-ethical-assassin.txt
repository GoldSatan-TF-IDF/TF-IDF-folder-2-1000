david liss the ethical assassin chapter it was friday evening just after seven oclock and still bright as noon in florida august is perpetual relentless refusing to unclench its fist and despite the looming sunset it was close to a hundred degrees the heat settled in my body dull and enervating and it accentuated the smell that hung in the air a stink both tangible and elusive like the skin of grease on a cold bowl of stew it was more than a smell but a thing heavy enough to weigh like cotton balls shoved into the back of your throat a putrid miasma whirled and eddied through the streets of the trailer park i dont mean hotgarbagebythecurb smells rotting chicken carcasses and old diapers and potato peelings no such luck it smelled like a prison camp outhouse worse i stood there on the spiderwebbed concrete step leading up to the mobile home propping open the screen door with my shoulder sweat trickled down my side and clung to my overworked undershirt id been at it since a little after lunch and i was in a haze now an automaton lost in the blankness of ringing doorbells delivering my pitch lurching forward again i glanced left and right at the faded white mobile homes and thought it both amusing and profoundly sad that i couldnt remember coming down this street i wanted nothing more than to make it inside someones home to get out of the heat the trailers windowunit air conditioner hummed and rattled and almost bucked trickling condensation into an eroded gully of white sand i was overdressed for the heat and every few hours i needed a blast of ac like an antidote in order to keep up the fight id chosen my attire not for comfort but to look smart and to do business tan chinos wrinkles smoothed out by the humidity a thickly striped blueandwhite shirt and a squarecut knit turquoise tie maybe three inches wide it was and i thought the tie looked pretty cool i knocked again and then jammed my thumb into the glowing peach navel of the doorbell no answer the muted hum of a television or maybe a stereo barely pierced the door and i saw a slight rustle of the slatted blinds but still no answer not that i blamed them whoever they were squatting behind their sofa pantomiming shhhh with fingers pressed to lips i was on their stoop a teenager in a tie trying to sell them something they would think rightly so and who needed that then again who needed them it was a selfselecting system id been doing this for only three months but i knew that much already the ones who came to the door were the ones you wanted to come to the door the ones who let you in were the ones you wanted to let you in the heavy brown leather bag which my stepfather had given me reluctant permission to borrow from its mildewing box in the garage dug a trench into my shoulder touching the thing always made me feel dirty and it smelled like splitpea soup he hadnt used the bag in years but my stepfather had still thought it important to act putupon before he reluctantly agreed to let me clean out the mouse droppings and polish it with leather restorer i adjusted the strap to lessen the pain and plodded down the steps and along the old walkway that bisected the lawn really just an ocean of sand peppered with a few islands of crabgrass at the street i looked in both directions unsure which way to go which way id come from but down to my left i saw a flyer flapping lazily against the corner mailbox affixed with a long swath of dull silver duct tape the missing cat flyer id seen what two or three of those that day maybe twice as many missing dog flyers not all the same dog or cat either and i was sure id passed by this one already it had a photocopied picture of a white or tan tabby with dark splotches across its face its mouth open tongue barely visible anyone seeing a plump kitty named francine should call the number below i headed away from the flyer i was sticking to the same side of the street passing a vacant lot to get to the next trailer my legs defying the demand for pep from my brain moved slowly shuffling almost i looked again at my watch which hadnt much budged since just before i rang the bell at least four hours to go and i needed to rest i needed to be able to sit still for a while but that wasnt really it what i needed was relief from thinking about the job even a good nights sleep as if such a thing were possible but i could give up all hope of sleep it wouldnt happen on the road when i worked all day and half the night not at home on my one day off when there were errands to run and friends and family to see before the cycle began again id been operating on less than four hours a night for three months now how long could i do it bobby my crew boss said hed been doing it for years and he seemed okay i had no plans of doing it for years just one year that was all and that was plenty i was pretty good at the job more than pretty good and i made money but there i was seventeen years old and i could feel myself aging feel soreness accumulating in my joints feel a beleaguered rounding in my shoulders my eyes didnt seem to work as well my memory had begun to frazzle my bathroom habits were irregular it was the lifestyle id gone to sleep at home just outside ft lauderdale the night before the alarm had jerked me out of bed at six so i could get to the local office by eight where id sat in pep meetings until we all hopped in the car and headed out to the jacksonville area checked into a motel and got to work another standard weekend gets under way tires rumbled behind me and i instinctively veered over toward the empty lot careful to avoid the nests of fire ants and the prickly weeds that would find their way to my dark gray gym socks which only a seventeenyearold could convince himself passed for respectable as long as no one saw the sporty stripes keeping over to the side was the smart thing in places like this locals wouldnt have to look at me twice to see that i was way out of my element they would throw mostly empty beer cans or swerve at me halfplayful and halfhomicidal they would shout things and i thought it a pretty good guess they were withering insults insults that would sting like salt in my eyes if i could hear them but theyd be garbled against the whoosh of a speeding truck and the crackling speakers blasting special i didnt know if the other guys had to put up with the same crap but i doubted it a dark blue ford pickup rolled to a stop it looked freshly washed and its paint glistened like a tar pit in the glare of the almost setting sun the passengerside window lurched down and the driver a guy in his thirties with a black tshirt learned over toward the window he looked handsome in an odd way like the debonair guy in a cartoon out to steal the heros girl but like a cartoon character he was oddly distorted he was puffy not fat or heavy or anything just puffy like a corpse beginning decomposition or a man suffering from an allergic reaction the puffiness was weird sure but what i mostly noticed was his hair he kept it sheared to almost a military cut but in the back it came down in a straight fan to his shoulders today they call this style a mullet in id never seen a mullet before had no idea what a mullet was what it was called or why someone might choose to endure such a thing except for the simple thrifty pleasure that comes from having two haircuts on one head all i knew was that it looked monumentally stupid where you going the guy asked his voice buckled under the weight of his syrupy accent uniquely florida half pecan pie half key lime we were about thirty miles outside of jacksonville and heavy accents were par for the course id lived in florida since the third grade and had long been afraid of just about everyone outside a major urban center in no way did i consider this cowardice but common sense despite the popular belief that big cities like ft lauderdale and jacksonville and miami were nothing but suburbs of new york or boston they were in reality dense with longtime florida natives a vocal minority of whom included confederate flag wavers dixie hummers and cross burners these cities were also full of transplants from all over the country so things balanced out reasonably well step out to the boonies and the flavor became considerably less cosmopolitan i now stood as far as i was concerned in the boonies which meant that the iridescent kick my jew ass sign on my forehead visible only to those who preferred hank williams jr to sr began to throb and fire off sparks i conjured a polite smile for the pickup driver but the smile turned out badly crooked and sheepish for an instant i considered giving the guy my line about how i was in the neighborhood to speak with parents about education but i knew instantly it was a bad idea puffy guy with his weird hair and his pampered pickup radiated a low tolerance for bullshit my crew boss bobby could probably get away with the pitch hell bobby would probably score off the guy but i was not bobby i was good maybe the best guy in bobbys crew maybe the best guy bobby had found in a long while but i wasnt bobby im selling i said with a startling realization like the flip of a switch that i wasnt merely uneasy i was afraid even in all that heat i felt cold and my muscles had begun to tense doortodoor i added i took the bag off my shoulder and set it down between my black dress sneakers the man leaned a little farther toward me and grinned a mouth full of haphazardly arranged teeth the two front ones in particular were long like a rabbits but widely spaced and moving in opposite directions their crookedness stood out all the more for their unusual even radiant whiteness i wished i hadnt seen them because now i had to try not to stare you got a permit for that he yanked at something between his legs and came up with a nearly full bottle of yoohoo which he put to his lips for a good ten seconds when he set it down again the bottle was now more than halfempty i suppose an optimist would say it was halffull a permit id never heard of such a thing did i need a permit bobby hadnt said anything about it hed merely dropped me off and told me to hit the trailer park hard bobby loved trailer parks i had to stay focused act confident presume this guy wouldnt try anything too crazy not in the middle of the street albeit a sinisterly deserted street my boss told me to sell here i said looking at the pavement rather than his teeth i didnt ask who told you to do nothing the guy said shaking his head with sadness at the poor state of things i asked if you had a permit i tried to tell myself i shouldnt be so afraid nervous sure anxious guarded alert you bet but this was like being ten years old again caught in the nasty neighbors yard or messing around with your friends fathers power tools do i need one the guy in the pickup fixed his gaze on me he curled his upper lip into a half pucker half scowl answer the question boy you stupid i shook my head partly in disbelief and partly in answer to his question i dont have a permit i said i tried to look away again but his eyes were bearing down on me then the redneck burst into a huge crookedtooth grin well its a good thing you dont need one then aint it it took me a minute to understand what had happened and then i forced a nervous attempt at an imagoodsport laugh yeah i guess it is you listen up you best stay out of trouble you know what happens to people caught breaking the law round here theyre asked to squeal like pigs i tried to keep it from coming out but despite my fear it slipped through my grasp and got away from me it could happen to anyone the rednecks dark eyes went narrow over his long nose you being a smartass what the hell kind of question was that could there be any explanation for what id said other than smartassedness i decided not to point that out when people say that they had the metallic taste of fear in their mouth that metal is generally copper my mouth tasted like copper just keeping things light i managed along with a forced expression of calm and affability whats a smartass like you doing out here anyhow why aint you in your college im trying to earn money for college i told him hoping my industry would impress him it didnt aint you something college boy am i going to have to come out of here and smack you in the pussy there was of course no dignified way to answer that question maybe bobby would be able to shrug it off crack some selfeffacing joke to make the guy in the pickup like him next thing you know theyd be laughing like old friends not me the only thing i could think of was groveling or to imagine an alternate universe version of me the lem who would walk over to the open window and pound the guy in the face until his nose burst and his stupid haircut was matted with blood the lem in this universe didnt do that sort of thing but it always seemed to me that if i could do it once if i could be the sort of person who might beat the living shit out of a jerk giving me a hard time then that fact would be written on my body my face in my walk and i wouldnt be once again under the thumb of a bully high on his own power over me i dont think so i said at last i dont think a pussy slapping is in the most technical sense necessary youre a little doofus you know that the guy said and he rolled up his window thick arms rotating as he cranked the handle he took a clipboard from the passenger seat and began looking over some papers after licking his thumb and index finger as if they were lollipops he pushed back a few sheets his two wild front teeth protruded from his mouth and began to rake in his lower lip doofus not the worst thing id ever been called but it stung in its banality on the positive side however the redneck rolled up his window so my fear began to abate a little until it became a low throb i had been dismissed and it was time to get going though the creepy redneck was still keeping an eye on me so i hoisted the bag back onto my shoulder and walked to the next trailer this one gray with green trim the lot like all the others was a patch of sand and grass weeds encroaching from the far borders a sicklylooking palm tree hunched in the front yard with a medicinal cup thrust into the trunk like an old mans corncob pipe the front windows had pulldown shades like civilized people put in bedrooms but they werent extended all the way down even from the street i could see light inside and the flicker of television no lawn furniture no toys no garish welcome mat there was nothing moochie that was the bookman word the word bobby had taught us the bookman loves moochie moochie is plastic kiddie crap scattered everywhere moochie is garden gnomes wind chimes excessive and early or late holiday decorations anything that suggested that here lived people who liked to spend money they didnt have on things they didnt need spending money on things their kids didnt need well that was about as moochie as it got driving his crew around bobby would sometimes do a sort of seated jig when he saw a house with an aboveground plastic swimming pool with an attached plastic slide a blind monkey could close those guys hed announce his big moon pie face which was always radiant would light up so youd need to put on your sunglasses to look at the guy man thats moochie but this trailer before me had been untouched by mooch if the pickup hadnt still been parked there i would likely have skipped the house bobby said never to skip knocking on the door of a loser doesnt take but a minute and you never know more than once id sold at places without a hint of moochiness but it was getting late now and i was tired and i wanted matching big wheels or a naked barbie or a company of toy soldiers crawling prone through the quang tri province of the lawn anything to make me feel i was on the right track in the absence of moochiness however id take sanctuary so i propped open the screen door feeling a few tablespoons of sweat drop from my armpit down to my midtorso two small green lizards sat motionless on the other side of the gray mesh one bobbed up and down its scarlet throat fan flashing warning or love or something i knocked while the lizards stared with their little bullet heads cocked then i heard a distant shuffle of movement the slightest hint of sound to which this job had made me sensitive it took a moment before a woman came to the door she propped it open just a little glanced at me and then looked to the pickup in the street what is it she asked in a harsh half whisper that nearly knocked me back in its urgency and desperation she was young but getting old in a hurry her face pretty at least in theory was splattered with light freckles and punctuated by a pert little nose but her eyes the brown of the rednecks yoohoo were raked with deep crowsfeet and underscored by extraordinarily dark rings her fine beachsandcolored hair was pulled back in a ponytail that could be either youthful or haggard there was something about her expression she reminded me of a balloon from which the air was slowly leaking not so that you could see it deflate or hear its flatulence but youd leave that balloon looking fine and come back in an hour to find it drooping and slack i pretended i didnt notice her misery and i grinned the grin hid my hunger my thirst my boredom my fear of the bucktoothed redneck in the ford pickup my hopelessness in the absence of visible moochiness my despair at the thought that bobby would not come by the kwick stop to pick me up for another four hours at least id already scored that day getting into a house in my first hour out id made right there just like that from those poor assholes not poor as in sadsack but poor as in illfitting clothes broken furniture leaking kitchen faucet and a refrigerator empty but for wonder bread offbrand bologna miracle whip and coke let me be absolutely clear about this not once not one single time no matter how happy i was to make a sale did i ever do it without the acid tinge of regret i felt evil and predatory and often enough i had to bite back the urge to walk out halfway through the pitch because i knew the prospects couldnt afford the monthly payments they would pass the credit app i was almost sure of it but when it came to paying the bills theyd have to trade in the coke for generic cola so why did i keep doing it in part because i needed the money but there was something else something bigger and more seductive than money drawing me in i was good at sales good at it in a way id never been good at anything in my life sure id done well in school on my sats that sort of thing but those were solitary activities this was public communal social i lem altick was getting the best of others in a social situation and let me tell you that was new and it was delicious i would look at the prospects slouching into their sofa people whod never done anything to hurt me and i had them i had them and they didnt even know it theyd hand over the check and shake my hand theyd invite me back ask me to stay for dinner ask me to meet their parents half the people i tricked into buying told me if i ever needed anything if i ever needed a place to stay i shouldnt hesitate they lapped up everything i served and evil or not it felt good it made me ashamed but it still felt good now i wanted another one the company offered a bonus for a double and i wanted to rack up another score before i saw bobby again of course i wanted the money for the day would be pretty satisfying and id done it before my very first day on the job in fact an act that had all but anointed me the new boy wonder the truth was i loved the look on bobbys face the happy surprise the sheer giddiness of his expression i couldnt have said why bobbys approval was so important it even troubled me that i cared so much but i did care hi there im lem altick i told the gaunt sortofprettysortofbitter woman and im in your neighborhood today talking to parents trying to get some feedback on how they feel about the local schools and the quality of education do you by any chance have children maam she blinked at me a couple of times appraising sorts of blinks the lizards were blinking too but more slowly and their eyelids came up from the bottom yeah she said after a moment to think her gaze went right past mine and toward the blue pickup which was still parked alongside the road i got kids but they aint here and may i ask how old they are she blinked again this time more suspiciously it had been only a couple of years since a boy named adam walsh had disappeared from a mall in hollywood florida his head had been found a couple of weeks later a few hundred miles to the north nobody had ever again looked the same way at kids or at strangers who showed an interest in kids seven and ten her hand gripped the side of the door more tightly and her fingers went white around her chipped fuchsiapolished nails she was still looking at the ford those are great ages arent they not that i knew id never spent much time around kids since being one myself and in my experience those ages were as unredeemably rotten as the rest still parents liked to hear that sort of thing or at least i figured they did so if your husband is home i was hoping i might be able to take just a few minutes to ask you some questions for a survey then ill be out of your hair youd like to answer a few questions about your ideas on education wouldnt you you with him she asked gesturing toward the pickup with a flick of her first two fingers i shook my head no maam i am here in your neighborhood to talk to parents about education what are you selling not a thing i told her i feigned a slight almost imperceptible surprise me ask you to buy something how very silly im not a salesman and if i were id have nothing to sell you im just asking some questions about the local educational system and your level of satisfaction the people i work for would love to hear what you and your husband have to say wouldnt you like to tell us what you think of the local schools she pondered this for a moment clearly unfamiliar with the idea that anyone could possibly care what she had to say id seen the look before i dont have the time she said but thats exactly why you should talk to me i said using a technique called the reverse you told the prospect that why they couldnt do it or why they couldnt afford it was exactly the reason they could then you dug deep and came up with a reason that it was true you know studies show that the more time you dedicate to education the more free time you have i made that up but i thought it sounded reasonable i guess she did too she glanced again over to the ford and then back to me fine she pressed open the screen door the lizards held their ground i followed her inside the fear of the redneck now almost forgotten in the excitement of a looming commission i had not been doing this long not compared with bobbys five years but i knew getting inside the house was the hardest part i might go days without anyone letting me in but id never once made it in without making the sale not once bobby said that was the sign of a real bookman and thats what i was turning out to be a real bookman i stood in the trailer me this desiccated woman and her still unseen husband only one of us was going to walk out of there alive chapter inside the smell of old cigarettes replaced the stench of garbage and filth everyone in my family smoked cigarettes every last relative with the exception of my stepfather who smoked cigars and pipes id always hated the odor hated the way it seeped into my clothes my books my food when i was young enough to still bring a lunch to school my turkey sandwich would smell like lucky strikes my mothers improbable brand the woman who also smelled of cigarettes and had nicotine stains on her fingers told me her name was karen the husband looked younger than she did but also like he was aging faster and i could see his balloon would be out of air before hers like karen he was unusually thin with a hollowedout look to him he wore a sleeveless ronnie james dio shirt that showed bony arms insulated with layers of wiry muscles straight reddish hair fell to his shoulders in a southernfried rock cut he was goodlooking in the same way as karen which was to say he might have been more appealing if he didnt give the impression of someone who hadnt eaten slept or washed in the better part of a week he came in from the trailers kitchen holding a bottle of killians red by its neck as though he were trying to strangle it bastard he said then he switched the bottle to his left hand and held out his right for shaking i wasnt sure why he would call me a bastard so i held back bastard he repeated its my name its a nickname really it aint my real name but its my real nickname i shook with what i considered an appropriate amount of skepticism so whered you find this guy bastard asked his wife it came out just a little too fast a little too loud to be goodnatured with a tic of the neck he flung back his longish hair he wants to ask us some questions about the girls karen had wandered into the kitchen separated from the living room by a short bar she gestured with her head toward me or maybe toward the door the two of them were jerking their heads around as if they were in a devo video bastard stared the girls huh you look too young to be a lawyer or a cop i attempted a smile to mask the kudzu creep of alarm working over me its nothing like that im here to talk about education bastard put his arm around my shoulder education huh thats right the arm came off almost right away but the inside of the trailer was beginning to feel more dangerous than outside id seen some weird stuff inside peoples homesfaces of death videocassettes mixed in with the mickey mouse cartoons a jar of used condoms on a coffee table even a collection of shrunken heads once but this weirdly intimate moment put me on my guard i didnt leave though because the redneck was surely still out there and that made it a loselose deal might as well stay where there was a chance of closing a deal not much of a chance though i took a guarded look at the trailer it was the kind of place that warded off salesmen the way garlic warded off vampires they had no toys scattered around no empty cases from kids videos or coloring books or haphazard lego towers they had no toys of any kind and there wasnt much in the way of adult crap either there were no plastic hanging plants or notavailableinstores garish cuckoo clocks or oil paintings of clowns instead they had a beige couch and a phenomenally not matching blue easy chair and a cracked glass coffee table full of beer bottles and beer bottle rings and coffee cup stains a single coffee mug white with oldham health services printed in bold black letters rested against the glass in such a way that i felt sure it would take both hands to pry it off the coffee inside had condensed into tar in the kitchen the linoleum floor the kind of tan that looked dirty when clean and extra dirty when dirty was chipped and peeling and in places curling up in one spot it had rolled up over a white towel and looked like a yodels yet despite it all there was some small reason to hope yes their stuff was absolutely awful and yes they clearly had no money except except a chipped lladró a ballerina in midtwirl sat on top of the television maybe it had been a gift or inherited from a grandparent or found by the trash it didnt matter it was a lladró and lladrós were gold lladrós were moochie the spirit of mooch no matter how diminished and repressed dwelled within bastard now put a hand on my back so youre like asking parents questions about their thoughts on education something like that had he heard me at the door thats right about education and your kids the kids who i noticed left no hint that theyd ever passed through their own home so what you selling a spark of amusement flashed in his dull eyes im just here to ask questions about education im not here to sell okay see you later jerkoff theres the door get out i was about to open my mouth to observe politely that his wife had said she wanted to take the survey and after all it would only be a few minutes but i didnt get that far karen pulled him aside to the bedroom where they exchanged some heated and hushed words in a minute or two they came out and bastard had a plastic grin on his face sorry about that he told me i guess i didnt realize how much karen wanted to talk about you know education he slapped my back you want a beer just water or soda or something if you dont mind no problem buddy bastard said with an enthusiasm that frightened me more than the shoulder squeezing karen led me to the kitchen card table where she directed me to sit with my back to the door in a metal folding chair the kind they brought out for ad hoc municipal gatherings in school gymnasiums she made some uneasy small talk and handed me lemonade in another oldham health services coffee cup i still felt a phantom tingling on my shoulder where bastard had grabbed me but the anxiety was beginning to dissipate they were strange strange and unhappy but almost certainly harmless i tried not to drink the lemonade in a single gulp this who you work for i asked gesturing toward the coffee cup i didnt direct the question toward either of them in particular bastard shook his head let out a little noise something short of a laugh nah we just have them theyre nice i said nice and thick keep the coffee warm i waited a moment to let the idiocy of my words dissipate what do you folks do karen used to waitress some bastard told me till her back started to bother her im the site manager for a hog farm site manager sounded impressive enough as though theyd be able to make the payments at least which was all i needed i unfastened the strap of my bag and took out one of the photocopied survey sheets i set my papers on the kitchen table next to the basket of plastic fruit another faint hint of moochiness there and asked bastard and karen the questions when id been in training id balked at first seeing them sure anyone with a pulse would smell the bullshit a mile off but bobby had laughed assured me that this sales pitch had been designed by experts it was one of the most successful pitches ever devised having sold for three months now i had no problem believing it would your child benefit from greater access to knowledge would you be happier if your child was learning more do your children have questions left unanswered by their education the last one was my personal favorite do you believe that people continue to learn even after they complete their schooling they say you learn something new every day bastard announced cheerfully isnt that right hell just last week i learned i was even stupider than i thought he let out a big laugh and then slapped his leg then he slapped my leg not hard but even so karen watched bastard there was a kind of suspicion there even a wariness if i had not known they were married i might have thought theyd never met before as it was i figured they were well on their way to petty claims divorce court not the best environment in which to sell but pickings were at the moment slim i dutifully wrote down their answers and took a moment to review the responses to study them i put on a serious face knit my brow contemplated the gravity of their answers all right i said i just want to be sure i understand you now so you think that education for children is important sure bastard said karen i asked yeah she nodded this was all part of the pitch make them agree as much and as often as possible get them in the habit of saying yes and theyll forget how to say no and you think that items products or services that aid in a childs education are good ideas bastard karen they both agreed you know i said with an expression of puzzled amazement i hoped it looked spontaneous but id practiced it in the mirrorlooking over all of this it seems like you two are just the sort of parents my employers would love to have me talk to you obviously care a great deal about your childrens education and you have a deep commitment to seeing that their educational needs are met my company has sent us out here to try to measure the level of interest for a product they intend to introduce in this area now karen bastard since you two are obviously such educationoriented parents it occurs to me that youre exactly the sort of people ive been authorized to show a preview of these products assuming of course youre interested do you think youd like to look at something that is beautiful affordable and best of all will significantly increase the education and ultimately income potential of your children okay bastard said karen said nothing the lines around her eyes deepened her cheeks collapsed and her thin lips parted as she began to speak i would not let her id never been asked to leave at this point but i knew perfectly well that it could happen that it would happen here if i let it outside the redneck in the pickup might still be waiting and i didnt want to find out one way or the other let me tell you up front i said barely managing to beat her to the punch that ive got a lot of people i need to see in this area im happy to take the time out to show you this stuff but first we need to make a contract the three of us if at any point you lose interest or you think that its not the sort of educational tool youd like to provide for your children just let me know ill get up and leave i dont want to waste your time and im sure you understand that i dont want to waste my time either so can you promise me that the minute you dont want to see any more youll speak up thats fair isnt it fair bastard let out a loud phlegmy snort congress never passed a law saying life had to be fair not unless youre a spanish a black a woman or a congressman i smiled politely doing my best to appear nonjudgmental another skill id honed over the past three months cmon bastard lets be serious its fair isnt it sure fair he agreed he looked up at the ceiling and let out a long sigh how about you karen do you think you would be able to tell me if you lose interest in these valuable educational tools that will improve the quality of your childrens lives she exchanged a look with her husband and then reached over to the counter for a pack of virginia slims and a cherry red bic yeah sure okay then you guys ready just another gratuitous yes question we said were ready bastard grumbled toward the ceiling i nodded in the kindly but authoritative way bobby had taught me and reached into my bag for the first brochure a glossy colorful little booklet with a couple of wellgroomed successfullooking kids spread out on a carpeted floor with their books these were kids like they would never raise in all likelihood never know these were the kids they wanted instead of the ones they had and that made bastard and karen the perfect candidates for me bobby had taught us that there was pretty much no way to sell books to comfortable suburbanites it had taken me a while to understand but i understood now karen and bastard looked at their first pamphlet and soaked in their first glimpse of the future of their children and they saw what they were supposed to see a different life the kids in the pamphlets werent the ignorant illbehaved destructive children of ignorant illbehaved destructive adults they werent living in trailer park squalor but lounging in affluent suburban bliss they laughed and played and learned their inner potential and outer grooming nurtured by unceasing exposure to wonderful tomes of secret knowledge the ability to discover the five principal exports of greece or the social structure of bonobo groups or the mysterious history of the mayan empire would make everything different the mere proximity to books that contained these glorious facts and more meant the difference between success and failure i managed a quick peek at my watch almost seventhirty now i was confident that by ten oclock these people would be financing a set of encyclopedias the resistance not surprisingly came from the aptly named bastard i made it through the bonus books the handbook of emergency health care the field guide to local wildlife the compendium of educational games for kids but hadnt yet reached the presentation of the sample volume of champion encyclopedias when id had about all i could take of bastard he interrupted me made fun of the books imitated my voice tickled his wife tried to tickle me once got up to make a sandwich now i said holding up the childrens history of the united states you can see how this is the sort of book your children would find educational and would improve their understanding of american history cant you yeah said karen somewhere along the way consumer longing had taken the place of blank apathy the rugged skepticism on her face had smoothed away and her lips had parted not in preparation to object but in slack acquisitive desire you think theyll ever have a woman president bastard asked i bet shell be a real honey with big knockers great big knockers man bigger than karens anyhow and you understand dont you that an improved understanding of american history will be of use to your children i asked yeah karen said jamming a cigarette smoked down to the scorched filter into the makeshift ashtray the bottom third of a tornopen pepsi can whose jagged edges she avoided with grace theres all kinds of tests in school where they have to know those things and that book would help them get better grades shed learned along the way that i liked to hear concrete examples of how the books would help and she was now working hard to come up with good ones but will it get them dates thats what i want to know bastard said maybe if id known all about ben franklin and betsy ross id have gotten laid more in school id been working against it since id started the pitch but there was only so much cheer i could maintain it was just common sense that i wasnt going to make the sale without bastard and i wasnt going to get bastard without breaking him i had to do something so i reached for a move bobby had told me about it had sounded so brilliant when hed explained it id been looking for an opportunity to try it i let out a sigh you know what i said clearly these materials are not for you bastard i asked you to let me know if you werent interested but it seems like you havent been honest with me its okay that youre not interested these materials wont appeal to every parent some are just more education oriented than others and thats fine i only wish you hadnt let me sit here for so long wasting all of our time then i began to gather my things not slowly so as to seem like i wanted to be pulled back but with the wooden determination of a lawyer whod just lost a trial and wanted to get the hell out of the courtroom wait said karen im interested what the fuck bastard said let the little shit go bastard apologize the wife ordered i want them what the fuck for the girls he sneered well send them her voice sounded small pathetic then something shifted and she sounded hard apologize or i swear to christ ill tell him everything i didnt know who the him might be but i knew it wasnt me and i was beginning to get the sense id walked into the middle of something and my best bet was to cut my losses and get the hell out with stoic calm i placed the last book into my bag and stood bastard do it he let out a sigh im sorry lem okay its not that im not interested i just dont like to sit still for so long go easy on me buddy show us the rest please stay said karen her voice had become small the voice of a child begging for education please sir may i learn some more i nodded slowly a sage weighing his options id been willing to bail but now i saw this was a clear victory the real trick was to keep from grinning theyd begged me to stay they might as well just take out the checkbook now and save everyone the time by a quarter to ten id spread everything out on the table right next to the wrecked soda can crammed full of lipstickringed cigarette butts it was all there the books and brochures the pricing sheet the payment schedule and of course the credit application the allimportant app karen had taken out the checkbook for the down payment like my own mother fastidious before the tranquilizers she filled out the receipt portion prior to writing the check and she did it with torturous slowness i wanted it in my possession i wanted it done until they handed over the check there was always the chance theyd back out i didnt want to let it get to where the check might break the deal id closed this deal before even mentioning the check i had karen hungry starving for these books id broken bastard who now sat without making a sound other than a strangely wheezy breathing as though he were winded from the act of respiration itself he looked at me with big moist eyes hoping for approval and i shoveled the approval out in spades karen pressed down one pinktipped finger and tore the check along the perforated edge then held it out to me she might have set it on the table but she wanted me to take it from her hand id seen it before it always happened late in the sale encyclopedia sales had allowed me to shed my high school skin my loser skin and turn into something else something that some women found even a little sexy because i had power the bookman has power the way a teacher or a political candidate or the lead in a production of our town has power its the power of the spotlight i was young and had energy and enthusiasm and i had come into her home and given her reason to hope she didnt exactly want to sleep with me and didnt exactly not want to i understood it with absolute clarity i had just about put my fingers on the check when i heard the front door open i didnt turn around in part because i wanted that check and in part because id trained myself not to look at visitors not to listen to phone calls this wasnt my house and it wasnt my business i didnt stray from the check grab at least not until i saw karens eyes go wide and her face go pale and her mouth form into the comical surprise of an o at the same moment bastard toppled over along with his chair felled by an invisible punch a punch that left a gaping hole a dark and bloody hole in the middle of his forehead now i heard it a puffy squeak of air and karen fell over too not the whole chair just karen out of her seat and onto the floor the second shot hadnt been as neat as the first and above her eyes it looked as though someone had smashed her with the claw end of a hammer blood began to pool around hair on the beige linoleum floor the air was full of something sharp and nasty cordite i didnt know what cordite was i couldnt even remember how i knew the word but i knew thats what i was smelling the stink assaulted me along with the horrible understanding two shots had been fired two people hit in the head two people had been murdered i wasnt supposed to be here id been accepted into columbia university but my parents had refused to pay i was raising money thats all i just wanted money for college none of this had anything to do with me and i squeezed my eyes shut wishing it away but it wasnt going anywhere i turned around chapter only a few days before i came to town with the bookmen jim doe had been getting restless hed told himself to lay off the risks just werent worth it but then hed be in his prowl car watching the drivers go by sometimes too lazy to stop an asshole going ten or even fifteen miles over the limit doing that hed get horny as hell just something about sitting there the radio on low volume with the oak ridge boys or alabama warbling out their bullshit the smell of burger king french fries congealing the sharp tang of chocolate and rebel yell coming from his spiked bottle of yoohoo it reminded him of exactly what he knew he oughtnt do it was instinct after all you couldnt ask a wolf to stop being a wolf he saw a sexred sports car that looked damn near perfect and doe set those lights flashing and the siren wailing the sound alone gave him a monster stiffy and he felt like he was seventeen again i can sense the grumbling how you are wondering do i know all this am i secretly jim doe in addition to being lem altick is this a multiplepersonality story its not but the events of this weekend were significant in my life just about as significant as it gets and ive invested massive quantities of time in talking to the survivors the people who escaped the people who evaded the cops the cops they evaded those who went to jail and those who avoided jail ive talked to them all ive synthesized it so i feel i have a reasonably good idea what was going on in jim does head besides youve read those memoirs you know the ones i mean the poor irish childhood ones where the writer recalls with preternatural clarity which hat his aunt siobhan wore to his seventh birthday party and what the cake tasted like and which relative gave him the orange for a present and which the hardboiled egg im not buying it no one remembers that kind of detail its all creative license to flesh out a true story so thats what im doing its my story and im going to tell it the way i want to tell it so back to jim doe and the red sports car the driver wasnt as goodlooking as doe had been hoping but she was in her twenties early thirties at the most she had big curly blond hair which he liked and she was dressed kind of sexy in one of those collarless tshirts that the women had all been wearing since flashdance none of that compensated for her big nose and fat lips all smashed against her face and her eyes which were too small for her head still hed stopped her might as well see what was what it was already getting dark he ought to be over at pams place by now it was jennys birthday and he guessed he should go by and bring her something she was four now and shed known what a birthday was for a couple of years and it would probably be a big deal if her father didnt get her a present hed hear about it from pam if he didnt show not only that hed have to hear it from that fucking bitch aimee toms sooner or later hed see aimee out at the thirsty bass or the sports hut or the dennys and shed come sit down and look ohsosad and smile a little and tell him how disappointed jenny had been on her birthday that her daddy didnt get her nothing she had that attitude all the assholes at the sheriffs department had it but aimee had it most of all she turned up her nose at him aimee turning up her nose at him unbelievable if she knew so much how come she looked like a dyke answer that one so shed come over her linebacker shoulders all squared off and shed shake her head or maybe his hand she wasnt trying to tell jim what to do of course it was awkward but she was pams friend and a cop and she knew how it was for both of them lots of cops got divorced but the children the children were the important thing maybe if someone ever got drunk enough to get her pregnant shed know if children were important or not of course doe didnt much like to think about that time he had been drunk enough to go after her when hed grabbed her ass and started singing amy what you gonna do that godawful pure prairie league song she had just wiggled out of his grasp like she was the queen of england or because she liked women he supposed like pam aimee was probably getting it on with his exwife what kind of a crazy world was this anyhow so if she tried any of that jim knew how hed handle himself pretty simple really hed take out his gun and blow the back of aimees head right off bam just like that oh shit aimee wheres the back of your head lets you and me try to find it together you know as pams friend and as a cop getting sneered at by aimee toms nothing but a county cop who thought she could push him around doe was chief of fucking police here and mayor how much money was she taking in maybe thirty a year if she was lucky if she took a little on the side which she would never do of course because that would be wrong let pam be her little dyke friend she could be jennys father and save him the trouble when he got done with the driver doe figured hed go by the drugstore and get jenny something a doll or some playdoh really he just wanted to keep pam from snapping her turtle mouth at him and aimee from giving him that pitying look that was going to lose her the back of her head one of these days truth was he couldnt much stand jenny with her hugging his leg and clinging and her daddy daddy daddy pam was getting older but she still had a decent face okay tits and an acceptable if everspreading ass and the kid had chief jim doe for a daddy so why was his own daughter so damn repulsive and they needed to stop feeding her whatever it was they fed her because it was chockfull of ugly and she was turning into a pig a man whod been around could tell it like it was and doe knew that fat and ugly was an evil combination for a girl doe climbed out of the cruiser and stood there for a moment peering over at the driver behind his mirrored sunglasses he wanted to get a better look and let her take in the sight of the big bad cop who had her in his crosshairs he knew what he looked like he never missed the surprised little smiles well hello officer like one of those male strippers they had for bachelorette parties so what if he had a little gut now women didnt care about things like that they cared about power and swagger and he had plenty of those when doe walked over to the window of her jap sports car she pressed her lips together in a smashed fat little smile hello there goodlooking is there a problem officer doe hitched up his belt which he liked to do so they could see all the stuff the gun and the cuffs and nightstick it was like spanish fly he took off his widebrimmed brown hat and wiped his forehead with his sleeve he put the hat back on and shot her a smile he knew his teeth were perfectly white despite the fact that he didnt brush as often as he ought to and maybe they were a little crooked but it was the sort of thing only he would notice because he was so hard on himself license and registration maam she had them ready and handed them over can you tell me what this is about im sort of in a hurry i sure got that impression way you was driving doe said lisa roland from miami huh miami s pretty far away i was visiting a coworker who moved up here i was just heading over to the highway they always wanted to tell their life story like they wanted his approval or something whyre you in such a big hurry to get home lisa you dont like this part of the state i just wanted to get home is all you like all them hotels and tourists in miami its where i live you got a boyfriend back there waiting on you is that it look what is this about what is it about lisa you know you was speeding i dont think i was you dont huh well it so happens i got you on the radar gun going a pretty good amount above the speed limit you must be mistaken she bit her lip looked to her side behind her she must have been nervous about something if she hadnt been speeding then why was she so nervous must i now well if i am i dont know about it come on officer it just so happens that id been looking at my speedometer and i was sticking very closely to the fiftyfive mark i got you at fiftyseven lisa fiftyseven christ i mean come on i cant believe you would even stop me for going two miles above the limit well he said taking off his hat again and giving his forehead a wiping way i see it the speed limit is the limit that dont mean its the speed you want to be sort of near it means thats the fastest you can go the limit now if you have a water heater and it says that you cant put your water over two hundred degrees or it will explode what you gonna do let it get to two hundred and two and then say you were only two degrees over i think if it gets to one ninetyfive youre going to do everything you can to put things right speed limits the same in my view dont those radar detectors have a margin of error to within a few miles per hour i guess they might doe told her but it happens that within the limits of meadowbrook grove the speed limit is fortyfive miles per hour its clearly posted on the roads maam so you were not just over the limit you were well over christ she said meadowbrook grove what the hell is that its this municipality lisa youre about half a mile into it and it runs about another mile and a half east its a speed trap she said it came out in a jolt of understanding and she made no effort to hide her contempt your trailer park is a speed trap doe shook his head its sad when people who are looking to keep folks safe are called all sorts of names you want to get into an accident is that it take a couple of other people with you the woman sighed fine whatever just give me the ticket doe leaned forward elbows on her rolleddown windows what did you say i said to just go ahead and give me the ticket you oughtnt to tell an officer of the law what to do something crossed her face some sort of recognition like when youre poking a stick at a king snake teasing it and jabbing at it and you suddenly realize its not a king but a coral that it could kill you anytime it damn well wants lisa saw what she should have seen earlier officer i didnt mean anything disrespectful i just wanted to had she been flirting probably the whore she put out her hand and gently really with just the nails scraped along the skin of his forearm barely even disturbing the tightly coiled black hairs it was all the excuse doe needed technically he didnt need any excuse at all but he liked to have one let them think it was something they did let them think later on if only i hadnt touched him better they should blame themselves the touch was all he was looking for doe took a step back and pulled his gun from his holster and pointed it at the woman not two feet from her head he knew what it must look like to her this big dark hot throbbing thing shoved right in her face never touch a police officer he shouted you are committing assault a felony put your hands on the wheel she shrieked they did that sometimes hands on the wheel he sounded very much like a man who believed his own life to be in danger like he needed her to do this to keep from shooting her hands on the wheel now eyes straight ahead do it or i will shoot she continued to shriek her little eyes became wide as tiny saucers and her curly blond hair went fright wig somehow despite her screaming she managed to move her hands halfway up her body where they did a little spaz shake and then she got them up to the wheel all right now lisa you do what i say and no one needs to get hurt right youre under arrest for assault on a police officer he grabbed the door handle pulled it open and took a quick step back as though he expected molten rock to come pouring out it was better to play it like it was real if you did the cocky cop thing they might despair or they might get full of righteous anger and then you could really have a problem on your hands if on the other hand you acted like you were afraid of them it gave them a strange sort of hope like the whole misunderstanding could still get straightened out with the gun still extended he reached out and pulled one hand behind her back then the other holding them firmly in place he put the gun back in the holster and placed the cuffs on her wrists too tight he knew they would hurt like hell her ugly face got uglier as he shoved her toward his cruiser cars slowed down along the road practically a highway at this stretch with more than five miles between lights to watch figuring her for a drug dealer or who knows what but they werent thinking that all shed done was speed and then whine about it they saw her in cuffs and they saw his uniform and they knew who was right and who was wrong doe shoved her into the back of the cruiser behind the passenger seat and then went around to the drivers side he waited for a break in the traffic and then pulled out onto the road they had gone less than a quarter of a mile before she managed to get any words past her sobbing whats going to happen to me i guess youll find out he told her i didnt do anything wrong then you dont have to worry isnt that the way the law works yes she managed no more than a whisper there you go then doe turned off the road just before they got near the hog complex it smelled something terrible from the waste lagoon which was what they called it a fucking shithole for a bunch of pigs that needed to be killed before they could die on their own was what he called it smelled like shit too worse than shit like the worst shit you could ever imagine rancid rotting shit it smelled like the shit that shit shits out its asshole some days you couldnt hardly smell it at all unless you got close but when it was humid which was a lot of the time and when there was a good easterly wind all of meadowbrook grove stank like frothing wormy bubbling fermented shit but thats what the hog complex was there to do to smell bad so no one could smell that other smell that moneymaking smell and that pig shit smell had some other useful features which was why doe liked to bring his girls there not just because it was isolated and no one ever came down this road but also because he knew what that smell did theyd get the feeling even before they realized they were smelling it it crept up on them like their terror doe pulled the car a good quarter mile up the dirt road through the haphazard pines to just around a bend he had to get out to unlock the flimsy metal gate there as a line pissed in the sand rather than as real security then he went back in to pull the car through out again to lock up and back behind the wheel one last time but safety first was his motto they were pretty well shaded by the cluttered growth of trees and hed be able to see someone coming in the unlikely event that some lost driver decided to head that way in the clearing the hog lot stood like a massive metal shack and behind that was the waste lagoon doe turned off the motor and as he did so he realized he was grinning hed been grinning for so long that his cheeks ached christ he must look like a jackolantern from hell so lisa you got a job he leaned back in his seat settling into that familiar good sensation hard and light at the same time he finished off his bottle of yoohoo the bourbon had kicked in strong and he felt just about right nothing but bourbon either he knew that people people in the know figured he was doing crank but he didnt touch the stuff he knew what it did shit just look at karen turned her all skank look at bastard turned him halfincompetent the woman in the back pivoted her head checking out her surroundings for the first time perhaps noticing that they were in a clearing in the middle of nowhere her nose wrinkled and then her whole face creased as she got a whiff of the waste lagoon where are we things are kind of busy down at the station i thought wed do our interrogation right here more comfortable dont you think she struggled a bit as though that would get her anything but more metal slicing into her skin i want to get out of here i want to call a lawyer a lawyer what for honey you said before you didnt do nothing wrong lawyers are for criminals aint they i want to see a lawyer or a judge judge is just a fancy lawyer in my book doe got out of the car taking his time taking a minute to admire the blue of the sky the long wisps of clouds like the strings of cotton that come out of an aspirin bottle then acting as if hed suddenly remembered where he was he opened the back door and climbed in he was careful to leave the door nice and open since there was no inside handle and if it closed theyd both be trapped back there the last thing he wanted was to be trapped with an ugly horse like lisa he sat next to her and traded the evil grin for a smile he knew to be charming whatd you say you do now i work for channel eight in miami she said after a moment of sobbing channel eight she sure as hell wasnt on the tv not with her mushy face that right what you do there some kind of a fancy secretary is that it you sit on the bosss lap and take dictation i could use me some dicktation she looked down and didnt answer which struck doe as rude someone was talking to her and she didnt answer what did she think she was miss universe or something she needed to look in a mirror sometime see what she really was and now that he was close he could see things were worse than hed realized acne scars covered with makeup a pale but discernible mustache lisa had no business taking an attitude with him to make this point clear he put his hand flat against her forehead very gently really and then gave it a little shove she didnt make a noise this time but the waterworks were going streaming down her face please let me go she said let you go hell this aint russia we have laws here procedures that have to be followed you think you can just talk your way out of paying your debt to society he bobbed his head for a moment like he was agreeing with someone somewhere some words the woman couldnt hear then he turned to her so he said a dogface like you would probably be pretty grateful for a chance to suck cock dont you think oh god she murmured she tried to squeeze herself away from him which was what they did but there was nowhere to go this was the backseat of a ford ltd for christs sake but thats what they did they tried to get away doe loved this part they were so scared and theyd do whatever he said and they loved it too that was the crazy thing he knew theyd be getting off on remembering it sometimes he got phone calls late at night hangups and he knew what was going on it was women hed had in the back of the cruiser they wanted some more they wanted to see him again but they were also embarrassed they knew they werent supposed to want it but they did all this oh god noing was just part of a script the truth was that it also made him a little bit sad on jennys account because she was probably going to end up a dogfaced whore like this one his own daughter a dogfaced whore in high school shed be sucking dick in the bathroom because that would be the only way shed get boys to like her which they wouldnt but it would take her a couple of years of getting smacked around to figure that out he knew a couple of high school girls like that right now he felt bad for them and all but there wasnt much to be done about it so there was no point in avoiding their company now was there and here was lisa squirming crying wiggling like a toad under a shovel meanwhile he had a telephone pole in his pants he unzipped himself and pulled it out look at that lisa you look at that now you be a good girl and do your job and well see what we can do about dropping the charges be a good girl well have you back in your car in fifteen minutes quarter hour from now youll be cruising down the highway heading back to miami that always helped you give them something real to hold on to put them in the future just get it over with and they could go which they could he wasnt a monster or anything he saw that he had her she turned to him slowly her little piggy eyes were red and narrow and pinched with fear but he saw something like hope there too that grim determination to suck and bear it and the twinkle in her eye like she knew she was lucky to have a man like jim doe force himself on her maybe this wasnt how shed always dreamed of it but shed dreamed of it just the same okay she whispered softly to herself mostly he guessed she had to get herself together why he didnt know shed sucked cock before and if some pretty little thing locked him in a backseat and told him to eat her pussy you wouldnt see doe having to talk himself into it but he supposed everyone was different okay she said again this time more to him youll let me go i told you i would doe said urgently with all this talk he was losing his momentum starting to get soft now get to sucking girl okay she said again but you have to take off my cuffs first nice try lisa please she said they hurt ill be good ill be good like she was a little kid well why not hed done it before sometimes they just needed to feel a little easy and he knew this girl wasnt going to get all funny on him she was broken all right sugar he said but nothing tricky keep your hands where i can see them he reached around and unlocked her cuffs wincing at the sound of the click and then the girls sigh of relief thank you she sniffed in a big honking snort of boogers which he didnt much like since who wanted to get head mixed with a mess of snot but fuck it he reasoned now i done something for you he said i think you owe me a little favor his first thought was that she was coming in a little fast his second was holy christ the fringes of his vision went red with agony the unbearably sharp but also dull thud of pain in his balls that spread like an electric alien fungus to his hips and down his thighs and up his spine and then again it hurt so much that he couldnt even make sense of it somewhere in the back of his mind he understood she was punching him in the balls not just punching him pummeling him wind up and release like a rocket he tried to back away from her out the door but his back was to the car seat and in the thud thud thud of her fist against his nads he was in a free fall of pain up became down left became right he couldnt figure out which way to go instead he started to reach for his gun on some level he knew that shooting her in the back of his ltd with his dick out on his own property when who knew how many people had seen him stop her and with her car still sitting by the side of the road was a bad idea on the other hand he had this vague notion that if he could put a bullet in her stupid ugly face she would stop and the pain would be gone the pain was somehow linked to her being alive it didnt make sense and he even knew it didnt make sense but he didnt care the problem was that he didnt have the gun everything was hazy and distorted and he was feeling around for his belt but he couldnt find it the other thing was that while the pain was still there the thudding had stopped that was an improvement but not much lisa had managed to get his belt off him the tricky fucking whore so she had his keys his nightstick and she had his gun the pain heaved back and forth below his waist and he hoped to christ she hadnt crushed his balls the horizon shifted and he understood that he was on his side in the back of the seat she was standing in front of him the car door open her tshirt disheveled and wet from tears or perspiration her hair all wild like some crazed fuck bunny in a porn movie you goddamn prick she said the gun was pointed at him which he didnt like but even in his agony he could see that she didnt know how to hold a gun she had it in both hands like a cop on some dumbass show if he had to guess hed say shed never fired one probably hadnt taken the safety off not that he wanted to take the chance shed figure it out if she needed to since shed already proved herself clever still she might be the cleverest ugly bitch in the world but if hed been able to move his body below his waist he would have gotten up taken that thing away from her and broken her potato of a nose with it thats what he would have done you wanted to know what i do for channel eight im a reporter you asshole get ready for camera crews she kicked the door shut trapping him into the back of his car the smell of pig shit from the waste lagoon washed over him like an insult like a big ugly laugh like a tax audit like a dose of vd doe was trapped he was in pain his balls were smashed the yoohoo and bourbon churned menacingly in his stomach and then came up onto the seat onto his chest his face his arms he felt himself passing out and he stayed passed out until the next morning when his deputy finally found him and woke him with a series of delicate and mocking taps of his nightstick against the window chapter my heart pounded and a clenched coil of fear hardened in my chest i had witnessed the death of two people i would be next i was going to die everything was cold and icy and slow unreal and so achingly physically undeniably real as to be a new state of consciousness i never decided to turn and face the killer but it happened i pivoted my neck and saw an unusually tall man standing behind me holding a gun pointed in my general direction if not exactly at me the lunar eclipse of his head blocked the overhead naked bulb and for an instant he was a dark wildhaired silhouette the gun which i could see clearly had a longish black cylinder at the tip which i recognized from tv shows as a silencer crap the man said he moved and came into view looking not raging or murderous but puzzled who are you i opened my mouth but said nothing it wasnt that in my terror id forgotten my name or how to make the sounds come out it was more that i knew my name would mean nothing to him he wanted some sort of description that would place me in context something that would help him decide if he should let me live or not and i wasnt up to the task with the gun still pointed toward me the man gazed at my confused face with an expression of patience both coolly reptilian and strangely warm he had blond hair white really that spiked out warholishly and he was unusually thin like karen and bastard but he didnt look sickly and drawn the way they had in fact he seemed sort of fit and stylish in his black chuck taylors black jeans white dress shirt buttoned all the way up and black gloves a collegiatelooking backpack dangled insouciantly over his right shoulder even in the smoky light of the trailer his emerald eyes stood out against the whiteness of his skin stay calm he said he had the demeanor of a man totally in control but in the tiniest fraction of a second his composure appeared to crack and then reassemble itself going from statue to rubble to statue again he took a step to his left and then to his right a truncated sort of pacing you might have noticed that i havent killed you and i can pretty much tell you that im not planning on killing you im not a murderer im an assassin worst that will happen if you do something stupid and piss me off ill shoot you in the knee it will hurt like hell might leave you crippled so i dont want to do it just be cool and do what i say and i promise youre going to be just fine he looked around and then let out a breath of air so that his lips vibrated crap i was so hopped up on adrenaline i didnt even see you until i took them down i continued to stare in something like shock i suppose the terror swelled in my head like a dull roar against my ears and my heart pounded but the thud of it felt distant and detached the tinny echo of someone banging on something far away my neck ached from craning but i didnt want to look away too much shifting might make him nervous what are you doing here the assassin asked you dont look like a friend of theirs i knew id better answer a direct question but something in the pulleyandwheel mechanism of my vocal cords wouldnt move i swallowed hard painfully forcing something down and tried again selling encyclopedias the green eyes went wide to those assholes jesus you should have done it a few years ago maybe a little knowledge would have saved them but you know what i doubt it dont ask him i warned myself just shut up play it cool see what he wants he hasnt killed you yet so maybe he wont he says he wont dont ask him anything why did you kill them i asked anyway you dont need to know that you just need to know that they deserved it he grabbed the chair next to mine and sat down moving in deliberate and authoritative movements as if he were about to deliver an older brothers kindly lecture on saying no to drugs i could now see that the assassin was younger than i had first realized maybe twentyfour or twentyfive he looked cheerful as though he had a good sense of humor almost certainly dry humor the kind of guy you might want at your party or to live on the same floor of your dorm even as i thought it i knew it sounded idiotic but there it was id like you to pack up your stuff the assassin said dont leave any evidence of being here i couldnt make myself move it seemed like the stench from the trailer park had begun to seep inside to beat down the smell of tobacco and gunpowder and sweat but then i realized it was the smell of the bodies shit and piss and blood and there were those dead faces with their empty eyes my gaze kept drifting over to their ruined heads frozen in terminal surprise this is important the killer said not unkindly i need you to clean up your stuff i rose in hypnotic compliance expecting to discover his promise not to hurt me to be a lie the instant i turned my back id hear the squeak of the silencer and the burning rupture of metal in my back i knew he was going to kill me yet at the same time i didnt quite believe it maybe it was intuition or wishful thinking but when he said he didnt want to kill me part of me believed he meant it and not desperate pathetic belief either it didnt seem to me like the desperate hope of the blindfolded condemned feeling the roughness of the noose as it slipped over his neck while certain the reprieve would come for whatever reason the idea that i could get out of this alive struck me as entirely plausible i looked at my stuff all of the book materials were on the table and miraculously none had been splattered with blood my hands big surprise trembled like an outboard motor but i began to pick up the brochures and samples and pricing sheets holding each gingerly as though i were a cop collecting evidence and i dropped them into my stepfathers moldy bag i took the check karen had written and shoved it in my pocket meanwhile the assassin began to organize karen and bastards stuff he placed the checkbook next to a pile of bills by the phone returned the pens to a cup on the counter separating the kitchen from the living room careful not to step in any blood he brought my cup over to the sink and washed it methodically with a sponge somehow keeping his gloves reasonably dry he was so cool about it so damn cool moving around the room with unflappable focus the sort of person who acted as though everything had gone according to plan even when it hadnt my being in the trailer hadnt thrown him off for more than an instant hed changed the plan was all i flipped out when i overslept by five minutes but this guy was centered he stepped back over the bodies over the blood and sat next to me i ought to have cringed at his proximity but i dont think i did under the heat of his gaze my mind emptied of everything except a loose preverbal fear and an irrational hope the assassin pointed the gun toward the ceiling unscrewed the silencer and then ejected the clip and removed a bullet from the firing chamber keeping his eye on me he placed these accessories in his backpack and then set the gun on the table i stared at it we didnt have guns in my family we didnt have firearms or knives or even baseball bats under the bed we didnt handle weapons if there were mice in the house we called an exterminator and let him touch the traps and the poison i came from a background of squeamishness and id been raised to believe as a matter of faith that if i handled anything with the capacity to do harm it would turn on me like a mutinous robot and destroy its master now there it was right in front of me the gun just like in the movies i understood the pistol wasnt loaded but for a moment i thought i should grab it do something heroic maybe i could smack the assassin with the gun pistolwhip him or something tough guyish like that while i pondered my options however the assassin took another gun out of his backpack so pistolwhipping became less of an option once again he sort of aimed his firearm at me less at me than in my direction not to terrify me but to make sure i kept my head remembered who stood where in the hierarchy give me your wallet i didnt want to give up my wallet it had my money my drivers license the credit card my stepfather had reluctantly handed over which i was allowed to use only in absolute emergencies and even then i could expect to get yelled at on the other hand if the assassin wanted my wallet i told myself maybe he really wouldnt kill me it would be easy to take a wallet off my dead body so i reached into my back pocket maneuvered it out not so easy since it and my pants were moist with sweat and handed it over the assassin deftly thumbed through it unimpeded by his black gloves and then removed my drivers license in which i looked unspeakably dorky and was wearing a velour shirt which surely must have seemed like a good idea at the time though now the decision mystified me the assassin studied it briefly ill keep this if you dont mind lemuel he wanted to take my license that meant something significant it portended of terrible things to come though i couldnt quite shape the ideas in my mind now pick up the other gun come on i promise if you cooperate youre not going to get hurt i didnt want to touch it i didnt want to go anywhere near it and what would happen if i did would he shoot me claim selfdefense claim id shot bastard and karen picking up the gun was insanity but so was not picking it up so i slowly wrapped my fingers around the handle and lifted it was both heavier and lighter than i imagined and it trembled in my hand aim it at the refrigerator the assassin said beyond the point of making trouble or arguing i did as i was told squeeze the trigger though i knew hed taken out the clip which i understood meant the gun was unloaded i still winced as i followed the order i pressed down hard expecting the rich boom of a tv shot report but i got nothing except a hollow click i kept my arm out the gun continued to shake good job lemuel now put the gun down on the table i did so heres the deal the assassin said your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon bad for you good for me but let me be clear about this you leave here you keep quiet about what you saw and no one will ever find this gun no one will know you were here and there will be no problem for either of us im not looking to frame you just to keep you from reporting to anyone what you saw so if you decide you want to go to the police theyll get an anonymous tip about you lemuel altick and discover the hidden location of this gun which will mark you as the killer on the other hand if you accept that there are bigger things at play here than you can understand and accordingly keep quiet the police will never link you to what happened here today now you can see im being fair about this so keep that in mind if you have any moral qualms believe me these were bad bad people and they had it coming so are we cool here i nodded slowly thinking for the first time that the assassin was probably gay he wasnt effeminate or anything like that but there was something about him about the way he moved and spoke that seemed full of unarticulated significance then a little voice inside me said that it didnt matter if he was gay it didnt matter if he liked to do threeways with proboscis monkeys i had to stay focused if i was going to avoid getting killed and now i had a new problem maybe he really would let me live but only so he could frame me for murder i looked up and he was shaking his head i really wish you hadnt stumbled into this whats a cleancut kid like you doing selling encyclopedias you going to college i swallowed hard im raising money i got in but i cant afford it so i deferred he pointed at me quick whats your favorite shakespeare play i couldnt believe i was even having this conversation im not sure twelfth night maybe he raised an eyebrow yeah why i dont know its supposed to be a comedy but its really kind of cruel and creepy the plays villain is the guy whos actually just trying to restore order interesting he nodded thoughtfully then he waved a hand in the air who cares anyway right shakespeares overrated now milton theres a poet the fear which i had done a reasonable job of pushing back for a while was now so intense that it flashed around me like electricity in a tesla ball crazy people ranted like this before they killed you didnt they thats what id learned from the movies even if i was misreading those signals i had just seen two people killed every time my attention shifted to something else every time i tried to comfort myself with the realization that the assassin probably wouldnt strike again that knowledge came back with a gruesome thump two people were dead forever whatever bastard and karen had done they didnt deserve to be gunned down like animals even so with the sadness that crept over me at the thought of the indelible cruelty of murder i felt the beginnings of something admiration maybe though that wasnt quite right for the man who had done the killing the assassin terrified me but i also wanted his approval i knew it made no sense but i felt i had to earn his trust which was why i spoke out theres something else i said with deliberate slowness a hopeless effort to control the trembling in my voice besides shakespeare i mean a guy saw me go in here he arched an eyebrow what sort of guy just a guy a creepy redneck when three hours ago i guess the assassin waved his hand dismissively forget it he wont remember who you are what you were doing here any of that hes not going to give you trouble and if he does bring in the cops tell them that you tried to sell them some books it didnt fly and you took off theres nothing to link you to these guys to suggest you had a motive nothing like that i dont know if the cops come to see you say you were in and out without luck saw nothing unusual except maybe this creepy redneck and thats all you have to say theyll be off your case in no time and on that rednecks can you trust me on that could i trust him hed barged into my life murdered a pair of prospects in front of my eyes and then set me up to take the blame i nodded fab the assassin said now id say it was time for you to be getting out of here leaving seemed to be a pretty good idea more than i could have hoped for i stood on wobbling legs held on to the table until i could support myself properly and began a sideways shuffle toward the front door careful to keep an eye on the killer at all times lemuel the assassin said i hope youll consider the back way secrecy and all vaguely humiliated i went into the living room and unlocked the back door i stepped out into the yard where the heat and the dank outhousestench humidity startled me out of my fear for a moment i had seen people killed just feet away from me i had sat at the table with their killer and i had made it out alive i was not going to be killed now i just had to get away from there before the cops showed up it would be easy to cut over to the neighbors property so i closed the door behind me and stepped out into the dank darkness the ghost of the moon was glowing behind a heavy blanket of clouds the crickets chirped their near screeching chorus and nearby an unfathomable tropical frog bellowed its equatorial song a mosquito divebombed my ear but i ignored the explosive buzz instead i trudged forward vaguely aware as i walked that the lights in bastard and karens trailer went metaphorically out bastard and karen he irritating and vaguely sinister she jagged and beaten down dead the two of them dead their kids off somewhere were now orphans and had no idea their young lives as they had lived them were finished and i had been a party to it i had witnessed the unspeakable horror of their deaths and then sat with their killer and i realized found him strangely charming it wasnt as though i could have saved bastard and karen but i told myself i could do something now i could go to the police and go fast maybe in time for them to catch the assassin while he was still in the trailer and even if they didnt get there in time no one would believe that i had killed them then again they might the assassin when not assassinating acted like a reasonable guy it could be that he believed really believed that bastard and karen deserved it but did anyone deserve it did i live in a world in which bad people were killed by righteous assassins nothing in my life told me it was so but then again this night had been in my life the first two trailers i passed were dark though i heard an angry dogs sonorous barking in the middle distance i came out onto a street though not the one on which bastard and karen lived which somehow made me feel better it was a little less than a mile to the kwick stop and only a couple of cars passed me speeding by in automotive oblivion i told myself over and over again that i just might get away with this i just might get my life back chapter the cutting board lacked music it was a large restaurant with a moderately unfortunate name composed of a series of interlinked woodpaneled rooms filled out with whiteclothed tables and heavy wooden chairs yet it lacked music and that disappointed bb he liked music soft music trickling in so quietly that he could hardly hear it ambient as a distant highway but still evanescently there adding texture to the meal a little heft if the conversation lagged a touch of the cinematic sound track classical was fine the soft sort of classical not the loud stuff with horns and kettledrums but the truth was that bb liked elevator music he knew everyone got a kick out of trashing elevator music and let them have their laugh but in the end they had to agree there was something reassuring about these songs everyone already knew maybe in a more raucous form handed back all soft and powdery prechewed going down so smooth that you didnt even know there was something in your throat this restaurant skipped the music and no fish tank he liked a fish tank bb wasnt one of those guys who took cruel pleasure picking which fish gets to die he had to make cruel decisions enough for work but he liked to look at fish he liked to watch them swim especially the big goldfish with the bulging eyes and he liked the bubbling in the tank the cutting board had palm trees though a few small groves of plastic palms stuck here and there to give the place a touch of class palm trees were important for obscuring views he didnt want to be seen and he didnt want to see the glory of a fine restaurant was its semiprivacy pillars could work too but he liked the palm trees since the fronds added extra cover the restaurant was also into low ambient lighting so in the end the dark and the plastic trees made it acceptable despite its other drawbacks bb would return at some point it would never be on his alist but he would put it on rotation in any case he didnt like to visit a place more than once every six months the last thing you want is for the waiters to start to recognize you recognizing that the last time you were in it was a different boy and the time before that too it was a little steakandseafood place near the ft lauderdale airport far enough away from miami that he wouldnt just happen to bump into anyone he knew and catering largely to the old and retired set so that his sort of people the nonwithered the surgically nonwithered the powergolf players the rolex wearers and the convertible drivers would never be caught dead in a place like this bb believed firmly in picking places that drew the old and the retired a man could be a prince in the eyes of a waiter simply by not sending back the drinking water for being the wrong temperature on the other side of bbs candlelit table chuck finn sat in concentration as he worked a breadstick with a waxy slab of butter hed have it under control for a second or two before it slipped out from under his knife and chuck would lurch in sudden and astonishingly ungraceful motions to regain his grip on it and each time he would smile at bb flash those slightly crooked teeth in sophisticated selfdeprecation and then go back to his business the third time bb had been forced to reach across the table to keep the boy from knocking his goblet of saintestèphe onto the tablecloth at a bottle he wasnt about to let any of it tip over particularly when the boy had taken his first sip probably his first sip of wine ever and nodded with knowing appreciation at a steakhouse a man drinks a nice bordeaux it doesnt get much more complicated than that most of the other boys maybe all of the other boys had taken a sip grimaced and asked for a coke chuck had half closed his eyes in pleasure and let the tip of his very pink tongue tickle his upper lip chuck got it and bb began to suspect that he had on his hands not only a boy willing to be mentored but one ready to be mentored hed taken only one sip and then somehow the glass was covered with greasy boyfingerprints bb understood thats what it was to be a boy boys made messes they almost knocked over wine sometimes they did knock over wine and unless you were eager to keep from drawing attention to yourself you didnt much care because you didnt keep boys from being boys that wasnt a mentors job a mentor turned a boy in the right direction so that at some future date when the time was right hed become a man thats how you mentored be graceful chuck bb said in what he hoped was his most mentorly tone grace is poise and poise is power look at me you want to be like me when you grow up bb pointed at himself when he spoke as if he were exhibit a if you pointed at yourself people looked and he had no reason to mind that he had turned fiftyfive this year a bit on the mature side though still in his prime but people mistook him for forty fortyfive max partly it was the grecian formula the use of which he had elevated to an art and partly it was the lifestyle an hour with the nautilus machines three times a week wasnt much of an investment for youth then there were the clothes he dressed and there was no other term for it miamivice hed been considering linen suits and tshirts before the show came on the air but once he saw those guys strutting around in those clothes bb knew it was the look for him it was the right look for a man of hidden but smoldering power and that show god bless it was singlehandedly transforming miami from a necropolis of retirees marbled with pockets of black or cuban poverty into someplace almost hip almost fabulous almost glamorous the smell of mothballs and bengay drifted off replaced by the scent of suntan lotion and titillating aftershave bb watched as chuck continued to work the butter and the breadstick was now glossy and slick and though it might have been a trick of the light even starting to sag a little i think thats enough butter he said it in a mentorly tone sympathetic but firm i like a lot of butter chuck said with naïve cheer i understand you want it but theres such a thing as discipline chuck discipline will make you a man cant argue with that chuck set the butter knife with its halfused pat still clinging onto the tablecloth place the butter knife on the bread plate where it belongs young man good point chuck observed he set the breadstick on the bread plate as well wiped his hands on the heavy linen napkin on his lap and then took another sip of the saintestèphe thats really good how did you get to know so much about wine working as a waiter in las vegas trying to make it through my shift so i could go lose even more money i didnt have get into it even deeper with a bodybuilding shirtless greek loan shark would not have suited as an answer so bb offered a knowing shrug hoping it would impress he had selected boys before boys from his charity the young mens foundation these were special boys he thought would be able to dine with him spend a few hours alone in his company and mature from the experience he looked for calm and steadiness in the boys but he also looked for the ability to keep a secret these dinners were special and because they were special they werent any of the worlds business the dinners were only for those very exceptional boys worthy of extra mentoring but in the three years he had been taking boys out to eat a thought had always nagged at him that he selected his dining companions for their ability to keep a secret rather than for their readiness to be mentored now here was chuck quiet slightly introverted if not antisocial trashynovelreading journalwriting obliviouslybadlyhaircutted chuck who knew how to keep a secret but had a sense of humor had an intuitive appreciation for complex wines obedient and pliable but with an impish resistance bb felt an excited tingle shoot out from the center of his body like a miniature supernova here he dared to speculate might well be the boy hed been looking for the special mentee the reason he had wanted to help boys in the first place what if chuck was everything he appeared smart interested full of softclay potential could bb arrange to spend more time with him what would the boys worthless mother say what would desiree say nothing could work without desiree and he knew without quite admitting it to himself that desiree would not be happy chuck now turned his attention to the breadstick he picked it up and was readying himself to take a bite when bb reached out with one hand and gently encircled chucks wrist normally he didnt like to touch the boys he didnt want them or anyone else to think that there was something not right about his mentoring nevertheless sometimes when two people were together there was going to be a certain amount of touching life worked that way they might accidentally brush up against each other bb might put an affectionate hand on a boys shoulder or tousle his hair press a hand to his back give him a pat on the butt to hurry him along or it might be something like this chuck had been an instant away from putting the breadstick in his mouth when bb saw the fingernails black dirt packed into discrete geologic chunks hibernating under the shelter of nails weeks overdue for trimming some things you could dismiss put in the boyswillbeboys category look the other way some things however you could not some things were too much to ignore if bb was a mentor then he had to mentor he kept his grip gentle but the hand motionless i want you to put the breadstick down bb said and go wash your hands before you eat scrub those fingernails good i dont want to see any dirt under them when you get back chuck looked at his nails and then at bb he had no father an impatient gnome of a mother an older brother in a wheelchair as the result of a car accident the impatient gnome of a mother had slammed her chevy nova into a sable palm a few years back and bb suspected to the point of deep certainty that thered been heavy drinking involved chuck slept on a tattered foldout couch with springs he felt sure as pliant and welcoming as upturned dinner forks he did miserably in school because he tuned out his teachers and read whatever he felt like during class he wasnt the weakest kid around but he got his share of ass kicking and he gave his share too chuck had plenty of pride and it was the frail and bitter pride of a desperate boy bb had seen it often enough these powerless boys growing red in the face flashing their teeth like cornered lemurs lashing out at their mentor because their pride demanded they lash out at someone even if it was the only person in the world who truly wanted to help bb understood it anticipated it knew how to defuse it this time however he did not get it chuck studied his fingernails and then turned to bb with another of those selfdeprecating smiles that made bb feel as though something in his body had just melted they are pretty dirty he agreed ill go wash up bb let go of the wrist youre a fine young man he said and then he watched chuck walk away the kid looked good there was no denying that hed made an effort to clean his best clothes a pair of green chinos and a buttondown white shirt he wore a cloth belt his socks matched his brown shoes and his brown shoes had been polished it all meant one thing the boy was letting himself be mentored he was back in under two minutes hed just scrubbed and returned hadnt even taken the time to piss now he sat took another drink of the wine and nodded at bb as though theyd just entered into a contract thanks for taking me out like this mr gunn i really appreciate it its my pleasure chuck you are an exceptional young man and im happy to help you in any way i can thats really nice of you chuck held bbs gaze with mature confidence the astronomical tingling was back turning into bbs own private cosmic event it was almost as though chuck were trying to tell him something trying to let bb know that he was comfortable with the friendship between a young man and his mentor bb looked at the boy with his thin frame his face a little too round for his body his tousled brown hair and strangely brilliant brown eyes the boy was trying to tell him something that he was ready for mentoring whatever mentoring bb might wish to pursue and the air at the table was electric chuck finished his glass of wine and bb poured him another then the boy bit into the breadstick with a ferocious clamp of his jaws crumbs sprayed out across the table and the sound of it echoed halfway across the restaurant chuck looked up at his mentor alarm preparing to settle on his face but he saw bbs amused smile and he let out a little laugh they both laughed several of the retirement zombies looked over with disapproving scowls bb made eye contact with all of them dared them to say anything when the black man approached their table at first bb thought it might be the manager there to complain maybe one of the retirees had convinced them to initiate an effectiveimmediately no children policy but the black man didnt work for the restaurant it was the darkness that kept bb from recognizing him right away otto rose he wore a blue suit and even in the dark bb could tell it was just a nudge short of electric blue but the rest of the outfit was conservative and businesslike richly polished oxfords a white shirt a rep tie crafted into a massive and artful fourinhand otto hovered over the table with that imperial grace he loved to exude he looked something like a cross between an actor and a third world dictator though barely thirty which was irritating enough he appeared hardly more than twenty even with his head shaved bb had been watching his hair thin with each year maybe even each month but otto shaved his head and looked good doing it the slick of his skin glowed from the candles of the surrounding tables the sudden and inexplicable appearance of otto rose was by any standards bb could think of bad news bad news because no one but desiree was supposed to know where bb was bad news because otto rose was standing there watching him mentor watching him dine with an elevenyearold boy in an expensive steakhouse a bottle of saintestèphe opened and two glasses one for an underage boy bad news because otto might be a business friend but he was the kind of friend bb would love to shed bad news because there was no reason in the world why rose should want to find him unless it was bad news hello young man rose said to chuck his west indian accent came out thick and chunky full of island hospitality and humor the way it always did when he cranked up the charm he set his hand on the bottle of bordeaux can i pour you some more wine or has mr gunn been taking care of you chuck held on to his breadstick and looked up at rose not quite making eye contact but he didnt say anything bb expected as much south florida might be diverse there were cubans and jews and regular white people and haitians and west indians and regular black people and all sorts of south americans and orientals and who the hell knew what else but the fact was none of them wanted anything to do with any of the others white kids clammed up around black people black kids clammed up around white people bb had seen it a million times when mentoring and if you were going to mentor you had to understand these things rose however was undeterred i am otto rose what is your name young sir he stuck out his hand for shaking chuck appeared to know he was trapped and being trapped he chose to forge ahead im chuck he said in a steady voice the handshake looked firm and unafraid and mr gunn is your friend he is a fine man to have for a friend hes my mentor chuck said hes been very nice to me and this is a fine restaurant for mentoring rose said the humor percolating just under the surface of his voice and nothing goes with mentoring like a glass of wine he picked up chucks glass and gave it a good sniff with his eyes closed a saintestèphe he asked as he put down the glass wow chucks eyes went wide you can tell that from the smell i read it on the bottle bb saw that the retirees in the restaurant were looking over at them they didnt like the big bald black man standing around the waiters were eyeing them as well and it would only be a moment until one of them came by to ask if the gentleman wished to join their table bb would be fucked if rose said he would so it was time to snip this one in the bud bb pushed himself out of the chair and away from the table rising with miami vice poise he might be half a foot shorter than rose but he held his own next to the guy bb knew who he was knew what he commanded knew that there were people all over the state who would shit in their pants if they heard b b gunn was pissed off it was time to make sure otto knew enough to shit in his pants excuse me for a moment he said to chuck ill be back as soon as i take care of some grownup business okay chuck said there was something forlorn in his voice bb knew instantly that chuck might be a mature kid he might be a spunky kid with a good sense of humor and the will to rise above the misery of his life but he didnt want to be left alone he wanted maybe above all things companionship and that was but one more reason to be pissed off at otto rose for showing up like this and fucking up his dinner follow me bb said to rose it was time to establish the pecking order in his barnyard rose thought he was clever finding out where bb was eating making sly little insinuations about chuck but now it was rose following while the alpha male led they stepped outside and the temperature rose by nearly thirty degrees in an instant it was humid and sticky and the sounds of cars off i hissed past desiree was out there leaning against bbs convertible mercedes arms folded over her breasts she wore moderately though not obscenely tight guess jeans and a lavender bikini top the pink of the massive scar along her side glistened in the neon light of the restaurant rose broke out into a gregarious grin desiree my darling how are you lovely he leaned over and rested a hand on her scar as he always did just to show that it didnt trouble him and gave her a kiss on the cheek i didnt see you on the way in desiree allowed herself to be kissed but her lips were pressed tight into a cynical little smile sure you did though you made a pretty good show of acting like you didnt he pressed a hand to his heart you hurt me when you say such things bb couldnt be bothered to let this play out if you saw him coming in why the hell didnt you stop him she shrugged what for youd have come out and wed be right where we are now what for jesus did he have to spell it out for her it was mentoring time she knew perfectly well he didnt want to be bothered while mentoring she knew and shed let rose in because she was still angry with him it had been a month and she was still angry and it was starting to make bb crazy she was his assistant and he wasnt sure he even wanted to think about what life would be like without her but life with her was starting to be a problem okay bb said he took an authoritative suck of air lets make this fast of course you have that young man in there im mentoring him bb said oh i am certain of it i see he likes breadsticks fuck if bb was going to take this kind of thing from otto rose what do you want how did you know i was here and what is it that cant wait until morning youre easier to find than you think rose said and as to why it cant wait i think youll be happy i did number one ive just received a tip theres a reporter in jacksonville theyve got a newspaper there bb said and tv stations last time i checked of course there are reporters rose let out his island laugh theres a reporter there out to do a story on your crew shit from where i dont know i dont know if the reporter plans to observe or if theres someone on the inside already who is a reporter undercover i dont know what this person thinks he knows but theres probably more of a story there than he realizes bb bit his lip okay well take care of it whats number two you know the legislature is taking up that bill in the next session to severely limit doortodoor sales ive just received word that if i go against it i am going to face severe fundraising problems now you know i want to help you out bb ive always stood up for you always valued our relationship but its going to cost me to go against this bill and if its going to cost me im going to have to make up that cost somewhere he wants another donation desiree said shed been doing a lot of that sort of thing lately stating the obvious as though bb wouldnt have understood what rose meant without her help christ otto cant this wait i came to see you about the reporter but since i was here well it seemed like as good a time as any of course i know you were busy mentoring if you would rather mentor than take care of business that is your own concern still i am not entirely certain you want the business community to learn just how important this mentoring is to you fuck if here wasnt rose putting on the squeeze trying to use his charitable nature against him a man wanted to help out the unfortunate and he had to answer to one opportunistic cynic after another and the thing was rose put all that work into crime prevention afterschool programs for the kids in overtown but no one could say anything about that because he was black and those kids were black and all of that meant that rose was a saint so now he had to stand out here talking bullshit with a state legislator while chuck sat by himself at the table his friendly mood deteriorating with each minute how much are we talking about desiree asked same as last time my darling same as last time meant these little payouts were adding up to huge money give us a moment otto desiree said she put a hand on bbs arm and led him about twenty feet into the parking lot what do you think i think i dont want to pay him any more money of course not but if this bill goes through youre going to have a lot of problems so youre saying we should pay probably but make it clear that this is the last time you dont want him to think he can come to you to strap on the feed bag every time hes feeling he needs a few extra dollars this is starting to feel like a shakedown bb nodded when we get rid of him get on the phone to the gambler and make sure he gets the headsup about the reporter and his crew should be making a payment after the weekend make sure he can get the cash to us okay they walked back over to rose who was still grinning as though he were about to deliver a singing telegram ill have the money by next week bb said but this is the last time come now my friend you know i cannot make any guarantees we cant make any guarantees either you get me dont you of course bb ive got to get back inside yes that boy might be tempted to start mentoring himself rose said with bb back inside the restaurant desiree remained leaning against the clean car arms still folded as she looked at otto her shoulderlength dirtyblond hair blew lightly in the wind and lifted her chin which accentuated the sharpness of her nose she knew that if she held her head just so she could make herself look pointier and angrier and she wanted to look angry now desiree wasnt quite ready to confront bb she wasnt quite ready to say the things she needed to say the end had to come and she knew it but it didnt need to come tonight it wasnt fear people who had never met bb who knew him only by reputation or by the size and ingenuity of his operation feared him desiree however knew better no it wasnt fear it was obligation and it was pity but she felt no pity for otto rose oh come desiree dont give me that look beautiful you know it is business if you work for a man like bb you must expect men like me to deal with him as he deserves she shook her head dont back me into a corner otto by saying things about bb youre right you are nothing if not loyal i am sorry i spoke so i wont say another word about bb but may i say a word about you if you must she let her expression slacken a little took some of the heat off otto took a step closer you are much too too good to work for a man like bb i dont merely mean good at your job though i do believe that i mean you are a good person you dont seem to have a problem doing business with bb he laughed im a politician my dear it is too late for me to be good but it is not too late for you young and talented and lovely as you are why dont you leave him the question needed dodging and desiree fought the urge to physically duck she didnt want to deal with his probing now i owe him okay otto thats all i want to say i know you owe him but how much can you owe do you owe him enough to help him do what he does or to help him with those boys he is just their mentor otto no one can say anything about bb and his boys i live in the same house with him remember im the livein help yes of course the better to make the world believe that the two of you are lovers he may not do anything with those boys desiree you must know that he wants to and how long before he gives in to that i dont want to hear it i wont listen i dont mean to push it is only that i want to help you and i become eager lets then not talk about bb lets talk about you my dear what do you want to ask me out on a date she asked but she kept her voice playful careful to sound anything but bitter or sarcastic i would not dare to hope for such good fortune otto said i have something a bit more formal in mind i know you depend on bb for protection so maybe you would feel you had more options if there was someone else offering you protection you i could offer you a job in my office desiree i know your worth and i can promise you it would be a highranking job of course nothing in politics pays well but it would be a fine opportunity for a talented young lady like yourself what kind of protection can you offer me when you might be voted out of office every election cycle he laughed who is there to challenge me you must at least listen to my advice darling she nodded lets sit in my car for a few minutes you sure youre not asking me out on a date she said i am almost sure otto said he led her to his massive oldsmobile painted a shiny sun yellow he opened the passenger side for her and she slid onto the leather seats he went around to the other side slid the key in the ignition and got the engine revving in a moment he had the airconditioning going and the low murmur of dance music from the radio he put a hand on top of hers maybe he did plan to offer her a job but he wasnt sure she wouldnt be willing to give him more shall i tell what i have in mind he asked first i should tell you something she said then she lashed out cobra fast and had a hand on his throat she slid over to his side and straddled him as if they were having sex she could feel the bulge in his pants and she could feel it diminishing in an instant it was both hands on his throat and she was leaning forward putting all of her weight not ever above pounds straight down on him she liked the heat of his skin the bulging under her palms under her thighs it was sexy but not exactly sexual it was powerful and she liked that desiree knew well that she had small hands and they werent strong even for their size surprise and the confines of the car worked in her favor but otto could escape her grip almost certainly if he tried if he really tried still she had a few crucial seconds here the advantage of his disorientation and she planned to be well away from him before he even thought to struggle otto weve done business together for a long time she said and its been good for everyone but if you ever pull shit like this again ill kill you you try to humiliate bb try to make suggestions about him use it as leverage whatever youre going to disappear you think youre smarter than he is and you think im cute and maybe you are and i am but dont you ever forget what else we are she let go of his throat you dont want to be his enemy otto coughed and put a hand to his adams apple but was otherwise quiet and still an old couple strolled through the parking lot staring unabashedly at the small white woman straddling the large black man in the car ive got some phone calls to make desiree said she gave him a quick kiss just a peck really but directly on his dry lips and then slid off and opened the driversside door the old man had looked away but the woman continued to stare over at her you want to say something desiree asked and she turned her empty judgmental eyes away otto was just now rousing himself from his wounded surprise he reached out to close his door but he met her eyes as he did so and of all things he offered her another of his grins does this mean you dont want the job my darling not at this moment she strolled over to bbs mercedes and shook her head softly the thing was otto might have been a player and a schemer and in his own way he might have been every bit as bad as bb but he had a sense of humor and that alone made her hope she wouldnt have to wrap her hands around his throat again chapter there i was survivor of a double homicide in the kwick stops public bathroom halfway to the store i realized i needed to piss and piss badly so badly that i couldnt believe i hadnt pissed myself during the shootings it was all i could do to keep from ducking behind a tree and taking a whiz under the canopy of stars but public urination even obscured public urination seemed a bad idea what if i had been caught what if the cops picked me up and found evidence hairs and fibers and that sort of thing my knowledge of police investigations came from a pastiche of television and movies so i had no idea how it worked in real life when i walked into the store i spotted the bathrooms in an instant in the doortodoor book trade you grow skillful at quickly finding the toilets in convenience stores and rushed back without even the pretense of calm in general i didnt like to act as though i needed the bathroom it embarrassed me that complete strangers should know about my body functions in this case however i was in no frame of mind for the casual shop a pantomime of interest in beef jerky and then a rub of palm against palm like oh i sure could do with a hand washing before a calm stroll into the bathroom when i looked up from the urinal i realized i must have already pissed since nothing was coming out and the crampy stretched feeling had faded into a tranquil fatigue i zipped up and washed checking in the mirror for signs of blood nothing in my hair or on my hands or clothes it all looked okay i splashed some water on my face again because i thought thats what you do in a crisis you wash your face did it really help or was it a myth circulated by the soap industry not that soap stockholders would gain much here the inverted pearshaped dispenser contained only encrusted pink dregs of soap gone by nothing in the way of towels only one of those rotating towel machines where someone elses dirt gets pressed or washed or just permanently affixed before it comes back around again i grabbed a wad of toilet paper from a loose roll propped above the dispenser and then dabbed it gently against my face the bathroom smelled like shit and piss and sickly floral deodorizers struggling to beat down the stench of crap and piss my hands trembled violently and i felt the need to puke the problem with puking was that i would have to get on my hands and knees to do it and the floor was covered with a deep coat of gummy dried urine and there was a fuzzy lump of gray shit in the toilet my reptile brain had no intention of letting me mark territory already well scented up by creatures more powerful and less hygienic than i instead i reached into my pocket for the check the check karen had written so that she could buy books for her now orphaned daughters karen wane it said in the top left corner it seemed odd that she and her husband wouldnt share the same account if i were worried about them passing the credit app it might be worth considering but under the circumstances it hardly mattered i tore up the check and dropped the pieces in the horrifically unflushed toilet one of the shreds fell into a viscous pool by the toilets side and i had to pick it up by its tiny dry corner and then daintily drop it in i flushed using the toe of my shoe so i wouldnt have to touch anything and then went to wash my hands again should i have flushed the check in two different toilets of course it wasnt as if cops were going to don hazmat suits and go wading through treatment plants in search of check fragments still i had to pound down that feeling of nausea again a process that involved closing my eyes and trying hard to think of nothing in about a minute i felt sure i wouldnt puke so i pushed open the door and got out of there the convenience store was a couple of miles from the motel i could easily have walked it would have preferred to but that wasnt the way it worked i had to wait for bobby so i grabbed a sixteenounce ginger ale from one of the walllength refrigerator displays in the hopes it would settle my stomach then i stood on line behind a guy wearing jeans and a black tshirt i couldnt see the mans face and all but a few strands of hair were hidden under a baseball cap with a glittery confederate flag emblazoned along the front but i could tell he was probably in his thirties or forties and he was chatting with the girl at the counter a teenager plenty young but not very pretty she had a longfaced horsey look to her with an upsidedown ushaped mouth that seemed never to close entirely the whole package ended up resembling nothing so much as an easter island statue no matter as the man in the confederate hat liked her plenty and his eyes rested with particular interest on her large squishylooking breasts which flashed out of a shortsleeved blouse one or two buttons past modesty the confederate laughed at something and slapped the counter and peered into the girls shirt unapologetically oh shit he said i think i must have dropped my quarter in there let me just get it out he raised his hand like it was getting ready to slide into the cleavage jim the girl said through a fan of splayed fingers you stop that she glanced at me as though trying to decide something then looked back at the confederate youre so bad on the radio an eager voice encouraged everyone to wang chung tonight which was one of the many confusing songs i figured id understand when i knew more of the world sort of like the lyrics to bohemian rhapsody the comprehension of which i assumed required a familiarity with european arts and music an educated person would know precisely what a scaramouch was and why he ought to do the fandango the unnaturally bright fluorescent lighting in the store made me feel as if i were onstage or caught in a police searchlight which was a particularly unhappy metaphor getting out of there escaping the lights the bad pop the freakish customer and clerk took on a kind of urgency i would gladly have stolen the ginger ale if id thought i might get away with it the kwick stop never the sort of place where i felt comfortable now seemed too small and it was getting smaller i didnt want to leave the ginger ale and i didnt want to say anything to the counter girl it also seemed a foregone conclusion that the man with the confederate hat wouldnt much like a kid with a northern accent and a tie telling him he had to hurry it up but i was thirsty and my stomach lurched violently so i twisted open the cap and took a drink it did make me feel a little better less like puking anyway you cant drink that before you pay for it the confederate man told me he grinned broadly exposing a mouth full of wild and white teeth its called stealing and we got laws about that here only now did i recognize him the guy from the ford pickup outside of bastard and karens trailer the splitlevel haircut was tucked under his hat but it was the same guy an icy terror burst in my chest and radiated out to my limbs but what the hell was i going to do run the guy had seen me go into a trailer where two people were murdered the nausea i realized most likely stemmed from my desire to suppress the one obvious fact in all of this once those bodies were found the cops were going to come looking for me no matter what the assassin had told me no matter what sweet lies he tried to conjure i knew full well that i would be their prime suspect it wasnt a matter of maybes or ifs they would want me apb on lem altick take no chances with lem altick boys hes probably armed and dangerous the only question was if my being totally innocent would save me i walked up to the counter and put down a dollar the soda was seventynine cents wait your turn the girl told me cant you see that theres people ahead of you there arent people i said my voice sounded edgy and nervous and i wished i would shut up theres person and hes not buying anything you being rude to this little girl the confederate asked rude as in pushy i asked or rude as in trying to stick my hand down her shirt boy you dont know who youre messing with the confederate said but i did i knew i was messing with a guy who wouldnt give a second thought about suckerpunching me and kicking my head when i was down still i was apt to run my mouth the thing id learned over the years was that the only power i had against someone like this was in mouthing off it didnt keep me from getting my ass kicked it might even promote an ass kicking but at least i got to perpetuate the stereotype of weak kids being verbally dexterous but this wasnt high school and id already learned tonight that the stakes were higher than a few bruises and a dose of humiliation it was time i decided to show some deference i didnt mean to be pushy i said quietly i just want to pay it aint time for you to pay you think you go walking around here in your tie and your fancy briefcase and you dont have to wait on line you think youre somehow better than us the math science and language arts curricula had been pretty weak but the one thing id learned back in middle school was that accusations of thinking i was better than someone else were a prelude to violence some asshole revving his engine in the process of convincing himself or witnesses or god that the ass kicking he was about to unleash was utterly righteous i needed to cool things down but it was hard to figure out my next move when my brain was spinning with terror there was a tiny hamster wheel of fear clacking around and i just couldnt get my thoughts to settle so i said what was probably the worst thing i could have i said we the confederate angled his head and stared what it was an outofbody experience i saw myself speaking and i had no power to stop you meant you think youre better than we we is a subject we are here who is here we are us on the other hand is an object the recipient of action bob gave the ball to us who gave the ball bob the subject did to whom did he give it us the object a stupid smile flattened out across my face the confederate stared as though i were a formaldehyde freak behind coney island glass the girl behind the counter took a step back her eyes went wide and she half raised her hands as though to protect her face from the coming blast the blast never came outside the store bobbys chrysler cordoba pulled gloriously miraculously into the parking lot the most fortunate timing in the history of the world far better luck than my nearly eighteen years had led me to expect or even hope for thats my ride i said as though wed been hanging out talking sports the confederate didnt say anything i looked to the counter girl but she would not meet my eyes nothing to do but forget the soda so i put it down on a pile of coors cases and began to head for the door you leave now and youre stealing it was the counter girl her voice had grown small and her hands which now hung limp by her side trembled just a little i stopped then let me pay i said you gotta wait your turn her voice was just above a whisper now the redneck bent toward me he wasnt unusually tall just under six feet and he had maybe an inch or so on me but he bent forward like a giant stooping to offer advice to a midget what do you think youre doing he asked correcting me i turned away hoping to god that bobby could see me would come to my rescue if he spotted trouble feeling the burn of the rednecks eyes i picked up the soda and took the dollar out from my pocket i put it back on the counter i didnt care that they were assholes and i didnt care about the change i cared only about getting out of there i turned away and pushed open the door which chimed merrily along with the sound of my laughter unhinged with giddy disbelief i had survived a double murder i had survived an interview with the killer i had survived a sure beating by a redneck whom i had insulted i ought to have felt some measure of relief but a churning dread burned away at my stomach i had survived only that moment and plenty more moments were coming chapter no one else was in the car yet which was some small comfort since it was a twodoor and i hated being crowded into the backseat in the months since id signed up id become bobbys biggest earner and that meant i received certain trivial privileges like good pickup times and the moochiest neighborhoods you dont look so hot bobby said you blank i shook my head and then peered into the store to make sure we werent in any trouble the confederate had gone back to flirting with the counter girl and appearances suggested id been more or less forgotten no i scored i opened my bag and handed bobby the paperwork i almost got a double but it didnt pan out bobby smiled hell my man you scored two days in a row youre on fire pronounced for sales motivation effect fieyah just stay pos keep thinking pos thoughts its the pos attitude that will get you the double or triple tomorrow bobby was a big guy big like a football player or more like an exfootball player he had meaty arms and thick legs no neck but he also had a sizable gut that jutted out over his cloth belt bobbys face was wide and boyish and almost preternaturally charismatic i wanted to be too smart to be drawn in by bobbys charm but i was drawn in all the same the fact was i found it impossible not to like bobby he enjoyed everyones company and he displayed a generosity beyond anything i had ever seen part of it was his command of the power of money bobby wanted always to demonstrate to his crew that he had cash that cash was good and that cash made you happy he would buy us beer and lunch and on occasion a night out during long drives when we stopped for fast food bobby tipped the counter workers at mcdonalds and burger king he tipped tollbooth attendants and hotel clerks he was to use his word pos you dont have a check here bobby said waving my paperwork at me he ran a hand through his short almost military style hair you didnt get green on me and forget again i had scored a double my first day on the job my first day no one expected people to score their first day so bobby hadnt yet talked me through the credit app and consequently i hadnt asked my buyers to fill one out bobby had then taken me over to both houses and this was now after midnight and all lights were out getting the people out of bed so they could sit around in their robes and fill out credit apps i would rather have given up the sales but bobby worked himself up into a feverishly rotating tornado of sales energy and hed insisted then again he knew he could get away with it he had that chummy grin and inviting laugh and that way of saying hello that made strangers think they must have met him before and simply forgotten i would have had the door slammed in my face but bobby had the wife at the second house making us all instant hot chocolate the kind with the little marshmallows that melted into gooey clouds and he had motivation i made off each sale bobby made each time i or anyone else in his crew scored thats why people wanted to be a crew boss you made money for getting other people to do work the paperwork bobby now held in his big hands belonged to karen and bastard i had handed over the wrong sheets the momentary relief id felt at escaping the redneck was now gone i was back to the rollercoaster feeling of plummeting straight down sorry i said i was bearing down clenching my abdominal muscles to keep the fear from seeping into my voice it was like trying to stanch a gaping wound i knew that the more time went by the more time i could spend living a normal life the less i would remember karen lying on the floor her eyes wide open a jagged crater in her forehead blood pooling around her like a halo id forget the acrid and coppery smell in the air i wanted it gone that was the one i blew i fished around in my bag and got the paperwork from early that afternoon the quiet little couple in the rundown green trailer their two kids and four dogs the stench of unpaid bills that had been a walk in the park bobby looked it over nodded definitively this looks pretty good he said before filing the papers in his own bag shouldnt be a problem passing i had missed out on commissions and bonuses because credit apps hadnt passed id even missed out on a big one a huge one because of credit apps my third week on the job id rung a doorbell and a skinny man pale as cream cheese wearing a bikini brief swimsuit bald but for a wedge of hair no thicker than a watchband had come to the door and grinned at me what are you selling hed asked somehow id sensed that it wasnt the right time for the usual line so id said straight out that i was selling encyclopedias come on back then the man had said lets see what you can do galen edwine my host was in the midst of a barbecue with about eight or nine other families while the kids splashed around in the moochie aboveground pool i pitched them all nearly twenty adults they drank beer they ate burgers they laughed at my jokes i was like the hired entertainment and when it was all over id sold four of them four a grand slam grand slams happened but rare enough that they were legendary that day there was a bonus for a grand slam so i racked up for a days work except i didnt because none of the credit apps passed not a single one it had happened to me before and it had happened since and it never ceased to piss me off but the tragedy of that day really got to me i had a grand slam and then it turned to dust still the reputation stuck and even if i hadnt earned the commissions id earned a certain respect so bobby pressed what happened here he held up karen and bastards app i shook my head they balked at the check shit lemmy you got inside and you couldnt close thats not like you i shrugged in the hopes that this conversation might simply go away it just sort of worked out that way you know when was all this maybe i should have lied but it didnt occur to me i didnt see where he was going with this i dont know tonight a few hours ago he glanced at the credit app for a minute as if he were looking for some forgotten detail lets go back there if this was only a few hours ago i bet i can work them i put a hand on the car for support i shook my head there was no way i wanted to return to the scene of the crime i dont think it will do any good come on lem i can work them what you dont want the money you dont want the bonus commission and bonus so were talking about another four hundred in your pocket i just dont think it will help i dont want to go well i want to try wheres highland road i dont remember i looked away wait here ill go in and ask bobby moved to go into the kwick stop i figured asking for directions especially from a guy who seemed already to want to kick my ass a guy who had seen me go into karen and bastards house and then going would be worse than just going i let out a sigh and told bobby that i now remembered the way and we drove back to the trailer it was just a few minutes along the quiet streets but the ride seemed to go on forever and it seemed all too short bobby parked the car along the curb and got out slamming the door hard enough to make me wince the trailer looked quiet freakishly quiet a beacon of stillness in the ocean of shrill insect sounds no trailer had ever looked as still as this one somewhere not too far away a dog barked an urgent bark that dogs saved for when a murder suspect lurked nearby bobby walked over to the trailer up the three cracked concrete stairs and rang the bell i looked back and forth compulsively a beatup datsun trawled past on a perpendicular street half a block down did it slow down to look at us hard to say bobby rang the doorbell again and this time he pulled back on the screen door and pounded softly if pounding can ever be soft just below the eyehole i caught myself thinking that they were never going to write that check if they were pissed off at being pulled out of bed from the steps bobby leaned over to peer into the kitchen window he pressed hard against the thin glass and i was sure he would go crashing through christ he said either theyre not home or theyre dead i laughed and then realized bobby hadnt said anything funny so i stopped together we walked back to the cordoba where i slouched in the front seat breathing in fear and indescribable relief while we headed out for the next pickup the inadequate airconditioning washed over me and i tried to recede into the freshly washed leather i wanted to pass out and i wanted to weep and on some level i wanted bobby to hug me but bobby busied himself by fiddling with the radio stations finally settling on blue öyster cult but somehow the songs insistence that i refrain from fearing the reaper didnt make me feel much better a single isnt bad he said maybe thinking that i probably needed a good pep talk not bad for a days work youre still in the game but a doubles better right huh but youll get a double tomorrow youre a power hitter lem youre doing great if i hadnt been numb from having witnessed a double homicide i felt sure that bobbys pos comments would have perked me up i hated the way i lapped up bobbys praise as if being a good bookman selling a set of books to people who would never use them and couldnt afford them were worth a pat on the head good doggie lem but i loved it two people dead holes in their heads blood and brains on the peeling linoleum and i still sort of loved it the other three guys in the ft lauderdale crew ronny neil scott and kevin piled one by one into the backseat each at his own pickup stop they all harbored resentment against me since scott was both fat and unimpressed by conventional ideas of personal hygiene and he crammed the rest of them in tight i meanwhile basked in legroom and relatively sweet air kevin was a quiet guy a bit short and stocky but affable in a selfcontained way it was easy to forget he was around even on long road trips he laughed at other peoples jokes but never told his own he always agreed when someone said he was hungry but probably would have starved to death before suggesting we stop to eat ronny neil and scott on the other hand were not so retiring they had joined up together and were like wartime buddies who enlisted from the same town and were assigned to the same platoon their friendship consisted as near as i could tell of ronny neil hitting scott in the back of the head and calling him a fat asshole ronny neil thought of himself as being strikingly handsome and maybe he was he had a sharply detailed face with big brown eyes of the sort that i thought women were said to like his straight strawcolored hair came down to his collar and he was deeply muscled without being bulky not like there was time to lift weights while we sold books but i did on occasion catch him doing pushups and situps around the motel room on those days that i managed to get up early enough to take in a run before the morning meeting ronny neil would earnestly advise me to take up lifting weights instead of doing pussy exercises but he would muse if there was one thing a jew ought to know how to do it was run fast each time he picked someone up at the designated convenience store bobby would take the guy around to the back of the car and open the trunk to shield their conversation from the rest of the crew once they entered the car you couldnt ask if theyd scored or blanked you couldnt ask how they did you werent allowed to tell stories about anything that happened to you that day unless the story was in no way related to scoring or blanking bobby and the other bosses knew there was no way to keep people from talking about it if someone hit a triple or a grand slam sometimes even a double everyone in all the crews would know by the next morning but you couldnt say anything in the car these rules appeared not to apply to ronny neil who didnt know how to shut up about scoring or anything else ronny neil was a year older than me and hed gone to a high school across the county from mine so i hadnt known him but the rumor machine had churned out some interesting details by all accounts hed been a serviceable placekicker for the schools football team but hed been convinced of his greatness and convinced that a football scholarship would be his for the taking as it turned out the only offer he received was from a historically black college in south carolina that was interested in diversifying its student population ronny neil had gone off in a huff and come back at the end of his freshman year with his scholarship revoked here details get fuzzy he was kicked out either because he failed to keep his grades up because hed been involved in a drunken and sordid sex scandal that the university wanted desperately to keep quiet or and this was my personal favorite hed never quite gotten the hang of avoiding the word jigaboo even when black students outnumbered him three hundred to one on the drives back to the motel hed tell us about how hed scored and hed share with us some of the more implausible incidents from his colorful life hed tell us about how hed filled in briefly for the bass player of molly hatchet how hed been asked to join the navy seals how hed fingerfucked adrienne barbeau after his cousins wedding though it was never clear what a movie star was doing at his cousins wedding he told these stories with such surety that they left me wondering if my own sense of the universe was hopelessly skewed was it possible that i lived in a world in which adrienne barbeau might let herself be fingerfucked by a moron like ronny neil cramer it hardly seemed likely but how could i really know on the other hand he bragged about things that were true too like about how the last time we were in jacksonville when wed stayed at the same motel hed stolen a passkey off the cleaning cart and slipped into half a dozen rooms lifting cameras and watches and cash out of wallets hed laughed himself sick watching sameen the indian man who owned the place defending his wife the hotel maid from accusations of theft he told us that the previous year before the election hed put on a suit and tie and gone around soliciting donations for the republican party hed have people make out checks to rnc and then hed just write in the rest of his last name seedy checkcashing places on federal highway had no problem cashing his checks for r n cramer tonight he was going on about how some hot redhead had been begging for him while her husband watched helpless to do anything about it you sure it wasnt the husband wanted you scott asked the words coming out as a highpitched jumble of spit from his rather serious lisp yes im thur ronny neil said he flicked scott in the ear you smell worse than a piece of shit you tonguetied dumbass for someone whod just been insulted injured and mocked for a speech impediment scott took it all in stride i felt a sympathetic knot of outrage on behalf of a guy i couldnt stand how would you know what a piece of shit smells like he asked sagely unless you were going up to them and sniffing at them i know what a piece of shit thellths like you fucking pussy because im thitting next to one still ronny neil looked away embarrassed that scott had drawn blood with so cutting a zinger when we got back to the motel we walked through its forlorn main parking lot cradled between two parts of the twostoried lshape here were the cars of the lost the wandering the short on gas the long on fatigue people who had left their dreams up north or out west and were now willing to let their lives take meaning from nothing more complicated than the absence of snow in the light of day the buildings were pale green and bright turquoise a florida symphony of color at night it appeared desolately gray we filed into the gamblers room his real name was kenny rogers so the nickname had come with depressing inevitability but we treated it as though it were the height of wit as i understood it the gambler didnt own the company that contracted with champion encyclopedias publisher but he was high up the chain of command was lost in interlinking strands of haziness and i suspected intentionally so but i knew one thing with absolute certainty every set of books that got sold meant money in the gamblers pocket he was probably in his fifties though he looked younger his slightly long white hair gave him an angelic cast and he had one of those easygrinning faces that made him a natural at sales he looked you right in the eye when he spoke to you as if you were the only person in the world he smiled at everyone with fond familiarity the lines around his eyes crinkling with good humor a born fucking salesman bobby had called him he still rang doorbells two or three days a week to stay fresh and rumor had it that he hadnt blanked in more than five years when i walked in the gambler hadnt yet arrived he was always the last to show strutting into the room like a rock star coming out onstage ronny neil and scott were off in the corner talking loudly about ronny neils truck back home and how big the tires were about how a cop had stopped him for speeding but let him go because he admired the tires the gamblers gainesville crew finally came in strolling with the confident sense of superiority of a kings retinue the gambler drove a van so he had a large crew nine in all but only one woman encyclopedia sales held particular challenges for women and even the good ones generally didnt last for more than two or three weeks rare was the crew with more than a single woman long hours spent walking by deserted roadsides going alone into strangers homes lecherous customers and lewd insinuations from the other bookmen dwindled their ranks and i suspected with great sadness that this one wouldnt last either nevertheless id been thinking about her since her appearance the previous weekend chitra chitra radhakrishnan during the past week id caught myself saying her name aloud just for the pleasure of hearing its music her name sounded kind of like her accent soft lilting lyrical and she was beautiful stunning far better looking than any woman i thought myself entitled to like even from a distance tall and graceful with caramel skin and black hair pulled into a ponytail and big eyes the color of coffee with skim milk her fingers were long and tapered finished off with bright red polish and she wore tons of silver rings even on her thumb which id never seen anyone else do i hardly knew her id had only a single extended conversation with her but those words had been electric for all that i couldnt say why this woman should be the one to send me into a tumbling vortex of infatuation there were other women in the group though not many and there had been in a purely objective sense far prettier ones in the past id never had a crush on any of them i had to consider the possibility that it was chitras foreignness perhaps her being indian among the otherwise all white population made her a misfit and therefore accessible or maybe for all her beauty and it was considerable there was something vaguely awkward about her a slightly ungainly walk an absent selfeffacing way of holding her head in conversation whatever it was i wasnt alone in admiring her even ronny neil who complained bitterly about his daily interactions with mud people couldnt take his eyes off her now he rose and went over to her just like that the words came out of him easy as anything i couldnt hear except that ronny neil said hi there baby and chitra smiled at him as if hed said something worth smiling about i felt a comforting rage comforting because of its familiarity and because it had nothing to do with the murder which for a moment i could tuck into a neat little compartment toward the back of my brain i could understand why ronny neil liked chitra she was beautiful that would be enough for him but why would chitra even speak to ronny neil surely she was the antironny neil with her quiet reserve her skeptical glances at the gambler the kindness she radiated that stood in counterbalance to ronny neils malevolence i knew almost nothing about her but i was already certain that chitra was smart and chitra was discerning but she was also from india she had been here since she was eleven shed told me that in a brief conversation i had strategized into existence the previous saturday night but she was still from a foreign country she spoke english well having studied it even before moving here but she spoke in the formal way many foreigners had suggesting theyre always tripping over something always making decisions worried about mistakes to me her foreignness raised the possibility that she might not be able to recognize the furnace of assholery that smoldered inside ronny neil surely they didnt have rednecks in uttar dinajpur from which she told me her family had emigrated they had assholes of their own variety obviously singularly uttar dinajpurish assholes assholes who would send up asshole flags the instant they entered an uttar dinajpur bar or restaurant but it might be hard for an american instantly to see such a person for who he was chitra was clever but ronny neil might nevertheless prove illegible to her so i had my eye on her to keep her safe ronny neil sat next to her and the two of them started talking quietly the fact that i couldnt hear a word of it made me furious and for a moment i considered getting up going over to them inserting myself into the mix the problem was i knew it would make me look foolish and desperate make my situation immeasurably worse my position was just fine for the moment the previous week after a couple of rapidly consumed cans of miller beer id managed to work up the courage to sit next to her and casually introduce myself shed listened to my bookman advice laughed at my bookman war stories a genuine laugh too an infectious almost convulsive giggle that came with mild torso rocking she talked about the novels she liked how after the summer she would be starting at mount holyoke where she had already decided she would do a dual major in comp lit and philosophy she loved living in the united states she said but she missed indian music and street food and the dozens of varieties of mangoes you could buy in the markets the conversation had been marvelous and full of promise but i hadnt initiated it until two in the morning and i had hardly overcome my initial nervousness before she announced she absolutely had to get some sleep i saw her the next morning but did nothing more than smile politely and say good morning lest i betray the fact that i liked her now i kept still averted my eyes for as long as i could before sneaking glances then i watched them talk while trying not to think about the dead bodies id seen that night though dead bodies already seemed a bit of sanitizing i hadnt seen dead bodies id seen bodies becoming dead that surely ought to keep me from dwelling on chitra on the graceful length of her neck on the vaguest hint of cleavage that peeked out from her white blouse it ought to have but somehow it didnt meanwhile the gambler had started talking hed been saying something about how it was all in the attitude about how the people out there wanted what we had to sell oh yes my friends he cried out his face was darkening not with the blood red of exertion but with the vibrant pink of exuberance you know i see them out there every day theyre out in front of their homes with their plastic swimming pools and their big wheels and their lawn jockeys you know what they are dont you theyre moochie they want to buy something theyre looking around with their greedy little eyes and theyre thinking what can i buy what can i spend my money on that is going to make me feel better about myself the gambler stopped and unbuttoned the collar of his blue oxford and loosened his tie with one finger like rodney dangerfield not getting respect see they dont understand money you do they want to get rid of it they want you to have it you know why because money is a good thing to have you know those songs you know the ones they tell you money isnt important only love matters thats right love you get together with your special love and as long as you have each other nothing else counts you can live in a rundown shack as long as you have love you can drive a beatup old car as long as you have love thats awful pretty and then he did that odd thing his arms were out flailing wide as if he were about to hug a bear and he just paused held the pose in the air he didnt do this every session not even every weekend but id seen him do it three or four times before it was weird theater but the crowd loved it everyone broke out into applause and cheers while the gambler held the position for twenty maybe thirty seconds and then he went back to his rant yeah he said as though he hadnt been playing statue those words are nice but those songs dont tell you about when the guy from that better neighborhood drives by in his brandnew cadillac on his way to his beautiful home and he winks at that inlove woman standing in front of her rundown shack see now that beatup car dont seem like its enough those people you sell to theyre looking for something and so are you theyre looking for what you can give them a sense of doing the right thing my lord friends it is so beautiful you believe in god you better thank god right now for helping you to find this job this job that lets you help others while you help yourself this went on for another half an hour the gambler made those who had scored feel like royalty and those who had blanked would burn to get back out there and try again he possessed and harnessed an incredible energy that i saw and understood even though it left me unmoved where everyone else fed off his enthusiasm i saw a core of meanness as though it were not money but anger that kept him going i saw the guy who would happily steal the poor inlove woman from her poor but inlove man just for the pleasure of meanness now theres one more thing the gambler told the crowd he was winded slightly bent and breathing deeply i just learned that there may be a reporter whos interested in us i dont know the details but hes gonna be taking a look at what we do may already be here among us for all i know and let me tell you a little something about the news folks encyclopedia salesmen bring knowledge and opportunity to needy families doesnt make as good a headline as encyclopedia salesmen trick customers hard as it is to believe thats how theyre going to want to show us so if a reporter comes up to any of you i dont want you to say anything not a thing other than no comment you hear you find out their name who they work for get a business card if you can and bring it to me are we all on the same page yes the room roared these people want to stop you from making money and our customers from learning i dont know what the hell their problem is but as long as im head of this crew were going to keep on making the world a better place and were gonna make money while we do it after the meeting everyone began to file out by the pool the way we did every night i moved through the crowd trying to keep an eye on chitra i heard her say something to ronny neil and walk off he hesitated and followed but i got the sense they werent going together by the pool the crew bosses would be grabbing cases of tall boys bud or miller or coors or whatever was cheapest and shoving them in coolers someone would bring out a radio or a tape player if people in the rooms above them minded the noise we never heard about it i always joined them at least for a while but that night i wasnt up to it i needed to be alone the aftersales meeting had been a torture but at least it had distracted me for a few minutes now alone again i felt like i had to get away i wasnt able to make idle conversation to laugh at stupid jokes i was afraid that if i had a beer or two id start to cry i went back to the motel room it had two beds shared by four guys ronny neil demanded his own bed and scott and kevin were willing to share which meant i ended up on the floor we didnt pay for the motel ourselves so i couldnt complain it was hard to tell how much was the room and how much the roommates but when i walked in the scents of mold and sweat and cigarettes and something stale and crusty slapped my senses even so the feeling of solitude and privacy comforted me i sat by myself for a moment staring at the blank gray face of the tv maybe there was something about the murders maybe i should be watching i continued to stare afraid of what i might see or not see until in a surge of bravery i lunged forward and turned it on the late news would be long over by now but i figured if there was a murder the local news stations would jump at the chance to use their generally useless live broadcast equipment nothing no police cars or helicopters hovering over the mobile home i sat at the edge of the bed hands pressed against the tattered bedspread that smelled like a mix of ashtray and aftershave and stared with unfocused eyes at johnny carson who was laughing hysterically at eddie murphy i didnt really know who or what eddie murphy was imitating but i took comfort in johnny carsons appreciation could i really have witnessed a murder in a world full of carson s belly laughs i wanted to embrace the doubt but there were too many questions so i opened the night table drawer and took out the phone book to look up oldham health services nothing in the yellow pages or the business white pages it didnt prove anything it could be reasonably close by without being in the same county but unless i knew where it was i didnt see how i could get a number to call them and ask them who they were and and what if they knew a guy named bastard that wasnt exactly a conversation i wanted to have i stood up and looked out the window pressing the thick brownish curtain to one side and trying not to cough from the storm of dust id unleashed about thirty book people were out now the tinkle of music and laughter filtered through the window id flipped off the gurgling air conditioner for a moment so i could hear what there was to hear through the glass i could just discern the furiously optimistic jangle of walking on sunshine that song was everywhere that summer and as much as i hated it its rhythms pumped with an undeniable pull it announced cheerfully that people were having fun somewhere else quite possibly everywhere else and sure it was stupid mindnumbing fun but it was still fun and sitting in a tobaccosaturated motel room with globs of ancient semen encrusted into the carpet trying to decide if id really seen two people gunned down that night was a hell of a lot less fun than walking on sunshine down to the pool drinking watery beer and possibly even flirting with chitra i looked out the window again and there was chitra sitting on the edge of a slatted reclining chair the sort sunbathers across the country the world for all i knew endured in order to tan themselves a tall boy was wrapped around those long silverringed redtipped fingers like everyone else she still wore her selling clothes in her case black slacks and white blouse so she looked like a waitress a beautiful waitress the fact was i was going to be eighteen in january and this virginity business was beginning to get me down not in a frenetic mustvisitthewhorehouse porkys sort of way but more in a lifeispassingmeby way it felt as though everyone i knew had been invited to a party from which i was barred i could hear the music and the peals of laughter and the clinking of crystal champagne flutes but i couldnt get in from my room i could make out chitras distant smiling face it was a big easy open and unselfconscious grin she was one of those pretty girls who didnt fully appreciate or factor in the effect pretty girls had on men so she believed the world to be a much nicer place than it was the brutality of people like ronny neil remained invisible to her not only because she wouldnt know a redneck if he did doughnuts on her lawn in his fourbyfour but also because they werent assholes around her were they they didnt insult her crowd her space make her feel that only the thinnest gossamer thread kept her safe from a monumental ass kicking no they tripped over themselves they told her how nice she looked they gave up their seats for her they offered her a piece of kit kat and for a moment i felt an incredible jolt of envy envy not of those who were close to chitra but of chitra herself and that beautiful protected fantastical universe into which shed been given a free pass now she threw back her head and let out a full tinkling laugh so highpitched that i could hear it this far away through the glass over the music from the boom box she was surrounded by a group of people marie from the jacksonville office a couple of people from tampa harold from gainesville who i suspected might be a rival at first i didnt recognize the guy who was doing such a great job of amusing her the umbrella at their table was up and the angle was odd i could tell from the clothes it wasnt ronny neil and anyway ronny neil wasnt very funny he might tell some dirty jokes or racist jokes in the car but they were stupid and only scott laughed at them they sure as hell werent going to make chitra throw back her head and let loose and then i saw the comedian tall thin black jeans white buttondown with the collar done up even whiter hair puffing upward and outward it was the assassin chitra was talking with the assassin chapter empty bud cans already littered the outdoor stairwell the gambler and bobby and the other crew bosses asked us not to litter but there was no way to get a bunch of exhausted bookmen thrilled after a long day to be sitting and drinking beer to pick up after themselves the bosses didnt really care as long as the books were sold and sameen and lajwati lal who owned the motel were content if not exactly happy as long as the bills were paid we stayed at this motel every time we came to jacksonville and they werent about to mess with a decentsize account so in the end nothing got done i rounded the stairs nearly slipping in a puddle of spilled beer but recovering by leaping into the air and landing at the bottom of the first floor to get to the pool i had to cross a little courtyard go past the reception lobby and come out the other end i never got that far when i landed i smelled something sweet and familiar and it wasnt until i felt a hand on my shoulder that i processed the scent it was pot not that i found anything especially sinister about pot sure i associated its use with my father but my father also wore pants and i wasnt about to eschew them on similar grounds id smoked a few times and though it always made me headachy and paranoid i figured that sometimes you had to be a good sport and go along to get along but here on the road with the bookmen i associated pot with just one thing rednecks wheres the hebrew fire scott lisped in his highpitched voice it wasnt bad enough the guy had an impediment he sounded as if hed just sucked in helium as well he had one of his dinnerplate hands on my shoulder and there was nothing friendly about it he pressed hard but even so i could have gotten away if thats what id wanted however doing so would have involved some squirming which struck me as humiliating better i thought to act as though i didnt care this strategy was one id turned to again and again in middle school and high school it never worked but i clung to the routine as desperately as a sailor clung to prayer in the face of a storm yeah where ith it ronny neil said harassing me didnt mean that scott was above contempt i looked at scotts hand ive got somewhere to go i said the sour odor of his unwashed body began to pierce the shell of the pot where would you have to go scott asked his eyes were already red and halfclosed and he teetered a little uncomfortably on his feet i tried not to stare at a cluster of pimples on his chin big and foamy white at the top yeah ronny neil repeated tossing his hair back like an actor in a shampoo commercial he took a big suck from the pipe held it for a moment and blew the smoke in my face i understood the gravity of smoke blowing a man blew smoke in your face you beat the shit out of him if you had the chance it was a hanging offense a reason to go nuclear bobby wants to see me i said in a scratchy voice it seemed like a good lie no one wanted to get on bobbys bad side there was no percentage in that fuck bobby and fuck you and fuck all your asshole friends ronny neil said that i observed is a lot of fucking you little shit scott added he jabbed his finger in my stomach not insanely hard but hard enough to hurt ronny neil smacked scott in the back of the head i tell you to hit him you fat fuck i just poked him scott answered defiantly well dont juth pokth himth dont juth poke nobody until i tell you to asshole he turned to me you think bobby is so great he aint shit around here and he dont know shit about whats going on the gambler trusts us you understand not you and not bobby so stop hiding behind him like he was your mama bobbys a fucking asshole scott said he gives all the best areas to a pussy like you a puthy like you ronny neil repeated you know what im starting to feel like a third wheel in this conversation i said i think the polite thing would be for me to excuse myself i think the polite thing would be for you to stick it up your ass its funny i said how the standards of politeness vary from culture to culture you think youre smart you blank again tonight ronny neil handed the pipe over to scott who looked at his hand for a moment trying to figure out how to keep me where he wanted without touching me scott then studied the ground and moved around on unsteady feet to block me from getting away i didnt blank i said not that its your business when you fall asleep tonight scott said were gonna fuck you up i had heard this threat before but it never amounted to anything they didnt want to get fired they just wanted to make me afraid and it worked because even though they hadnt done anything yet didnt mean they werent going to they were certainly capable of it guys like ronny neil and scott had no real future not one they could imagine or look forward to the end of high school had always meant that i could put the worst behind me for ronny neil and scott it meant that the best was over they were entirely capable of doing something horrible and irreversible of sending themselves to jail all on a whim my clenched determination not to waver before them was beginning to crumble id seen too much today and now i could feel the tears welling back somewhere in my throat i needed to find some way to end this just what do you boys think youre doing we all turned around sameen lal came storming out of the registration office a paddle i somehow recognized as a cricket bat in one hand he was in his forties slender and tall and had a thick head of black hair welldefined cheekbones and small intense eyes a natty little mustache we stayed in his motel many times and he recognized some of us and had opinions about the ones he recognized he and his wife had singled me out for friendly waves a good morning a sympathetic nod at night they somehow knew my name they also appeared to understand that ronny neil and scott were bad news i smell something illegal sameen said i want you boys to clear out of here how you doing there semen i smelled it too ronny neil said i think lem heres been smoking ganja best you should call the police and turn him in hardly my idea of a good joke tonight less so than ever fortunately sameen understood what he was dealing with i find your story very unlikely now this is my motel and im telling you to clear off or ill report this to your boss i wouldnt do that if i were you id hate to see this here motel of yours burn to the ground if you take my meaning his meaning is arson i said working hard to sound dry now that my rescuer was here i never threatened nothing ronny neil said you just remember that when this here place burns down that i never threatened nothing i do not want to hear your threats sameen said you are a pair of very bad boys now clear off i said okay then ronny neil took hold of my arm and began to lead me away lets go sameen raised the cricket bat only a few inches but it was clear he meant business and that he understood a lot more than his retiring demeanor suggested let go of him and clear off by yourselves i dont like the way youre ordering us around semen ronny neil said you dont decide who goes where now do you the two of them stared at each other each waiting for something definitive to happen over by the pool above the throb of conversation and music i heard a few words unmistakably chitras voice and i wanted to find some way to excuse myself for her sake yes but for my own too i didnt want to be there to witness more violence not even if it meant ronny neil having his head bashed in by a vigilante wicket keeper excuse me mr lal youve got a customer waiting for you sir so if you dont mind ill look out for lemuel the assassin walked toward us with an easy if slightly slouched gait he had a spirited grin and one hand was up in a half wave ronny neil scott and sameen stared they stared at this crazylooking guy with his wild white hair and gangling enthusiasm im lemuels friend the assassin said to sameen hes okay now how do you know my name sameen asked its inscribed on your cricket bat sameen squinted with suspicion can i leave you with him he asked me i nodded i was afraid to do anything else sameen nodded back you come see me if you have any more problems he said to me and then went back to his office i liked that sameen had come out to help me i was grateful even touched but id never believed that this inoffensive nearly invisible man even with his bat would be a match for ronny neil and scott the assassin on the other hand was another story the brief gust of relief i felt was gone in an instant the assassin might get ronny neil and scott to back off but i couldnt help feeling i was better off with ronny neil and scott i wanted to beg them not to leave me alone with him what do you want ronny neil asked his voice slow and viscous he held himself straight but he was a good three inches shorter than the stranger just looking for lemuel the assassin said he put a hand on my shoulder and began to lead me toward the pool i didnt want to go i wanted to cling to something to resist but there was no resisting him and i went that your boyfriend ronny neil called i ignored them but the assassin didnt he turned and cocked his thumb and index finger into a gun and fired invisible digit bullets at each of them how frightened should i be i wondered i had already known he was down here i had been coming to the pool because he was there and we were in public for all that however i felt the chill of terror simply from his proximity as though he belonged as though he were the host and i the visitor the assassin led me to the throng of bookmen by the pool for a criminal he didnt fear crowds much in my haze i didnt see her come up to us but then there she was ive met your friend chitra said gesturing toward the assassin with her redtipped fingers she stood next to me smiling warmly even goofily as if shed started in on a beer that would be one too many and talking to me our first exchange of the weekend for all my fear i felt the thrill at hearing her voice which was soft and high the accent sort of british and sort of not hes quite funny i grabbed a tall boy popped it open and drank without tasting trying not to gulp yeah hes a great guy i said to chitra i then turned to the killer what are you doing here i tried to keep the trembling out of my voice tried to hit the tone i would have used with anyone i knew who had turned up unexpectedly i wildly missed the mark looking for you lemuel will you excuse me for a minute of course chitra said the assassin put his hand on my back pushing me away from the crowd i didnt much care for him touching me in that way in part because he was a killer but also because people already were quick to label me as gay not that they really much contemplated my sexual proclivities but the insult came easily to guys like ronny neil and scott for whom faggot interchanged nicely with pussy and jewboy the assassin stopped by the candy machine that rested between the two public bathrooms the nauseatingly sweet scent of deodorizer wafted out whyd you go back to the trailer lemuel the assassin asked so there it was the reason he had followed me here i felt the whoosh of panic in my ears id been caught but caught at what exactly maybe i tried to tell myself i should relax now that i knew what it was i could deal with it maybe on the other hand a guy who resolved his problems by killing now had a bone to pick with me and that was discouraging i didnt have a choice the words tumbled out hasty and hollow nothing in the assassins body language suggested menace but i had to believe that i was talking to save my life i accidentally handed the wrong credit app to my crew boss i explained the rest how bobby wanted to go back wouldnt take no for an answer the assassin considered my explanation for only a matter of seconds all right he said but your pit boss didnt see anything strange i shook my head he just rang the doorbell and knocked and then we took off because it looked kind of funny to me the assassin said from where i was watching it looked funny yeah i know but i couldnt do anything about it i guess theres no harm done huh he gave me a little pat on the shoulder and i got to meet that nice girl he leaned closer i think she likes you he said in a stage whisper really what did she say the absurdity of the question of the conversation descended on me at once and i blushed she said she thought you were cute which you are in a timid sort of way can i get my drivers license back i wanted to hear more about what chitra had said i wanted to interrogate the assassin get every detail of what she said how she said it how it came up her body language her expression i almost began the interrogation but i had to remember that this was not a friend not someone with whom i could talk about a girl i was also eager to change the subject from the very probably gay assassins evaluation of my cuteness he shrugged okay he reached into his pocket and pulled it out but ive got your name and address memorized so you know i can find you if you decide you want to be a jerk about this but i dont think thats going to be a problem and hell its one thing to frame someone for murder kind of another to make him wait on line at the dmv as long as you have your sense of priorities in order i put the license back in my pocket strangely comforted the assassin was acting reasonable so maybe i really didnt need to worry i couldnt believe it though the fact that he wasnt always at every moment homicidal didnt change what hed done and it didnt make me worry about him any less i was about to say something that i hoped would encourage his departure when i saw something in my mind saw it in a cinematic flash wed been right there cleaned up all around it but there was something we missed fuck i whispered the assassin raised one eyebrow yes the checkbook it came out like a croak karen wrote a check for the books and she wrote a note in her checkbook the receipt i was the only one working that area the cops will be able to figure out it was me crap the assassin shook his head why didnt you think of that before i wasnt exactly prepared for this i yelped im not a professional i didnt have a list of things to tick off yeah youre right you are right he stood for a moment still processing the new information okay lemuel weve got to go back what we cant well we have to otherwise you my friend are going to jail i dont want to go back there i said in a quiet voice i cant do it you want me to go by myself to save your butt thats hardly fair i thought to say that i wasnt the one whod killed bastard and karen in the first place but i knew how the words would sound coming out of my mouth absurd and petty all at once and you just didnt get petulant with a killer the assassin looked at me cocked his head like a deer in a petting zoo youre not afraid of me are you lemuel it might have sounded odd or creepy but in fact there was something kind of touching about it the killer didnt want me to be afraid you know i began i didnt know where to take it i told you im not going to hurt you youre going to have to trust me now because were in this together fuck this i announced and fuck you too then on second thought i added nothing personal i mean but this isnt me this isnt my life im not involved in killings and assassinations and breakins i cant be part of this first thing in the morning im going to call a cab go to the bus station and go home thats a great idea the assassin said running away is a reasonable strategy sometimes there are some things that should be run away from the only problem is lemuel this one is going to come running after you i understand that you want to be done with it all and i want you to be done with it but for that to happen youre going to have to see it through you run away now all eyes are going to be on you i didnt want to accept it but i knew it was true i cant believe this i dont blame you the assassin said but denial is not going to get you through this lemuel im going to get you through this he gazed at me a beatific smile on his pale skin and i believed it inexplicable as it was i believed it the rational thing would have been to run screaming to barricade myself in the room and call the cops that was the only way i might get out of it but the assassin was so smooth so crafty i couldnt quite believe that i would get the better of him if i called the cops id end up in jail and if i rebuffed the assassin id end up in jail i didnt want to go anywhere with him he was a killer and i didnt want to be alone with a killer okay i breathed now we have to go get that checkbook the two of us okay you can do this i nodded unable to summon any words the assassin drove a slightly beatup datsun hatchback charcoal or gray or something it was hard to tell in the dark i had vaguely imagined he would drive an aston martin or a jaguar or something james bondish with ejector seats retractable machinegun turrets a button that would instantly turn it into a speedboat mainly it had old magazines and empty orange juice cartons cramping the floor on the passenger side there was a pile of paperback books on the backseat books with odd titles like animal liberation and the history of sexuality volume one how many volumes did a history of sexuality require id been nervous getting in we werent allowed to leave the motel and we werent allowed to go anywhere with friends who might live in town if i had reported ronny neil and scotts harassment i had no doubt that they would have thrown themselves into paroxysms of outrage at my tattling acting like a baby i also knew they would not hesitate to turn me in if they saw me leave still so what if they did given the enormity of the crime i was covering up slipping out at night didnt seem all that terrible the assassin kept his eyes straight ahead of him hands at two and ten oclock on the wheel he looked calm and comfortable just an ordinary evening of an ordinary life i felt neither calm nor comfortable my heart pounded my stomach churned and the nausea returned this time interlaced with glutinous chunks of fear leaving in pursuit of the checkbook had seemed like my only move but now i had to wonder if i had just signed on to my own death why are you going to such trouble to help me i asked mostly just to break the horrific silence the assassin had some kind of strange hollow thudding music playing softly from his tape deck the singer groaned that love would tear him apart again you could just fuck me over if you wanted to i could youre right but i dont want to why to begin with if the cops get you theres always a chance that youll lead them to me its unlikely but it could happen better they should get no one than get you besides it would be wrong for you to go to jail for this even if you were arrested and acquitted that would be monumentally unfair if i could prevent it i did what i did to those people because it was the ethical thing to do it hardly makes sense to let someone else suffer for my convenience whats the point of behaving ethically if its going to have unethical consequences you want to tell me why it was ethical to kill them melford what melford kean thats my name i figured you know now that were working together you ought to know my name so maybe youll trust me and now you dont have to think of me as the killer or something he thrust out his right hand feeling fully the absurdity of it i shook he had a firm shake but melford keans hand felt thin and precise like a musical instrument it wasnt the hand of a killer more like that of a surgeon or an artist and the calm confidence of his shake helped to distract me from the notion that his giving me his name didnt make me feel safer it made me feel less safe i knew his name didnt that make me a danger to him i didnt point that out however rather i said ive been thinking of you as the assassin thats sort of cool the assassin mysterious agent of unknown forces he laughed i didnt get why it was funny i thought it was more or less true since were friends and all i proposed maybe you can tell me why you killed them i cant lemuel id like to but i cant because youre not ready to hear it yet if i tell you youll say hes crazy and your opinion of me and what i do will be set in stone but im not crazy i just see things more clearly than most people isnt that what crazy people say point taken but its also what people who see more clearly say the question is when to believe those who say it you know about ideology you mean like politics i mean ideology in the marxist sense the way in which culture produces the illusion of normative reality social discourse tells us whats real and our perception of reality depends as much on that discourse as it does on our senses sometimes even more you have to understand that were all peering at the world through a gauze a haze a filter and that filter is ideology we see not whats there but what were supposed to believe is there ideology makes some things invisible and makes some things that arent there seem like theyre visible its true not just of political discourse but of everything like stories why do stories always have to have a love component it seems natural right but its only natural because we think it is or fashion ideology is why people in one era might think their clothes look normal and neutral but twenty years later theyre absurd one minute striped jeans are cool the next theyre a joke so youre above all that i asked the striped jeans yes but for the most part im bound up in ideology the same as everyone else yet knowing that its there grants us some small power over ideology and if you squint you can see a little more clearly than most thats really the best you can hope for because were all the products of ideology none of us even the smartest and the most aware most revolutionary can escape it but we can try we have to always try and maybe you can try too so when i see you squinting ill tell you that sounds like an awful lot of crap to me i wished i could take it back the minute i said it look i know its bogus to just leave you in the dark so let me ask you a question i dont think youll be able to answer it right now but when you can ill know that you are able to see past our cultural blinders then ill be able to tell you why i did what i did okay good now prisons have been around for many centuries right is that your question no therell be a whole bunch of little questions theyll be leading up to the big question ill tell you when we get there so prisons right why do we send criminals to prisons i peered out the window into the darkness dark houses dark streets rolling by in the middle of the night people quietly sleeping watching tv having sex eating late night snacks i sat in a car talking about prisons with a crazy man for doing things like killing people in their mobile homes i ventured it was like the grammar lesson in the convenience store i needed to learn to shut up youre a funny guy lemuel we send them to prisons to punish them right but why why that punishment what else do you want to do with them hell you could do lots of stuff lets say someone is a housebreaker slips into homes takes jewelry money whatever doesnt hurt anyone but just takes stuff there are lots of ways to deal with him you could kill him you could cut off his hands you could make him wear special clothes or give him a special tattoo you could make him do community service you could provide him with counseling or religious training you could look at his background and decide he needs more education you could exile him you could send him to study with tibetan monks why do we use prisons i dont know thats what we use melford took a hand off the steering wheel for a moment so he could point at me correct because thats what we use ideology my friend from the moment of birth we are trained to see things a certain way and that way seems natural and inevitable not worth questioning we look at the world and we think we see the truth but what we see is what we are supposed to see we turn on the television and happy people are eating at burger king or drinking coke and it makes perfect sense to us that burgers and coke are the path to happiness thats just advertising i said but advertising is part of the social discourse and it shapes our minds our identities as much as if not more so than anything our parents or schools teach us ideology is more than a series of cultural assumptions it makes us subjects lemuel we are subject to it so that we serve culture rather than culture serving us we see ourselves as autonomous and free but the limits of our freedom have always already been delineated by the ideology that provides the border of our tunnel vision and who controls the ideology the freemasons he smirked at me i love conspiracy theories the freemasons the illuminati the jesuits the jews the bilderberg group and my personal favorite the council on foreign relations great stuff but where these conspiracy theorists go wrong is that they see the result as evidence of schemers to them because theres a conspiracy there must be conspirators and thats wrong dead wrong the machinery of cultural ideology is on autopilot lemuel it is a force like a boulder going down a hill it is going somewhere picking up speed and damn close to unstoppable but there is no intelligence behind the boulder it is beholden to physical laws not its own will what about the rich guys in smokefilled rooms who plot to make us eat more fast food and drink more sodas theyre not driving the boulder theyre being crushed by it just like the rest of us i took a polite moment to consider this idea and then i moved on this isnt helping me with the prison question its pretty basic really because of our ideology sending criminals to prison strikes us as inevitable not as a choice one option of many but as the thing now lets go back to our hypothetical housebreaker what is supposed to happen to him in prison i shook my head and smiled at the absurdity of it all playing this peripatetic game with a killer and it was absurd but the thing was i enjoyed it for the few seconds that i could forget who melford kean really was what i had seen him do earlier that evening i enjoyed talking to him melford held himself as if he were important as if he knew things really knew them and this whole business with prisons might not make sense but i felt sure it would lead to something and to something interesting too i guess hes supposed to consider his crimes and feel miserable about his imprisonment so that when he gets out he wont do it again okay sure punishment go to your room for talking fresh next time you want to talk fresh you wont since you know whatll happen to you punishment yes but also punishment as rehabilitation take a criminal and turn him into a productive citizen so when you take a housebreaker and you send him to jail what do you think happens to him what does he learn well i guess in reality he doesnt really rehabilitate i mean its pretty common knowledge that if you send a housebreaker to prison he comes back an armed robber or a murderer or a rapist or something melford nodded okay so criminals go to prison and learn how to become better criminals does that sound about right yeah you think president reagan knows that probably what about our senators and representatives and governors they know i guess how could they not wardens prison guards policemen they probably know better than most okay are you ready for the big question everybody knows that prisons dont work to rehabilitate if in fact we know they do just the opposite which is to say they turn minor criminals into major ones why do we have them why do we send our social outcasts to criminal academies theres your question when you can answer it and you know the answer is right ill tell you why i had to do what i did what is this like a riddle no lemuel its not a riddle its a test i want to see what you can see and if you cant at least try to peer past the gauze theres no point in knowing whats on the other side because no matter what i say you wont be able to hear it melford made a left onto highland street where bastard and karen had made their home up until the time of their murder we cruised about halfway down the block and i wondered if he was planning on stopping right in front of the trailer probably not i decided just casing the neighborhood first that turned out to be a smart move since when we drove past we saw that there was a cop car in the driveway we almost missed it because the lights were off no headlights no blue and red flashes of strobing disaster in the darkness with no car lights and no porch lights a policeman in a brown uniform and a wide hat stood talking to a woman one hand on her shoulder and she was crying chapter come on melford said once we made it safely past the cop who didnt hop in his car and come chasing after us he didnt even notice us what did you expect they had to find the bodies sooner or later you cant be surprised i was hoping we could get the checkbook i said my tone shrill and nearly hysterical right the checkbook well the check wasnt written out to you was it it was written out to a company educational advantage media thats who i work for holy cow youve got to love their shamelessness so how will they know you were the one providing the educational advantage i was the only one working that area plus my fingerprints are all over the trailer if they sample everyones theyll come up with a match for me fuck i added i pounded my knee with the palm of my hand doesnt prove anything so you went there you tried to sell them some books it didnt work out you have no motive if you just sit tight youll be fine melford placed a hand gently on my shoulder great now the gay assassin is going to make a pass at me that isnt my idea of a solution sitting tight and being acquitted the hand mercifully went back to the steering wheel it wont get past the grand jury wow thats comforting next youll cheer me up by promising me a sentence of nothing more than time served just a few minutes ago you were talking about how unfair it would be for me to even be arrested okay okay he held up a hand as if i were his nagging wife ill think of something melford parked the car and for the first time since we saw the police cruiser outside karen and bastards trailer i examined my surroundings we were outside a bar or something like a bar a rundownlooking shack of a building with peeling white paint and a couple of dozen vehicles mostly pickups parked out front the parking lot was an empty patch of land pounded down by the weight of tires and drunks it wasnt exactly like the music screeched to a halt when we walked in but it might as well have men looked up from their beer men looked up from the pool table the men at the bar craned their necks to look no women that i could see not a single one part of me wanted to believe that melford knew exactly what he was doing but the bar seemed to me a very bad idea the braggadocio of david allan coe blasted from the jukebox and did a fair job of drowning out the sound of blood thumping in my ears the sight of the cop had so terrified me that a cold pain had ripped across my body as though someone had stabbed me in the heart with an icicle the place was a longish room with a concrete floor and cinderblock walls with a miller time clock a flashing budweiser sign and a giant poster of buxom coors girls there were no chairs just picnic tables and benches and in the far corner stood a large oldfashioned jukebox the kind with the rounded top closer to the surprisingly ornate wooden bar were four wellkept pool tables all of them occupied as far as i was concerned it meant that there were at any given moment eight rednecks with weapons at the ready melford led the way to the bar where we took a seat while he waved over the bartender a burly ponytailed man who looked a hardlived fifty haggard with multiple burns on his hands that suggested hed been letting someone jab at him all night with a lit cigarette melford ordered two rolling rocks which the bartender set down with a skeptical thud i eyed the faded blue tattoos that crept up his forearm he eyed my turquoise knit tie which i wished i had remembered to take off behind us pool balls cracked with sharp menace four dollars the bartender said you boys want something to eat before the kitchen closes up got good burgers here but tommy the cook is about fifteen minutes away from being too drunk to man the grill got that on a timer melford asked just gotta watch the color of his face were about fifteen minutes away now from him passing out or sitting in the corner and crying we also take bets on which its going to be ill have to wait until i know tommy better fair enough but the smart money tonight is on tears so you boys want burgers despite everything that happened i realized i was hungry a hollowedout sort of hunger that left me feeling on the brink of organ failure ill have one i said medium rare you want fries or onion rings he asked onion rings just an order of onion rings melford asked picking at the label on his beer bottle you got it one burger with rings and one order of just rings no burger at all melford corrected him im not having anything and hell just have an order of onion rings better make it a double he looks hungry the bartender leaned forward how is it that you know what your friend wants more than he does how is it you know your cooks going to be crying and not sleeping the bartender tilted his head in a gesture of concession you got a point melford smiled onion rings he put a five on the bar keep the change the bartender gave him a half nod i have to eat onion rings i asked is that part of the secret code of ideology too sort of you want to hang out with me you have to give up eating meat i dont want to hang out with you i want you out of my life and i want this day out of my life isnt it enough of a punishment to hang out with you i have to give up burgers too i can understand how you feel melford said i dont take it personally its been a big day for you thanks for being so freaking understanding i looked away and took a breath to calm myself i had to remember that just because melford said karen and bastard had it coming didnt mean they had it might be best not to piss him off so i changed the subject no meat what are you some kind of a vegetarian yes lemuel in observing that i dont eat meat you have correctly deduced im a vegetarian and you know what if you knew how animals were tortured youd give up eating meat on your own but you dont know and you probably dont care so im forcing you to give up meat well backtrack later and youll learn why for now you can follow me and walk the ethical path im going to take ethics lessons from you funny how that works ive never met a vegetarian before i said no wonder youre so thin are you my mother is my mother wearing a latex mask or something holy crap lemuel just dont eat anything that involves killing or exploiting any animals and youll be okay and i dont want to hear about how im a fine one to talk if we only ate evil animals whod made bad ethical choices then that would be good enough for me id sooner eat those two in the trailer park than a hamburger youre not doing a good job of convincing me that youre not crazy lets talk about something more pleasant tell me about that charming lady of yours what was her name chanda chitra i said in part feeling like an idiot for talking about this while such a horrible crisis was in the hopper and in part wanting to thank melford for giving me the chance to talk about her she gonna be your girlfriend he asked not a hint of mockery in his voice i shrugged vaguely embarrassed ive got some more pressing things to worry about at the moment besides i hardly know her i only met her last week you only met me today and look how close we are i chose to ignore that i dont see how anything could happen ive got to work all year to save money for college and she goes to mount holyoke in a couple of months theres always the longdistance relationship he pointed out i guess it sounds like it would be hard to keep up with all the distractions and everything but i suppose its less frightening when shes going to a girls school womens college what he sipped at his beer its not a girls school its a womens college who if i may ask cares i was in no mood for stupid nitpicking i care and you do too words count lemuel they have power and resonance there will never be true equality without gendersensitive language it was at that moment that something hard smacked me in the back of the head it came on suddenly and it startled me more than it hurt i turned around and two men with pool cues stood there laughing they both wore faded jeans and tshirts one was tattered and black the other was pale yellow and said bobs oysters across the front underneath there was a picture of an oyster with the words shuck me coming out of its i dont know mouth oyster hole or whatever they call it against the tightening of my throat and the pounding of my heart i felt a raging anguish building inside the anguish of why me there were two of us sitting there i as far as i knew looked like just an ordinary kid i had a tie sure but so what melford on the other hand with his freaky postelectrocution bleached hair would surely be a better target instead they went for me they always went for me the silence lasted less than a couple of seconds they stared i looked away you guys are kind of far from the pool table arent you melford said hes going to kill them i thought numb now with powerlessness theres going to be more killing right here im going to have to watch more people die a whole room full of them bobs oysters grinned showing a mouth full of nicely browning teeth maybe so he said what you want to do about it me melford shrugged i dont really want to do anything about it what do you want to do about it what he asked what melford asked what did you say what did you say i dont know what in fuck youre up to to be honest im not up to anything i dont like no faggots coming in here said the one in the black tshirt i think our foreign policy in el salvador is misguided melford said the black tshirt guy knit his brow what the shit are you talking about i dont know i thought we were just saying you know stuff we think your comment seemed pretty random so i figured id come up with one of my own he lifted his beer and drank down half the bottle finishing it off with a mighty gulp he wiggled it at them documenting its emptiness you want another beer whats it to you nothing i was just going to order up some beer and since were having a conversation it seemed polite to order one for you you want it the guy paused as his desire for beer clashed with his pointless anger maybe if melford had seemed nervous or twitchy or afraid it might have gone differently but i was already beginning to understand the power of melfords calm okay sure said the black tshirt guy he blinked rapidly and bit his lip as though he had misunderstood something and now didnt want to admit it the two pool players exchanged glances bobs oysters shrugged melford signaled the bartender and ordered the beers the pool players took theirs the black tshirt nodded his thanks at melford and he and his friend wandered back over to the table they were dazed not looking at each other what the hell i whispered into a basket of steaming onion rings which had arrived during the confrontation i thought we were going to get our asses kicked i didnt see that guy figured one of two responses id fight him or id turn coward all i did was take a different angle and suddenly the threat of violence is gone nothing to it he made it sound so simple yeah what happens if he decided to knock you off your stool and go upside your head with the pool cue melford patted his pocket then id have killed him i let that hang in the air for a moment unsure if the answer pleased or terrified me why didnt you just kill them anyway im willing to defend myself and im willing to fight for whats right but im not indiscriminate all i wanted was to get out of the situation without you getting hurt and i took care of it in the way i thought would cause the least harm i stared at him feeling not only relief and gratitude but a strange sort of admiration it was then that i first realized that in the same way i liked it when bobby praised me for books well sold i liked melfords attention too i liked that melford seemed to like me wanted to spend time with me melford was somebody a crazy violent and inexplicable somebody but a somebody all the same and as id just seen an occasionally heroic somebody what are we going to do about the checkbook i asked were going to wait for what well you know where that mobile home is located what the jurisdiction is i shook my head the city of meadowbrook grove a remarkably unpleasant little slice of land carved out of the county that consists of a very large trailer park and a small farm with a hog lot the cop you saw outside the trailer is the chief of police also the mayor a monumental creep named jim doe and he doesnt much like the county cops chances are hes going to hold off on calling the real cops until the morning otherwise hell have to be up all night so were going to wait were going to wait until it gets good and late and then were going into the trailer sliding under some yellow crime scene tape and getting the checkbook he looked over at my basket can i have an onion ring i didnt know when if ever bars around here closed but this one showed no sign of slowing down at a quarter of three when melford tapped me on the arm and said it was time to go i followed dutifully in the car melford was playing another tape now a sad and jangling something that i liked mostly despite myself maybe it was the four beers what is this the smiths melford said the albums called meat is murder i laughed somethings funny it just seems a little strong i said i mean if you want to be a vegetarian thats fine but meat isnt murder its meat melford shook his head why why is it okay to expose creatures who have feelings and wants and desires to any pain we choose so we can have unnecessary food we can get all the nutrients we need from vegetables and fruits and beans and nuts this society has made the tacit decision that animals arent really living things just products in a factory due no more consideration than automobile parts so the smiths are right lemuel meat is murder i probably wouldnt have said it without the beer but id had the beer okay fine meat is murder but you know what else is murder wait let me think oh yeah i remember now murder murder is murder thats right killing a couple of people who are minding their own business breaking into their home and shooting them in the head thats murder too i think the smiths have an album about that melford shook his head as if i were a kid who couldnt grasp some simple idea i told you they were assassinated but im not ready to know why thats right and im a bad person for eating meat no youre a normal person for eating meat because the unchecked torment and painful slaughter of animals has become the norm in our culture you cant be judged for eating meat up to this point anyhow on the other hand if you listen to what i tell you if you think about it even a little and then you go back to eating meat then yes youre a bad person torment my eye i said its not like they drag the cows off to dark cells and wake them up for mock executions the animals stand around they moo they eat grass and when the time comes they get killed their lives are a little shorter than they would be otherwise but they dont have to worry about starvation or predators and disease maybe its a decent tradeoff sure that sounds great farmer brown comes out once in a while to pat their rumps or maybe pick a little on his banjo while he chews on a stalk of hay wake up friend that idyllic farm doesnt exist anymore if it ever did small farms are being absorbed by giant corporations theyre building what are called factory farms in which the maximum possible number of animals are warehoused in dark buildings pumped full of drugs to make it possible for them to survive in these unnatural conditions theyre given growth hormones so theyll get big and meaty even though they dont want to eat theyre given antibiotics so they wont get sick even though theyre spending their whole lives on top of each other and then you my friend nibble on your big juicy porterhouse and you know what youre eating antibiotics and bovine growth hormone eat enough beef and who knows whats going to happen to you if a woman eats beef and pork and chicken when shes pregnant what is she passing along to her baby besides being unspeakably cruel this is a public health disaster waiting to happen yeah if the public is so threatened then how come the public doesnt care the public he let out a dismissive sigh remember ideology the public is told meat is safe and good and healthful and so the public complies so what do you live on eggs and cheese i asked he laughed no way im a vegan man i dont eat any animal products none oh come on you cant stand to exploit the labor of a chicken if you could prove to me the chickens didnt suffer id eat their eggs he told me but you have no idea those chickens are packed into cages so tight they cant even turn around their beaks and feet get infected and theyre in agony maybe even more than cows and pigs chickens suffer unspeakable torments probably because theyre birds and we care even less what happens to them we are talking about animals that never experience a single moment of life without pain fear or discomfort and those are the females the males born to egglaying populations are just tossed into sacks until theyre ground up alive and fed to the females you want me to tell you about how dairy cows live not especially i want you to tell me how you live what is there to eat at home my kitchen is very well stocked and i eat fine but the truth is if youre going to be vegan and you will be you cant eat out a whole lot unless youre willing to be creative but you can look at yourself in the mirror and know youve been doing the right thing plus you get the added bonus of feeling more righteous than others and it makes a great conversation at parties he gave me a knowing nod women love vegetarians lemuel theyll think youre deep you get to college start fussing about what you can and cant eat believe me the women will start conversations about it and theyll swoon over your sensitive soul we took another pass by the trailer and saw it was now abandoned no sign of cops or crime scene so melford turned down the stereo and parked at a strip mall lot with a closed convenience store a dry cleaner and something that called itself a jewelry store but looked through the lattice of metal grating more like a pawnshop taped to a phone booth next to the car was another missing pet flyer this one for a brown scottish terrier called nestle it was only three blocks cut mostly through the backs of other mobile homes to bastard and karens house the temperature had dropped to the mideighties but the air was still thick with humidity and the trailer park smelled like a backedup toilet none of this seemed to bother melford who knew where to find breaks in fences where to cross over to avoid barking dogs all of which told me that he had spent a fair amount of time casing this route so maybe killing bastard and karen hadnt been just some random act of violence we reached the back of the trailer which in fact had no yellow crime scene tape and melford pulled out something that looked like a cheap ray gun from a dr who episode some kind of a handle with multiple wires of a variety of thicknesses protruding pick gun he explained very handy thing to keep around eyes narrowed in concentration he went at the back door of the trailer for just a moment before we heard a click melford pushed the door open while he slid the pick gun back into his pocket now he took out a pen flashlight which he flipped around the kitchen for a moment huh he said thats funny check it out i hadnt wanted to look at them again in fact id taken comfort in the blackness of the room which allowed me to shield myself from the sight of the no doubt stiff bodies but i glanced over anyhow knowing that it was what melford expected of me i stared thinking that melfords deployment of the word funny didnt quite cut it bastard and karen still lay there eyes open stiff as bloody and bloodless mannequins by their side was a third body chapter maybe it wasnt fair but i blamed my stepfather for everything bad that happened that weekend and sure it was at least partly andys fault but the odd thing was it all played out the way it did because of the only two good ideas andy had ever had the two ideas that changed my life for the better hed had countless bad ideas that i should get new clothes no more than every two years that i should wait until i turned sixteen before getting a learners permit that i should clean out the barbecue each time he used it so the best pieces of charcoal could be salvaged for reuse this one filled me with the most resentment because when i came in from the garage covered with sweat and soot nostrils caked with black powder coughing up gray phlegm i found it impossible to deny the dickensian bleakness of my life the first good idea came the summer after my freshman year in high school andy roman had married my mother six years earlier and i had been gaining weight steadily ever since my mother said nothing while her son went from skinny to husky to fat said nothing while i carted away bags of oreos and boxes of doughnuts to my room to eat during solitary marathon sessions of happy days and good times reruns the apathy i later learned originated from the heroic quantities of valium she took i thought she was simply inclined to sleepiness and partial to naps i accepted that some people napped between breakfast and lunch and then after lunch until it was time to start making dinner if andy knew about her little pill fixation and he must have he didnt show much concern despite her fogginess in which my mother sometimes wandered from room to room clutching a plastic soup ladle or pot holder while searching for something she couldnt quite recall she managed to clean the house and make his meals and that was all andy required on occasion hed try to interest her in his obsession with my increasing weight but my mother just shrugged and muttered observations about growing boys he wasnt having it and one day he announced that he would take care of it if she wouldnt taking care of it marked the beginning of a disciplined regimen of derision to help slim me down but six months of calling me big booty and helpful suggestions that i get off my fat butt and go outside and play in the fresh air and sunshine failed to achieve significant results so in a rare moment of intellectual retrenching he took on a new approach time for a serious talk he said to me over breakfast one morning my mother staring at us through the slits of her eyes had already announced that she was going to lie down so it was just me and andy he was then in his midfifties fifteen years older than my mother and looking like a man taking a nosedive into senior citizenship he was jowly and liver spotted and had heavy bags under his cloudy green eyes despite his harsh assessment of me he was himself a good thirty pounds overweight most of his head still had decent coverage but what he had was gray and thinning and too long for a man of his age he played golf with the ceaseless intensity of a florida lawyer which he was and constant exposure to the sun gave his skin the look of an overbaked apple however he came from a generation that believed you could never be too tan and pachyderm skin was far preferable to the shame of pallor andy pushed up his blackrimmed bifocals over his nose which had become noticeably bulbous in the last two years i know you want to go away to college when you graduate high school he said but lets face it everyone wants to go away and whats so great about you that anyplace decent should let you in am i right less than a year earlier i had realized in a kind of aesthetic epiphany that i hated florida i hated the heat i hated the white shoes and white belts i hated the golf and the tennis and the beaches and the rundown art deco buildings that smelled of old people and the palm trees and the rednecks and the loud transplanted northerners and the clueless canadians who visited during the winter and the unremarkable sadness of the poor mostly black people who fished for their dinner in the stagnant canals i hated the crabgrass and the sandy vacant lots and poisonous snakes and deadly walking catfish and dogeating alligators the unavoidable sharpspored plants and gargantuan palmetto bugs and fistsize spiders and swarming fire ants and the rest of the tropical mutants that daily reminded us that human beings had no business living here all of which i knew on some fundamental but unarticulated level meant that i hated my life and i wanted a new one id been talking ever since about going away to college going far away as though the intervening three years were only a mild obstacle you need to think about how youre going to convince them youre not just another loser andy said he had both his elbows on the white oval breakfast table and he was practically leaning into his microwaved pancakeandsausage breakfast i know you dont want to hear it he said now but what you ought to do is join the track team next year your grades have been all right i had a average which i personally thought was beyond all rightand being on the school paper is fine i guess but athletics really round out your application and you want them to think youre wellrounded but not in the way you are now he inflated his cheeks you want them to look at your stuff and think theres a real gogetter not theres a big lardo they probably already have enough of those i understood at once why andy suggested track and in a vague way i was grateful for it team sports were not going to get me very far not after the fifth grades disastrous experiment with softball track on the other hand offered certain advantages it was essentially a solitary sport played in proximity to others no one was relying on me not to fuck up at least not in the same way they would if a popup to right field came my way and sure andy said its not like youve ever been good at running or anything but with a summers worth of hard work you could at least be good enough to be the worst guy on the team our house on terrapin way encircled a manmade pond in which nameless fish brightly colored frogs lumpybilled ducks and the occasional itinerant gator made a home and andy announced that he had tracked the circumference of the surrounding road at exactly onehalf mile so heres the deal he said tapping one manicured nail against his fork were going to practice between now and when school starts ill give you a dollar for every mile you can run and ten dollars for every five consecutive miles you can run it had seemed like a nice offer hell if im going to be honest it was a truly generous offer a rare moment of inspired stepparenting though i understood it was also about andy wanting to show just how right he was nevertheless it was a good deal even though i had never done well with running in gym class when the instructor sent us to do laps i was always the first to surrender into a walk to hold my cramping side while the other kids whisked passed me glancing back with contempt the money might provide motivation for me to improve my prowess but there was something humiliating in being offered money to do what other kids could do freely and easily so i declined i didnt want to go out there and sweat while andy watched me struggle to put a half mile under my belt i didnt want to go huffing past the house while andy shouted an inevitable keep it going big booty the thing was i wanted to lose weight i wanted to diet but id been unable to do so because committing to a weight loss program would be like telling andy that hed been right that it was okay that hed been calling me fatty and lard butt and butterball all those months i knew this track business was a way out andy had brought it up only once which meant going along with it was still more or less uncharged i could diet while training but pass off the diet as a new way of eating to get in shape and i could never accept a dime of his money for any of this i needed to keep andy out of my slimming there was no way i was going to go running around terrapin way far too many kids from school lived in hibiscus gardens our subdivision and a few even lived in houses around the pond and i didnt want them watching not until i could run with ease not until i could do five miles i needed the shield of success since they also enjoyed calling me fatty and butterball though they went with lard ass instead of lard butt not being restrained by a stepparents sense of decorum instead of hitting the road right away i went to my room put on my sneakers turned on the radio and jogged in place at first i couldnt do more than ten minutes then fifteen within a week i could do half an hour and after a week of that i figured i was ready for actual laps i imagined my triumphant return to school looking slim and fit snappy in the new clothes andy would have to pay for since the old ones would be too big were getting too big already the bullies would now have to find someone else to pick on i never really believed it nor should i have that sort of transformation is the staple of hollywood teen movies but never allowed in real life in the movies the ugly girl gets new clothes and a new haircut removes her glasses andgasp shes the most popular girl in school in real life when we bottomfeeders try to rise above our station they pull us down cut off our limbs and stick us in a box even though i returned that september as fit as any healthy tenth grader they still called me lard ass and continued to do so until i graduated but the fantasy was motivation enough i started running laps while andy was at work and my mother was off doing errands i didnt want them to know not until i could run five miles without stopping doing so turned out to be a lot easier than i would have thought and six weeks after my first solitary jog i told andy i was ready to try out for track next year fine he said with an embarrassed shrug it was clear that he regretted having offered me the money and now wanted to make it as difficult as possible for me to raise the subject as it turned out i did fairly well at track i made the team and acquitted myself reasonably well at matches i didnt excel at speed but i was good at endurance and in some of the longer races i could outlast some of my opponents well enough to score a third and occasionally a second place it would be good enough to help me get into college and i wasnt even the slowest guy on the team the second good idea came a little more than half a year later during the winter break of my sophomore year i had been lying on my bed reading when the knock came at the door it was a good two hours after dinner and i could hear the tv going from the family room where my mother would have nodded off on the couch the still life with apples needlepoint pattern shed been working on for the past nine months in her lap andy didnt wait for an answer he opened the door and stuck his head inside whats going on in here anything naughty i sat up and folded the book open to my spot andy said nothing for a moment just leaned against the doorjamb grinning fiercely his thickframed rectangular glasses had slid down his ballooning nose i think andy announced you should set your sights on an ivy league school harvard or yale preferably but princeton or columbia will do in a pinch i guess even brown or dartmouth if you had to andy had gone to the university of florida himself and to a local university of no national reputation for his law degree but he seemed to feel he knew a lot about the intricacies of the ivys of course he added we know we cant rely on your father to help with the money my father was living somewhere in jamaica now where he worked as a tourist scubadiving guide and if overheard conversations could be trusted smoked prodigious quantities of marijuana i imagined him sitting on a beach in a circle of glassyeyed rastafarians puffing lazily on a cigarthick joint some of my friends had discovered reggae but i couldnt stand the political yearnings of bob marley the ganjafueled rage of peter tosh the selfaggrandizing toasts of yellowman not when my father was off living the life of a white rasta besides he had entirely given up on paying child support and i hadnt heard from him in two years when hed placed a drunken call on a warm april afternoon to wish me a happy fifteenth birthday i was thirteen at the time and had been so since january so maybe it doesnt make sense to go to a place like that i proposed i was confused and presenting a counterargument seemed like the best way to draw out andys game i mean if its so expensive going to an ivy league school had never occurred to me id always believed them reserved for the moviestar handsome and privileged charming boys and girls with trust funds and easy grins and ruddy complexions from effortless afternoons on the ski slopes if you keep your grades up and you do well on your sats andy prophesied you should be able to get a decent financial aid package plus this business i set up for you with the track team should help theyll cut you a deal and youll take out some loans and if all of that doesnt cover everything he announced magnanimously well work something out the seed was planted id always thought of myself as smart had always thought of myself as capable of doing smartperson things but going to harvard or yale that was far out of reach like becoming an astronaut or ambassador to france still andy had suggested it and now i wanted it i wanted the opportunities an ivy league degree would provide i could become an important historian or direct movies and go into politics once it was on the table i knew it was the way out the way to a genuinely nonfloridian future the next summer while visiting my grandparents in new jersey i had made arrangements to take a look at columbia harvard princeton and yale over the course of three separate weekends when i went to columbia s upper west side campus it was my first trip to new york city despite the annual visit to my grandparents who lived a lighttraffic fortyfiveminute drive away in bergen county i had been instantly seduced by the city and by the campus and i left with no doubt that columbia was where i wanted to go in fact the moment the car crossed the george washington bridge i knew that new york was the place that i must have always known about in the hidden recesses of my mind maybe i had already absorbed new york from television and movies i must have seen the city depicted on the screen countless times but it never signified much of anything but some kind of foreign and urban landscape in reality on the ground with the noise and people and the gumstained sidewalks littered with trash and teeming with the homeless it seemed to me something else entirely i had discovered the antiflorida columbia s all right andy had assured me and if thats the only place you can get in fine but it shouldnt be your first choice harvard should be your first choice he folded his arms authoritatively though the closest hed ever been to harvard was logan airport to change planes as it turned out it didnt much matter since yale harvard and princeton all said no columbia said yes as had improbably berkeley and my safety the university of florida when i received the admission on a rainy saturday afternoon i ran to tell andy who was resting on his recliner in the family room watching golf on television columbia he observed at least thats something after getting the thumbsdown from harvard and yale i just cant believe it i said i paced around too excited to hold still even for an instant man living in new york its going to be so cool andys face went long a sure sign things were about to turn sour he shook his head as he geared himself up to piss on my cornflakes you might want to think twice about this university of florida is a good school if you go to new york youll probably get mugged theres millions of people they cant all get mugged some people will but you wont is that it what you think youre exempt i dont think its worth worrying about well i got a pretty good education at u of f andy said whats good enough for me isnt good enough for you i dont want to go to florida i want to go to columbia youre the one who told me i should go to an ivy andy shrugged and looked over my shoulder to watch someone miss a threefoot putt and it was a fine idea and you did try im just saying that you may not want to go to columbia harvard or yale sure but they already said no maybe they saw something in your application and they realized youre not ivy material isnt it kind of beneath your dignity to let columbia have you as sloppy seconds that is so far beyond stupid that i dont even know the word for it if you had a better vocabulary maybe harvard would have let you in i think a state school education is much better you dont want to become an ivy league snob do you there was no way i was going to let him talk me out of it the thing about columbia was that no one would know me there unlike the university of florida columbia would not have anyone from my high school or my neighborhood most people when i told them where i was applying thought i meant south carolina when i got there i would no longer be the loser who had once been fat i would be whoever i said i was it was not only an escape from florida it was a clean break maybe the cleanest break i would ever get could ever hope for and i knew i wasnt going to squander it the day of graduation while id been drinking orange soda with relatives at my house before going out with friends one of whose cousins was having a party andy took me aside you know he said ive been looking over the application material for columbia maybe this isnt the best time but i dont see how you can afford it even with the financial aid and the loans youre going to need another seven thousand dollars a year thats almost thirty thousand dollars where are you going to get that i looked at the floor you said youd help me out and i have havent i i didnt ask how since it would invariably turn into a food on the table clothes on my back kind of thing and i wasnt interested come on now lem im not your father your father is off smoking wacky weed and chasing topless natives uga buga he added bulging his eyes maybe he should pay for it have you even asked him i dont know how to get in touch with him so you want me to pay for you when you havent even asked your father you said you would help was the best i could manage it was my graduation and andy dropped this bomb as if hed been saving it for the maximum effect come on now university of florida is fine im not going there i said trying to keep the whine out of my voice im going to columbia andy smiled and shook his head then i guess you have a lot of money to make this summer dont you the next day i called the admissions office at columbia and arranged for a deferment and then i began doing research how was i going to save in a year it didnt take me long to realize sales was my best bet and encyclopedias looked like just the thing to make it happen chapter thats really odd melford said just not the sort of thing you expect death and darkness hid her features but i could tell the third person was an older woman with a short fiercely coiled perm she wore tight jeans and an open blouse which seemed to me the same color as the darkness her heavy tongue protruded from her gaping mouth like a cartoon creature caught in midstrangle from the marks on her neck i guessed that strangling was the way it happened who is she i managed beats me but im thinking that this is the woman we saw when we drove by before well what happened i hated how it came out like a whine but i thought myself entitled it was bad enough to have witnessed two murders that day to have been close enough to smell the blood as it came out of bastards and karens respective heads now here was another i wasnt built for this sort of thing and the truth was that i had to work very hard if i was going to keep from falling apart i didnt even know what falling apart would constitute but i was pretty sure id know it when i saw it melford shook his head im guessing the cop killed her what who else we saw him with her now shes dead just a few feet away from where it happened why would the cop leave her alone at the crime scene where the murderer might get her and since we know the murderer didnt get her we have to assume the cop did but it doesnt make any sense melford was about to say something but he stopped himself when we both heard the sound of wheels on dirt outside and the hum of a motor and then the cutting of a motor he shut off the penlight and moved over to the window boogers he whispered he then turned to me okay listen up the bad news is that theres two guys out there and one of them is the cop out of uniform but the cop now dont panic theyre in a pickup and they came with their headlights off so i doubt this is official police business we hide and everything will be fine my four beers churned violently grappling back up to my throat with little acid hooks i let melford pull me by the arm into the smaller bedroom and then to a closet against the far wall the kind with the folding slatted doors and it faced out to the kitchen so we had a decent view of the action but that wasnt what i noticed about this bedroom what i noticed was that there was nothing in here but boxes some had old shirts and torn jeans sticking out some were file boxes but most of them were sealed shut one of them had oldham health written along the side with a thick black marker the walls were bare except for a twoyearold puppies and kittens calendar stuck on october this wasnt a kids room this wasnt even a room that had once been a kids room and now was something else no kids lived here so why had karen and bastard lied to me the back door banged open and i could see obstructed by the slats two figures enter one of them swinging a small flashlight around it was too dark to see much more than that for a moment i felt a fresh wave of panic what if they had come to look for something something that might just as well be in a closet as anywhere else the thought made me have to piss fiercely and i clenched my teeth as i tried to force back the urge to void my bladder at least there was melford melford still had his gun melford wouldnt let us get taken that was the measure of how much my life had changed in the past twentyfour hours i was now depending on someone to shoot my enemies for me fucking hell one of the guys said youve got a lot of dead people in here jim i know it jesus look at them it was some cold mother that took them down looks like and youve got no ideas i aint got the first fuck of an idea i mean its gotta be about the money but who shit dont no one know nothing about it but us those of us in on it bastards been talking which is the only thing i can figure i guess but hell thats about right shit fucking bastard with frank taking off last month youre fresh out of chemists bb isnt going to like that yeah im working on it but i aint gonna put an ad in the paper jim what the fuck was bastard doing over here anyhow i dont know there was something hard in the voice you figure he was boffing that skank shit maybe a couple of years ago but she was like a fucking corpse man all that crank she was doing id sooner fuck some old grandma a pause then just shut the fuck up and help me with this shit uhoh a laugh you werent dipping your wick with that were you ill tell you what i got a couple of grandmas i could introduce you to you want to stand around talking shit all night or you want to get this done i had been watching through the slat totally absorbed as though i were not in a mobile home closet but in a theater watching the most compelling movie id ever seen i felt strangely calm outside of myself and then i didnt feel calm at all i didnt feel like i was in a theater i felt hot and cramped and about as terrified as id ever felt in my life it was because i realized i knew both men the cop jim was the guy id seen at the convenience store the one whod given me a hard time about the ginger ale the same bucktoothed man from the ford whod been hassling me outside the trailer with the possibility of being arrested for murder id managed to anger the crooked chief of police the other guy i couldnt see him well enough to take a look but i knew the voice i was sure i knew the voice from somewhere i knew that other man i watched as they laid out a sheet of plastic on the floor and then picked up the body of the older woman and rolled her up the cop grabbed one end the familiar man the other and they hauled her out of the house we listened to the near silence punctuated only by the occasional grunt or curse and then the thud of something heavy landing on a flatbed they were back in a few minutes shit the cop said the other two are gonna be messy wish i brung some gloves or something fuck me said the familiarsounding man someone sure plugged those assholes look at the shots neat and clean looks like they were executed who died and made you a law enforcement official the cop asked you been watching too much tv you sure you didnt hurt your leg the other one asked looks like youre having trouble walking i told you im fine the voice terse grim i heard you suck in your breath a second ago too like you were in pain forget it jesus they laid out another sheet of plastic and then lifted karens body the cop complained about getting whore brain on his hands and he wiped it off on his knee while they rolled up the body and hauled it out they were panting hard when they returned fucking bastard the cop said he kicked the body not too hard then he kicked him again it sounded like someone kicking a sandbag i dont know what the fuck he did or who shot his sorry ass but i figure he deserved it yeah well the other one responded then a pause you think whoever did this got the money you know i never even thought of that you dumb shit he let out a derisive snort you think i give a shit about them being dead its the money ive already looked through here and been over to his place tore it up but i couldnt find jack not even any sign of what he was up to you still think he had something going on the side he asked he then turned away from me and i couldnt quite hear what he said next but i was sure it contained the word oldham had to have been something the cop said i know how much he made and he had way too much cash getting his wallet all fat i just cant figure he made that much money doing that bullshit but i figure he meant to rip me off disappear with the money and since i looked everywhere else i have to figure he was hiding it in the waste lagoon you cant be serious the other man said youve got to be dryhumping me how in hell are we going to find it there i dont know there must be a way to drain it or drag it or something jesus i sure wish we didnt have to haul this dead asshole he dont even deserve to be dumped by me lets just do it the other man said no room for blanking out here and it must have been the term blanking out because i suddenly recognized the second man it was the gambler the gambler who ran the doortodoor champion encyclopedia operation for the state of florida the encyclopedia guru himself was in the trailer removing the bodies of people melford had killed at least melford had killed most of them melford shoved me i must have been making noise because he flashed a look visible even in the near total darkness i got hold of my breathing they grabbed bastard and hauled him out and when they returned they were gasping for air there was the glugglug of someone drinking from a bottle now they had a bucket and mops and paper towels and a bottle of formula they still didnt turn on the lights but they set up a couple of flashlights and got to work erasing all evidence of melfords crime it took more than half an hour before they were done hard to tell with just the flashlight the cop said but i think thatll do her ill come back in the morning and do a quick runthrough in the light if that fucker was screwing us over and the moneys gone were going to be in some deep shit bbll be in a fucking rage fuck that asshole and fuck bastard fuck me this last he cried out as if in sudden pain you know if your leg is bothering you its best to see a doctor why put it off shut the fuck up about the doctor im fine i just think its best to be safe hey take a look at this the gambler said karens checkbook melford gave me a gentle tap on the back i must have been making noise again you figure she had anything in her account the cop asked says here the balance is almost three thousand how did an uglyass skinnyskank rottencuntsmelling whore like that get three thousand dollars i guess it wont hurt to write out a check though make up for some losses maybe i can get that numbnuts pakken to do it he wont know any better which will help him get away with it and it shouldnt be a problem anyhow if he goes across the county line i figure and they left we remained in the closet for a good fifteen minutes theyd done a decent enough job of cleaning up at least melfords penlight didnt pick up any sign of the blood i figured the fbi could probably scare some up they had crime labs for stuff like that but you had to be looking for blood and if there were no bodies why would you look all right melford said lets get the hell on out of here it wasnt until we were back in his datsun that we dared to talk about it im fucked i said and i felt fucked i felt like i was about to fall into the chasm i felt like i was falling through the sky just waiting for the impact of when i hit earth i dont think so yeah why not i heard my voice getting shrill why arent i fucked tell me why im not fucked because the guys who have the evidence against you are highpowered felons thats why highpowered felons dont seek out the law lemuel they avoid it theyre not going to investigate they wont even look to see who the checks are made out to except that the gambler would notice the check to educational advantage media he would see it in a heartbeat and he would know who was there but would the gambler think it anything but a coincidence he barely knew me by sight but he wouldnt imagine that id had anything to do with this still it scared the hell out of me and i dared not say anything about the gambler to melford melford might think i was too weak a link affiliated as i was to one of these highpowered felons he might quite possibly might kill me just to be safe and there was something else something that made no sense they werent married i said aloud what the people you killed bastard and karen they werent married and they didnt have kids yeah well i could have told you that melford said so why did they lie to me i dont know something crazy is going on something bigger than i realized why would the cop be hiding the bodies you killed and what were they talking about bastards business on the side what is that and the missing money dunno melford said what about oldham health i asked they had some mugs and stuff bastard told me he didnt know anything about it but i kind of got the sense he was lying melford shook head i dont know anything about it i looked over at him melford was lying too i couldnt say how exactly i knew but i knew wed been talking about some heavy stuff all night but there was something in melfords voice that i hadnt heard some kind of tension whatever bastard had been involved with melford knew exactly what it was the other guy who was with the cop melford said i wonder who that was i didnt say anything my heart pounded and my head throbbed i felt the urge to confess as if it were all somehow my fault but i kept it quiet probably just some goon melford saved me by answering his own question ill tell you what though we have to find out who that woman was the third body why do we care i asked because if things dont go our way and they decide they want to risk bringing the law into all of this and the cop finds us and wants to arrest us were going to want some leverage if we can expose them then maybe we can reach some sort of understanding you want to figure out who that woman was so were in a position to blackmail the criminally insane cop pretty neat huh chapter earlier that night jim doe had been in the police trailer waiting for nothing in particular but something bad all the same hows the gonads feeling pakken sat across from doe his feet were up on the desk and he was drinking from a mammoth styrofoam cup of gas station coffee hed been working at it for two or three hours now and it had to be cold as shit the question was apropos of nothing since theyd both been largely still for hours pakken was working at one of the word finder books he liked his pen hovering over the oniony pages doe was flipping through a sports illustrated not much paying attention to an article on the dolphins he was still out of uniform in his jeans and black tshirt sometimes he felt like relaxing in the police trailer was all doe could tell that pakken had just found a hard word he liked to start a conversation after he found one hed talk about anything really but sooner or later hed try to bring it around i just found substantial hed say with littlekid pride these interruptions were annoying as hell under the best of circumstances but even more so now that pakkens favorite topic was does testicles it had been pakken whod found doe after his unfortunate runin with that miami bitch pakken whod gone looking when doe had not shown up the next day it was pakken whod taken a guess at what might have happened knowing about where the chief liked to take the ladies and not a bad bit of police work for such a moron doe had still been passed out when pakken had found him in the early morning hed peered into the cars window a grin stamped onto his flat wide face capped off by a single massive eyebrow and a caveman cranial ridge doe had fluttered his eyelids and said my balls she crushed my balls what happened chief his balls were swollen and angry it hurt even to move his legs bitch attacked me he mumbled pakken let out a laugh yeah thats good she attacked you doe struggled to his feet and pain shot through his balls but he bit his lip and climbed out of the car then he smacked pakken in the face hard the fuck you laughing at pakken gingerly poked an index finger to his cheek whyd you do that a woman was speeding you dipshit doe said risking her life the lives of others and now shes assaulted a police officer you think thats funny pakken was still poking at the reddening spot on his face hell there i was thinking you was just trying to get a blow job off of her now almost a week later they sat in the trailer pakken with his cold coffee while doe leaned back in his chair and sipped at his bottle of yoohoo and rebel yell it was kind of a ritual the two of them lazing around talking or not talking but doe didnt want to look at pakkens drooping idiot face his balls were still swollen still tender a little bit better he was nearly certain they were better today than yesterday he reached into his pants with a tentative hand and the pressure against his scrotum hurt hurt like living shit but maybe a little less than the last time hed checked and pakken had laughed at him it was a disrespectful thing to laugh at an officer injured in the line of duty what kind of a sick asshole laughed he guessed that pakken wasnt really sick just young his uncle floyd pakken had been the mastermind behind meadowbrook grove hed come up with the name even though they didnt have a meadow brook or grove but it sounded a lot better than pigshitsmelling trailer park it had been floyds idea to convert the trailer park into an independent municipality to lower the speed limit and to watch the cash flow in and it did all the residents got free gas and electric which was no small thing during the summer months of hardhumping airconditioning they got free water free basic phone service three or four big barbecues a year a carnival in the spring a halloween shindig for the kids a fourth of july party with an upandcoming country star or two they were happier than pigs in shit which ironically they had to put up with to get all this or more accurately they had to put up with the smell of pigs in shit since the city also incorporated the hog lot on does adjoining family land every year the office of the mayor which consisted basically of the mayor issued a report that detailed income from traffic violations and expenditures in taxes services and salaries and everything just balanced out nice and neat maybe a few dollars to roll over to the next year why not no one ever much looked at the report and no one near as doe could tell bothered to find out if it was bullshit or not but of course it was bullshit floyd had been a sharp fellow to devise this scam and to put himself at the helm doe had always figured that floyd had something going on other than his mighty generous salary which everyone knew about since hed done such a good job of giving back to the city doe had suspected and hed been the obvious choice for mayor and police chief after floyd had got himself killed along with a couple of fourteenyearold cuban whores in an explosive rollover two weeks into the job looking at the records and following the money trail doe couldnt stop his perpetual eulogy to floyds genius by two months into the job hed been laughing at floyd for thinking too small floyd put twenty or thirty thou a year aside good for him bless his little heart three years later doe was tripling that easy and it would be getting even better play it right be patient dont be stupid doe could be pulling in a hundred thou a year when he had a million put away hed say it was time to retire hed head to the cayman islands where his current sat nicely nestled buy himself a big house and spend the rest of his days drinking strawberry daiquiris and fucking tourists a man could do worse for himself everything had been going perfectly the scam with the tickets the deal with bb all of it until now he couldnt stand waiting around to see if the reporter from miami turned up the fact was and doe knew this from experience most women wouldnt say shit about what happened to them they had this kind of programming like a robot or something that the worse you treated them the less they would do about it you could overdo that like hed done with his exwife but mostly theyd take it because they knew what would happen if they didnt how many of them really wanted to bring this thing to the courts they knew what would happen tell the truth now you found his honor mayor doe rather handsome didnt you yes at first but and you were at least on some level flattered that he wanted to have sex with you werent you yes it was flattering but and at any time during your interactions did you enjoy the sensation of having his unusually massive penis in your mouth remember you are under oath i never asked for it did you enjoy it answer the question yes yes im so ashamed but i loved it where was the woman who wanted to put herself through that but doe had a bad feeling about this reporter shed gotten away before shed had a chance to really get into it that shed pounded does nuts might tend to make some folks believe that she really hadnt wanted to suck him off plus she was a miami reporter and nothing would make her happier than a story on these country bumpkins up here with their speed trap trailer park the morning after the incident after hed gone home and showered angling his body to keep the water from hitting his nads keeping his head up so he wouldnt have to look at the purple swollen horror hed managed to get dressed although the underwear and pants were a bit of trouble and had gone back to the police trailer and called up the florida highway patrol this is jim doe im chief of police and mayor over here at meadowbrook grove is that so said the voice on the other end of the phone then there was a snicker halfhidden they all knew about meadowbrook grove yeah look here this is kind of embarrassing but i was ticketing this woman last night ill alert the media the smartass said i was ticketing this woman last night doe continued and i guess i let my guard down she was young and seemed harmless and well she kind of caught me by surprise she knocked me down with her car door and took off before i could get back up but i still got her license and registration is that so yeah its so i dont know why she would take off that way but she must be hiding something i figure you worked that out huh and she knocked me down she assaulted a police officer she assaulted you and a police officer now look here i dont have no beef with you and im sure if it were a highway patrolman she knocked down youd have the helicopter dragnet out right now a highway patrolman wouldnt have got knocked down he said im just trying to report a dangerous person she knocked me down maybe she takes a gun at one of you boys i dont know you telling me i shouldnt have called this in he let out a long sigh fine give me the info doe read off the information to them and hung up he says she tried to get away she says he tried to attack her if necessary hell concede that it is possible that she might have for whatever reason believed he was going to attack her and hed be okay with her getting off with a warning this time but now hed made it so it was her word against his that had to be worth something since days later he hadnt heard a thing half an hour after the last inquiry hows the family jewels pakken asked whynt you go and get some speeders doe said im off duty thats why you aint got no initiative maybe so but i got initiate he said turning his book so that doe could see the word ovaled in red ink get some tickets or go home pakken must have figured out this meant that doe wanted to be alone so the kid grumbled a bit and took his time collecting his worthless shit but finally he made it out the door ten minutes later doe rose to his feet and hobbled legs wide apart to the counter where he took out what he thought of as his law enforcement funnel and added some more bourbon to his yoohoo he made it back to his desk with no one around he didnt have to try to walk as though everything were fine and put his feet up spread his legs gave the injured parties a little room to breathe the phone rang it was probably fucking pam again shed been calling him twice a day to bitch at him about forgetting jennys birthday hed told her he hadnt forgotten hed been involved in some serious police work and hadnt been able to get away somehow that argument hadnt convinced her best to let it ring but he had responsibilities to the community so he yanked it from the cradle meadowbrook grove police im looking for chief doe this is officer alvarez with the florida highway patrol this is doe name like alvarez doe figured hed have an accent or something but the guy habloed ingles pretty well yeah were following up on that report you filed listen we spoke to the woman in question she said you let her off with a warning and that was the end of it what doe swung his legs too quickly and he had to control the urge to yelp into the phone yeah she says you stopped her gave her a warning and let her go when the fuck have i ever let anyone off with a warning it almost came out but he checked himself so is that it well alvarez said sounds to me like one of you isnt telling the truth now wait a minute doe began just then the other line began to ring the pain in his balls the ringing of the other line he was going to lose his fucking mind no you wait a minute alvarez was saying one of you isnt telling the truth we can open an investigation if you like or we can let the matter sit what do you want to do how was he supposed to know what he wanted to do with his balls aching and the phone ringing it was on something like its twelfth ring now who was it that wouldnt give up but the thing was the woman didnt want to press charges maybe that meant she was saving her thunder for her own report but no that wouldnt work she had denied to the state police that there had been an incident to make public allegations now would be to set herself up as a liar shed shut herself and her story down just drop it then doe said you sure chief i hear an officer of the law was assaulted you heard me señor doe figured he was done with this asshole so he hung up by slamming his finger into the blinking light of the endlessly ringing line meadowbrook grove police whats so freaking important a sob and then a pause jim jim is that you oh jesus jim the voice was all broken and messed up choking and crying a car accident maybe if it happened on their turf it was their problem which always pissed him right off maybe he should buy a tow truck have a towing service on the side so at least accidents might be worth a few dollars or better yet haul the cars over the city limits line let the county handle it then he placed the voice laurel vieland shit he hadnt spoken to her for five or six years probably not since she went and moved to tallahassee but her daughter now that was something else karen had been fine a few years back before the crank and if she hadnt wanted to give it up back then she sure had no problems nowadays no inhibitions at all laurel and karen were the only motherdaughter team that doe had ever fucked not at the same time and now he sure as shit wouldnt want to still it was something and karen had that daughter the girl lived with her father up north somewhere and he knew that the father didnt even let her see karen not since karen went crazy with the crank a couple years back but thered be a family reunion one day girl would come on home to meadowbrook grove thirteen or fourteen and doe would work his magic on her then he would have fucked three generations of one family he didnt know anyone who could say hed done that laurel is that you honey more sobbing jim theyre dead it came out like a ghosts whisper bastard and karen theyre dead christ he said wheres the accident not that she said more crying crying crying crying jesus fucking hell just spit it out of course you couldnt say things like that because people took offense even if it was what they needed to hear even if they secretly wanted you to say it you still couldnt doe was already thinking about the money maybe karen a little too but mostly the money bastard had been over there again he still couldnt believe that bastard was stepping in on karen he knew knew doe had been fucking her and hed moved in anyhow doe had seen it for himself tonight and hed seen karen see him too just like he planned let her know she was in trouble that stupid encyclopedia kid went in there and he figured shed kept him inside as if that would keep doe from trying anything none of that mattered as much as the fact that bastard had just come back from doing his collections and he ought to have damn close to to hand over that was a lot of cash and if bastard was dead would doe be able to find the money what if it had been in the car and was scattered to the winds what if hed hid it somewhere and now theyd never find it doe told himself to slow down maybe he wasnt dead maybe he was only dying fucking stupid laurel no one was dead he was willing to bet dying maybe but not dead doe could get there on time kneel down while bastard raised up one bloodied hand to his shoulder pulling him close so he could whisper his dying whisper its in the toolshed or something not the toolshed bastard didnt have a toolshed he rubbed his uneven teeth back and forth like a pair of opposing hacksaws wheres the accident laurel ill come on over he sucked down the rest of his drink sobbing endless sobbing punctuated by a kind of heaving and then a bit of a groan and then more sobbing the phone stretched far enough that he could make it to the little refrigeratorfreezer unit and grab a fresh bottle of yoohoo he swallowed enough to make some room in the bottle then cradling the phone between his ear and his shoulder he funneled in about four shots worth of yell he got back in his chair and put his feet up finally not an accident she said in karens trailer theyve been shot doe swung out of his chair sudden movement turned out to be a terrible mistake a stab of electric pain shot out you there now yuhyuhyuh she said stay there and dont call anyone he slammed down his phone and knocked over the yoohoo bottle it gushed brown all over his desk all over his pants now hed have to change into his uniform stress out his balls again this was turning out to be one fucking disaster of a week the cruiser crunched onto karens driveway its headlights illuminating laurel who stood puffyeyed with her hands over her mouth doe shut off the lights instantly he normally loved to flash his police lights let the world know who made the rules but this time something told him to keep it quiet and lowkey bastard was dead and was missing only a couple of steps in toward laurel and she lunged forward and threw her arms around him she was heaving like shed been doing on the phone only now he had to feel her wet tears streaming down his neck and he felt obligated to put his arm along her back which was all jutting bone and flesh like wet clay wrapped in a cloth hed fucked her when shed been an exciting older woman now she was just old probably fiftyfive and she still dressed like a whore even though everyone could see her tits were shaped like salamis hanging above a deli counter cmon baby he said tell me what happened he knew he was in for it so her heaves and sobs didnt piss him off too much she finally pulled it together enough to speak my casserole dish i lent her my casserole dish last thanksgiving and i have company this weekend doe had seen this before and he couldnt stand it the blubbering the talking nonsense i called her this morning i asked if i could come by and she said i could and i wanted to come by earlier but i had to get my hair done and that took longer than i thought uhhuh doe tapped the tip of his shoe against a small rock i said i would come by earlier but i came by a little later i was just going to slip in and get it not bother her i didnt think it would matter but when i went into the trailer what happened in the trailer hed have to find out for himself since all he got from her was a long wail then more sobbing and heaving what a mess my baby laurel was saying my only baby baby my ass karen was a grownup whore and it wasnt like she and laurel were best friends or anything half the time they couldnt stand each other a few months back hed heard theyd gotten into a fistfight when laurel caught karen taking money out of her purse now she was going off with this my baby garbage the trailers door hung open so doe pushed himself away from the lamenting whore and walked up the steps it was all gray darkness inside but one step was all he needed there they were deadern shit bastard the fuck dead karen the slut dead what a mess more than a mess because doe didnt know who had done it which made him uncomfortable the whole point of their business was that things like this didnt happen he stepped outside where laurel held a cigarette in one palsied hand her eyes widened waiting for his professional diagnosis maybe she thought that somehow he could make it all disappear as a law enforcement officer hed be able to tell her that they werent really dead at all those were dummies actors a trick of the light fat chance doe wasnt going to make it better for her he knew pretty clearly what was going to happen even if he hadnt thought it through there wasnt time for thinking it through just for doing it you call anyone else he asked her she shook her head no one else knows she shook her head again how long was bastard seeing karen laurel stared at him she didnt answer how long he said again raising his voice was there something between you and karen jim she asked softly jesus fucking christ she was about to make this personal laurel this is police work i need to know how long were they seeing each other laurel shrugged two or three months i guess this time but they been together before piece of shit he said he almost hit her right there she would have deserved it too he could tell she knew he could tell by the way she was looking at him she knew hed been fucking her daughter and she was jealous he didnt have time for this crap doe went back into the trailer he walked over to bastard and for the fun of it gave him a good kick in the ass body was kind of heavy for a skinny guy he looked at karen her head was all messed up it had been messed up pretty good anyhow he thought and then tried not to laugh well cheating whores get what they have coming to them that was one thing everyone knew for a fact doe let out a sigh he nodded to himself the signal that it was okay and then turned toward the door laurel jesus get in here quick karens still breathing shes alive holy shit i think shes going to be okay laurel came running in right up to the bodies doe had stepped out of the way in the shadow of the wall separating the kitchen from the living area she ran up to karen and went down on her knees something she knew how to do all right and put a hand to karens cheek she did not get what she had hoped for warmth and color and movement the cheek would have been cold and rubbery now and even in the dark she could see that karens eyes were wide open staring into the nothing that comes after life she started to turn toward doe but shes not it was as far as she got before the handle of does gun came smashing down into the side of her head knocking her over onto her daughters dead body her hand slipped into a congealed pool of blood no way doe was going to keep hitting her in the head sometimes people went fast or so he had heard but not in his experience doe knew you might have to hit a person five or six times good hits too before theyd shut the fuck up instead he took advantage of her daze and wrapped his hands around her scrawny neck her turkey neck and pressed in good and tight he shoved his thumbs into her bobbing throat she struggled sure she did but not nearly so much as he expected it was like shed given up she knew it was too late more than that doe knew what she was thinking and for some reason it bothered him he wanted to clear the record i didnt kill them he told her looking right into her bugging eyes i dont know who did it but it wasnt me the only person im killing today is you he pressed in even tighter so that his hands hurt and he sort of liked the throbbing warmth of her throat against his hands for an instant he wondered if he should stop let her up tell her it was all a joke he hadnt flashed his lights but maybe people had seen them together seen her crying still what did it matter a mother standing outside her daughters trailer crying happened every day no one would even think twice he told himself and under his hands he felt something like a chicken bone snap chapter desiree sat on her bed crosslegged wearing only her panties and her bikini top a gray copy of the i ching in her lap for the past three weeks shed been coming to the same symbol again and again no matter how she asked the question no matter how she sought her answer she kept coming back to the hsieh she drew it on the back of her left hand with a sharpie so she would think about it constantly meditate on it when it finally faded away in the slow tide of flaking skin she would redraw it last week she had passed a tattoo parlor on federal highway and she thought about having it placed on her hand permanently but she decided there was no point being permanent with a symbol of change bb saw it on her hand and said it looked like a bunch of lines and she guessed they all did but this pictogram she knew derived from the image of two hands holding on to the horns of an ox it signified transformation addressing and fixing a problem it was her symbol she had to fix the problem and the problem was her life with bb she was now twentyfour and shed been with him for three years fixing his meals and driving his car organizing his calendar reserving his tables in restaurants she bought his groceries and paid his bills answered his door mixed his drinks he needed her and she knew that she loved that she felt grateful too shed been about as lost as you could get when hed taken her in hed done it for his own reasons to exorcise his demons but hed still done it those first few days weeks even months shed slept lightly watching the door handle waiting to see bb slink in under cover of darkness and claim his due maybe not that first day when her stench had been so bad that even she had had to breathe through her mouth not to gag but once shed cleaned up got off the crank bought some new clothes different story then her old face started to come back in the mirror flesh grew on bone cheeks reddened and rounded her nose became less narrow less sharp her hair less brittle she had become herself bb had told her that no matter what happened no matter how clean how happy she became shed never stop wanting to use the crank would always call to her it would be a shadow that would haunt her it was a rope tethered to her neck that would never stop tugging he was wrong he was wrong because desiree already had a shadow she already had a tether the crank had obscured it hidden it and god help her that was what she had loved about it at first but when she was clean as she lay in the bed in bbs coral gables house staring at the endless rotation of the ceiling fan listening to the distant sound of lawn mowers and car alarms she found her way back to her sister aphrodite had died during the procedure that had separated them the girls hadnt reached their second birthday when theyd performed the operation which her mother had known was complicated which risked the lives of both girls the doctor had urged her on however telling her that his university would cover the costs it was a great opportunity for the children and for science theyd separated the girls who were linked from shoulder to hip in what the doctors referred to as a minor omphalopagus yes the girls were joined but mostly by muscle and vascular tissue of the organs only the liver was shared and they believed they could separate the livers with a chance that both girls would live the doctor had been clear it was possible that they would both live likely one would die and unlikely neither would make it aphrodite died during the operation not afterward which maybe the doctors had said was better since it spared her days of painful lingering but the prognosis for desiree was quite good she would have a scar for the rest of her life and quite a large scar at that but she would have a normal life desiree learned that it was all a matter of what you called normal jeering in school locker rooms every year settling into the role of de facto freak fear of wearing a bathing suit for example were these things normal they were not of course beyondthepale odd lots of fat ugly and misshapen children had similar experiences and they werent ready for the sideshow but the whole world knew about aphrodite they knew desiree had been a siamese twin kids at school for as long as she could remember would pull back their eyes with their index fingers and sing that cat song from lady and the tramp somehow inevitably they learned aphrodites name and asked after her as though she were still alive still joined to desiree every single year of middle and high school there was always at least one pair of kids and once as many as four who came for halloween as conjoined twins then there was her mother who always claimed to have favored aphrodite even before she was out of elementary school desiree had begun to wonder if it was true if it was just something hurtful to say but wondering that even believing that didnt diminish the sting her mother loved to cry to hold her head in her hands and say oh why wasnt aphrodite spared and there was aphrodite herself desiree started hearing her voice around her twelfth birthday her mother was out of town that week gone to key west with a new boyfriend though the relationship big surprise never went anywhere but the emergency room even calling it a voice was suggesting too much she supposed aphrodite was there a presence a sensation a compulsion even a stream of intuitive information when she met someone and she took an instant like or dislike she could feel her twins push or pull at first it had been welcome a balm in the loneliness of her life but by the time she was fifteen things had begun to change she met people who didnt care about her scar who wanted to hang out listen to tunes smoke cheeb aphrodite didnt like these people but they liked desiree plenty then desiree discovered that crank made aphrodites voice quiet it stung at first made her nose burn with such incendiary pain that she snorted up water and blew it out like a whale the next time it didnt burn so much the time after that if it burned she didnt notice that was how it went until bb had found her or she had found him he was driving on the ft lauderdale strip stopped in his mercedes at a light with the top and windows down and randy newman blasting as if it were led zeppelin this guy had what she needed cash she needed cash because she needed to shoot up so fucking bad that it killed her once it had jolted her from the normal world to a place of power where she could do anything say anything she felt whole and finished no longer subject to the whims of her mother or teachers or dead twin now it was something else the crank still lifted her up no doubt about it but not to such heights and the lows the lows were more than she could ever have imagined under the earth lows buried under your grave so you were scratching the bottom of your own casket lows she was dry and evacuated a squeezedout and tattered sponge and she would do anything to get back up if only she could begin the cycle again even go over to a stranger on the ft lauderdale strip whatever restraints had once governed her routines had been eroded by endless fatigue and sleeplessness as far back as she could remember which wasnt very far since her memory didnt work so well in those days a low level of panic hummed perpetually just under her consciousness her mouth felt dry no matter how much she drank and she never felt hungry no matter how little she ate for all that shed never done anything quite like this before she fucked and sucked for crank but always guys she knew but the more she thought about it the more she saw that it didnt matter it was just a few minutes of what sex big deal they tried to make a big deal of sex but it was nothing a few minutes and shed have some money and she could score even then with the pound of need and terror in her ears she could hear her sisters muffled voice she couldnt make it out but she knew it was there a distant pleading but the guy he seemed like he would go for it he was nicely dressed hair neatly combed neatly dyed he had a few pieces of tasteful but expensive jewelry her time in the pawnshops had taught her to tell the difference he didnt look like just another rich florida doctor or lawyer or real estate developer in a convertible he was that other kind he had the mark the sign the vibrating tone audible to crankheads and dogs he lied on his tax return cheated on his wife fucked over his partners something the guy in the mercedes was crooked and he had money she walked over smiled at him she used her best smile which was radiant at least it had been once if shed known how she looked cancer thin sunken eyes thin lips red welts on her face and hands she never would have offered never would have thought anyone would want her but she didnt know so she smiled and he turned to her ill blow you for ten dollars sweetie she said he started to roll up his window a defense of minimum value with the convertibles top down and she pulled away from the rising glass about to swear then he stopped the window came back down what are you using fuck you she said starting to turn away but slowly she knew they werent done he took out a twenty and showed it to her what are you using she paused she could hear aphrodite the voice that had been muffled and muted for years she could hear it now hollow and echoing the trickle of distant water in a cave a feeling so strong that she could almost sense the words dont tell him and that was why she told him crank she said he studied her for a minute longer and then unlocked the doors with a flick of his finger get in he said she got in why not he was okay looking for an older guy probably clean certainly rich that other thing the vibrating something that told her she might die might end up dumped in a vacant lot tossed off an airboat into the everglades that didnt matter right now the need called to her the need the need ripping her in half pulling her crushing her knocking her off her feet and dragging her through the dirt so she got in but the man in the mercedes didnt want a blow job he wanted to clean her up bb never came for sex after a couple of months by which time desiree had become a kind of livein maid it was clear that he wasnt going to he didnt like women he didnt look at them when they passed on the street or in the mall not the charming or the cute or the beautiful the slutty and the sexy he looked at but not with desire it was more like a vague hostility or maybe amusement at first she assumed he was gay which was okay by her shed known plenty of queens on the street and even if she hadnt shed spent too much time as the object of derision to judge anyone for being in any way different or out of step with the idea of normal you got on tv still it never rang true bb didnt much look at men either not even those who were both beautiful and obviously gay it was entirely possible that he was asexual but desirees gut and aphrodites voice doubted it he was maybe asexual and maybe not but he was something else too something the twins could not put their respectively fleshly and ephemeral fingers on there was a blankness to him he seemed in a daze half the time hed rescued her but he never acted like the sort of person who would rescue a drug addict only when he was doing charity work with one of his kids did he come fully alive or sometimes when he was watching a boy theyd be in a restaurant or walking on the beach or shopping and his pupils would dilate and his posture would grow straighter without getting stiff and he would flush a healthy pink as if he were in love each time he seemed to fall in love once she brought it up only once because the thing of it was there was something almost admirable about bbs desire for boys he wanted to be with them she could see that on the street shed seen men who went for boys for girls for children so young that they didnt know what sex was they were predators monsters and she regretted not having killed them all bb was like them but also not he turned his desire into charity he hid from the world maybe even from himself instead he helped them if there was a way to be admirable in such a desire surely this was it shed been with him more than a year made herself as much a part of his life as his limbs when over dinner she decided it was time it was bbs birthday and hed taken a little too much of a few bottles of red hed been saving maybe shed had a little too much too about you and your boys shed said yeah he chewed at a piece of perfectly rare choice tripletrimmed filet mignon that shed grilled for him on his plate along with a pile of asparagus were two pools of dipping sauce a delicate au poivre and a garlic cream i just wanted to let you know that i understand okay i know why you do what you do bb and i think its very brave if you need anything any help you can be honest with me he set down his fork and stared at her his face reddened and veins bulged in his neck and for a moment she thought he was going to burst explode throw his plate at her order her out instead he let out a thick throaty laugh not you too he said oh desiree i know that people love to imagine the worst but i thought for sure you would understand i do understand she said i just want to help them i had a rough time when i was a boy and now that i can i want to help other boys thats it im not a pervert if you dont understand that i might want to help someone without wanting to fuck them then no one will he wasnt angry not even sad mostly he seemed weary okay bb she said she knew better but she nodded he could hide his impulses from the world as long as he hid them from himself too so at least she didnt have to worry that her friend and boss and companion might go around fucking boys he might do a lot of bad things be a lot of bad things but he had this in check even so aphrodite would not be appeased yet dead twins can rant only so much before even they give up and her objections quieted down after the first few months yes it was probably wrong to work for a man who made his money his loads and loads of money the way bb did but someone was going to and if she stopped working for bb there would be just as much trouble in the world but no food and shelter for poor desiree she could hardly get a job with no high school diploma and her only prior experience being personal assistant to a criminal besides bb wanted her around valued her deferred to her opinions she owed him her life so she could turn a blind eye to the pleasure he took from setting his hand on a boys shoulder from the way his eyes lit up when he saw one of his charity cases in a bathing suit she could live with being his beard his disguise to the world then things took a sharp turn last month theyd been driving back from a dinner meeting with a guy who ran an encyclopedia operation in georgia bb was thinking more like half thinking of expanding and maybe that would have bothered desiree if hed been serious but he would never expand he made all the money he needed now and he hated hassles why risk new territory and cross state lines the meeting went badly and both he and desiree didnt like the georgia guy didnt feel they could trust him desiree felt relieved and she suspected bb did as well it was almost as though he were looking for a way to celebrate and when they saw a kid walking along the beach something shifted visibly in bbs face the boy looked maybe eleven cute cleancut but staggering as if he were drunk maybe for the first time he had a stupid happy grin on his face and he sang something boisterous to himself occasionally breaking into air guitar as he walked why dont you stop the car bb said lets give that boy a lift desiree didnt want to stop but the light turned red and there was no choice where do you want to give him a lift to bb grinned at her like whatever had broken in him must have broken in her our house desiree kept her eyes straight ahead no no no im not going to let it happen bb bit on his lip what exactly are you not going to let happen bb lets just forget it go home if i say we give the kid a lift then thats what we do his voice had turned loud you dont tell me no and he doesnt tell me no no one tells me no stop the car and sweettalk that kid into the car or youll be on the street tomorrow and whoring for crank in a week all right she said softly she chose her words deliberately because his cruelty demanded treatment in kind and she wanted him to think if only for a second that he had won okay fine the light turned green and she sped past the boy the next morning her packed suitcase and gym bag were met with flowers and chocolates and an envelope with cash he didnt apologize didnt say he was sorry hed tried to turn her into a pimp but she knew he was sorry for all it mattered she knew she would stay but as she unpacked aphrodite made it clear that this was a reprieve not a stay desiree didnt resist or disagree or shrug it off because it wasnt a suggestion it was fact they both saw it the urge inside bb was coming out and sooner or later bad things were going to be happening under her roof maybe she could keep him in check but for how long forever it seemed unlikely what frightened her however was not the thought that bb would give in to his worst self that he would become the monster he had resisted it was that she would lack the strength to fight him she would convince herself that it would be worse if she wasnt around that she helped him from hurting even more boys she would help him with this like she helped him with his business how long could a person participate in evil without becoming evil herself or had she been guilty the moment shed accepted bbs charity the moment shed chosen to stay after learning who and what he was she had to get out she had to move on aphrodite whispered it to her in a mantra so perpetual it was like the sound of breath even the i ching couldnt stop telling her so that bb would panic if she left hardly mattered that she had nowhere to go hardly mattered she had what she needed she had money shed saved enough money that she could live for a year or two while she figured things out and she had information on bbs trade not that she wanted to extort him or threaten him but she had a feeling that once he realized she wasnt coming back once he realized she was gone for good bb was going to be very very angry and when a man is very angry and he has a bunch of people like jim doe and the gambler working for him things can get tricky chapter the phone call came in the middle of the night bb never answered the phone himself that wasnt his thing but he liked to keep the phone near his bed it was one of those office phones with a shrill office phone ring and the multiple buttons so you could see which line was in use they had only one line but he liked the idea of having several and he liked to keep an eye on when the line was in use it wasnt that he didnt trust desiree of course he did he trusted her more than anyone but why take chances the tv was on but there was only snow bb looked over at the digital clock a phone call at that hour couldnt be anything good he sat up and turned on the bedside lamp which was shaped like a giraffe reaching up to eat leaves the shade was over the tree bb sat still staring at the blue and pink of the rococo wallpaper until he heard the light tap at the door who is it the door opened a crack its the gambler fuck he picked up the handset and punched the button to switch over to the right line he always kept the phone on one of the dead lines since he liked the feeling of pushing the button when he took a call it made him feel like he was an executive which he basically was just an unconventional sort of executive so whats the status he asked the gambler everything in line there was a pause it was the sort of pause that bb did not much like not really the voice was flat wouldnt be calling now if it were what does that mean he looked over at desiree who was leaning against the door with her arms folded studying him she wore a white bathrobe and probably nothing else underneath a lot of guys scar or no would find that pretty sexy he figured and the fact that it might be kind of sexy seemed for an instant kind of sexy then the feeling passed it means the gambler told him that theres a serious problem the sort i may not be able to get resolved bb hated having to talk in code on the phone but even though there was no evidence the feds gave the slightest shit about his dealings you had to assume they were listening which meant you had to spend a lot of time talking around the issue and that got awkward when you didnt even know what the issue was who needed these hassles wasnt all of this supposed to be hassle free not really but it was supposed to be easy and he guessed it was bb had inherited his hog lot outside gainesville from his fathers father a redfaced old man with wisps of white hair that stuck out of his head as though theyd been rammed in by a vengeful enemy he was so ornery that he was like a parody of an ornery old man cursing and spitting tobacco in a rage and slapping away kind hands grandchildish hugs bologna sandwiches anything anyone might offer visits to the farm had been an unrelenting torment the old man would put him to work shoveling hog shit mopping up pools of hog piss dragging dead hog carcasses by their hooves if he even gestured toward an expression of complaint his grandfather would tell him to shut the fuck up and smack him in the head sometimes with his hand a few times with a mostly empty sack of feed once with an oldfashioned metal lunchbox there were other punishments too in the empty barn when bb broke the farmers code a fluid list of regulations that had been omitted from the poor richards almanac bb never learned the code understood its rules or parameters but a few times a year his grandfather would come up on him looking especially tall and dirty hed spit a wad of dip in bbs direction and tell him hed broken the farmers code and he needed to be mentored in the old barn he had no idea what the word meant had no idea what it was to mentor a boy he was a monster and by the time bb became old enough to make decisions for himself he vowed never to see the old man again then ten years ago the old man died hed reached ninetyseven kept alive by freefloating achilleslike wrath and a similarly quasidivine hatred of dogooders women television politicians corporations changing fashions and a world turning ever more youthful while he turned ever older bbs own father had died long before in a drunken and cokefueled motorcycle accident the helmetlessness of which smacked of suicide after his grandfathers death came the registered letter from the lawyer telling him hed inherited the farm and at just the right time too since things had not been going so well for bb in some of the various careers hed been trying on including car salesman unlicensed real estate agent landscaper security guard and a stint as a las vegas poker player this last had involved long and delirious runs under casino lights that obscured the difference between night and day drunkenness and sobriety winning and losing he now remembered hyperbolic laughing raking piles of chips toward his chest and he remembered that the next day hed mysteriously have no money but those werent the memories that came to him most often when he thought of vegas he thought of the shirtless greek he owed and still owed sending a thug to beat him so hard with a broom handle that his ribs still ached when he sneezed more than ten years later he thought of his shameful retreat from town sitting on a bus and disguised as an eastern orthodox priest the only plausible costume he could get on short notice it was that or flee town as a pirate or a mummy with no other options he took on hog farming it paid the bills though barely but it stank and filled him with a vile repulsion toward animals animals that stank and shat and demanded food and bellowed in pain and misery and deserved to die as punishment for being alive and the land itself that godawful farm with its memories of his fucking grandfather for whose sake alone he sincerely hoped there was such a place as hell the barn by its simple proximity so disturbed his sleep that he convinced a trio of potbellied and thickforearmed locals to take it down for him he paid them in beer and a whole roasted pig going back to the farm working his grandfathers lots had been degrading a waking nightmare but hed been broke beyond broke and the farm kept him afloat there was money for food and a roof over his head and occasionally the wines hed learned to love in vegas then this guy he almost knew spoken to a few times in a local bar a friend of one of the men who had taken down the barn a biker in a gang called the devildogs came to see him one night how would he feel if a couple of the boys set up a small lab on the property no one would know since the smell of the pigs would hide the smell of cooking meth bb wouldnt have to do anything except keep quiet and hed get a month it was a good deal after a month or so of not wanting to know about it bb began to hang out with the meth cooks learn how they did it learn how easy it was to turn a few hundred dollars worth of overthecounter cold medicine into speed so potent that it made coke look like a watery cup of maxwell house then the guys who worked the lab were busted while distributing he figured theyd roll on him but they never did he figured other guys from the operation would come by and take over the lab but they never did there it was a fully operational moneymaking machine on his property hed be crazy to ignore it the problem was bb hadnt known the first thing about distributing drugs had no idea how to go about it he couldnt see himself on the corner wearing a trench coat pssting to any skinny trailertrashy redneck with an oversize shirt and a dull look in his eyes he continued to make the meth not large quantities only an ounce or two a month while he got the hang of it it seemed like a good idea to keep the quantities small since making meth when you didnt know what you were doing was like holding a jar of nitroglycerin on a roller coaster he made it and he stored it just a hobby really like putting ships in a bottle it took only a couple of days of work and then there it was this lovely yellow powder he got better more confident made more learned how to dispose of the waste which was so toxic that it ate through the ground within a year he had thousands of dollars worth of stuff and no idea how to unload it when he read in the business section of a local newspaper that champion encyclopedias was looking for someone to run an operation in the state it all began to come together for him he convinced them he was an entrepreneur that he could run the book business as well as he ran his agricultural concern his term but enthusiasm was wasted on them they cared no more for his acumen than his crew chiefs cared for the acumen of new bookmen you hire everyone you can you cast them to the waves and you see whos still floating this happened three years after vegas and when bb met with the top crew chiefs in the state he knew one of them a guy by the name of kenny rogers called himself the gambler he didnt recognize bb but bb recognized him the gambler was the thug whod beaten bb with the broom handle in his vegas apartment bb down on the ground hands over his head the sounds of the neighbors dog barking the neighbors tv turned up loud to pretend he couldnt hear and bbs own sobbing filling his ears bb had been thinking only of revenge of exorcising his demons when hed hired the gambler let him work for bb let him think he was doing a great job in on the deepest secrets of the organization part of the whole planning process bb was keeping the gambler close figuring out where and how he would get even make things right in the universe as time went by however the revenge never happened the gambler made bb money way too much money to remove him so thoughtlessly and the greater truth was that if bb did take revenge then he would no longer have the pleasure of anticipating the sweetness of payback so bb had kept the gambler where he was and occasionally thought about what he might do to him things had gone so well for so long he should have expected something like this can you get me the thing i asked for bb said he tap tap tapped a pencil on the night table i dont know the gambler kept his voice devoid of content right now its missing missing jesus christ wheres um the guy who is supposed to have it hes gone gone in a permanent and messy way if you know what im saying what the hell is going on there who caused him to get gone no idea the gambler said were working on it yeah you working on getting me my stuff too were working on it but right now we dont have a whole lot to go on am i going to have to come out there bb asked i dont think thats necessary the gambler said we can take care of everything ill keep you updated bb hung up the phone hed keep them updated great with their little i spy with my little eye games he turned to desiree get dressed were going to jacksonville he said she scrunched up her nose i hate jacksonville of course you hate jacksonville everyone hates jacksonville no one goes to jacksonville because they like it then why do people go to jacksonville to find their money bb said and to make sure their people arent trying to rip them off and maybe he thought to take care of the gambler if hed lost the payment then there was a pretty good chance hed outlived his usefulness maybe even if he could find the money the gambler hung up the phone the asshole was going to come up here he just knew it the last thing he needed was bb and his freakshow girlfriend messing around with the business technically of course it was bbs business but that struck the gambler as more a matter of happenstance than anything else hed stumbled into this deal met some people formed some alliances whatever the money came in not because bb was so smart but because people were willing to buy crank crank was cheap to make there wasnt much competition for the market and the cops were too busy chasing after cocaine cowboys to pay much mind to homemade meth they could sell it out of icecream trucks hell they practically did without the feds or local law taking notice they had bigger fish to fry than some homemade bullshit that you could cook up out of overthecounter asthma medicine the truth was that there was a lot more money to be made and the gambler was sick and fucking tired of babysitting this encyclopedia zoo he wasnt going to have the strength for it much longer and he was ready to move on to help expand the empire he needed something less physically taxing something that would enable him to sit and think and make money hed told bb as much though he left out the part about worrying about his strength bb hadnt been interested right now hed said were all making money the cops are oblivious and everything is just fine we get greedy everything could fall apart it was easy for bb to be happy with the status quo he didnt have to hang out with these doortodoor fuckos and assholes like jim doe he didnt have to perform for the sales monkeys twice a day and he didnt have to worry about the day coming and it could be in a couple of years maybe even next year when he wouldnt be able to do it anymore when the medical bills would begin to pile in when he would need the cash to make sure someone was taking care of him so he didnt end up with psychopathic orderlies who would stick pins in his eyeballs just for the fun of it the gambler had never been anything but effective and loyal and he was getting sick of bbs ingratitude not just ingratitude there was something else bbs new residence in the land of oblivion he was checked out on another planet that was no way to run this kind of operation the gambler had worked with guys in vegas who could run six operations at one time have three phone conversations and handicap a weekends worth of football games and give them all their full attention fucking bb couldnt figure out if a yellow light meant speed up or slow down without fucking desiree to tell him and sure the money was good but it wasnt going to be enough not when he began to decline hed been forced to leave off working for the greek in vegas when the freezing started he probably ought to have gone to a doctor right away youre in the middle of kicking someones ass and you just freeze bat over your head like youve turned into an action figure thats usually a sign to head for the doctor but it was an isolated incident a freak thing so he forgot about it then it happened again three or four months later out on a date with a showgirl ruined the whole thing then three months after that this time while playing golf midswing and frozen just like that hed been with the greek that time and the greek had wanted to know reasonably enough what the fuck was going on five doctors later it was confirmed als amyotrophic lateral sclerosis lou gehrigs disease a form of muscular dystrophy he was now one of jerry lewiss fucking kids it could start in any number of ways muscle spasms loss of coordination slurring of speech clumsiness and the gamblers own freakish freezes it would progress until he was a complete physical nothing unable to move even to breathe or swallow on his own while his mind meanwhile remained in perfect working order it could happen slowly or it could happen quickly no one knew in the gamblers case the progress appeared to be slow so that gave him time to get his shit in order it wasnt the death he feared he knew that death wasnt the end hed seen those pictures of ghosts heard the recordings of voices from the other side even been to a medium who let him speak to his dead mother knowing that the body was but a shell and the soul lived on had helped him in his enforcement work in vegas its not so hard to beat someone to death if you know youre not doing any permanent damage what scared him was the time leading up to death when he was alone and helpless and the only thing that was going to keep him from being abused and tormented was money he needed money if he told bb the truth bb would be sympathetic understanding and he would send him on his way maybe with a nice little bonus but not nearly enough the gambler needed money piles and piles of money enough money to pay for the bills to pay for a personal nurse and pay the nurse so well that she would do anything to keep him happy and healthy the way things were going the cause was in trouble in the last six months bb had been more distracted than ever business was falling off and he didnt seem to care and desiree that sneaky bitch was up to something he was sure of it maybe she was planning a takeover to cut out the gambler entirely but there was no way he was going to work for her and he sure as hell wasnt going to let her get rid of him if anyone was going to take over for bb it would be the gambler desiree kept her eyes straight ahead next to her in the passenger seat bb sat quietly his head tilted slightly away from her she couldnt tell if he was asleep or not or maybe pretending his tape of randy newmans little criminals had finished playing a minute ago and now there was only the hissing silence of the radio she wanted more music the radio anything to help keep her awake her fatigue the darkness of the highway the glare of oncoming traffic lulled her into a hypnotic stupor you had a good time with chuck she asked at last bb stirred what do you mean i mean did you have a good time we had a productive dinner he said hes a good kid bright ready for mentoring could be more if you know hes willing to open himself up she let that hang there okay they said nothing for a few more minutes desiree winced when they passed a pair of squashed raccoons in the roadside i never wanted to be like this bb said desiree felt herself suck in her breath in a way shed been waiting for this the big confession and shed been dreading it once he told her of his shame of how his desires controlled him of how he had been victimized as a boy whatever it was that he would say she was afraid she would feel pity and sympathy and the will to leave would be lost in a tangle of guilt and obligation i never wanted to be in this business you know it just happened to me relief passed over her he didnt want to talk about his thing for boys he wanted to talk about being a supplier im in no position to judge anyone bb i never wanted to do this he said again i dont like it id live off the hogs if i could except ive gotten used to the money now but its like a stain on my soul you know its a blackness i keep thinking that i want to get rid of it so walk away she said just walk away no one is stopping you i was thinking something else he said i was thinking that maybe someone could take over for me that you could take over for me id cut you in on the profits and i could retire from it all work at the young mens foundation fulltime live a decent life thats very flattering she said its really incredible that you trust me so much bb but i need to think about it okay he said and he fell into silence again desiree had no desire to think about it bbs idea of cleaning the stain off his soul was to hand the dirty work to someone else and just take the profits ever so slightly she shook her head she didnt want him to see it but she felt she needed to offer the universe a gesture her decisions were getting easier all the time chapter the alarm went off at seven am normally after hanging out by the pool people would begin to drift off to sleep between one and two and hardly anyone was left by three that meant you could get four hours of sleep easy which bobby said was all you needed he ought to know he was always among the last to leave the pool area and he never once looked tired i couldnt remember ever having seen him yawn i had grown used to the fatigue in the way you might grow used to having a tumor on the side of your face you never forgot about it but not forgetting about it didnt mean you were actually thinking about it i woke up each morning exhausted fuzzy slightly dizzy and the feeling never quite went away bobby tended to breeze into our room about twenty after seven swinging the door wide and bounding in like a character in a musical about to break into song he would make sure everyone was awake and chitchat with whoever had been the first to shower and was by then usually dressed since they had to rush if four people were going to get showered and have breakfast in time for the prep meeting at nine as it turned out i was the first to hit the showers though i was the last to go to bed bed being a euphemism for a spot on the floor id crawled into the room just before five in the morning undressed quietly and gone to sleep in the space between the television and the doorless closet resting my head on a dirty undershirt no one had left me a spare pillow id slept i was almost certain of it but it had been a fitful sleep in which i dreamed mostly of lying awake on the floor and trying to sleep at least i hadnt dreamed about selling books and it was the first time in weeks that i could say that and i hadnt dreamed about bastards and karens bodies which was some kind of mercy when the alarm went off i jumped up as only someone whos had chronically little sleep can and headed for the bathroom by the time i showered and put on my other pair of khaki pants a light blue buttondown and a narrow tie noontime sun yellow i was feeling almost like myself again i could forget what happened in the trailer the evening with melford and the events back at the trailer i could almost forget that i had been involved in a double murder a third murder implicating a crooked cop and the head of the company for which i worked i sat on the bed staring at my vaguely trembling hands trying to summon the desire for breakfast when the door opened and bobby came bobbing in up first and im not surprised he said glad to see it lemmy i scoped out todays area already and i have a moochie spot for you but youve got to promise me a double youre getting out there by eleven this morning youll have twelve hours you think you can promise me a double at least that is a double at least i can try i said lamely hell hes too tired scott said he was lying on the bed shirtless and his pale gut and pale tits were hanging out at us i dont know how much sleep he got last night maybe you should give that moochie area to someone else bobby someone who aint gonna let it go bobby grinned at him as though scott had just told him that he liked his haircut lemmy here has earned the mooch you produce like lemmy youll share the spoils like lemmy now hows that gonna happen if youre every time giving him the best areas bobby shook his head a good bookman can sell anywhere and when lemmy came up he didnt get the cream just like none of the green guys get the cream you didnt get any special treatment when you came up and i still dont he mumbled thats where lemmy proved himself you want a share of the mooch you have to show me you deserve the mooch all he done was get lucky scott said aint nothing but a rich jew that wants more money for hisself cmon scottie bobby said lemmys a good guy yeah good at what butt fucking i guess said ronny neil lying still on the other bed his arms and legs out as if he were making a snow angel you good at butt fucking he asked me define good i said holy bananas you guys are cranky this morning bobby said but im glad youre dressed lemmy the gambler wants to see you ronny neil who had been sprawled out dreamily suddenly shot upright like scott he slept shirtless but unlike scott ronny neil had a tightly muscled body he had small but hard pecs and his back muscles shot out like wings on his left shoulder he had a cross tattoo it had been done by hand and in ink the kind prisoners give each other whats the gambler want with him ronny neil demanded bobby shrugged i guess youll have to take that up with the boss yourself rono ronny neil narrowed his gaze at bobby he dont have nothing to do with the gambler i aint gonna stand for the gambler bringing him in bringing him in to what bobby demanded i dont want him talking to the gambler ronny neil said it wasnt quite sulky more like a growl the fact that i didnt want to talk to the gambler either didnt seem to count for much i felt a wave of dizzying panic had the gambler somehow learned that melford and i had been hiding in the closet he had the checkbook which meant they knew someone from the company had been there and by now hed probably figured out that the someone in question was me lets go lemmy bobby said dont want to keep the big boss man waiting he gets too cozy with the boss ronny neil said ill stick a knife up his ass does that count as being good or bad at butt fucking i asked oh dont be that way ronster bobby put a hand to my shoulder and led me out the door i couldnt believe he was going to leave it at that maybe he thought that if he came down harsher on them it would be worse for me maybe he thought that leaving it alone wouldnt affect how many books were sold maybe he was off on planet bobby and didnt understand that ronny neil was a scary asshole and scott was a scary and pathetic asshole was such a thing possible had bobby skated so blithely through life with his salesman grin and good cheer that he didnt know what it meant to be picked on to be humiliated by bigger or meaner guys who got their rocks off by reminding you that you walked around unscathed at their pleasure was bobby like chitra insulated from the cruelty of the world not by his looks but by an impenetrable armor of optimism and generosity if that was the case it meant that bobby and i lived in entirely different places the same to an outside viewer but utterly unalike to our particular perspectives where i saw danger and menace bobby saw only innocent ribbing a little on the harsh side perhaps but still innocent what if bobby lived in this wondrous world precisely because he believed in it i had seen how melford had defused a certain whumping the night before in the bar but hed done it consciously what if bobby did that sort of thing all the time only he didnt know he was doing it he assumed the best in people and he got kindness and leeway in return if that was true it meant that i was in some way responsible for ronny neil and scott hating me so much i assumed the worst about a couple of ignorant rednecks they picked up on it responded to it acted on it did it work that way what troubled me about this idea truly troubled me was not so much that i had to shoulder the blame for ronny neil threatening to stick a knife up my ass though that was undeniably distasteful as that it seemed to be too much like what melford had been talking about last night we all see the world through a veil of ideology hed said melford thought that the veil came from outside of us the system or something but maybe it was more complicated maybe we made our own veils maybe the world made us and we in turn made the world surely melford couldnt be the only person thinking about this stuff hed mentioned marx and marxists but there had to be others philosophers and psychologists and who knew what if i had been on my way to columbia instead of being on my way to see the gambler the deadbodyhiding and evidenceconcealing gambler i might have a hope of finding out someday but unless the sample volume of the champion encyclopedias i carried around with me took up the issue id probably not find out anytime soon chapter we walked along the motel balcony as if it were the corridor to the electric chair at least i did the morning was bright and sunny with only a few wispy streaks of white in the sky and the extreme mindnumbing heat hadnt started to get going yet so bobby appeared to be in a good mood he had his hands thrust into the pockets of his khaki chinos and his lips pursed in a soft whistle maybe something by air supply so what does the gambler want with me i ventured i guess youll find out soon enough bobby said i sort of figured youd know fat chance i was about to ask something paranoid and foolish did he seem angry when he asked you to get me did he say that he found something perhaps something in a checkbook he took from a dead persons trailer i choked back all those questions what would melford do i wondered melford i decided would tell himself that the gambler was not about to kill me not when there were half a dozen people who knew i was going into his room melford would figure that the gambler was looking for information melford would see this as an opportunity to get some information for himself we were only about four doors down from the gamblers room so i stopped whats the gamblers deal anyhow bobby stopped too but reluctantly he looked at me and looked at the gamblers door as though he couldnt believe i was in one place and not the other what do you mean i mean he works for this company educational advantage media right but theyre not part of champion encyclopedias how does all of this work theres no time for a civics lesson lemmy the boss man is waiting come on i said trying to sound relaxed i just want to know how all of this works you want to know now but he must have decided it would be more expedient to answer than argue so he pursed his lips and emptied his lungs educational advantage media contracts with champion okay they contract for various cities and their surrounding areas and in florida they contract for fort lauderdale miami tampa jacksonville and gainesville thats why we go to those places over and over again who owns educational advantage media the gambler bobby shook his head no but hes high up maybe even the number two guy the boss is a guy named gunn who ive never met the gambler talks to him all the time and hes been out to visit us on the road a few times but he never bothers to meet with us little people so is this guy you know okay bobby shrugged probably i guess ill tell you one thing though he looked around conspiratorially hes got this woman who works for him shes kind of hot and she always wears a bikini top but shes got this nasty scar down her side like she was in a motorcycle wipeout or something its really pretty ugly but she loves to show it off i dont want to judge someone for being unfortunate or anything but ouch dont show the world you know i said i knew though i didnt know at all okay enough piddling bobby clapped his hands together with cheerful finality lets go see the boss the gambler sat at the peeling particleboard desk in his room looking over some credit apps he wore greenishtinted chinos a white oxford with no tie and brown loafers he had perched on his nose a pair of glasses that made him look like a nineteenthcentury accounting clerk an effect only increased by his hair straight and thick and just a tad long all he needed was a high collar and some muttonchops sit the gambler said he gestured with his head to a chair by the window i walked over and sat the chair rested on thick wooden legs and was upholstered with a leather worn so thin that it threatened to burst like a soap bubble my heart thumped violently and my hands shook i stared up at my boss having no idea what to expect i probably should be trying to think of what sorts of things the gambler might ask so i could come up with good answers but i couldnt think clearly everything swirled around me in gray eddies you can leave us alone now the gambler said to bobby okie bobby bounced on his feet almost a heelclicking salute and then walked out the gambler continued to peer at the paperwork gazing over his perched glasses what were they there for if not for reading how have you been lem everything all right terrific i said though i didnt sound terrific i sounded like i knew i was in trouble terrific huh i guess well see he stared at me until i looked away you know bobby says youre a born bookman a real power hitter you got that grand slam that fell through a while back didnt you that was me shame about it i mean you do good work you should get your reward right a more experienced bookman might have seen those guys for deadbeats but you cant blame yourself for not knowing what only years on the job can teach you i guess not i hadnt been blaming myself and i couldnt think of what a more experienced bookman might have picked up on sure galen had lived in a relatively rundown place but hed had a pretty nice truck his wife had some decent jewelry his friends all looked okay too none of them were going to be extras on knots landing but nothing suggested that they were off to the welfare office the next day either but im more concerned about this the gambler said he now held up a credit app karens not that i could read it from across the room but i knew what it was bobby tells me you got all the way through and they balked at the check is that right yeah that shouldnt happen i know you get that far you should close you should have been closing the minute you walked through that door the check should have been a formality not a deal breaker you understand what im saying the gamblers voice remained calm through all of this but there was an urgency there too a kind of growing gravity and anger too maybe i understand what youre saying the words the ideas behind the words the whole thing i had the distinct feeling that i was talking too much but i didnt know what he wanted from me and my mouth switched into running mode if you understood the gambler answered then we wouldnt be having a talk about this bullshit would we he smiled thinly so i want you to tell me what happened with these people you had them they filled out the app they were ready to go and then what they balked i sounded a little shrill so i looked at my hands to hide my embarrassment and my fear this gambler the gambler in front of me had nothing to do with the oldtime revival preacher who sermonized to us about selling this was not the supersalesman gambler this was the gambler who disposed of corpses in the middle of the night they balked tell me something i dont know why why the fuck did they balk maybe anger wasnt the right way to go when speaking to an accessory to murder but there it was besides i was myself an accessory to murder so i had to figure that leveled the playing field look bobby told you im a power hitter and i am i sell a lot of books ive never had people balk at the check before and theres no reason to think its going to happen again it was just one of those things just one of those things huh well how about we dont do anything about it lem and then it becomes two of those things and then three of those things how about you tell me how many sales you have to blow before im supposed to care about it how many tell me i let it hang in the air for a moment before i spoke more than one i wanted to look away but i told myself to keep my eyes steady this was his problem not mine more than one okay more than one but i dont want it to be more than one i want it to be less than one its a little late for that i know but im thinking and maybe im crazy here im thinking it might be better to stop this in its tracks so you dont sit in someones house for three fucking hours have them fill out the app and then fuck up the close thats what im thinking lem so tell me what happened i bit my lip this wasnt the principals office i wasnt in danger of my mother getting a phone call i was in danger of being executed like bastard and karen i had seen it i knew what it meant and i had to come up with something based on the conversation id overheard i could feel reasonably confident that the gambler had known bastard and karen knew something of their personalities so whatever story i came up with would have to sound plausible when the wife was filling out the app the husband was making trouble he was kind of a clown you know trying to distract her insult her insult me with him carrying on i could see the wife was having problems she looked nervous she started talking about money what money the gambler demanded how much money i knew id hit a nerve he and the police chief had been looking for money from what i could tell a lot of money i took a deep breath and concentrated on acting as though i had no idea what he was talking about just money you know then when it came time for the check she said she didnt want to do it yeah the gambler said he took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes with the back of his hand i felt pretty sure i was bombing so i uh tried again i went over all the stuff theyd seen i told them about how i had asked them to let me know if they werent interested i did all the things weve talked about in training but she still wouldnt budge i guess the husband got angry and then i knew it was pretty much lost this is bullshit he said why the fuck would they want encyclopedias i stared at him um i dont know i said why would anyone want encyclopedias i mean theyre great books and all spare me the bullshit what did you do then i shrugged i left you left the gambler repeated you just walked out of there did you say hell i dont need two hundred dollars i made me that already so i dont need it again is that what you told them do you think that would have been helpful his face reddened but he didnt say anything it was clear now that the gambler wanted some other kind of information information he didnt know how to excavate so i bit back my irritation the thing to do i realized was to use his confusion his desperate fishing i needed to figure out a way to make all of this work for me i didnt know what else to do i got the feeling they wanted me to leave like i was getting on their nerves i didnt know how to turn it around i sighed so can you tell me what i should have done what the gambler sneered at me astonished at the audacity of the question i mean if this is about keeping me from losing them at the check ever again i need to know how to handle it how would you have handled it the gamblers eyes narrowed and his face pinched inward you tell me lem you think about it for a while then you come back and tell me right now im more interested in what you did so you left were they doing anything when you left i felt like i was gaining some ground so i pushed it further why what does that have to do with my having lost the sale just answer the question would you the gambler looked away i dont think so they were sitting at the kitchen table smoking too angry with each other to talk he stared at me blankly then i felt the smack of inspiration ideally i would have had more time to think it through to be certain it wasnt an amazingly stupid idea but i didnt have time and i decided to run with it i paused and peered away as if in thought before i went in there i saw this creepy guy hanging around the gambler now sat up straight what creepy guy i shrugged as if the story were no big deal just a guy who stopped me wanted to talk to me he drove a dark ford pickup and he had a strange haircut short all over but longish in the back he had weird teeth too i think he might also have been the guy who was hanging around in the dark outside the trailer when i left but im not sure i didnt see whoever it was lurking around the trailer but it was just a feeling i had you know i tried to look more puzzled than pleased with myself the gambler and this other guy doe were clearly working together on this and had been working with bastard and karen now i had the gambler suspecting doe if i could cook up enough treasure of the sierra madre tension between the two of them theyd forget all about me and the check that never got written all right the gambler said get out of here i stood up and started to walk toward the door i wont let it happen again i chirped like a good little bookman the gambler didnt even look up thats just fucking great chapter hed been dreaming about the bodies about moving them which was why he believed you should never do anything too unpleasant right before going to sleep it always stuck with you in his dream doe had karens body thin and light like a department store mannequin draped over his shoulder next to him with bastard in tow was not the gambler but mitch ossler that fat bumbler in the dream doe was just waiting for him to drop bastard and he would have hed have dropped the body and it would have come out of its impromptu bedsheet shroud and it would have rolled away from them even though they were on flat ground mitch ossler was like that hed taught the other guys how to cook meth and he knew his stuff no doubt about it mitch could cook fast and he could cook reliably he had his ear to the ground and came up with new recipes he was the one who found out how to turn crankhead piss back into meth but mitch never had a mind for the details little things like safety and staying alive no one had been surprised really surprised when the accident happened something like that was bound to happen and mitch was exactly the sort of guy it would happen to the asshole had been setting up a new lab he let a batch get too hot and it vomited out a violent blast of vapor right in his face no one else had smelled anything but mitch whose face had gone all red and puffy from the wallop of heat said it was mustard gas invisible almost odorless and in about twelve hours his organs would start to rupture he had to go to a hospital thing was doe couldnt let mitch go to the hospital couldnt let him make up some bullshit story about how he got exposed to mustard gas it wasnt exactly like he could have been defending his trench against an offensive by the germans so theyd burned down the new lab and mitch had been the first guy to end up in the waste lagoon too bad because he knew a lot of useful things doe was up earlier than he would have liked and later than he should have been he forced himself out of bed and hobbled around his bedroom moving from closet to dresser and back again keeping his legs wide apart to ease the pain he wasnt going to look at his balls anymore hed decided he would just not look hed wait a week and then look again surprise himself by seeing a normal sack that was much better than checking them every day like some sort of hypochondriac no one would have guessed from looking at his trailer from looking at the stuff in his trailer that he had a fat and fastgrowing account in the caymans and that was just how he liked it sure his trailer was a little bit bigger than most of the others in meadowbrook grove a little bit more nicely kept he had a girl come twice a week to pick up for him so he didnt need to bother with crap like laundry and putting away dishes thats why most people lived badly they had to choose between the freedom of laziness and the tyranny of neatness doe knew that a cleaning girl was the third way in his case he had a chunky sixteenyearold with bad acne and droopy eyes her mother said she was slightly retarded and doe had no problem believing it the way she hulked around mumbling cheerfully to herself but she cleaned with a thoroughness that bordered on obsession and she didnt steal or nose around even better he almost never felt the urge to fuck around with her ugly thing that she was one time he thought about throwing her down and shoving it right into her asshole purely on principle because he could get away with it give her a cookie or a lollypop or something and shed be all right but the phone rang or someone knocked on the door and he was distracted first thing that morning he staggered into the shower angling himself so the water didnt hit his balls he stayed in there for a long time maybe too long but finally forced himself out and after a cursory pass with the towel he stumbled into loosefitting jeans and a tampa bay bucs tshirt with breakfast in hand a bag of doritos and a pepsi from the fridge he hit the truck bastard was dead and that was going to be a problem now he had to see to it that there were no other problems he needed to do the rounds make sure everything looked normal bastard had a family emergency he might say he had to take off visit his dying mother fuck his dying sister it didnt matter bastard found out he had colon cancer and had to go off for treatment that might be good serves the fuckstick right for messing with karen he deserved to have the world thinking he had ass cancer meanwhile doe would have to get someone else real soon because if production dried up there was going to be trouble even if doe understood in principle how to cook he wasnt about to risk getting an organmelting blast of mustard gas so until they could recruit a new cook it would be business as usual a great deal of the distribution went through the encyclopedia kids those two assholes the gambler kept close so that wouldnt be a problem same as always theyd come to town once a month go into neighborhoods pass off to their dealers nice and neat cops didnt look at them twice they werent the problem the problem was the extracurricular product that the gambler and bb didnt know about things had been growing lately and doe had begun to move beyond the cover of bookmen there were other distributors now and if they didnt get what they wanted theyd whine if their tweaking crankhead buyers didnt get what they wanted theyd do more than whine theyd make trouble theyd break into houses and knock off convenience stores and old ladies in the street to get their ten fucking dollars for their fix they would get themselves arrested and once these assholes were sitting across the interrogation table from the cops too stupid to ask for a lawyer theyd talk doe drove out to the hog lot and parked his truck out back he was alone no chance he wasnt but even so he looked around carefully he saw nothing but the pines the undulating waste lagoon a few egrets passing overhead and a waddling trio of ducks the ugly kind with gnarled red knobs on their beaks an enormous toad almost the size of a dinner plate sat glumly in his path it was low and fat and sprawled out as though its own size had been a horrible mistake doe gauged the distance to the waste lagoon it might be possible just possible to punt it all the way over there watch it splash into a shitty death but he didnt do it letting it live was punishment enough mitch had designed the door to the lab so that it was practically invisible from the outside if you didnt know where to look just slats in the corrugated metal exterior of the hog lot doe slid his fingers inside and pulled the hidden latch outward the door swung open and a blast of cool air hit him hard he always winced always like the cool air might contain the same toxic cloud that killed mitch but it was just the ac cranking hard unlike the hog lot proper which he kept just cool enough to keep the hogs alive the lab was downright chilly if it went over sixtyfive degrees alarms went off to warn them he had a special receiver in his house in his car in the office it seemed like a good idea because of all the shit they had in there if it got too hot the place would erupt into a toxic mushroom cloud so he kept it under sixtyfive degrees christ he hated the place and he avoided it as best he could bastard had made it easy piece of shit though he was he had been good at his job had been able to make sure everything went as it should and he could cook quickly and safely all of that freed doe from having to do more than the occasional spot visit say goodbye to that for a while hed be practically living in this shithole until he felt he could trust their new cook as soon as they could find one after the cool the first thing that hit him was the stench an impressive trick considering that hed been walking along the shore of the waste lagoon but that was what the waste lagoon was for it disguised the stink the gripping knifesharp gutchurning stink like cat piss that rammed through his eyes and up into his brain the instant he crossed the threshold doe grabbed at one of the face masks the kind favored by workers removing asbestos hanging near the door it helped a little but he could still smell it and he could hear softly through the wall the low pathetic grunting of hogs the cooking gear lay everywhere empty containers of stove fuel starting fluid ammonia iodine lye drano propane ether paint thinner freon chloroform and sinisterly marked containers of hydrochloric acid more skullandbones symbols than a pirate hideout there were open boxes of cold and asthma medicine crap they bought by the caseload from mexico in one corner were hundreds of empty wooden matchboxes and scattered around lay thousands maybe millions of little wooden sticks whose red phosphorus bastard would spend hours scrapping into a metal mixing bowl while listening to molly hatchet every once in a while he was supposed to destroy as much of this stuff as he could take it somewhere out of town and burn it holy jesus they didnt risk dumping it but it looked like bastard might have been a little lax on that point of late that he had been lax about the trash suggested hed been lax about other things and that was about as disturbing a thought as you could reasonably have doe walked around a large wooden table with three hot plates half a dozen coffeemakers and a huge tippedover box of rock salt he maneuvered around the pit a hole ten feet in diameter maybe eight feet deep dug right into the dirt floor where they poured the used lye and acid then he made his way back past the hulking old ice machine the cooling process demanded a lot of ice and doe had decided it was too suspicious to keep buying their own hed heard about a couple of guys in california where the cops were starting to pay attention to crank who got nabbed because they bought a twelvepack of beer and twenty bags of ice to go with it a sharpeyed cop saw the transaction figured something was up and followed them to their lab so doe had bought this used machine out of state one more reason why he would last while the others fell before his mighty empire behind the ice machine which he wheeled aside he found the spot on the particleboard covering of the wall a quick push and the flap opened revealing the safe two thoughts shot through does mind one was that he would find the money in there that bastard had been keeping the money in the safe even though he knew he wasnt supposed to keep cash and product together the other thought was that the safe would be entirely empty neither turned out to be true inside the safe he found a brown publix shopping bag filled with dozens of little plastic bags of yellowish powder all in all about a pound of nicely diluted meth without factoring in overhead it had cost a couple of hundred dollars in ingredients to cook he would be able to sell it for close to five thousand doe did another quick passthrough he wanted to make sure nothing was cooking nothing hot nothing in the works when bastard had got himself killed that was the problem with this stuff it was gold pure profit and the cops didnt give a shit about it but it could explode if you looked at it funny you made the stuff by soaking overthecounter cold medicine in toxic chemicals reducing the ephedrine out of it and the process required and produced as byproducts shit so deadly that you could fight a war with it hed heard countless stories meth labs exploding the cooks all found dead or worse than dead from acid and lye burns searing chemicals in their lungs that made them pray for a bullet in the brain everything looked turned off cool and nonexplosive no frothing chemical reactions no smoke or burning smell or hiss of seeping chemicals doe got out of there got out right quick shut off the light and didnt take off the mask until he was outside and could breathe in the pure shit stench of the waste lagoon back in the truck he predicted he could have everything taken care of within a few hours drive off to jacksonville unload the product to the distributors at a couple of places he would need to pick up twentygallon containers of urine it had been mitch stupid dead mitch who had discovered that crankheads processed meth very badly and you could recycle their urine theyd been giving good deals to anyone who provided a healthy quantity of the stuff and there was a certain pleasure in getting people hooked on meth and then harvesting their own piss to keep them hooked bastard had loved that part now the asshole was dead doe didnt know what it proved but he was sure it proved something chapter every time we went out on the road we ended up in a motel near a waffle house maybe florida law stated that motels had to be built near a waffle house anything i was coming to understand might be as true as anything else i wasnt particularly hungry but i thought i should eat something so after i got out of the gamblers room i headed over it was probably where most of the bookmen would be eating including i hoped chitra who i had not forgotten seemed to think i might be cute the waffle house sat on the other side of the highway offramp and to get to it you had to cross an empty lot full of sandy dirt and thorny weeds and huge undulating fireant mounds fat crickets and toads the size of my thumbnail hopped out of my way as i walked slowly making certain i didnt step in anything that would bite me litter from the highway punctuated the field and there were piles of broken green and brown beer bottle glass and a rundown wooden shack about as long and as wide as three jiffy johns placed side by side i decided to plot a course far around it in case a derelict had set up camp there i had nearly reached the waffle house when i heard footsteps behind me ronny neil and scott they both wore newish s and buttondowns scotts was a pale faded yellow of a heavy cotton weave far too hot for this weather ronny neils was white but with stains the color of scotts shirt under his arms both wore old pattern ties that had certainly belonged to their fathers though ronny neils was wide and short enough that it might have been his grandfathers where you going scott said breakfast i told him is that fucking right ronny neil asked i kept walking didnt you hear him scott asked he was talking to you how rude of me i said yes ronny neil it is in fact fucking right you watch your mouth ronny neil said and ill tell you something else you aint as smart as you think you are look im going to get something to eat i said trying to soften things up a little so are we scott flashed a crooked grin why dont you buy us some breakfast you can buy your own breakfast i told him you being a cheap jew scott asked me is that it pinching your pennies im not the one asking for a free breakfast ronny neil smacked me in the back of the head it happened so fast that someone looking might not have been sure it had happened at all but there was no mistaking the sting ronny neil wore a ring on his finger maybe not turned around but he knew how to smack ring first it hit me in the skull with a sharp crack that brought tears to my eyes i went stiff with disbelief and anger i was out of high school this sort of thing wasnt supposed to happen anymore despite the long hours and grueling conditions and aside from the money i had loved selling encyclopedias because it put me beyond high school no one could see that i used to be heavy that i used to be easy pickings all they could see was the new lem fit slim good at selling now with ronny neil and scott the feeling of powerlessness so infuriated me that it took all my will to keep from lunging at one of them both of them lunging haplessly and ineffectively no doubt but i wanted to lunge all the same i keep a buck knife in my pocket ronny neil told me now my brothers in jail for armed robbery and i have two cousins in there too one for grand theft auto and another on manslaughter though it was really murder and he got pleaded down thats what happens on a first offense which my killing you would be you think im afraid to sit a few years in jail you go on and try me you think maybe you want to buy us some breakfast now scott lisped yeah ronny neil said you ready to buy uth some breakfath when we walked into the waffle house there were already groups of bookmen in some of the booths under certain circumstances the postsales pool gatherings mostly the bookmen could be a gregarious lot but for the most part we stuck to our own groups the ft lauderdale crew socialized with the ft lauderdale crew and jacksonville with jacksonville no particular reason for it and it wasnt a segregation in any way promoted by the crew bosses but there was an inherent competitiveness among the crews and no one ever got too friendly people glanced at us as we walked in offered a few friendly nods but no waves no one shouted hey come over here and join us all of which was fine by me i didnt need my humiliation to go public they led me to one of the booths and pushed me in scott blocked me and ronny neil sat across he immediately picked up a laminated menu and began to study it intensely most important meal of the day he said theres a lot of people dont know that the waitress a plump blonde in her late twenties came by and began to put down the table settings how you doing this morning darling ronny neil asked just fine baby it was going to be one of those godawful polite exchanges full of empty endearments and somehow that infuriated me more than my near abduction only two i said to her i wont be staying yeah you will scott said no i wont get up and let me out of here dont mind him ronny neil said to the waitress i think hes forgotten what my good friend buck told him i shook my head scott get out of my way just sit and shut he said juth thit and thut ronny neil echoed i turned to the waitress this was a big and enormously dangerous gamble but i couldnt live with myself if i backed down now i was done with backing down at least for the moment call the police please i hardly wanted the cops around but i wasnt in meadowbrook grove so it was worth at least conjuring the idea of law enforcement her eyes narrowed you serious hon i nodded she nodded back now hold on ronny neil said he held his hands up in the air in the universal gesture of lighthearted surrender no need to get all threatening on me were just having some fun then to scott get your fat ass up cant you see hes trying to get out i pushed my way out and past scott avoiding eye contact with the waitress or any of the other bookmen i didnt know how they read this exchange and i didnt want to know instead i turned to ronny neil dont fuck with me i said it quietly and slowly maybe if it had been a movie something dark would have crossed his face he would have recognized hed gone too far and he would have winced pushed himself back into the padding of the booth that was the myth bullies are cowards and if you stand up to them theyll back down it was the most insidious of fables of course it was the lie that parents told their children because they liked to tell it to themselves it was an excuse to avoid the social awkwardness of getting involved of standing up for their kids of facing the bullies parents surely as frightening and unhinged as their issue ronny neil turned to scott and the two of them snickered i guess well just see you later then ronny neil said inside the waffle house everything had been cold with airconditioning and vibrant with energy there had been loud conversations music the sizzle of the grill the ring of the cash register the clink of coins dropped on a table for tips outside the world was hot and still and sticky i trembled in tight little spasms fight or flight pounding through my system but it had suddenly become distant as though the conflict with ronny neil and scott then telling the waitress to call the police were a vague memory or a story i made up there would be consequences i knew it i knew that my situation had grown almost inconceivably dangerous this was no longer a matter of boys calling one another names or the occasional fingers flicked hotly against earlobes this was deadly and dangerous anything could come at any time and from anywhere i squinted across the parking lot and saw chitra making her way toward the restaurant she walked with her head down slightly slouched and her gait tended to be a bit shambling it was quite possibly unsexy but i found it remarkably endearing and therefore utterly sexy funny how that worked she caught my eye and smiled oh youve eaten already i was sure she was looking for company and i might have been as acceptable a companion as any of a dozen others or i was nearly sure because melford had said shed thought i was cute no i said theres an ihop about a quarter mile up the road lets go there whats wrong with the waffle house i cant believe thats a serious question i said with a forced grin i didnt want to tell her about scott and ronny neil i didnt want to look weak in front of her and i didnt want to have to explain what it was all about i didnt know what it was all about chitra didnt actually say that she wanted to go down the road but somehow we were walking there keeping to the ragged side of the street trying not to stray too much into the weeds unless a car or a mammoth truck came barreling past every ten paces or so i would sneak a look at her profile angular and dark and breathtakingly beautiful a couple of times she caught me gave me a half grin and then looked away i didnt know how to take it but i had a feeling that maybe those little half grins would be enough to get me through this mess inside the restaurant which smelled deeply of maple syrup we sat down and watched our waitress place before us coffee in thick white cups with droplets spilled over the side it felt like permission to start talking in earnest i didnt know what i had to say this is the first time weve been alone since last week chitra said that sounded promising i guess it is think of something clever something witty and seductive and disarming it presents all kinds of opportunities her eyes narrowed such as had i gone too far had i been cheeky too suggestive i needed to make a quick recovery for conversation i mean not to be critical of anyone but youre not like the other book people neither are you how do you mean i asked how do you mean she smiled slyly at her coffee cup my cheeks burned you just seem you know more together than a lot of the others youre going to a womens college and all she gave me a look of pleasant surprise id scored a point thanks to melfords sensitivity training i expect it will be a friendlier place for me than the world of book sales she said ill bet you know i never asked you how does someone like you end up here she shrugged maybe not very comfortable with the question summer came around and i needed extra money and more than i could make working at a store in the mall i know how that goes i had already told her about my quest to raise money for columbia i wish i could have taken a year off like you my father owns a drycleaning business and he had a problem with his crooked landlord and that ended up with my father having some debts but he refuses to let me offer him any money from my college account so im trying to earn extra cash and take the burden off them i laughed i have the opposite problem my parents have the money but they wont give it to me well believe me i have problems of my own with my parents they think im far too american they hate the way i dress the music i listen to my friends my boyfriend i took a casual sip of my coffee and forced a smile that must have looked grotesque i felt like i was trying to get the corners of my mouth to touch each other somewhere behind my head yeah i somehow managed her eyebrows knit together exboyfriend really mostly anyhow people in my family are pretty good about getting you know feelings about people my father had a feeling about todd my boyfriend exboyfriend i said mostly she gave me one of those sly sideways looks right exboyfriend try telling him that things in that department havent been so smooth anyhow my father was sure that todd was bad news and he wouldnt let up about it you said those feelings run in your family didnt you have a feeling about todd yes she said i did but you had a different feeling no i also had a feeling he was bad news but sometimes a girl likes a little of that maybe she said in your own way youre sort of bad news too lem the waitress arrived just in time to keep me from trying to figure out what the hell she was talking about i could instead occupy myself with figuring out what to eat for breakfast it occurred to me that i didnt really know how to order breakfast not if i was going to be a vegetarian and when had i decided to become one i didnt even know but it seemed to me odd now to think of eating meat and i figured it might be best to hold off until i had a chance to think things through a little more so i ordered oatmeal to play it safe and i asked the waitress to keep milk and butter out of it chitra ordered a cheese omelet are you a vegetarian she asked once the waitress had gone i dont know why but i blushed given her discussion of her attraction to guys who were bad news a category to which i now inexplicably belonged i didnt know why my possible vegetarianism was so touchy but it seemed to be sort of maybe im pretty new to it but my friend melford who you met hes been trying to talk me into it and i guess once you hear certain things about how animals are treated its hard to go back to pretending you dont know then dont tell me she said i enjoy chicken too much maybe i looked disappointed because she smiled at me and shrugged how long have you been a vegetarian not long i said how long is not long since last night she laughed anything special happen last night you didnt meet a nice vegetarian girl did you and there i was thinking i couldnt get more nervous not really i mean no no girls i was just talking to melford and he has all these arguments theyre very convincing so is melford chitra observed i didnt talk to him long but i could tell hes very charismatic you get to talking to him and you feel like youve known him a long time and its easy to open up i said some things to him and maybe i should have kept quiet like finding me cute i thought in fact i almost said it but i caught myself in time i wanted her to like me not to see how clever i could be at her expense yeah hes charismatic how long have you known him not that long i said longer than youve been a vegetarian i hope a bit longer i said trying to sound playfully casual but hating the half lie hes very likable she said but to be honest i sort of didnt like him anyway i mean i did but i didnt trust him i dont know i dont want to be down on your friends or anything but if you dont know him that well i thought maybe you might want to be careful because the truth is as far as feelings about people go i had one about melford oh my casual oh i had a feeling that hes bad news himself but in a real way not like with todd who could end up in jail as easily as community college or with you in your interesting kind of messedup way i mean real bad news there was so much to say really that i hardly knew where to begin her sortofexboyfriend who might end up in jail did i ask why how precisely was i interesting and messed up beyond all that she had pegged melford did she have these vibes like oh maybe he might have just killed some people what does that mean exactly real bad news she held up her hands im sorry i said anything its not my business i worry is all i couldnt help but smile she was worried about me i picked up a packet of sugar and began to tug lightly on the opposing corners since were talking about trust i said theres something ive been meaning to bring up oh she leaned forward and her large eyes grew larger she liked me she had to like me she was flirting with me wasnt she the thing is i began i tugged on the sugar packet again this time almost hard enough to rip it and send sugar sprawling over the table that would be bad the thing is i kind of get the feeling that ronny neil is interested in you ronny neil cramer she said wistfully she put a hand to her chin and let her eyes roll upward in delight chitra cramer mrs ronny neil cramer what colors do you think for my bridesmaids youre teasing me i observed can you seriously think that i would need to be warned off a fellow like that i dont know i figured you know youre not american and hes such an american type he might not be as obvious to you as he is to me mmm she said have i offended you she said nothing for a moment then a massive dazzling smile white against the vibrant red of her lips no not at all i only wanted to make you squirm a bit on the way back to the motel chitra kept glancing over at me and grinning in a way that felt absolutely wicked it was driving me crazy in virtually every way what exactly is so funny i finally said i grew up in a family of lapsed hindus she said my parents arent religious and we ate fish and chicken but never red meat out of habit i suppose ive never had a hamburger youre kidding no ive never had one do you think i should well they taste good but as a new vegetarian i cant really endorse a move like that you know what she was now twirling a little strand of hair above her right ear her ears were unusually small i think we should go out for hamburgers except that im a vegetarian youre forgetting that part ive never had one and youre not supposed to have them thats what will make it fun dont you find the forbidden exciting i could think of no way to tell her that id had enough of the forbidden in the last twentyfour hours to last me some time hamburgers arent forbidden to me ive given them up well now youre challenging me arent you im going to make it my mission to cause you to lapse i have pretty good willpower well see what does that mean it means that everyone has a breaking point not me i told her once i decide to do something thats it oh suppose i offered to sleep with you if you eat a hamburger i stopped in my tracks she let out a laugh playful and strangely innocent im not actually offering to sleep with you she said not stopping so that i had to dart to catch up im just making a point you think you have an iron will but well see youre assuming i want to sleep with you i had no idea why i would say such a thing but i felt exposed i suppose i am she said i had no response and we walked for a moment in strained if amicable silence i decided it was time to change the subject and raise the question id wanted to ask it needed to seem casual relaxed so whats it like being in the gamblers crew she studied me as we walked why her voice was strangely flat no reason im just wondering i work for a nice guy but you work for the big boss i was wondering what it was like oh im sure its pretty much the same as anyone elses or maybe i havent been around long enough to know is he always like he is in the meetings you know so vibrant sometimes does he ever talk about his own boss there was a pause now a long one an unnaturally long one as if she were trying to think about how best to answer why are you asking me all of this im a curious guy well there are better things to be curious about like what like me she said and that pretty much killed my line of questioning chapter setting up a place to meet was the tricky part since the gambler didnt want to be seen with jim doe in public and he figured the feeling was mutual that meant that the police trailer and restaurant were out so more often than not they met in the gamblers motel room doe had complained about the arrangements finding them too gay but as hed been unable to come up with an acceptable alternative the arrangements had stuck now he sat in the gamblers room drinking a cup of dunkin donuts coffee with a little rebel yell splashed in for good measure it helped him to keep his head clear the gambler gazed at him looking in that highandmighty way that made doe want to stick his fist through the gamblers face doe saw how this was shaping up the dust had cleared all of does hard work was getting lost in the haze of greed and now that asshole was trying to figure out who was looking to rip him off and how youre still walking funny the gambler said you should see a doctor about that i just pulled something moving the bodies you were walking funny before we got to the bodies if youre having leg pain or something you shouldnt ignore it have a doctor check it out doe didnt need this bullshit it aint nothing jesus i got enough problems without you trying to be my mother okay fine im just saying to see a doctor is all he paused for a minute to recover his momentum i talked to the kid yeah doe asked what he have to say fuckall they were going to buy but balked at the last minute what i dont get is why would they invite him in let him sit there for three hours pretend they had kids karen has kids doe said had them anyways from her first husband little smartass fucker named fred george if you can believe that two first names worked for the bank and seemed to think that was some sort of big deal something everyone ought to just marvel at like being a pro football player or something he took off and grabbed the kids when karen first started doing meth why would she pretend she wanted to buy encyclopedias she didnt know about the arrangement with me did she doe didnt know the answer but he knew that the gambler thought he knew the answer thought he was being clever getting the best of the conversation i dont fucking know gamb i dont think she did and as for why i cant guess what went on in her head i dont know what she was doing there with bastard maybe he was looking to rip us off you know maybe he had a plan to stash the money there maybe he was doing a deal with that money and it went bad could be a lot of things kid said something else yeah he took a sip of the coffee it could have used more yell said he saw you hanging around outside he dont know me hows he gonna say he saw me the gambler clucked his lips impatiently he gave a description that matched you handsome guy the gambler stared what thats a description that would point you right to me handsome guy fucking hell doe is this all a big joke to you we got dead bodies piled up to our dicks weve got missing money and ive got bb on my case bb is always on your case yeah well he isnt always on my case so much that hes even as we speak in a car on his way here to find out where the fuck his money is doe felt himself blanching jesus he isnt bringing that freaky cunt is he he brings desiree everywhere and since hes coming here i guess hes bringing her makes sense dont you think that girl is weird and that scar is nasty but you ever think shes also kind of you know sexy like you wouldnt want to fuck her but if she came up to you and was like come on lets go youd probably end up fucking her you know what i mean youre going to get fucked and not by desiree if you dont start working with me doe stood up wait a second there gamb i dont much like the way youre talking are you blaming me for something the gambler kept his expression blank im just trying to find out why bastard was acting so weird letting one of my bookmen pitch him for three hours and im trying to figure out why you were skulking outside the house the whole time i saw the kid on the street gave him some lip thats all i dont fucking know why bastard would invite him in maybe it was all a big joke to him you want to hear my theory doe didnt especially want to hear his theory but he figured hed have to listen to it if he protested or not so there was no point in griping he sat back down my theory the gambler said is that bastard invited the kid in because he was scared that something was going to happen to him and he thought he needed a witness since you were slinking around outside its going to look to some people like he was afraid of you and since you and he seemed to be fucking the same crankhead and he ends up dead with our money missing its going to look to some people like you killed him and you took his money doe slapped his coffee cup down spilling it on the particleboard table you want to tell me which people exactly are going to see it that way bb the gambler said and if you dont find that money you are going to be in some deep shit my friend that took some of the anger out of doe it was true enough the gambler was a smug old fucker but he knew how to call it if bb was coming to check on the money it meant he didnt believe that doe could handle the situation if the money didnt show up the arrangement could be in trouble still it didnt seem inevitable that bb would blame doe all this business about how people were going to see things was crap the gambler was going to make sure that bb saw it a certain way to cover his own ass the fact was doe could come up with the money himself if he had to it would mean a trip over to the caymans and it would hurt but he could do it he had to admit the money had been lost on his watch still hed only consider that option when all others were exhausted so what do you think happened to it he asked i dont fucking know the gambler said it beats the shit out of me but youd better find out yeah doe said he finished his coffee and set down the cup leaving it in a film of spillage on top of the table with all the weight the gambler was putting on him doe was starting to think that maybe the gambler had the money himself maybe hed killed bastard and karen and taken the cash doe had never seen the gambler kill anyone but hed seen him beat the shit out of some crankheads trying to rip them off it might well be that hed gone over to see bastard on some ordinary business things had gotten out of control and the next thing you know bastard and karen are dead now he was either trying to cover his tracks or find some way to take advantage of the situation it was possible that the gambler was setting him up not just in case but setting him up period and that meant doe was going to have to do some clever thinking to get out of this once doe had left the room bb came out of the bathroom where hed been hiding in the tub behind a tan shower curtain streaked with a milky way of mildew now he walked into the room and took a seat at the foot of the bed he dusted off his linen suit and flattened out his pants as he walked bb sat in the armchair but shot up almost at once the chair is wet he said its just water the gambler said i spilled some ice last night you saw i was going to sit in a wet chair and you didnt say anything jesus i spilled the water last night i forgot about it bb went into the bathroom and got a hand towel which he dabbed repeatedly against his ass hed always been a little off but this was how it had been going lately fussing over his clothes his hair and his shoes like a woman obsessing over the smallest and strangest details of the operation having his crazy scarred bikini girl do all the important work lately hed been distracted as though the business were taking him away from something more important that morning while theyd been waiting for doe to show up after agreeing that bb would hide in the bathroom hed wandered off without telling the gambler where he was going and when hed be back next thing you know theres no bb the gambler had stuck his head out the door and seen him on the balcony staring at a couple of shirtless boys by the pool if doe had come by the plan would have been shot to hell not that the gambler cared if bb wanted to go around fucking boys or chickens or accident fatalities that was his problem but dont forget youre running a business that was the thing you took care of business first and you kept your eye on the ball it was at that moment when he saw bb leaning against the rail leering at a couple of boys like a drunk in a strip club that the gambler knew he couldnt let things go on this way for everyones good the only problem was that he had no idea how to take over this wasnt the godfather he couldnt have his boys whack bbs boys there were no boys to speak of and no whacking their operation didnt work that way they kept it lowkey what with the encyclopedia front and the hog lot front now bb was staring at him slightly red in his smooth babyish face wiping at his ass as though hed just taken a shit next time be a little more mindful sure fine whatever the gambler held up his hands in surrender im sorry you sat in my wet chair lets move on bb tossed the towel on the gamblers bed i just dont like to sit in wet things lets move on pressing a hand to the corner of the bed testing for hidden wetness bb considered for a moment and then sat very carefully as though the bed might turn into a fountain if he werent careful those two kids by the pool you know them why would i know anything about kids by the pool they looked i dont know familiar or something you seen them with their parents what does it matter you know i run a charity for neglected young men im just wondering if they need help you see them with their parents you let me know what the parents are like okay fine but can we get back to doe what did you think bb shook his head i think the guy is full of shit but that doesnt mean he took the money then what does it mean mostly it means that hes full of shit but he knows hed better come up with the money im glad that desiree wasnt with me to hear what he had to say she doesnt like that kind of talk he mouths off like that in front of her ill kill him somebody might have to kill him the gambler didnt know if it was true or not even if doe had taken the money he was still essential to keeping the jacksonville operation alive and the gambler knew that he himself was necessary for keeping the book operation running smoothly the only person who didnt pull his weight it seemed was bb bb glared at the gambler youre awful quick with the violence arent you im just saying im the one who just says okay remember that what im not allowed to make suggestions make good ones and youll be allowed christ youre touchy today lets forget it he looked out the window you think having desiree follow the kid is worthwhile no its a waste of time thats why im having her do it the gambler shook his head okay bb whatever you say thats right whatever i say the gambler didnt answer there was no response that didnt involve kicking the crap out of him back in his room bb sat on the side of the bed and picked up the phone he dialed the number he had memorized but not yet called until now for an instant he felt the hammering in his chest might be the sign of something serious he might look like a young man but he was in his fifties and people his age seemingly healthy people his age dropped dead from heart problems all the time it was only nerves odd he should feel so nervous like a kid asking a girl out on a date he was just calling thats all he heard the click of an answer and he prepared to hang up until a familiar voice spoke hello chuck bb said yeah its bb oh he said with cheer wonderful heartening cheer hi hi bb said he was silent for a minute while he gathered his thoughts listen i was just calling to tell you that i you know had a good time with you last night he hoped it didnt sound stupid yeah it was fun chuck said the food was good and the wine yeah i didnt tell my mom about that but it was good too maybe youd like to try some more bb said that would be neat i have a nice collection at my house okay the boy sounded hesitant did he not like the idea of being invited over or did he not know exactly what having a wine collection meant maybe youd like to come over sometime next week see the collection sample a few choice bottles that would be cool thanks bb he felt himself suck in a breath chuck wanted to come over he wanted to drink wine with him desiree wouldnt like it she would think he was up to something bb would deal with that later because chuck was a special boy maybe the most special boy hed come across and there was much to teach him and show him that was what it meant to be a mentor in the distance he heard chucks mother call his name in her shrill gnome voice listen bb said i have to go but stop by the foundation early next week and well set up a time hed have desiree out on a wild goose chase that afternoon something that sounds great ill see you later bb he hung up the phone and shook his head against the power of it all here it was the boy bb had always known was out there the one he could show things and educate and enlighten and together they could tell the world to fuck off with their narrowminded suspicions maybe everything was changing maybe it was time to move on hand the business over to desiree shed been overwhelmed by the idea of course but he only needed to help her gain the confidence that would get her out of the house certainly there was one last thing however he couldnt hand things over to desiree with the gambler still running the operation desiree wouldnt be the new bb she would be the new gambler only with more responsibility and that meant it was finally time hed kept the gambler around long enough savoring the opportunity enjoying the feeling of toying with him now it was time to get rid of him that he had no idea how he would do such a thing bothered him hardly at all chapter i sat gloomily in the car while bobby drove us around getting us pumped up for the selling day he would point at moochie houses point at lawn furniture and slip n slides and volleyball nets finally he let me out at a little after eleven he would come by the kwick stop to get me in about twelve hours there had been times when i enjoyed it this feeling of the day being all before me every house a potential sale a potential some days the unanswered knocks with the low barking behind thin metal doors didnt even bother me some days i all but smirked at the people who stared at me blankly as i went through my introductory speech and i judged them i judged them for their apathy thats why you live in this shithole thats why your kids will live in a trailer just like you when they grow up because you dont care not that the encyclopedias mattered sure it was possible that theyd make a difference in someones life but if a kid wanted to know some detail about the population of togo or the history of metallurgy hed find out at school or in the library on the other hand the parents willingness to buy the books to invest the money signaled something and there were times when i actually believed in the importance of the work not this morning i skipped houses if they didnt look moochie i knocked listlessly mumbled my lines half an hour into the day id had a smallish woman pretty but ferociously freckled just about primed she was ready to bite i could feel it but i eased up on the pitch excusing myself from going inside i knew that my days as a bookman were over id go back to ft lauderdale on sunday night and id quit and the thought of my impending freedom both excited and enervated me what would i do with the rest of my day if only there were a movie theater around here a good bookstore a library a mall someplace i could go to cool off but for twelve hours suddenly the day stretched out endlessly the heat hammered down on me and i felt the sting of perspiration in my eyes the endless expanse of time blanketed me smothered me like the humidity i wished i could gear myself up into book mode just for the next couple of days id still quit id still walk away from this and never come back by twelvethirty i was walking along a main road not even bothering to look at the houses i passed when i heard a car slowing down behind me i turned and saw melfords old datsun a faded dark green in the sunlight he rolled down the window hop in i continued walking with melford keeping up with his slow pace i dont think so come on what are you going to kick rocks all day ive got airconditioning tunes witty conversation i told myself that i had no choice that the guy was a killer and a person was smart to do what a killer said to do but id stopped being afraid of melford not entirely maybe i wouldnt want to provoke him or even be around him when someone else had provoked him but for all his killing he wasnt like ronny neil and scott whom i actually feared i sighed and nodded so melford stopped i went around to the passenger side and got in he did have the air conditioner going pretty strongly and it felt good we sat in silence for a few minutes while melford drove past houses and mobile homes and a shopping plaza with a kmart and a sporting goods store and an italian restaurant coming out of the kmart i was sure was galen edwine the man at whose house id sold the grand slam that didnt work out not so far from where id been selling the day before in fact melford saw me looking at the strip mall god i love florida he said youre kidding i hate this place i cant wait to get out of here i think youre the kidder this is the land without art or values or even the most basic cultural orientation nothing matters but real estate and shopping malls there are more golf courses than schools prefab housing subdivisions growing like cancers an aging and dangerous driving population the klan drug lords hurricanes and twelvemonth summers those sound like bad things to me he shook his head in florida you get to live in perpetual irony it keeps you from settling into false consciousness i just want to get out and never come back i said well theres that position too i guess we rode in silence for another ten minutes until i asked where we were going youll see i want to know now while i might have felt a strange liking for melford despite all i had seen i couldnt stand this i couldnt stand being boxed out and left in the dark youre awful curious arent you i just dont want to be shot in the head or anything i regretted it the instant i said it not because i had endangered myself but because it seemed to hurt melfords feelings his eyes narrowed and he looked away surely by now you realize i dont solve all of my problems with violence he told me violence is a tool its like a hammer it has its uses and it is great for those uses but if you use a hammer to change a babys diaper theres going to be trouble i chose to use violence with those two because i thought it was the right thing to do okay i said i understand i didnt and it was clear from my tone that i didnt melford shook his head i dont enjoy hurting anyone lemuel i only do it when theres no choice but you wont tell me why ill tell you why when you can tell me why we have prisons i dont have the energy for your prison riddle i want to know why and i want to tell you but until youre ready theres no point it would be like telling a fouryearold about relativity there may be a will to understand but not a capacity i thought to blurt out something defensive like he thought i was no smarter than a fouryearold but i knew that wasnt what he meant for now melford was saying whats important is that were in this together you are in serious trouble my friend we both are there is dangerous stuff going on around here and weve had the bad luck to land in the middle of it but i dont have anything to do with it its not my fault thats right its not your fault and if your house was hit by lightning and started to burn that wouldnt be your fault either so do you stand there and shout at the flames or do you do what you can to save yourself and put out the fire i didnt have an answer because he was just convincing enough to piss me off melford stopped outside a chinese restaurant and announced that it was time for lunch i was reasonably hungry not having eaten much of my breakfast the dairyfree oatmeal had tasted like elmers glue and id been too nervous about talking to chitra to try to force it down chinese restaurants are great for vegetarians he told me as we sat at a table in the smallish dining room lined with red wallpaper flocked with gold buddhas there were an additional two buddha statues by the door a tank full of white and orange koi and a small fountain they tend to have lots of nonmeat options and they dont traditionally cook with dairy he poured tea into white cups with cracked enamel eating breakfast with chitra id been determined to abandon all animal products now here with melford i wanted to be a carnivore this morning id wanted to impress chitra with my sensitive soul now i wanted to impress melford with my defiance i needed to decide if i agreed with the principle or not if i wanted to be a vegetarian or if i just wanted to stay away from meat when i thought it might impress the ladies i looked at the menu what about fish melford raised an eyebrow what about them do you eat fish the sea bass with black bean sauce looks pretty good do i exclude fish from my moral calculus because they live in the water instead of land is that what youre asking me i think i get the answer i said but come on were talking about fish here not fluffy bunnies or bessie the cow theyre fish we put hooks in their mouths every day so cruelty justifies itself you of all people ought to know better than that what does that mean it means that when i came up to you with those two guys at the motel last night i had the feeling that it wasnt the first time some mindless assholes decided to turn you into a pincushion the fact that its happened before doesnt mean its okay for it to happen again the fact that were cruel to fish doesnt mean we should be cruel to them just because they live underwater and have scales instead of skin or fur doesnt make it okay i sighed fine when the waitress came i ordered the vegetable lo mein melford ordered vegetable dumplings im not especially hungry he said then why are we here melford shrugged mostly i wanted to see if the woman following us would come in with us what woman she was driving a mercedes and now shes at the table behind you dont turn around actually no need to bother since it looks like shes heading over here the woman came around and stood between us and looked us over as though deciding which of us she might choose to bring home she was pretty and tall dark blond shoulderlength hair rounded features that would have once been considered hyperfeminine and now seemed girlish as if to offset that effect she dressed to draw attention wearing tight pink jeans and a nearly translucent white blouse that exposed her black bra underneath you dont want to let him eat fish she was now looking over sunglasses at melford her eyebrows knit together why do you make him miserable about his lunch boss your friend around like that we were silent for a moment finally i ventured hes not really making me miserable hes giving you a hard time isnt he she then looked at melford are you a bully hes not a bully i said not sure why i should stand up for melford or defend him to this woman whoever she might be sometimes people are so bullied that they dont even know theyre being bullied she told me then she looked at melford isnt what people eat a matter for their own choice no said melford nothing but kindness in his voice when i said no it came out blunt and hostile and defensive he made it sound like an invitation whether or not to wear clothing that exposes our underwear is a matter of choice whether or not to apply lipstick or go to the movies or enter the goofy golf tournament are matters of choice when you do something that inflicts suffering on another then it becomes a moral question the woman looked at him in a way that seemed both sly and appraising you know what she said you just might be more interesting than i thought at first can i join you id be delighted melford said she sat down and angled her chair slightly toward melford and put her sunglasses in the breast pocket of her diaphanous blouse im desiree she said and as they shook melford glanced at a series of lines drawn on the back of her hand he gently kept hold of her fingers for a moment almost as if he were getting ready to kiss her hand hsieh he asked she nodded not bothering to hide her surprise thats right he let go of her hand are you considering making a break with the past she tried to look neutral i guess so me too he folded his hands so youre interested in becoming a vegetarian im not she told him i like eating what i eat im interested in why you care so much i care melford said because when we see something wrong we ought to try to make it right its not enough to silently condemn evil to congratulate ourselves for not participating i believe we all have an obligation to stand against it something darkened in her face at first i thought hed made her angry but then i realized i saw a pang of sadness maybe even confusion and doubt how exactly is this a matter of ethics animals are here for our use arent they so why shouldnt we use them melford picked up an empty teacup this was put here for our use right it was designed to make our lives better and all what if i were to hurl it across the room that would be considered an impolite act at best but also violent antisocial unkind and wasteful the cup is here for my use but im not free to use it in any way i see fit she shrugged sounds reasonable but not so reasonable that youll change how you eat melford said no not that reasonable he turned to me its interesting isnt it you convince someone that everything you say is right make them understand that eating animals is wrong but they still wont change ideology i asked you got it so what are you fellows up to today she asked oh you know this and that melford said she leaned a little closer to him can you be more specific he leaned closer too and it looked for an instant as though they might kiss can you maybe give me a reason why i ought to be more specific because she told him im a curious curious woman are you curious enough to wonder what it would be like to stop eating animals not that curious melford leaned back a few inches and then reached out to her hand and touched the black marks shed penned onto her flesh you can tell yourself that your actions alone and weighed against the balance of the universe dont matter but i think you know better how long can you wink at evil because it is easy and gratifying to do so youre better than that she pulled her hand away but not violently it looked to me more like embarrassment or surprise you dont know me you dont know anything about who i am melford offered the ghost of a smile maybe not but i have a hunch she said nothing for a minute she unwrapped a tube of disposable chopsticks separated them and tapped them together does it make you happy to crusade for animals he shook his head does helping the sick caring for the desperate make someone happy would giving comfort to lepers in the sudan make me happy i dont think so happiness isnt the issue these things make us feel balanced with the world around us and that is something much more important than happiness she nodded for a long time still tapping her chopsticks together then she dropped them as though theyd suddenly grown uncomfortably warm she stood up i have to go melford held out his hand for her to shake she looked surprised but she took it anyway you want to tell me who youre working for he asked why youre following us i cant right now she looked genuinely sad about it too okay he let go and she turned away but he wasnt entirely done with her you know he said youre much too smart to be working for them youre not like them she reddened slightly i know that hsieh melford said she looked at her hand and nodded chapter so who was she i dont know someone who works for them whoever they are i sat in the passenger side of melfords datsun id eaten the lo mein and put back five or six little cups of tea desirees little visit that afternoon had left me stunned but melford appeared unperturbed hed eaten his greentinted dumplings with splintery chopsticks and talked for a while about a philosopher named althusser and something called the ideological state apparatus only once we were back in the car did i try to talk about the woman doesnt it bother you that a strange person in peekaboo clothing is shadowing us peekaboo clothing isnt without its pleasures dont you think i noticed you inspecting the lace of her bra maybe you were thinking about buying a gift for chitra i hated the feeling of being caught i do have to admit it she seemed less scary and more i let my voice trail off sexy sure i agreed cautiously i didnt know that melford would be the worlds best judge of which women were sexy and which were not but still weve got someone following us what are we going to do about it nothing melford said shes not following us now and to be honest i dont think she means us any harm there are dead people floating all over the place i know you killed some of them but isnt it a bit naïve to assume they dont mean us harm i cant speak for they im sure they do mean us a whole truckload of harm but i dont think desiree does you could see it in her eyes she is straying from them she doesnt want to hurt us or even report back about us i have a feeling great you have a feeling fine its the best we have until we know who they are i thought about telling him what i knew that the gambler was involved but i hadnt told him last night and now it would look weird as though id been holding out on him and that maybe he ought not to trust me there would be a way i decided to steer him in that direction if it became necessary or to discover something that would point to the gambler in the meantime i felt safer with his not knowing even if it meant keeping a huge secret from a guy who was known to resolve his grievances from time to time with a silenced pistol so where are we off to now i asked youll recall that we have a task to do melford said we have to figure out who that third person was the body in the trailer what about the money theyre looking for a ton of cash maybe we should find out about that he shook his head forget the money its a dead end lets think about finding the body and tell me again how we do that the first thing we want to do is look at the body who knows maybe they were dumb enough to leave identification on her long shot i know but its worth trying sure i said thats a great idea poking around at a dead body looking for a wallet but and i may be being dense here shouldnt we know where the bodies are first it so happens smart guy that i have a pretty good guess where they put the bodies you catch that bad odor in the trailer park you know what that was the smell of trailers i dont know it was a hog lot lemuel the city of meadowbrook grove is mostly just that trailer park which raises the bulk of its revenue through speeding tickets behind it is a small factory farm that raises hogs intensive hog farming produces a ton of waste and that waste has to go somewhere that bad smell in the trailer park comes from the waste lagoon a nasty environmentally hazardous seething pit of pig piss pig shit and pig remains it also happens to be the single best place i can think of to hide bodies so thats where were off to and we just waltz onto this property and start digging around through pig crap and no one will mind is that it no one will be there theres no old macdonald theres no oink oink here and oink oink there the evil brilliance of these things is that they require virtually no maintenance just someone to stop by once a day to make sure the animals are fed how do you know that the guy who feeds them wont be there melford shrugged because i killed him yesterday i sucked in a breath i felt the painful jolt of realization is that why you killed bastard because he worked at a pig farm relax im nowhere near that arbitrary that had nothing to do with it i feel sorry for most of the employees at these places theyre exploited just like the animals are they earn low wages and labor for employers who neglect their health and safety theyre victims the owners deserve to die not the workers no this is a coincidence he paused thoughtfully sort of melford pulled off the main road and drove behind the trailer park then made a sharp right onto a dirt road that i might never have noticed even if id passed by a dozen or more times it cut through a dense wood of scraggly pine and wayward florida shrubs and white rock we followed this path for a good mile or so and all the while the thick stench of sulfur and ammonia became stronger until it felt as if someone had fashioned an ice pick out of bad smells and was shoving it into my sinuses we arrived at a fence and melford stopped the car hopped out and removed a key from his pocket which he used to open a padlock when he got back in the car he was still grinning where did you get the key i asked i have my methods back in the car and after a little more woodlined road we pulled out into a clearing and i could see in front of us a large flimsylooking building with no windows it was maybe two stories high and made out of what appeared to be aluminum sheets the thing vaguely resembled a warehouse but a nightmarish one all alone in the clearing like it was or maybe it resembled a prison i figured melford must be getting to me he parked behind some pines so it wouldnt be visible if someone happened by better safe than sorry melford explained and we got out and began to walk toward the building i thought it smelled bad in the car thought i was getting used to it but it grew stronger harsher the stench in front of us was like a physical weight in the air walking into it was like walking against the force of a wind tunnel how could anyone work here how could people stand to live nearby and the pigs themselves but i decided not to consider that i had bigger things to worry about and i was determined that melfords obsession would not become my own around the back of the warehouse the grass and brush faded into a thick black dirt from which sprigs of grass shot upward intermittently this beach extended maybe thirty feet and then the lagoon began abruptly so abruptly that i thought it must not only be manmade but concrete lined it was smaller than i imagined the word lagoon suggesting tropical excess lush green misting waterfalls flocks of shrill tropical birds exploding into flight waste lagoon turned out to be a euphemism and when your euphemism has the word waste in it youre starting from a pretty bad place i found not a lagoon but a ditch the worst most horrible ditch i could ever have imagined maybe three hundred feet in diameter nothing grew near except a scattering of the most ragged of weeds and the strangely miraculous exception of a single black mangrove tree whose gnarled roots looped in and out of the soil and into the lagoon i expected to get mud on my shoes as we approached but the dirt was as dry and crumbly as a moonscape with each step however the stench grew worse impossibly and exponentially worse the stink to my surprise seemed to possess mindaltering qualities my head grew light my steps unbalanced i held out my hands to keep my balance i kept my eye on the lagoon as though a monster might emerge to devour us at first i had thought it was a trick of the sunlight but the contents were not merely shaded they were brown it was a brown pond of viscous sludge that undulated its bloated waves against the slick shoreline pond is to waste lagoon i thought my mind lapsing into sat analogy as human being is to zombie a seething nimbus of insects hovered above buzzing with mutant menace melford stopped outside the perimeter marked by a series of metal rods around the pond linked by string with dayglo plastic ribbons that fluttered sickly in the mild breeze theyre probably in there he said gesturing toward the pond so thats a waste lagoon melford nodded that is all pig shit and pig piss melford nodded again they all this vile probably ive never seen one close up before i stared at him youve never seen one never its worse than i thought it would be bigger more impenetrable it looks like a good place to hide bodies i said so how do we find them melford shrugged we dont this was a stupid idea im sorry about the waste lagoon business he said it seemed like a reasonable plan when i came up with it i shrugged not quite sure what to say when a thoughtful assassin apologizes for the fact that his scheme to exhume the one body he didnt kill has ended up so badly toward the far side of the warehouse we approached a pair of large double doors imposingly sturdy against the rest of the building which close up looked as if it had been made from punched tin a massive padlock held the doors together next stop melford said he took out a key chain and opened the lock how do you get these keys i asked he shook his head without looking up from the lock lemuel lemuel lemuel have you not yet learned that melford is a man of wonders all doors yield to melford he pulled open a door hung the lock on the latch and gestured for me to enter i didnt want to go inside it was dark not pitch dark but gloomy the building had no windows and the only lights came from four or five naked bulbs that dangled from the ceiling they were interspersed with slowmoving fans which created a disorienting strobe effect turning the space into a nightmarish nightclub of the damned it smelled far worse than anything outside worse than the lagoon worse than a hundred lagoons it was a different smell mustier and muskier thicker and more alive a blast of cool air wafted from inside not cool really but cooler than the scorching temperature outside and there was the noise it was a low chorus of moans and grunts i had no idea how many pigs were in there but it had to be a great deal dozens hundreds i had no idea then melford took out his pocket flashlight and pointed it forward looking suddenly like virgil in a gustave doré illustration from the inferno i still couldnt see very well but i could see enough dozens and dozens of small pens were staggered from the entrance to the far end of the warehouse each pen could hold four or five animals comfortably contained fifteen possibly twenty i couldnt be certain because of how tightly they were packed i watched the pen where melford pointed his light one pig was trying to move from one end of the pen to the other as it pushed its way forward it created a space that another pig had to fill it was like a rubiks cube nothing went in or out and if one was going to move it had to trade spaces with another animal the floor was slotted to let their urine and feces pass through to a drainage system that would flush it to the lagoon but the slots were too big and the pigs hooves kept getting caught i saw one animal squeal as it yanked its leg free and then it squealed again even in the gloom the blood on its hoof was clearly visible i took the light from melfords hand and approached the nearest pen the pigs which had stood in a kind of trance of labored breathing woke at my approach and squealed they tried to push back away from me but there was nowhere for them go to so they squealed more fervently more shrilly i hated to frighten them but i needed to see what i thought id observed in the sporadic flashes of the strobing fans was now all too clear many of the pigs most perhaps had heavy red growths erupting from under their short hair ugly knotted red tumorish things that jutted with malevolent force like misshapen rock formations some of the growths were along their backs or sides and the pigs appeared to more or less ignore them others had them on their legs or near their hooves and so had trouble moving some had them on their faces near their eyes or on their snouts so they couldnt close their mouths or open them fully i backed off whats wrong with them i asked melford i mean holy shit it looks like a medical experiment or something it is in a way melford said with the clinical calm i was coming to expect of him but theyre not the test subjects we are no animals except maybe social insects were meant to live in such close quarters but the hog farmers pack them in because the closer you can get them the more hogs you have to raise in a single space its a matter of being costeffective but the pigs and lets forget about their pain and misery most of them are probably insane by this point anyhow but on a purely physiological level the pigs cant stand it their bodies cant take the physical stress and that makes them vulnerable to disease so they get pumped full of medicines not to make them healthy you understand but to allow them to survive their confinement and reach slaughter weight im talking about mammoth quantities of antibiotics i dont get it isnt there like an inspector or something who will say theyre too diseased for human consumption that would be the usda the same agency thats in charge of making sure that we dont eat diseased animals is also in charge of promoting the consumption of american meat its bad business to make meat safe and treat the animals humanely because that costs money if the meat costs too much well that makes voters unhappy so if an inspector actually gets it in his head to try to stop this craziness the farmers the guys they are supposed to regulate file complaints and next thing you know that inspector is reassigned or out of a job the result no one opens his mouth and sick animals get sent to the slaughterhouse where they are often dismembered while still alive the visibly diseased bits are cut off and their flesh steeped in antibiotics and growth hormones arrives on the dinner table so what are you saying that our food supply is tainted and no one knows but you lots of people know but people dont worry about it because they are told everything is fine but the statistics are staggering seventy percent of the antibiotics we use go into livestock meat and dairy animals that people end up consuming most of the population is walking around with low dosages of antibiotics in them allowing bacteria to evolve into antibioticresistant strains even if i didnt care how the animals are treated i would still have to worry about the plague thats coming to wipe us all out i dont believe it i said if it were really that dangerous then wouldnt someone do something about it things dont work that way money greases the wheels if there were a plague and it were linked back to factory farming then someone would do something about it until that happens too many people are making too much money our senators and representatives from farm states say that theres no evidence that intensive farming hurts anyone meanwhile theyre taking zillions of dollars of campaign contributions from these giant agribusinesses that destroy family farms and replace them with nazi monstrosities it cant be that bad i said its amazing youre like a walking poster child for ideology how can it not be that bad you are looking right at it it is that bad and if your own eyes dont convince you how can you ever be convinced of anything ever except what you already believe i had no answer look he continued even if you have no sympathy for the suffering of the animals even if youre too shortsighted to care about the longterm health risks of tainted meat then think about this there are consequences terrible human consequences soulcrushing consequences from being asked to not think about something as basic as our own survival because big corporations need to keep up their bottom lines it was a good point and i didnt have a response lets get out of here outside even in the midst of all that stench i didnt feel like moving we stood in the clearing while i stared at the building in numb disbelief imagine what youve just seen melford said only multiply it by millions billions it makes you wonder doesnt it makes me wonder what i asked my voice sounded hollow if it is ever ethical to sacrifice human life for the sake of animal life even in the face of what id witnessed i didnt hesitate no i said are you sure let me ask you something say you come upon a woman being raped the only way to save her from rape is to kill her attacker is killing him the right thing to do if i had no other choice of course why why is that morally acceptable because i value the right of a woman to escape rape over the right of a rapist to live good answer but what about the right of an animal to escape torture you dont value that right over the right of a torturer to achieve pleasure or profit no look what goes on in there is terrible melford i would never say otherwise but there is still a basic divide between people and animals because animals have a lesser sense of themselves thats right and what about a severely retarded person one who as far as we know is not any more aware than a monkey does he only have the rights of a monkey of course not hes still a human being and receives the rights thereof yes the umbrella that includes the imagined or the typical person must also include the lowest of us is that it yeah i said thats it but is that umbrella natural and right and just or is it just what we tell ourselves for our ethical and economic and sensual convenience why shouldnt that umbrella include all creatures who are capable of feelings and emotions if its wrong to torture a pig then its wrong to say that it is no longer wrong when its lucrative because we want valuable exports and cheap meat at the supermarket is insane ethics cannot be bound up with profit its like permitting contract killing while making murders of passion illegal is cruelty motivated by capital less evil than other kinds of cruelty i understand what youre saying but you cant convince me that theres no hierarchy animals might feel emotions but they dont write books or compose music we have imagination and creativity and that means human life is always more valuable than animal life always lets say theres a dog a heroic dog a dog who has saved the lives of countless people through acts of bravery maybe a firehouse dog who rescues babies from a fire and lets say there is a convict on death row one you know is guilty of horrible murders hes escaped on the eve of his execution and hes taken the dog hostage the next morning the authorities discover his hideout they know they can recapture him but in doing so the dog will surely be killed or they can have a sniper take out the convict and save the dogs life whats more important the convict who has killed numerous people and who would already be dead had he not escaped or the dog who has only done good come on its an extreme case i said agreed its the most extreme case i could devise on short notice now answer the question you save the man i told him not entirely convinced i believe it once you go down the road youre talking about its a slippery slope so human life no matter how evil must always take precedence over animal life no matter how exalted i shrugged playing at an apathy i didnt feel didnt come close to feeling the truth was i had no answer to his line of questioning and it bothered me if melford was right then there were no absolutes not like id always believed and it put me in an ethical free fall the example was extreme and i understood that was melfords point i wasnt willing to admit that you probably save the dog however since that meant that the question was no longer black and white but a matter of degree it wasnt if you value human life over animal but when and under what conditions i dont know can we go now yeah head over to the car i havent quite figured out how im going to save these pigs but in the meantime i need to feed and water them it will only take a few minutes you want help nah dont worry about it i did worry about it but i obeyed because with melford it was my lot to obey so i put my head down and shuffled toward the car trying to blank my mind trying to think of nothing at all rather than think about those pigs with their ugly red tumors and the hollow looks in their eyes i couldnt make my mind go blank though instead i thought of karen and bastard cold and dead and wideeyed when i was halfway to the car i looked up from my miserable reverie something must have attracted my attention and when i peered in the glaring afternoon with everything hazy from the sun blasting the land with ovenhot intensity i saw something that made me freeze with terror a cop car was pulling onto the grounds and pivoting right at me as if it were lining me up to run me over there could be no doubt whoever was behind the wheel had seen me i craned my neck in search of melford but there was no sign of him the cop probably hadnt seen him either as far as he knew i was there all alone i recognized the cop at once it was the guy from the dark ford outside bastard and karens trailer the guy who had helped the gambler move the body the police chief of meadowbrook grove chapter the cop stepped out of his car shut the door and leaned back against it if hed been a smoker hed have lit up the car was clean i noticed it right away it looked newly washed the kind of car you wouldnt mind leaning against he waved me over as if we were old friends and i obeyed the command i wanted to run figured i probably ought to run but i knew i wasnt ready for an instant metamorphosis from working teen to outlaw besides melford was nearby and i figured i was probably safer with him lurking somewhere around here than i would be running through the trees with a cop of pretty questionable ethics on my tail i walked over slowly trying to keep my head up to smile to look as though id done nothing wrong id learned that much from melford act like everything is cool and maybe everything will be cool of course melford was also willing to start shooting people in the head if things ended up leaning toward the not cool good afternoon officer i said well now the cop said if it aint the encyclopedia salesman you sell any encyclopedias to them pigs he grinned showing me his twisted teeth i recalled that i had never told the cop what id been selling i never thought to try i said i was getting out of the heat in those trees and sort of wandered around and came out here i was curious about what this place was the smell and all that so i thought id look around am i trespassing or something the cop jim doe by melfords account squinted at me he rubbed at his nose and his fingernail clawed for one unconscious instant at a hard booger encrusted at the tip of his nostril what the hell you doing wandering in the woods when youre supposed to be selling books your boss gonna like that its a long day i said i wanted to take some downtime before heading back on the road you can understand the value of resting a bit before hard work im sure officer i dont see how trespassing on a hog lot is downtime he said in fact it seems to me that what you were doing was breaking the law not a whole lot else besides either im sorry but i didnt see any signs telling me i couldnt be here i guess you didnt see that big yellow sign saying no trespassing did you didnt see that gate that keeps folks out i came through the woods i said not knowing if such a thing were possible anyhow i was just leaving i think you can understand my mistake cant you the sales technique didnt seem to be doing the trick id better look around to make sure you didnt fuck anything up then im going to take you to jail on trespassing charges he stepped toward me now turn around and face the car hold your hands behind your back i dont think this is really necessary i said my voice wavered as panic began to set in doe grabbed my shoulders digging into the flesh hard enough to bruise he twisted me around and shoved me into the side of the cruiser if i had not yanked my neck back my head would have slammed against the passengerside window and for a dizzying moment i thought i would fall down somehow i managed to maintain my balance but doe gave my head a shove and my nose hit the window hard the blood began to trickle out of one of my nostrils there was only a moment to process this pain before the next wave began doe slapped the cuffs down on my left wrist and then the right the cold clamping of metal cut into me and then a curious combination of sharp tearing pain and a growing numbness shot up my arms another claw on my shoulder and i was spinning around again to face doe these cuffs are too tight i gasped youre cutting off my circulation shut your fucking hole doe punched me in the stomach the air went out of me and i bent over and let out an oof but then straightened myself up vegetable lo mein churned in my stomach as much as it hurt i knew that doe had pulled his punch and i knew i didnt want to taste the real thing now doe said you cut out the bullshit and tell me what youre doing here i told you i said wincing at how feeble i sounded blood trickled out of my nose and into my mouth a whooshing noise roared in my ears you havent told me shit you keep showing up in the most fuckall places boy and your story about wandering onto this property aint going to convince me of nothing am i under arrest you aint that lucky doe opened the door to the backseat he shoved me inside making sure to knock my head against the roof on the way in youre going to sit in here while i go look around to see if i can tell what you were up to you better hope i dont find nothing either or you may be getting a better look at that there shithole he gestured toward the waste lagoon and then shoved the door shut i wasnt going to cry despite the watering of my eyes and the growing mass in my throat this wasnt kevin oswald from gym class knocking me hard in the locker room so i fell backward over the bench and smashed my head into teddy abbotts locker this was a cop clearly operating outside the law possibly guilty of murder who was intent on doing something really terrible to me i concentrated on licking away the salty blood that trickled slowly out of my nose and settled on my upper lip i tried to wiggle but it hurt too much and my hands felt like overfilled hotwater bottles ready to burst i wondered if the cuffs were going to do any permanent damage and i wondered if permanent damage was even something i needed to be concerned about just what were the chances that i would have the opportunity say ten years from now to rub my wrists and think that the old cuff injury was acting up again where the hell was melford surely he would take a little time off from tending to the livestock to come back to rescue me melford would not be intimidated by a little thing like going up against a policeman he had removed himself from the ideological state apparatus or so he claimed so he would have no compunction about sneaking up on a cop and bashing in his head thats what i was hoping because i also had to wonder if melford would take advantage of the opportunity and leave me holding the bag for everything that had happened i looked out the window and saw doe walking slowly legs wide like an oldtime cowboy toward the barn was melford still in there making clucking noises while casting hog chow to diseased pigs or was he at that moment planning a covert attack had he covered himself with leaves and twigs and taken a slow crawl along the ground so he could leap up and slit the cops throat i didnt want to be party to another murder particularly a policemans murder though i was now well convinced that doe was the kind of guy who needed killing the kind of person i would gladly sacrifice to save a dog of even moderate bravery i still had more significant qualms about murder than melford did i sure as hell didnt want to be a fugitive from a cop killing doe could be a baby raper but if he was killed every cop in the world would pursue the murderer with unceasing rage all of that became irrelevant because just then i saw another cop car coming down the dirt road and out of the thick of pine trees that meant melford was now outnumbered doe had backup and the cops back at their station knew about the call if something happened to these guys we would be worldclass fugitives then i noticed something about the second cop car it wasnt navy blue like does it was brown instead of city of meadowbrook grove along the side it had grove county sheriffs department i glanced over at jim doe who had also turned to look at the car and even from the distance i could see him mouth a single syllable it looked a lot like shit doe started powerwalking back to his car one arm swinging hard one hand pressed to the crown of his hat to keep it from falling off the brown sheriffs department car pulled directly in front of does and a woman came out dressed in an unflattering brown uniform it was hard to say what might have been flattering on her she wasnt ugly but she was stocky and rugged with a mannish build and a slightly flattenedlooking face her short walnutbrown hair was pulled back into a sensible ponytail the sort that wouldnt get in your face while hopping fences and darting into alleys in pursuit of bad guys she glanced at doe and then into the back of does car making eye contact with me for a moment she then reached into her own car to pull out her radio mike hold up there i could hear doe say though his voice was muted by the glass of the car with one hand still on his hat he speedwaddled toward her lets just hold up a second the woman put the mike back i suspected that it might have been a bad move but i wasnt about to start shouting or knocking on the window with my skull i couldnt even decide if the presence of this new potentially uncrooked cop was good news or bad news no need to call in nothing doe said slightly winded from his jog he offered a smile certainly meant to be friendly but it looked grotesque to me whats the hurry aimee she glanced at me i tried to plead with my eyes what the fuck is going on here i dont like it when a lady swears he told her what are you my minister i dont give a rats shit bag puss fuck tit what you like i want to know whats going on here got me a trespasser doe said thats all maybe more than one still got to check out the grounds and this here is meadowbrook groves jurisdiction not to mention my own personal property so if you dont mind staying out of our business i promise not to stick my nose in yours he unveiled another grin nope i wont stick nothing in your business she met his gaze jim you know perfectly well you cant order a county cop out of a municipality and if i think you might be up to something i can have a look around its a little something called probable cause a concept pretty wellknown among cops and let me tell you that sadlooking boy in your car licking the snotty blood off his face gives it to me doe turned away from her pressed one finger to his left nostril and blew out a wad of snot onto the ground you want to play hardball with me sugar what i want is to know whats going on so how about you stop jerking me around maybe you want to jerk me around a little before the county officer could speak doe let out an exasperated sigh and pointed toward the hog lot i came to check on my property and i happened to notice this suspiciouslooking fellow prowling around looking to break in i guess what should i have done called the police yeah she nodded thats what you should have done get him out of that car i dont much like the tone of your voice youre not going to like the tone of the county jail either get him out of there he put his hands on his hips what crawled up you is this because i forgot jennys birthday is that what this is about because if pam told you to give me a hard time about that why thats nothing but harassment is what that is i might file me a complaint you dont want to play it this way i dont understand why you folks at county dont have more respect for your fellow law enforcement officers from other jurisdictions we have plenty of respect for other law enforcement officers she told him we just dont respect you get him out of there now unless you want me to radio for backup because if that happens things are going to get ugly it got ugly the minute you showed your face doe mumbled he opened the door and yanked me out sending another wave of pain through my arms dont make me mad he whispered hardly more than a hot breath into my ear dont think for a second youre getting away with anything i know who you are boy the other cop gave me an appraising almost sympathetic onceover i couldnt figure out my move cops were no longer my friends but i had to believe that she would be a better bet than jim doe a better bet by a long stretch frankly at that moment i believed id be willing to face charges and trial and testify against melford if i could get away from jim doe maybe not very loyal but i hadnt seen melford running to my rescue and i wouldnt be involved in any of this if melford hadnt killed bastard and karen for reasons he still wasnt talking about jesus fucking christ swore the county cop looking at my bloodied nose i found him that way doe said she ignored him whats your name son she asked even though she was still in her twenties possibly even early twenties and had no business calling me son lem altick no point in lying when she could and certainly would pull my license what were you doing here i told her the same story id told doe about looking for shade and then just wandering around in the absence of no trespassing signs it found a more sympathetic audience with her perhaps because of the blood you resist the man in any way she gestured toward doe with her head no maam i explained myself like i did with you turn around she told me i did jesus fuck she whispered take those off of him now i got a right to handcuff a perp doe im going to count to three and if those cuffs arent off then youre going to be the perp here he grumbled but took out his keys and unlocked the cuffs getting in a few rough jerks while he fumbled to fit the key in the lock what a bullshit move putting them on too tight what did you knock his head against the door when you put him in the car too it had been a rhetorical question but i answered for doe yes maam he did punched me in the stomach too this fucker is lying doe said as the cuffs came off i felt a rush of pain as the blood began to flow it stung horribly and i winced as my eyes watered but i was determined to show nothing more than the wincing i kept my hands behind my back not wanting to see them until the pain dissipated it sure doesnt look that way jim im going to have to bring you up on charges but she didnt move she didnt go to cuff him instead she smiled thinly and stared at him waiting to see how he planned to take it is this because i wouldnt fuck you he asked is that what this is about its just that i dont like women without titties unless you have something useful to say that would make me view this matter in a better light im going to have to take you over to the station i didnt know i was going to say it until it came out i dont want to press charges the cop turned to me so fast i was surprised her hat stayed on her head why in hell not i shrugged i dont want any trouble i dont live near here and i wouldnt be able to come back for the trial or anything and i guess i was trespassing even if he got a little mean about it id just as soon forget the whole thing doe grinned at me as though we were coconspirators or something else as though he hadnt been appeased and this effort to get on his good side would only hurt me in the end still it was the right move best to let the whole thing disappear get the cops and the courts and maybe the media involved i might end up in jail way things were now it might just turn out okay it was a long shot but it was something to hope for you sure about that she asked i nodded she turned to doe this is your lucky day why dont you get on out of here why dont i get on out of here he asked scratching his head let me think about that one how about this because its my fucking land how about you get out of here do us both a favor and take a hike and let me be clear about something if anything happens to this boy jim anything at all im coming after you so i suggest you be careful i aint never seen a woman with such small titties he answered and then got into his car the engine came on with an angry growl and the car pulled out at about fifty miles an hour the county cop watched it go i ought to give him a speeding ticket she said see how he likes it the she looked over at me so what were you doing here just like i said i told her i was wandering i sort of plan to quit selling encyclopedias when i get home and i didnt have the energy to work today so i was walking along and i came here come on there must be more to it than that you smoking pot or something i dont care i just want to know i shook my head nothing like that i was walking is all she shook her head fine let me give you a ride i thought about the offer for a minute melford was back there somewhere but what had he done for me but hang me out to dry either he hadnt seen what was going on which showed he couldnt be trusted to watch my back or he had and decided not to help me either way i figured i ought to have no problem washing my hands of him for want of anyplace else to go to i asked her to give me a ride to the motel then i climbed into her car fully aware that sitting in a cop car front seat or back was just about the last place i wanted to be as we pulled out along the pinelined road and i caught a glimpse of jim does car hidden behind a few trees i knew taking the ride had been the smart move the cop officer toms according to her badge decided the silent treatment was the best way to go she handed me a tissue for my nose which had already stopped bleeding but i dabbed at it anyhow because it seemed the polite thing to do finally without turning to look at me though she might have given me a sidelong glance behind her mirrored sunglasses she said youre in some kind of trouble arent you not anymore yeah you are what makes you think that i tried to keep my voice steady because you were the victim of an asshole cops brutality and now youre happy to forget it ever happened in my experience only people who are afraid of the law are content to look the other way when a cop steps over the line i shrugged and then the lies started flowing id never been a saintly paragon of truth but i wasnt a habitual liar either still it was getting to be pretty easy im scared of the guy id rather he forgot i exist ive got nothing to gain by trying to beat him in some legal contest all i wanted was to get away from him which i did thanks to you whats he up to anyhow she had a distant tone in her voice i knew she wasnt talking to me so i didnt have to tell her that he was up to hiding dead bodies and searching for a whole bunch of money weve been trying to get a search warrant on that lot for months she told me but i think hes got connections at the courthouse the judges keep telling us theres no probable cause but i sure as hell dont think hes doing nothing more than raising hogs i was about to say something nondescript like i wouldnt know about that but i thought better of it instead i opted for a melfordian strategy well what do you think hes up to she turned her head but her eyes were invisible behind the glasses so her face was illegible to me why do you want to know im just making conversation with the nice police officer who rescued me good for you she said good for me what police officer mostly i get police woman like im angie dickinson or something true equality can only be achieved through gendersensitive language i told her she glanced at me again right you are id never seen a car drive away skeptically before but thats how officer toms did it one last dubious glance and she eased her cruiser away and there i was back at the motel it was a few minutes before two now and i didnt know what to do with myself then a remarkable idea occurred to me i could sleep i could go back to my room sleep for hours and then wake up in time to hoof it over to the kwick stop and claim to have blanked i could make the tedium of the day disappear get some sleep and remain hidden from rednecks crooked cops and compassionate assassins opportunities like that didnt come along every day i climbed the stairs to my room already full of sleepy satisfaction i passed lajwati lal sameens wife she wheeled her cleaning cart along the balcony her face impassive hard and lined but she smiled at me when i passed by giving her a little wave good afternoon mrs lal i said thinking myself enlightened because i cast a friendly greeting at an immigrant busy toiling over a strangers bed she nodded agreeably in my direction i hope youre staying out of trouble my stomach flipped what could she know trouble i said my voice a rasp my husband told me about those very wicked boys she said with a sympathetic smile i let out my breath he was great to help me oh yes he fancies himself a real hero with his cricket bat she said but i think he only wanted an excuse to teach those fellows a lesson i asked her to thank him again for me once inside my room i turned up the air conditioner and sat on the edge of the newly made bed the stillness the dark of the room with its reddish orange curtains drawn all of it felt too luxurious for words i would at last sleep after splashing water on my face and rubbing off the last of the blood i was happy to see i didnt look like someone who had been beaten up a little red but nothing more i lumbered over to the bed and lay down fully dressed arms stretched ready to fall asleep then i sat upright how could i afford to sleep when i was a potential murder suspect if i were arrested tried and convicted and had to spend the rest of my life in jail id spew curses at myself forever for having squandered this time time i could have used for for what exactly for trying to figure out what the hell was going on i supposed melford seemed absorbed by the mystery of the third dead body but that bothered me less than it did him i was more troubled by the gamblers involvement in all of this of course i knew about the gamblers involvement and melford did not best not to think about melford too much since for all i knew he was sitting in the back of jim does police car with a bloody nose and his hands cuffed tight behind his back i however was at the motel and the gambler was not it occurred to me that being here at the motel presented a golden opportunity i stood up and headed out of my room very slowly down the hall i saw lajwatis cleaning cart and no sign of lajwati herself i walked slowly along the balcony trying to look anything but furtive and probably failing miserably when i got to the cart i saw that luck was on my side or perhaps fate was simply setting me up for an even greater tumble there hanging on a hook on the side of the cart were the extra pass keys the ones ronny neil and scott had stolen in order to wreak havoc i could take one and lajwati would never notice or at the very least never suspect me i heard the sound of running water coming from the open room and when i peered in there was no sign of lajwati herself except for one small whitesneakered foot protruding from the bathroom she was in there scrubbing with the water running with a casual swipe i took one of the keys and kept on walking i went around to the side of the motel to the gamblers room there was no one around and no sign of lights on in the room to be safe i knocked and then ducked around the corner to watch but the door didnt open i went back looked both ways and stuck the key in the door it worked id been half hoping it wouldnt if the key had failed me i could tell myself id done my level best but the black bag operation simply wasnt in the cards now i had no choice but to go forward i sucked in my breath and pushed open the door and that was it id broken into the room of a dangerous criminal i couldnt imagine having done this twentyfour hours earlier but twentyfour hours earlier id been a different person living a different life i looked around the gamblers room lajwati had already cleaned here too which was good since it meant i didnt have to worry about her barging in it also meant that i didnt have to be paranoid about putting everything back exactly as i found it things would have been moved anyhow giving me the freedom to look around as i pleased but what was i looking for some clue to who the gambler really was why he would be involved in covering up a triple homicide his burgundy garment bag was entirely unpacked but i went through it anyway nothing he had a few shirts and pants hung up and a pile of dirty laundry shoved in the bottom of the closet i poked at it with my shoe in case his dirty underwear was meant to disguise something of consequence but a little shifting around revealed nothing i went through the drawers carefully lifting the undershirts tshirts briefs and socks but found nothing of interest there either nothing under the newspaper on the nightstand a whole lot of nothing in the bathroom i discovered the gambler used cheap disposable bic razors offbrand shaving cream and crest but i discovered little else except that he took three prescription medicines none of which id ever heard of this was turning out to be a big bust but then i saw it hiding in plain sight hell it was so obvious that it was a miracle i saw it at all right in the middle of the glass table toward the back of the room next to the clean ice bucket with fresh plastic liner his date book it would have everything in there it was one of those date books that was about as broad as a paperback novel and almost as long it had a little clasp and pockets on the inside and outside jackets the pages were disposable to be replaced each year and there were too many of them shoved into a small ring which made it hard to turn them as i flipped through i began to see that this wasnt the gold mine id been hoping for it was a barely legible scribble mine each spread of two pages represented one week and there was an entry for at least one day each week generally more the problem was that the entries didnt mean anything to me bill pancake somehow this tidbit didnt exactly clarify things then i noticed that one name appeared over and over again bb expect bb call pm get instructions bb bb am dennys this was surely something i thought i checked the back of the date book which had an alphabetized section for addresses it was pretty well maxed out so i concentrated on the bs but found nothing that looked right then i checked the front and back pockets overflowing with business cards anything i thought with the initials bb but nothing salesmen lawyers real estate agents doctors appointment cards it was all crap i was putting them back trying to remember the right order when one card grabbed my attention it read william gunn livestock wholesaler bobby had mentioned gunn as the owner of educational advantage media so what was with the livestock there was nothing else in the book to suggest that the grambler had anything to do with livestock jim doe however did then there was the name william gunn b b gunn i thought an inevitable nickname as inevitable as the gamblers i ran over to the desk took out a motel pad and pen and copied the information i put everything back carefully then did a quick runthrough to make sure all was as id found it nothing to do now but make a clean getaway and id be home free i parted the curtains slightly and looked out as best i could the angle left a lot of room for blind spots but i felt moderately comfortable that i could escape unseen so i opened the door and stepped into the light and heat as it turned out there had been a pretty serious blind spot standing fifteen feet down the balcony hands in his pockets was bobby chapter desiree stood by the pay phone running her neatly manicured but unpolished thumbnail along the receiver she really ought to have called in by now bb would be waiting hed be wondering and very likely worried he worried about her easily if she was half an hour late hed be a wreck when she got back she liked to think it was just need he needed her and if shed been killed in a car accident who was going to make his dinner but it was more than that in his own selfabsorbed way bb loved her she knew he did and that made it harder she hadnt been following the kid and his friend since the chinese restaurant why bother it was clear to her she wasnt going to tell bb anything aphrodite seemed to like them she had that feeling from her longdead twin and she especially liked the friend melford that just went to show that she and aphrodite were agreeing on things more often because desiree liked him too following them giving bb what he wanted would feel like a betrayal and that meant that in the end she was going to have to betray someone what melford had said about sitting by idly about winking at evil because it was easy to do so it had felt like he was talking about her like he knew about bb what he did what he was likely to do when the pretense of mentoring could no longer keep his desire caged like he knew how shed been helping bb peddle crank the same poison that had nearly killed her of course he didnt know he was talking about how he wanted to make the world safe for little lambs and piggies and that was sweet naïvely sweet shed been surrounded by the taint of crime and drugs and human destruction for so long now the thought of involving herself in something as kind and hapless as helping animals might be just what she needed bb might not bloody his hands directly but she knew and shed known all along that his little empire had left more than a little carnage lives ruined pain and suffering and death all in the service of meth that hed been kind to her might make it easier to sympathize to care to have feelings but it didnt mean that what he did was right or that she ought to help him hey there sweetness i like what youre wearing desiree looked over standing no more than three feet away was a wide man in his forties longish beard and hair jeans and boots of a biker he cradled a sixpack of old milwaukee under his arm you about done with that phone he asked her because i need to call my mama and tell her that im in love do i look like im your private peep show desiree said her voice was calm almost absent whoa there he said taking only half a step back he raised one hand defensively and flapped up the other since the arm was still primarily committed to holding the beer dont be so uptight baby cant a man tell you he thinks youre pretty she was out of the booth and facing him her switchblade out the blade extended before she even had time to think about it no she said he cant jesus all right he took another couple of steps back and gave a half shrug to tell anyone who might have witnessed the exchange that it didnt bother him desiree watched to make sure he was gone then she picked up the phone and started to dial the motel she hung up before it rang the time had come to sever ties with bb now not some point in the near future shed been guilty and complicit too long thats what their fight last month over the boy at the roadside had really been about shed been asked to draw a line for as long as shed been with him there had been a line somewhere on the horizon and now shed come to it stood over it and once you get there she thought you can see whats on the other side and you can see what youve left so far behind that its lost in the blur no more she had hardly exchanged more than a few sentences with him but she was sure that melford had come to tell her that things happened for a reason accidents were part of the order of things coincidence a manifestation of cosmic design it was time to move on and maybe she thought to make up for her mistakes too there had to be balance in the universe shed done harm and now she had to do good but what exactly hurt bbs business slow down his crank trade that didnt feel right bb was what he was and hed helped her she would have to find something else she would figure it out or maybe she could get some help for the second time that day bb picked up the phone with his heart pounding in his mind hed always imagined having a hand in the gamblers destruction but in the end he would almost certainly have to skip that why not turn things over to the mechanisms so readily available the ringing ended meadowbrook grove police it wasnt him chief doe bb barked in a staccato voice base and forceful entirely unlike his own hold on there was a brief pause this is the chief chief doe bb said in his disguised voice i am calling to warn you ken rogers the gambler is setting you up he had your meth cook killed to frame you he is out to get you and take over your cut for himself youve been warned yeah who is this someone who works with him bb said and why are you telling me this the question stumped bb why would someone tell doe because bb said deciding to stick to the truth the gamblers a fucking asshole who deserves what he gets cant argue with that logic doe said bb hung up the phone now things would follow their course doe was a ruthless bastard and he wouldnt hesitate to take out the gambler hed deny it to bbs face but that was okay in the vacuum desiree would step in and bb would be able to toast his success with chuck finn over a glass of médoc doe slowly hung up the phone who the heck was that pakken asked him a guy who was disguising his voice thats what i thought too pakken said whatd he want to tell me the gambler is going to fuck me over you think its true doe pushed himself down into his chair i dont think so i mean he would if he could but i dont think thats whats going on right now but ill tell you that whatever is going on it is highly fucked up because a disguised voice dont mean shit to me i recognized him chapter on the balcony standing in bobbys massive shadow i watched a wounded palmetto bug the size of an egg limp toward the gamblers door and force its way in through the crack im sure there was something very clever i might have said to bobby to defuse the situation to make it disappear in a puff of smoke but i didnt know those words bobby i said my voice felt heavy and stupid whats new what were you doing in there he asked me pointing to the gamblers room the words just tumbled out of my mouth the gambler asked me to get something for him why not bobby was already puzzled about my earlier meeting he continued to stare shouldnt you be out selling i shrugged youd think wouldnt you but you know the gambler and all anyhow what are you doing back here i just needed to get some tums he said absently my stomachs bothering me hope you feel better ill see you at the pickup later okay and i dashed off leaving him in what i hoped would be a state of such perplexity that he wouldnt say anything to the gambler before the end of the weekend back in my own room still shaken from my runin i stared at the information id copied down and tried to figure out what i was going to do with it then all at once i knew i took out the yellow pages and flipped through it in search of private investigators nothing but i was redirected to investigators there were perhaps two dozen listings but only three ads i wanted someone who had taken out an ad because i couldnt risk some smalltimer running a scam not the way i was planning on handling this after examining the ads i went with chris denton investigations the quarterpage ad featured the silhouette of a man crouching and taking a picture with a telephoto lens the text assured me that chris denton excelled in surveillance criminal investigations checkmates which i assumed had nothing to do with chess preemployment screening process serving employee fraud missing persons child custody evidence contested wills and loss prevention whatever that was more to the point he could do background checks and record retrieval which i guessed might be exactly what i wanted it was a local number so i didnt need my phone card yet it didnt seem like a good idea to me to talk in the room thereby leaving evidence of the call on my bill so i wrote the information on the same sheet of paper on which id copied everything from william gunns business card and headed outside id seen a phone booth behind the motel where the parking lot met the highway so i strolled over to the phone booth a shrill voice answered on the first ring denton here i was mouthing off to officer toms about gender equality and it had never occurred to me that chris denton might be a woman oh i said stupidly i thought you would be a man i am a man you asshole the voice shot back im a man who sounds like a woman okay everyone thinks im a woman on the phone can we move the fuck on yeah sure sorry dont sorry me douche just state your business okay can you do a background check on someone for me howd you get my number he asked from the ad in the phone book did the ad say i could do background checks sherlock it might have alluded to something like that then youve got your fucking answer dont you look im just finishing up some paperwork be at my office in an hour i cant i said im sort of in a tight spot and i need to do this over the phone you gonna shove my fee through the phone too ill give you a credit card number you can run it first if you like just to make sure everything is legit can i now he snorted thanks so fucking much for the permission okay give me what you have i read him the info off my piece of paper im looking for anything in the public domain about this guy does he have a criminal record are there any press articles about him that sort of thing fine denton said i need it pretty fast said the priest to the whore how fast today fast i said a brief pause i need four or five hours but a rush job will cost you two hundred it was more than i wanted to spend and certainly more than i wanted to put on my credit card i knew i was going to get it from andy even if i told him in advance gave him the money in advance which i wouldnt do since the last time i did that he claimed i hadnt given him anything when the bill came hed still give me a hard time tell me i was wasting his credit as though credit were like the elastic on a pair of briefs that could get stretched out but the money had to be spent so i read him the credit card information and hung up when i turned around melfords car was parked directly in front of the booth i hadnt seen him pull up howdy stranger he said through the rolleddown window the truth i was happy to see him clearly hed had no problems with doe and made a clean escape but that didnt mean i was ready for more adventures no thanks i told him weve been through this melford said with mock gravity lets cut to the place where you get in the car forget it i told him ive seen people killed ive broken into buildings ive been harassed and hurt by cops and nearly arrested and you know what the worst thing is you hung me out to dry melford you were going to let me go down for your crimes so if you think im getting back in that car with you youre crazy i hung you out to dry he asked lemuel i was right there every step of the way i wasnt going to let anything happen to you yeah what were you going to do about it who do you think called the sheriffs department in the first place he asked you think that nice lady cop just happened to show up i knew getting someone from the county cops would defuse the situation so i got them there id have put a bullet through jim does head if i had to but i was hoping to avoid it i thought youd want me to avoid it wow thats kind no ones ever refrained from killing a cop for me before look you were in a tight spot i dont deny it but were already in a tight spot you didnt choose to get into this and im sorry that youre in it but you are you are just going to have to accept that and when things got hairy i got you out didnt i you were in trouble and i fixed the situation right he grinned at me i did didnt i he did but i didnt quite want to admit it yet even though i was pleased maybe even delighted that i no longer had to believe melford had betrayed me the truth was the gambler and jim doe were looking at me now and theyd be looking at me regardless of whether or not i was spending time with melford going it alone just didnt make sense not when having melford around would actually keep me safer more out of frustration with myself than melford i kicked at the dirt and then walked around to the passenger side im not happy about this what can you do you can either watch the world come tumbling down on your ass or you can get the hell out of the way of the rubble keep the aphorisms coming theyre cheering me up melford studied me looked me up and down youre very cynical on the other hand youre also perfectly presentable all washed up blood off your face im glad to see youre ready to go go where to play detective chapter high noon was on the tv but bb didnt much feel like watching it he could remember once liking that movie thinking that gary cooper was cool and efficient bucking up to do what he had to do but now it seemed dull cooper was old compared with his earlier movies as tired and irrelevant as his character and as westerns went it didnt stack up against the really good ones now shane that was a movie feeling good about himself his future his phone call bb strolled over to the closet to examine himself in the fulllength mirror not out of vanity but to make sure his linen suit wasnt too wrinkled always the problem with linen wear it once and throw it in the trash desiree liked to say hed been keeping on his sunglasses even inside since calling doe but now he removed them the suit looked good and the black tshirt too crisp and right around his neck he hated a tshirt with a sagging neck the hair was okay a bit long in the back and thinning in the forehead but that was that the leather brown color was more real than nature herself he did a half turn to make sure his ass didnt look big when he moved he caught a glimpse of the phone on the nightstand the one on which hed placed his defining call to doe the one on which desiree hadnt called him where in the hell was she what was she doing now that his revenge against the gambler was in play he needed her to keep an eye on things make sure all went as he intended he supposed that maybe if the kid kept moving she might not have had a chance to check in yet but he didnt quite buy it nor did he believe that something had happened to her not desiree no she was punishing him she was still angry with him over that business with the boy all hed wanted was to help him give him a ride a good meal at the house and then get him to wherever he wanted to be how could it be that even desiree doubted his motives that even she saw something sinister where there was only kindness and what would she say about his wanting to taste wines with chuck finn he shook his head no his plan was perfect get rid of her by promoting her it would be a hard transition but hed live with having to pick up his own dry cleaning hell maybe he could give chuck a little parttime work as a valet everything was on the verge of falling apart and everything was on the verge of being fixed how ironic and how pleasant that it all hinged on doing to the gambler what he ought to have done two or three years ago just like that there he was only for a second back in his las vegas apartment falling back hard knocking his head against the wooden frame of his futon blood from a cut on his forehead dripping in his eyes blood from his nose dripping into his mouth above him broom handle brandished like a homeric warrior the gambler squinted in joyless intensity for too long hed held off on dealing with the gambler who now was making money enjoying power and oblivious to the fact that he lived by bbs grace no more of that doe would solve the problem and if he dug his own grave in doing so then bb could live with that something something bad had evaporated fled his body it had been weeks maybe months since hed felt this energetic bb replaced the sunglasses stepped outside the room and gave his eyes a minute to adjust to the blazing sun it was another scorcher today close to triple digits and humid enough for fish to swim through the air reflected light shot off the cars in the parking lot with one hand to his forehead he gazed across the courtyard and at the mostly empty pool this wasnt much of a vacation motel the guests were people who stopped for the night out of desperate fatigue still the owners a bunch of indians like more and more hotel owners these days optimistically kept the pool up waiting for that better class of clientele that would surely arrive when ganesha so ordained right now the only adult by the pool was an enormous woman in a lavender onepiece a year or two on either side of forty lying with shades over her eyes chewing gum smiling into the heat bb gave a slight sympathetic shake of his head the poor pathetic thing a baking seal with a bleached blond bob legs like condoms overfilled with curdled milk across the pool from her playing loudly were two boys hed seen before the two aimless neglected boys who if left to follow their sad course would lead empty disappointed lives these were boys he knew in need of mentoring part of him felt he ought not to be looking for new mentees he had chuck finn waiting for him at home after all but he was here and the boys were in need of a guiding adult presence it would be wrong selfish to fail to do what he could bb crossed the parking lot and shuffled over to the woman on the chaise longue and blocked her sun she lowered her sunglasses and squinted up he smiled his most ingratiating smile excuse the interruption he said but are those your boys of course they werent but bb knew the drill show her some respect and shed defer to his charitable impulses they bothering you too she wrinkled her nose as though she had to sneeze he shrugged im just wondering they aint mine she told him i wouldnt let my boys act that way if i had any i think theyre with their father and i saw him leave early this morning in his truck left them alone i guess he was kind of cute she added thoughtfully this was all good news no parent around to impose misguided values on the children no hypocritical guardian of right and wrong to impose the pinched morals that denied boys what they needed ill go talk to them bb told her brightly as though volunteering to do the dirty work ask them to quiet down kind of you an awkward pause i like your sunglasses he told her not able to think of anything else to say thanks ill let you get back to your sunning you bet though bb couldnt see her eyes he felt sure they were closed now and the gum chewing resumed with its lulling bovine rhythm he stayed a moment longer than necessary staring in trainwreck style at the folds of fat emerging from under her white suit her breasts were surprisingly small considering her magnitude it must be hard on a woman he thought to be so massive and not even have the bust to show for it still there were some men who found obese women attractive it was a funny world bb strolled over to the boys who were playing at the other end of the pool they splashed around the deep end but seemed capableenough swimmers they darted back and forth up and down while talking about a comic book character called daredevil from what bb could tell this daredevil was blind and so sounded like a lowrent sort of superhero how you young men doing today bb asked he sat on a chaise across from them and smiled a new smile the one that he knew neglected aimless boys boys in need of a role model found reassuring fine one said and the other echoed in mumble the older one who was probably about twelve was blond and tan and fit with firm pecs a flat stomach and tight little arm muscles his nose was a bit too long and too narrow for him to be truly handsome and he had a bit of a receding chin but he didnt look weak for it no with his trim lithe physique he wasnt the kind of young man who took crap from bullies the other boy much darker and covered with unsightly freckles was probably closer to nine he was thinner less graceful bb cracked his knuckles and leaned forward you like this blind superhero huh yeah said the blond kid daredevil its a shame bb observed the way they force that stuff on you you cant turn on kids programs anymore without seeing someone in a wheelchair or on crutches or missing an arm or doing sign language like a monkey and now theyre giving you blind superheroes they want you to look up to some blind gimp beating up on bad guys with his cane the blond kid didnt say anything the younger one said im sorry he said it very quietly and he held his head so far down that the water bubbled around his lips and the hulk bb said half the time hes a loser egghead and the other half hes a big green moron what the heck is that i dont know the little kid bubbled now superman bb said theres a superhero for you hes smart and strong and hes that way all the time he pretends to be a dweeb but thats only to put people off guard and batman you know why i like batman because hes really a regular guy he doesnt have any superpowers hes just a man who wants to do the right thing and uses the resources he has to help him do it and hes got robin to help him hes robins mentor i like the way they work together the way they learn from each other thats how it is between a mentor and the boys he helps theyre dc the blond kid said something twisted in his gut something ugly and mean and judgmental was now stomping toward him like an ogre what does that mean he felt his face grow hot were these kids calling him a queer we dont read dc comics the boy said we read marvel dc is you know stupid okay they werent calling him a queer just stupid well that was fine kids often had this notion that adults were somehow dorky or clueless he could live with that for now let them spend some time with him and theyd know better yeah bb asked so who else do you like i like wolverine the boy said defiantly i read mostly xmen thats great said bb who lamented a world in which kids read a comic book called the exmen what was going on exactly blind guys and transsexuals listen i was thinking about heading out to get some ice cream you boys like ice cream ice cream said the beautiful blond kid with an unmistakable note of caution in his voice a sort of who wants to know kind of tone the thing you had to remember though was that these were kids and they had thoughtless neglectful parents the sorts of parents who instilled fear in their kids because they couldnt be bothered to teach them how to distinguish between dangerous strangers and kind people who wanted only to help they knew adults often told them not to do things but they also knew that adults often had their heads up their asses the trick was to get them to see that the dont go off with strangers rule didnt apply here couldnt apply here not when this stranger had their best interests at heart once you broke down those barriers you were home free theres an ihop down the road i thought you boys might want to get an ice cream with me really the little kid asked what flavor were not supposed to the older boy said looking at his brother rather than bb our dad said we had to stay here and he says we shouldnt talk to strangers there it was regular as clockwork im sure your dad means that you shouldnt talk to bad men i cant imagine why he would have any problem with you talking to a nice man who wants to buy you ice cream anyhow my name is william everyone calls me bb and i work with young men like you every day im a mentor they didnt say anything were even staying at the same motel he continued im over in room one twentyone what are your names im pete and hes carl said the little one pete and carl well it looks like were not strangers anymore dont you think i want strawberry ice cream the little one said he nearly sang it too loud for bbs taste the last thing you wanted was a bunch of meddlers getting involved in what they didnt understand i dont like chocolate forget it his brother shook his head i can ask my dad when he gets back tonight tonight bb asked letting the judgment and incredulity seep into his voice caution was one thing but they were standing in their own way when was the next time they were going to meet someone who was willing to help them to make them feel important and special in control of their own destinies if not their lives at this moment you want to wait until tonight im going for ice cream now its hot and i want ice cream but i can wait a few minutes if you want to run upstairs and get changed how fast you think you can be ready five minutes the younger one said wow thats fast bb grinned you think the exmen could get ready that fast even faster the little kid shouted it was hard to keep a little triumph from creeping into his smile jesus he was on a roll i dont think we should go the older one said bb shook his head sadly well if your brother wants to go by himself thats okay too you sure you want to stay alone doubt stretched its shadow across his face his feet twirled anxiously in the water he bit his lip were not either of us going it was a question not a statement just because you dont want ice cream doesnt mean your brother shouldnt enjoy it i think its wrong to deny things to other people because you dont want them yourself thats what they call being selfish carl yeah his brother agreed i dont know he said again which was not exactly a yes but certainly a retreat from were neither of us going bb was gaining momentum he could feel it the thing here he knew was to go with the flow to keep it outside of his head if he thought too much about it if he concentrated too hard he would say the wrong thing and blow it stay in the zone whats going on here the sunbathing woman asked she now stood directly behind bb hands on her massive hips sunglasses propped on her head her exposed brown skin glistened with suntan oil glimpsing her over his own sunglasses he was struck by the prettiness of her eyes not that bb went for fat bossy cows but still there was no denying it they were stunningly green healthylawn green emerald green tropical fish green my goodness bb said those are the prettiest green eyes ive ever seen tell me something i dont know whats going on with you and these boys i was asking them to play quietly bb said so they wouldnt bother you anymore and ice cream the little one said dont forget the ice cream bb went pink as he looked at the woman i thought that if i bribed them with a little ice cream they might leave you alone youre sweet she said now why dont you get out of here before i call the cops bb took off his sunglasses entirely and met her gaze lady he said i am the cops hed tried this one before always worked like a charm better than telling someone he ran a charity that helped young men she wasnt going for it though lets see some id im off duty i dont have it on me well if you go and get it now she said youll have it ready by the time your fellow officers get here fine he said ill be right back see you in a minute boys bb walked breezily toward his room where he would have no choice but to hole up until the cow finished baking chapter melford had been driving in silence and i was paying him very little attention mostly i was trying to come up with ways to convince myself that my runin with bobby wouldnt end in disaster it was only once wed pulled into meadowbrook grove that i snapped out of my fog i stared at the trailers the ragged lawns the empty lots what the hell are you thinking we need to stay away from this place not go back to it your plan of avoidance sounds fine in theory but the truth is that we need to figure out what is going on and to do that we have to learn who that third body in the trailer was as near as i can tell the only lead we have is going to be what the neighbors can tell us so youre going to go into salesman mode only instead of selling worthless encyclopedias youre going to ask about bastard and karen and who might have been by to see them last night should i also ask them if theyve seen anyone who looks exactly like me fleeing the scene of the crime relax lemuel no one saw you if its so relaxing why dont you do it he shook his head me i stand out too much dig my crazy hair youve been in this neighborhood before besides youre the salesman this is your territory there was no way to fully express the degree to which i did not want to do this thing what if that cop drives by and notices me should i explain to him that its my territory while he punches me in the stomach it wont happen ill be keeping a lookout if anything goes wrong ill grab you and well take off youll be perfectly safe i then leveled my most compelling argument at least most compelling to me but i dont want to do it and i dont want us to get fucked lemuel but we very well may if we dont take charge of the situation believe me i dont like this any better than you do but jim doe is now on to you and whoever sent that woman we saw at lunch is on to you weve got to take action instead of sitting around and waiting for everything to catch up to us i knew he was right i hated it but melford was right there was no getting around this i couldnt simply recede and think that well maybe things might have been different if i hadnt gone to jail for multiple homicides i had to do this so what do i tell people i dont know but if you can convince people to spend a ton of cash on books they dont need or want how hard can it be to get them to gossip he had a point one more thing he told me its not going to happen but lets just say things go totally haywire shit i began lets say things go completely nuts he continued and you end up with doe again screw this i said im not going itll be fine im just giving you worstcase scenario advice if you end up with him and youre in some kind of danger hit him in the balls you think thatll hurt trust me smarty pants hes had some testicular distress recently so hes going to be extra sensitive give him you know a good smack to the nuts it should make all the difference and you know this how he smiled because a friend of mine recently had cause to smash him in the nuts he told me now enough with the questions get going it all felt too familiar hot covered with a slick of sweat the plankton coating of grime on my tongue standing at a door ready to knock the sickly smell of pig shit wafting through the air only this time i wasnt trying to make money i was trying to get information information wanted by an assassin not me i stood on the stoop of the trailer several doors down from bastard and karens id already had one noanswer two suspicious doors closed hastily in my face and one veiled threat from an exceptionally short and obese man in boxers and a sleeveless tshirt then there was number five the day before it had been dark and empty when id passed by this afternoon i could see lights on in the living room and hear the hum of the windowunit air conditioners a woman in her sixties opened the front door but refused to open the screen as though that would somehow protect her her hair dyed to the color of yellow grapefruit was cut short and permed into a dense jungle of cheerlessly fisted loops she wore thin sea green sweatpants and a university of florida tshirt on which a saucily agitated gator charged forward hi id like to ask you a couple of questions about your neighbor over there karen i dont want to buy nothing the woman told me im not selling anything maam i said noting how odd it felt to mean it this time i was hoping you could answer a couple of questions for me youd be willing to do that wouldnt you i told you i aint buying she said and began to shut the door part of me was content i might go back to melford and say that no one would talk to me then wed get into the datsun and cruise out of meadowbrook grove forever but that other part of me that niggling part knew that melford would send me right back out to another part of the trailer park this one maybe closer to where doe kept his police station so i said hold on a clever little lie occurred to me and i figured i had nothing to lose maam im really not selling anything im a private detective private detectives were on the brain after all following my conversation with chris denton so why not she looked at me this time more kindly really her eyes were wide with wonder yes maam it was incredible to me this being assertive business actually paid off like cannon she asked i nodded solemnly exactly like cannon not exactly well have to fatten you up first she opened wide the screen door her name was vivian and she sat me at a padded card table in her kitchen and served me a can of tab and supermarketbrand frosted oatmeal cookies that she daintily placed on a layer of paper towels there were pictures of poodles everywhere on the walls in frames on the counter i counted at least a dozen but there didnt seem to be a dog around though the place had the wet smell of dog hair oh that girl was always a slut vivian said thoughtfully just like her mother whores the two of them and into drugs too what sort of drugs i asked i wouldnt know that she said with a cluck of her tongue i hardly even know what people today take in my day we just drank you know the other things like reefer and such were for coons raccoons maam i asked she giggled and waved a hand at me as if we were old joking pals oh you stop what about the man she was seeing i ventured i liked the way it came out all tv and professional sounding are you familiar with him you mean that bastard fellow oh yes i didnt much care for him not a nice man you could tell by his name not a proper nickname i dont think thats right i agreed nice people have nicknames like scooter or chip thats right i heard he was into drugs too and i heard he was selling them with and then she stopped she stopped she looked around the trailer and she flipped at the metal ring on the top of her can of tab go on i urged it dont matter but she and her boyfriend were into drugs all right and thats why her husband took her kids away because she was hooked on something and they say she was letting that bastard fellow have his way with one of the girls maam i said evenly tell me more about the business with the drugs does this have anything at all to do with the police chief jim doe vivian looked down oh no not that i heard nothing of i got nothing bad to say about jim doe hes always been nice to all of us except for the smell that comes over from his pigs there hes done nothing but good here ill tell anyone that i dont want to make you uncomfortable just one more question i was beginning to feel my audience straining and i wanted to get out before i frightened her too much she shook her head i dont think so she said i think we done enough questions today i think maybe its time for you to go just one more i urged no she said her face had grown pale and her skin slack all right i stood up thanks for your time i really appreciate it im sorry if you feel like talking to me might get you in trouble with that policeman the woman said nothing i can promise you i continued i would never do or say anything to let him know youd helped me but the thing is if he knew you spoke to me he wouldnt have to know what you said would he i mean you might tell him that all you did was give me cookies and a drink and smile at my questions right thats right she said slowly thats all he would get from me if it came down to that though im sure it wouldnt so since im here and hes not going to find out anything about what was said there isnt anything wrong with answering just one more question is there i guess not she said youre absolutely right i told her as though this argument had been hers all along do you know if there was a woman in her forties or early fifties who might be a regular visitor at karens trailer vivian nodded probably her mother she said if it were anyone it would be her mother the whore she sometimes comes for a visit karen says she comes without calling just pops in without knocking like shes trying to catch her daughter at something that would probably be it theyre both whores she added thoughtfully okay i said thanks so much youre really going to help me crack my case it sounded pathetic but it seemed to soothe her well you can come back anytime if you just want to talk a polite young man like you im happy for the company ever since my rita went missing ive been so lonely my first thought was that there was another dead person in meadowbrook grove but something told me i was wrong your poodle i asked her eyes brightened do you know her she sounded as though we were at a party and she mentioned someone who might run in the same circle i did no i just noticed all the poodle pictures oh yes she disappeared a few months ago im just so broken up about it she was so beautiful not one of those tiny toy poodles either but a proper standard poodle black with a white patch on her head so she looked like she was wearing a hat such a sweet girl my rita she always loved to play with the little children around here and she loved fruit you know strawberries and grapes and bananas all the kids knew it and would bring her fruit to eat she was so happy and fat i just wish i knew what happened to her where she is now her eyes were watering and i turned away im very sorry shes disappeared i offered she sniffled youre very kind and she surprised me by giving me a kiss on the cheek melford had agreed to hang back two or three trailers down but when i came out of vivians house i saw no sign of him my stomach churned only a little at first but as i walked closer to where wed started and still couldnt find him the idea of being trapped in that trailer park alone where jim doe might easily find me at any moment well none of that sat well i went back almost precisely to karens trailer but i realized that was a terrible idea so i moved again toward vivian still no melford the sweat now came streaming off me and the hog lot smell began to give me a headache i began to walk the dusty streets back toward the kwick stop once i was there i would at least be out of doe territory it was like walking through a minefield and i expected some kind of boom with each step every time i heard the rumble of a car behind me an invisible fist squeezed my heart every grasshopper disturbing the weeds every lizard darting to safety it was all terror but i made it to the convenience store without incident and as i approached i noticed a familiarlooking car in the parking lot it was melfords datsun the car pointed away from me so i could see only the back of his head and the back of the person in the passenger seat it took an instant to see that it was the mysterious woman who worked for our unknown enemy it was desiree chapter at that moment i believed my best option would be to run away away from melford away from jacksonville away from all of it at least i told myself it was the smart thing since i found it easy to ignore all of the difficulties bound up with fleeing it didnt matter anyhow i was beyond smart way beyond smart i was well into pissed off i went over to the car and rapped on the drivers side melford rolled down the window howd it go you fucking shit i said his eyes widened that bad you were supposed to wait for me and i did right here no you were supposed to wait for me in the trailer park melfords face crinkled in puzzlement why would i do that i would just be drawing attention to myself we agreed to meet here that wasnt how i remembered it at all but melford recalled the conversation with such conviction that i began to wonder if id made a mistake he after all was the one used to formulating covert plans cooking up schemes maybe id heard what id wanted to hear since i didnt like the idea of him leaving me all alone whats this i asked gesturing with my head toward desiree who had been smiling agreeably at me the whole time you remember desiree melford said of course i remember her whats she doing here what are the two of you doing sitting so cozily together excuse us melford said to her he got out and led me about fifteen feet away over toward a pair of newspaper vending machines so what did you learn i figured i would hold off for the moment with the desiree issue since arguing with melford probably wouldnt get me anywhere i told him what vivian had said that the older woman was likely karens mother it looks like she went over there at the wrong time melford said doe clearly had his reasons for wanting to keep the deaths secret so he killed her as well what reasons are that drugs melford shrugged as though the topic bored him does got some sort of scheme going on and hes more afraid of an investigation that will unearth his operation than he is of linking himself to homicides and that my friend is good news tell me how a crazy cop who deals drugs is good news look doe and his friends hid those bodies they dont seem so bright and im sure they left an evidence trail a mile long if the bodies do show up the evidence will lead back to them not to us at that point they cant very well say that no they didnt kill karen and bastard it was probably a salesman who did that they only buried them doe and his friends have plenty to lose and what that means lemuel is you are in the clear what are you saying that i can just walk away from this thats what im saying im going to give you a ride back to wherever you want and as far as im concerned you can go back to your life you keep quiet about everything you saw stay away from that cop and all will be fine but what about this money theyre all looking for i asked theyre not going to forget about it and as long as they think i have something to do with it arent they going to keep after me forget the money he said not for the first time it doesnt matter they sent desiree to follow you but shes going to tell them you have nothing to do with the money trust me shes on our side and even if she werent shed have no reason to tell them you ripped them off when you didnt theyll have to look somewhere else i sucked in air through my teeth could it really be true had these assholes for stupid and illadvised reasons of their own protected us from scrutiny all to conceal their sordid little drug deals i could hardly believe it if i were honest with myself i would have admitted that my relief was marbled with disappointment i hadnt liked the terror of being arrested i hadnt liked being slapped around by doe but i liked the feeling of being a part of something and melford had made me feel it was something important something more than murder in a couple of days i would be home i would quit selling encyclopedias and everything would be back to where it was and i would still need to get to columbia next year desiree stepped out from the passenger side of the car she was wearing the same jeans as before but instead of the seethrough shirt and dark bra she wore a butter yellow bikini top she had a nice body there was no denying it voluptuous and trim all at once and under normal circumstances my biggest problem would be how to avoid staring at her breasts but right now i had to figure out how to avoid staring at her scar it was huge unlike anything id ever seen before running from her shoulder down her side and disappearing into her pants it covered most of her side under her arm and nearly half her back it wasnt just that it was unusual i remembered what bobby had told me the gamblers boss gunn had a woman with an enormous scar working for him desiree worked for b b gunn melford had been sitting companionably in his car with a woman who worked for the enemy the big enemy not looking at the scar was incredibly difficult it was as though it had its own gravity pulling in my eyes i decided to conceal my discomfort by asking about it can you tell me about your scar i said i regretted the words the minute they came out this was life and death here she wasnt just an attractive woman with large breasts a butter yellow bikini and a scar the size of a hand towel she was some sort of agent of evil wasnt she she looked over at me and smiled thank you for asking her voice was sweet and vaguely vulnerable most people think its polite to ignore it pretend they dont see it this is where my sister was before they separated us she ran her left hand along the scar grazing it with the tips of her unpolished fingernails she died im sorry i felt stupid saying it desiree smiled sweetly again thanks youre very kind you and melford are both very kind so i said rubbing my hands together what can we do for you this time mostly she said i came to see melford i want to hear more about helping animals i sat in the backseat sidekick status withdrawn instantly converted to third wheel i felt sullen and rejected and cramped shoved back there as i was into the too small space designed for japanese children not american teens and a library load of tattered paperback books when i asked where we were going he explained not very helpfully that we were driving around he wanted to keep me busy and away from doe until my pickup time it was hard to hear everything from the back but i could see that melford had desiree enthralled she sat up front beaming at melford as if he were a rock star as though she had a crush on him i didnt like her fawning all over him and i didnt like that i didnt like it i recognized that churning uneasy feeling working its way through my chest as jealousy but jealous of what did i want the sexy half siamese twin or did i hate having to share melford once again i felt i was missing something maybe everything why didnt melford want to know more about her before inviting her into the car it seemed to me that the superassassin might be less detail oriented in his work than it had at first seemed after about twentyfive minutes on the highway melford pulled off and stopped at a eleven saying he was thirsty and had to wash up when he walked away i felt a sickening panic set in i didnt want to be left alone with desiree i had no idea who desiree really was other than an employee of b b gunn i didnt know what she wanted but desiree showed no signs of finding the situation awkward she turned around and grinned at me conspiratorially i think hes so sexy i fidgeted with an empty plastic cassette holder id found on the floor im not sure youre his type being female and all you dont think hes gay do you well i did kind of assume it but look thats not important who are you anyhow why do you think hes gay because hes a vegetarian of course not i said i dont care if hes gay or he isnt i was just letting you know that you may not be his type but we can discuss that once you tell me why youre following us around melford might not care but i do its so wrong desiree said to just assume things about people to label them based on appearances ive worked so hard at trying to understand my real self ive been reading about auras and reincarnation and using the i ching and you boom you decide hes gay look its not a big deal to me i was just saying have you even asked him no i havent asked him because i dont care my tone was growing increasingly shrill i havent asked him what his favorite color is either why are you getting so worked up about this desiree asked melford came out of the store a bottle of water in one hand his keys in the other lem thinks youre gay she told him when he opened the door melford settled behind the wheel and pivoted around to me he grinned broadly a lot of people think that lemuel i wouldnt sweat it but you dont have anything against gay people do you no i blurted thats not the point i want to know who desiree is and what shes doing following us around what does that have to do with my sexual orientation melford asked i dont get it neither do i my voice came out highpitched melford glanced over at desiree lem has a valid question who are you and why are you following us around me she said some very bad people asked me to keep an eye on you lem find out if you were up to anything improper and is he melford asked not as near as i can tell but ill have to keep following him to be sure unless she glanced at melfordsomeone distracts me information came out slowly over a leisurely drive up and down the highway desiree worked as id already suspected for b b gunn who was centered near miami and who used both the hog trade and the encyclopedia business as some sort of front for selling drugs desiree seemed eager to avoid getting too specific she made it clear that she wanted to leave bb but while she didnt want to betray him shed reached the conclusion thanks in part to the i ching and in part to melford that she needed to make amends for her involvement in such an enterprise for some time now shed been looking for something she said some kind of meaning and at the chinese restaurant shed become increasingly convinced that melfords interest in kindness to animals might be what she sought i had no idea if her conviction would strengthen or waver when she discovered the project involved killing people so what do animal rights people do she asked blow up slaughterhouses and things melford shook his head for the most part no the principal arm of the movement is a loose affiliation of activists collectively known as the animal liberation front the thing that makes it work so well is that to be a member of this group all you have to do is espouse its values take action and attribute that action to the alf no training camp no indoctrination no oath of loyalty on a small scale they generally vandalize fastfood restaurants or hunting shops anything to throw a monkey wrench even a tiny one into the machinery of animal misery but more sophisticated operations involve things like rescuing lab animals or breaking into research or farming facilities to take pictures and expose their cruelty i dont know desiree said it sounds sort of weak do you really want to dedicate your life to pestering people to stop doing what theyre never going to stop doing anyway maybe you should take stronger action beat up some fastfood executives or something the alf believes that its people must never harm anyone not even the cruelest of animal tormentors since their core belief is that human beings can live their lives without harming any creatures i tried not to react when i heard this they cant take down someone really nasty desiree asked melford shook his head anyone who would do that who would even be suspected of thinking about that sort of thing would be shunned by the organization and the entire animal rights movement theyre all about saving lives even human lives though property is always a legitimate target i respect that she said there are those however melford went on who take action when the alf wont who believe that violence is under extreme circumstances a necessary evil the core of the animal rights movement never condone this sort of thing not even in private i suspect that sounds about right to me desiree said it doesnt make any sense to support the idea of protecting the rights of all beings if you then start picking and choosing otherwise were all like people in a restaurant picking from the tank which fish we want to eat melford smiled thats right desiree smiled at this lie as if she were so happy to have melfords approval the crazy thing was i knew how she felt and i knew he was lying to her so what did that say about the ease with which id come to value his opinion if i didnt know from personal experience the personal experience of seeing him kill two people i would never suspect he was lying i suddenly felt distinctly uneasy like i wanted to get out of the car like i wanted to get away can i ask a question desiree said of course what about medical research i mean it may be unpleasant to use animals as test subjects but we get results and isnt it important to find cures for diseases absolutely its important to find cures for diseases melford agreed but using animals to do so is another matter look there are two aspects to the answer one ethical and the other practical the ethical issue is that it may be expedient to torment and kill animals for our needs but is it the right thing to do if we could get better results by using prisoners or unwanted children or unlucky bastards picked by lottery would that be okay in other words do the ends justify the means either the lives of animals are to be valued or theyre not and if they are then making exceptions because something is really really important doesnt make sense im not sure i buy it she said theyre animals not people shouldnt we have the right to take advantage of our position on the food chain we dont judge lions for eating zebras lions cant choose not to eat zebras melford said its not ethics for them its what theyre designed to do we can choose whether or not to harm animals so we can be judged by that choice okay i accept that she told him but i dont know that i accept that we should die of diseases rather than use animals to help us overcome them thats a tough one it may be the toughest one for people to get past the ethical person can sacrifice hot dogs and hamburgers but the question of animal testing seems to provide a real dilemma so heres something to keep in mind most animal testing is utterly worthless come on i chimed in why would they do it if it was worthless dont fool yourself medical labs may be full of wellmeaning researchers but they need funding to do their work researchers have to apply for grants and grant proposals have to be written so that they are successful and to get grants researchers have to use animal research its just that simple grant providers have come to believe in the efficacy of animal research and no amount of scientific fact is going to sway them maybe they believe in it because it works desiree suggested most of the animals they use for research are mammals and are closely related to us but that doesnt mean they respond to diseases or to drugs the same way we do chimps are our closest relatives theyre more closely related to us than they are to gorillas but you know what happens if you give a chimp pcp angel dust it goes to sleep pcp makes a great chimp tranquilizer think about that a drug that turns us into monsters makes them sleepy and theyre the nearest thing to humans out there so if a drug works or doesnt work on a chimp or a rat or a dog what does that tell us about how it will go on humans ultimately it tells us nothing havent there been lots of breakthroughs that have come through animal research and there will probably be many more that doesnt mean its the best way to go advocates of medical research ask if wed rather live without the polio vaccine since the polio vaccine would never have come about if there had been no animal research its a false argument sure were better off with a polio vaccine than without one but human beings are clever and resourceful there are alternatives including using volunteers and lab tests some scientists are even beginning to work with models built entirely from computer software to say that we would never be where we are without animal research is to assume that research would close down without animals of course it wouldnt wed find new ways necessity is the mother of invention so if we outlawed animal testing we might have more advanced computers now because wed need more sophisticated computer models to save lives and because animal research is so unreliable the better question to ask would be what we might have discovered if we didnt rely on it the defenders of vivisection like to suggest that its a choice between animals and disease or testing and cures but what if just the opposite is true and using unreliable biological models has set back medical science maybe without animal testing wed have a cure for cancer by now i dont know desiree said absently you make a good case but if im sick i want them to do everything possible to cure me you want them to do everything possible but not anything conceivable whether it benefits you or not true and as an ethical person even if you want to allow for animal testing dont you think there should be some sort of standard of need maybe a tester should have to make a case for why it is necessary to sacrifice a monkey or a dog or a rat for a particular cause right now they are free to slaughter and torture however many thousands they like without oversight and you know theres a whole lot of animal testing that has nothing to do with health cosmetic companies subject millions of animals a year to torture to see if this new and improved nail polish remover does as much damage to a rabbits eyes as the old version youd think it would be enough to know that putting corrosive material in your eyes is a bad move but these guys need to test it out why i asked who knows why insurance liability or some nonsense like that they just do it come on desiree said youre telling me that big corporations pay who knows how much just to torture animals unnecessarily i dont believe it really a strange sort of smile came over melfords face you dont believe it lemuel you dont have to be at the pickup until what tenthirty or eleven right right i said slowly and you have nowhere you need to be before then well i ventured it would be nice to go to a movie nice try i dont know what youre thinking i told him but i really dont like it no he said you wont like it you wont like anything about it i guess we were already heading in the right direction because melford hit the gas harder where are we going desiree asked well i wasnt planning on doing this so soon but ive already done the logistical work so why not he grinned at her were going to visit a research lab chapter we drove for about an hour farther away from jacksonville until melford pulled off and took us through a bleak landscape of fastfood restaurants topless bars and pawnshops finally he turned again and we went about another ten miles through wooded roads until he stopped and parked in a little strip mall with a jewelry store and a dry cleaner we got out and he walked to the back where he proceeded to take out a black garbage bag full of black sweat clothes dig around he said find something that fits but dont put it on yet or youll be hot as hell he picked up a black gym bag and slung it over his shoulder and then he reached into a cardboard box and handed us each a lump of cloth youll need these too they were ski masks i already had as many legal problems as i needed so i had no desire to break into an animaltesting facility but i knew better than to bring that up or to suggest that maybe i should wait in the car i was in and i wasnt getting out melford opened up his gym bag and passed around a bottle of bug spray and once wed applied that we began the trek through a fairly thick copse of pines it was still light out but the mosquitoes were buzzing around my ear moderately deterred by the repellent the cluster of trees smelled of rotted leaves and the sourness of an occasional decomposing opossum desiree didnt say anything she had a look of amused determination on her face but why should she care she clearly did illegal things all the time one more wasnt going to bother her finally we began to emerge and melford held up his hand the platoon commander ordering us to stop this is as far as we go for now he said its saturday and there wont be anyone there but were going to wait for dark all the same shouldnt be more than an hour and a half or so in the meantime ill go over with you the reconnaissance ive already done he reached into his pocket and pulled out several pieces of paper which he proceeded to unfold on the ground they were handdrawn maps of the interior of a building what exactly are you planning desiree asked nothing fancy he said this is a simple hitandrun you wanted to know what animal rights activists do well this is it were going in were going to take pictures and collect evidence and were going to get out simple as that then im going to pass along the swag to an animal rights organization and theyll make the images public and try to stir up controversy pretty basic yes sure desiree said piece of cake piece of cake i looked through the woods at the building beyond about a hundred feet of wellmanicured grass spread out between the edge of the woods and a squat white building without windows a thin layer of shrubs outlined the structure but that was all as far as gardening went it looked bland harmless except for its menacing blankness at the far end just before an oceanic expanse of parking lot i saw a concrete slab sticking out of the grass with the companys name chiseled deep oldham health services like the coffee mugs and boxes in karen and bastards trailer melford had claimed to have no idea what it was and now we were about to break in it wasnt nearly dark enough to move until almost nine oclock melford smiled at me dont worry he said well get you back in time to keep you from getting fired the three of us sat there listening to the chirping cicadas and frogs and night birds watching the poorly lit grounds of oldham health services grow dark these guys are so behind the times melford explained up north theyd never leave a lab like this so vulnerable but animal rights activists havent really made themselves known in florida so the bad guys feel safe he took a look around okay put on your sweats desiree began to unbutton her jeans but melford shook his head over your clothes my dear he said we want to be invisible going in but we want to look normal once were inside he glanced at her bikini top youll want to leave the sweatshirt on i think once we were clad in black and had our masks on he gave the forward gesture and we charged onto the lawn like a trio of commandos heads down bulleting into the unknown i was already starting to sweat but i felt the rush for an instant i understood why melford was melford i understood the thrill of doing something illegal of breaking boundaries rejecting the mundane and the stable and it wasnt as if we were burglars motivated by base greed we were defying authority for a moral cause whether it was my cause whether i believed in the cause seemed irrelevant just being there made me feel alive the yard was poorly lit and melford led us around the side and up a set of concrete steps that led to a metal side door he opened his bag and removed his pick gun the one he had used on karens trailer and within two minutes the door had clicked open we slipped inside it was pitch black in there no lights on and no windows melford took out a flashlight and instructed us to remove our masks and sweats all but desirees top security is light he said in a whisper some guards almost no cameras if guards do show up leave the talking to me once wed stuffed the clothes into his bag he hoisted it up and we began to talk again we were in some sort of storeroom metal shelves full of boxes most marked medical supplies there were glass jars of dangerouslooking liquids bags of dog food cat food rabbit rat and monkey food all of these emitted their own pet store smell but from farther beyond i smelled odors far more clinical things chemical and antiseptic melford found the doors out of the storeroom and we came out into a long corridor of plain cinderblock walls adorned only with an inexplicable teal racing stripe and dingy beige linoleum floors the main lights were off but enough fluorescent bulbs were illuminated that melford could turn off his flashlight the place looked like a hospital after hours we made a right and then another right and then we went up a set of stairs to a floor that looked remarkably like the one from which wed come we followed melford down a corridor to a door marked lab six which was locked so the pick gun came out again desiree stood nervous watch while i tried to peer inside through the dark glass square and melford worked the lock in less than a minute we were inside when the door came open i knew i had crossed something more metaphorical but also more tangible than a doors threshold yes id seen the hog farm seen how terrible it was the misery and if such a term can be applied to hogs the degradation but this was different the hog farm was after all owned by a crooked cop and it was a place whose purpose was the raising of hogs so they could die it was a way station between nothingness and death and it wasnt meant to be anything more the pigs were prebacon prepork preham their slaughter was ordained and inevitable it was a place of horror and misery perhaps unnecessary horror and misery but that it should be miserable and horrible made a sort of functional sense this was something else three of the walls were lined with small cages each of which contained some kind of brownish gray monkey about the size of a childs doll thin with expressive faces the room stank not like the hog lot which was the smell of fear and feces but of living putrefaction it smelled of fresh shit and of vomit and piss and rot at first i thought the monkeys were asleep but when melford turned on the light i saw that their eyes were opened they lay on their sides most of them panting their eyes wide following our movements with unmistakable terror many of them were letting out whimpering noises one bit its lip and gripped the wires of its cage in its fingers with a repeating desperate pulse across the room one of the animals rose dragged itself upright and hissed at us a weak but defiant hiss it bared its teeth then its legs appeared to buckle under its weight and the monkey fell back into a brown pile that might have been its own feces or maybe monkey chow melford reached into his bag and found a camera which he handed to desiree start taking pictures he told her he meanwhile began to search the lab and quickly found a clipboard which he held up to us okay here it is you know what these monkeys are being tested for cure for cancer brain regeneration for stroke victims heart surgery to help babies with birth defects guess again theyre part of an ld thats lethal dose fifty percent these are routine studies done on standard household products to find out what quantity causes death in fifty percent of the test subjects they do it with drain cleaner dish soap motor oil you name it you know whats being tested here photocopier paper how much paper these monkeys can be forcefed before fifty percent of them die desiree stopped taking pictures her gaze fell on one monkey lying on its side one arm straight back the other resting limply on its face its chest heaved up and down in pained respiration but why what does that tell them exactly what you think how much copier paper will kill fifty percent of the test subjects melford said look you have to understand that these experiments arent goal directed anymore maybe there was a time when ld tests were designed to discover something useful it didnt make it right but it made it practical at least now its just something thats done its a standard test because insurance companies want data to help them determine liability and flesh out their actuarial tables they do it because not doing it might help some lawyer down the road argue that the company didnt perform all necessary safety tests they do it because it is what they do millions upon millions of animals are tortured and killed each year just because i dont believe it she said id said the same thing that afternoon looking at the hogs listening to melford explain how they were housed why they were housed that way and what it did to them and the people who ate them i hadnt believed it looking right at it i hadnt believed it believe it melford said lemuel over here were in luck weve found some videotapes so while desiree finished snapping pictures he and i shoved videotapes into his bag we then shut out the light and left the lab melford looked at his watch we shouldnt push our luck and we dont want lemuel here to turn into a pumpkin if he doesnt get to his pickup but why dont we do one more lab i kind of want to see lab two for myself ive heard things we followed him around a corner where he opened another door here we were met by the sounds of subdued whimpering the smells werent much different from those of the monkey lab but when he turned on the light we were met by a room stacked with dog cages two or three on top of one another thin wooden boards separated them but they did a poor job and the feces from the animals above dripped onto the animals below a few let out tentative barks but mostly they watched us they rested heads on paws eyes wide and brown watching off in the distance i heard one let out a whimper melford handed desiree the camera and she began to snap photos again he looked around until he found the clipboard he wanted oh no he breathed theyre scheduled for an ld test for pesticide to start in two days this is what sucks about this kind of operation theres nothing wrong with these dogs those monkeys were the living dead but these guys are savable unfortunately we cant do anything if we try to get them out of here well get caught theyll get brought back the best we can do is document this and get the evidence into the right hands and wait for a better day where do they get these dogs desiree asked a lot of shelters have deals with places like this they send over unclaimed strays but the truth is labs have backdoor deals with animal abductors people will steal pets and sell them to a place like this for fifty bucks a pop you can make decent cash if you dont have scruples desiree put down the camera melford we cant leave them here they would at least have a chance if we could let them out in the woods we cant do it he said how are we going to herd twenty or thirty dogs out of here without alerting the guards im not leaving them she said you are he told her if we all go to jail we wont do any good you want to walk this path you have to harden yourself you cant blow up every burger king you drive past you cant liberate all tortured animals from all the factory farms you want to but you cant and it drives you crazy sometimes because everything you do is just a drop in the bucket this isnt a fight for the moment or a year or even a decade this is a battle that will be resolved over generations and right now we have to make choices we do what we can and we stay free and keep going and chip away at the edifice our getting arrested and those dogs being sent back to their cages isnt going to accomplish anything doesnt choosing who lives and who dies make us as morally suspect as the people who put these animals here no melford said they put the animals here not us and were doing the best we can which right now is to bear witness were taking one i said we can take one cant we how do you choose which one he asked i pointed it was a black poodle it wasnt rita vivians black poodle but it was a black poodle and i knew that vivian would take care of it i knew that she would regard it as some sort of divine compensatory gesture maybe the idea was silly but i believed it i believed that dog could have a home and someone to love it this was no longer abstract no longer theoretical were taking this dog i said if you dont like it you can leave without me melford swore but didnt say anything else desiree however nodded at me if lem knows someone wholl take the dog we cant leave it here to feast on black flag shes a poodle melford said shell bark i dont believe this i could feel myself getting agitated melford kean with ice water in his veins is afraid to do the right thing its a matter of being practical i dont want to fight a battle that will lose the war its one dog desiree said her voice hard well keep her quiet and im with lem were taking the dog whether you help or not maybe it was that he didnt think he could dissuade her but i had the sense that it was because he liked the fact that she felt so adamant boogers he said lets do it he went over to the cage and began to open it very carefully i suspected he knew enough to suspect that a dog that had been mistreated the way this one had might well turn on him but she came out docilely and licked his hand i figured that was a good sign okay he said lets try to pull this off but when we turned around we saw the guard standing at the door melford didnt see it but i did desiree reached into her back pocket and removed a switchblade she didnt open it but she balanced it in her palm she might believe that melford was committed to nonviolence but she clearly had not yet signed off on that part of the animal liberation front manifesto maybe the two of them belonged together can i help you melford asked he had found a leash and was in the process of attaching it to ritas collar he hardly even bothered to look at the guard who are you he asked he was in his forties overweight to the point that he had trouble walking he stared at us with dark and heavily bagged eyes im dr rogers he said and these are my two students trudy and andré the guard stared at us what are you doing here im running a j melford said from the puzzled look on the guards face it seemed pretty clear to me that melford had just made up the j how come i didnt get any word that anyone was going to be here do you really think i would know the answer to that melford asked you have your id card ill show it to you on my way out melford said in the meantime you can see im doing something are you new here because youre supposed to know that you must never disturb the staff when theyre handling animals the guard stopped to think for a minute ive been here all day how come i didnt see you come in this question must have stumped melford because he paused right the guard said im calling dr trainer and if he doesnt know what youre doing here im calling the cops now put the dog back in the cage and come with me no wait melford said let me show you something first he handed the poodles leash to me and walked over to his black bag i stood frozen with fear desiree had her knife out and now melford was going to take a gun and kill this guard just for doing his job this wasnt some nefarious force of evil like he claimed karen and bastard were this was some poor working asshole i tensed ready to dart forward but when melford took his hand out of the bag he didnt have a gun he had a stack of money they were twenties and i couldnt tell how many but there was easily there i dont know what they pay you to keep guard over this house of horrors melford said but you have to know what goes on here is wrong so ill make you a deal you take this cash and let us walk out with this dog its one dog no one will miss her no one will know we were here anyone asks you say you have no idea simple as that the guard looked at the money and then around the room sure there was no sign anyone had been here we hadnt vandalized the place many of the cages were empty anyhow so no one would notice one more empty one he didnt know about the missing videotapes so it seemed like a good deal the guard snatched the money ill make my rounds again in half an hour he said if youre still here im calling the cops and ill deny you gave me anything fair enough melford said he turned around to grin at desiree who already had the knife back in her pocket most of the ride back went silently we made a stop at a eleven and bought some doggie treats and water for the poodle and she happily ate and drank in the backseat with me she hardly made a noise it was just one dog i thought one dog rescued from being forced to eat insecticide wed made some small difference i told melford where vivian lived and we stopped outside her trailer he tied the dog to the door rang the doorbell and we drove off we were halfway down the street when her door opened and we heard her muffled shriek of joy what we didnt hear was the subsequent disappointment it wasnt her dog her dog was gone maybe dead but it was a dog and i had to think it would be some comfort we were tired from what we had done and what we had seen but i was lost in another thought why had melford said he had no idea what oldham health services was if hed been keeping his eye on the place for who knew how long and what was its connection to bastard it was just shy of eleven when melford dropped me off outside the kwick stop it was only after i was out of the car and it had driven away that i recalled that melford had said i was done with him that our business was over did that mean i would never see him again was he hurt that i hadnt said goodbye and did i really care if i hurt the assassins feelings not that it mattered maybe it was because of everything that had happened in the last day but i didnt believe i was done with melford and i found it even harder to believe i was done with the gambler jim doe and the rest when i was back home away from jacksonville and bookmen id believe it i walked over to the pay phone just outside the kwick stops door it was late to be making the call but surprisingly chris denton picked up on the first ring yeah he told me ive got your guy and and not much hes a miami businessman deals in livestock and also deals with some doortodoor encyclopedia outfit he also runs a charity thats about it no record no arrests no stories in the media other than the usual business crap thats all youve got i asked what do you want me to do tell you hes a mass murderer hes just an asshole like everyone else like you i was hoping to get more for my money too bad he said and he hung up i stood there by the phone letting disappointment wash over me i dont know what i had expected maybe some missing piece something to help put it all in perspective maybe i wanted something that would have helped me feel safer and i didnt buy it if b b gunn was the head of some kind of drug and hog operation whatever that would look like he must have had some dealings with the law an arrest that never went anywhere unfounded allegations that made their way into the newspaper something like that why had denton come up empty as it turned out it was my fault i never noticed that chris dentons number was in the same exchange as the one karen had put on her application it was a meadowbrook grove exchange and chris denton i would later learn knew jim doe when i hung up the phone i had the feeling someone was watching me i looked up there was chitra her eyes narrow and i thought judgmental hi i said this is your pickup too yeah she told me you werent selling today were you not selling ive been here a while i saw you get out of that car your friend was driving did you go swimming what that woman in the front was wearing a bikini that was about as far as our conversation got before bobby pulled up in his cordoba and she melted back into the store ronny neil and scott were already in the car ronny neil in front whispering conspiratorially to scott in the back did that mean something bobby had been picking me up first for weeks why should i care who got to sit in which seats i was planning on leaving and never coming back i had bigger and more important things to worry about than whether or not bobby considered me the best bookman in his crew i was more interested in making certain i didnt go to jail for murder or get killed by drug dealers the cordoba came to a stop in front of the store and bobby pushed himself out the engine was still running and from inside billy idol crooned about eyes without a face whatever the hell that meant bobby grinned and came around to the back flipping open the trunk with a flair of his wrist as if he were a magician performing a trick his blue oxford shirt was partially untucked and hed spilled something sodalike on his pants so besides running errands for the gambler did you have any time to make money i shook my head i blanked bobby sucked on his lower lip that was a pretty primo spot i gave you might have helped if youd been there i was out there most of the day it just didnt work out yeah right its not like i blanked on purpose i said even though thats exactly what i did so what happened i shrugged i dont know bad luck no such thing as bad luck lemmy you make your own luck bobby looked at me with a kind of seriousness i had never seen before and i knew he didnt want to hear my bullshit excuses he gave his head a little sad shake and then shut the trunk you guys want to go behind my back fuck me up thats your business get in the car i had to climb in the back with large smelly scott when they picked up kevin there was no way scott would scoot over to the middle which meant i would be squished between them breathing in the stink of scotts unwashed body all the way back to the motel but i told myself it would all be over soon tomorrow would be the last day in town monday morning bobby would head for home we would stop on the road to sell and id be back by two or three am early tuesday and i would never have to sell books again just two more bookselling sessions and then freedom a tinny genesis tune was coming through the radio now and i tried to concentrate on it id read once that if you had a really bad headache you could make it go away by thinking about some other part of your body instead thats what i was trying out i figured if i listened to genesis if i concentrated on phil collinss voice i might not smell scott quite so much i bet you blanked today ronny neil said from up front i didnt i got me a double this was where bobby would tell him to be quiet that they didnt talk about how it went in the car but bobby didnt say anything he just stared ahead as he drove you aint gonna answer me ronny neil said scott shoved an elbow into my ribs i heard someone say something to you he told me he scratched at a zit on his nose i still didnt say anything i decided instead to nurse my indignation well did you blank or didnt you ronny neil asked i thought you understood english so great you know were not supposed to talk about it i dont hear bobby complaining i paused to let bobby chime in but he didnt say anything were not supposed to talk about it i said again shit boy you worry too much about what youre supposed to do and what youre not supposed to do me im gonna celebrate in style a double with that bonus i got me six hundred dollars today and i get me some pussy yeah said scott yeah what ronny neil asked his friend yeah your buddy is going to get some pussy you know you aint who would get with a fat lisping fuck like you scott laughed how much money you think that chitra will want for her to give me some of that pussy she got ronny neil asked how much you think i think shes giving it away scott told him those indian girls are horny as shit the dots they got on their heads make them horny she dont have a dot but its the same thing shut the fuck up ronny neil said then on second thought he added horny as shit i heard that too back at the motel after everyone had piled out of the car bobby put a hand on my shoulder to hold me back we watched as scott and ronny neil walked off with kevin lagging behind goodnaturedly trying to stay in the conversation not seeming to notice or mind that ronny neil and scott didnt give a damn about him wait a minute bobby said i want to talk to you i sighed ill do better tomorrow i said though i knew i wouldnt id blank again tomorrow because i wouldnt try again tomorrow it was that simple its not that bobby said i want to know whats going on with you and the gambler if it werent for the darkness bobby would have seen the cloud of fear pass over me its nothing i said reaching for words that would comfort him and in no way encourage him to bring the conversation to the gambler himself dont tell me its nothing this morning the gambler seemed ready to string you up now the two of you are best buddies and hes sending you on errands plus hes leaning on me to do whatever those two baboons ronny neil and scott want he told me to give them whatever spots they ask for lem he told me to treat them like kings im going to do what im told but i want to know why i dont know why come on lem i know your story you want to go to college a little more than a year from now youll be studying for midterms and trying to talk sorority girls into coming back to your dorm room im still going to be here this is my job and i want to keep doing it i like that i make money doing it im good at it i know you are yeah then why are you screwing this up for me because i blanked you know that isnt it the gambler is angry with me and i cant figure out what his deal with you is youve got to tell me whats going on because i dont want to burn out here ive put too many years into this it took me two years to be a crew boss i can move up in this organization but not if the gambler is angry at me so youve got to tell me whats going on i shook my head i dont know is it about the reporter have you talked to that reporter he mentioned i shook my head again because you were asking those questions this morning i was curious is all he waited a moment to see if there would be more coming there wouldnt be you wont tell me he asked his voice gone quiet now theres nothing to tell bobby fuck he slapped his hand down on the back of the car ive been your friend ive looked out for you and ive helped you make a lot of money and this is how you treat me if i could tell you something i would i said almost whined get the fuck out of here bobby said i started back to the hotel and i thought that the next two days were going to be the most miserable of my life and that was saying a lot chapter i wasnt sure i wanted to go to the pool that night what i wanted was to keep a low profile to slink through the rest of the weekend without making anyone else hate me without having any more conflicts with ronny neil and scott or the gambler or bobby on the other hand if i was never going to come back then i was never going to see chitra again not unless i arranged to see her so maybe that was what i needed to concentrate on i looked out the window to the pool area people were beginning to congregate no sign of chitra though i could go out there have a couple of beers and see if she showed up i left the room and went down the stairs this time unhindered and began to make my way across the path i walked quickly with my head down the way i did when i was lost in concentration and the noise was almost drowned out by the sound of my own footsteps that is it would have been drowned out by the sound of my own footsteps if there hadnt been a voice my whole nervous system had been wired to hear i had become like a radar dish tuned to one signal and when that signal was anywhere in the air my dish rotated toward it it was chitras voice musical and lilting but this time it was not so soft it was strident ronny neil please a couple of vending machines stood behind the building with the checkin desk more than once id heard couples making out in there when i came back to my room late at night only now it was chitra back there with ronny neil were they having a fight could she have lied to me so brazenly about her connection with ronny neil was she so foolish and was i so foolish as to have believed her i got me a double today i heard ronny neil say i took a step closer yes thats nice but you brought me here under false pretenses i dont want to stay sure you do baby no ronny neil take your hand off of me i dont want to stay give me one kiss come on it aint so hard i knew this was a gift i could walk right up to that vending machine and be the hero if i rescued chitra there would be no going back the only problem was i didnt know how to rescue her i wished melford were here with his gun and his bravado and his cool disposition melford would know exactly what to do i looked around as though the answer might be somewhere nearby i heard voices from the pool laughter the grating sound of patio furniture sliding against the rough chattahoochee and there was the throbbing in my head the veins or arteries or whatever they were in my temples thumping thumping like the pulsating gong of cowardice i felt sure i was going to walk away chitra could take care of herself for a few more minutes anyhow i would get a couple of guys and we would all come back my role would be diminished but chitra would be safe and the risk would be spread more comfortably i felt sure i was going to walk away but that wasnt how it happened i pushed my way through the bushes and found chitra pinned to the coke machine her head was flush against the bright red façade of it her ponytail squished her face in a glowing mask of fear and contempt ronny neil stood right before her bent over slightly holding hard to her wrist i wanted to shout something melodramatic and absurd but i choked down the words because the thing was melford might be crazy he might be a homicidal freak but he still knew a thing or two about the world and about human nature hey guys i said whats going on i walked past chitra and toward the soda machine then fished into my pocket for some change my hands were shaking badly but i was certain i could keep everything under control i turned to chitra excuse me for a sec i said she stepped forward and i slid the coins into the slot and pushed the button for a sprite not that which soda i picked made a difference i could have pressed the button for goat piss if it were on there for all it mattered but the sprite landed at the bottom with a hollow and metallic thud and i took it out popped the top and turned back to the two of them whats up with you two i asked i kept the wavering in my voice to a minimum why dont you fuck off ronny neil said i shrugged as though id been asked if i had plans for the weekend i dont know i said never really thought about it what ronny neil sneered i dont know why i dont fuck off i explained im not in the mood to fuck off right now i guess i looked over at chitra you want to take a walk or something the thinnest of smiles appeared on her lips as though she suddenly understood the game yes she said the smile was growing i think id like that very much i looked over at ronny neil see you back at the room easy as that we walked away we crossed through the registration area where sameen gave me a curious glance and then out to the pool area we figured without discussing it that ronny neil wouldnt follow us that way i stopped to toss out the sprite and pick up a couple of tall boys from the cooler because holy hell i needed a beer i handed one to chitra and then opened my own it didnt taste all that much different from the sprite when you came down to it but it was good i needed a drink id never needed a drink in that manly way before but i needed one now i was calmer than i would have thought maybe even than i should have been my heart pounded and my hands still trembled but i didnt care the grateful heat emanating from chitra her appreciative silence her relieved and amused smile were all like the pendulous watch of a hypnotist we walked past the pool and back to the cloister of the motel i had no idea where we were going and i could tell chitra had no idea either none of the book people were staying in this part of the building we went up the stairs and walked along the secondstory balcony looking out over the railing painted white but with rust showing through we stopped where the floor turned filling out the boomerang shape of the wing here was another pair of vending machines food and beverage and a groaning ice machine as well now chitra was leaning up against a vending machine again and there i was just like ronny neil slouching in front of her only this time she was smiling she took my hands youre very clever she said that makes one of us what were you doing behind the bushes with that idiot she laughed and her caramelcolored skin darkened with a blush he told me that the vending machine had some sort of indian soft drinks in it i cant believe i fell for it me either wow she laughed i know it sounds foolish but this motel is owned by indians you know it was possible true enough i agreed they have that chutneyomatic in the lobby she was still laughing you can stop making fun of me now okay i agreed maybe i will we said nothing for a long time she held my eyes and we grinned i knew i ought to kiss her i knew it but she was from india how did they do things there i might offend her maybe kissing was the last thing on her mind and she was involved in some mysterious hindu gratitude ritual and if i tried anything shed hate me id be as bad as ronny neil but then she was no longer holding my hands she had her hands on my arms and she was rubbing them back and forth i took a step forward and chitra reached out and put her hands behind my neck and pulled me in for a kiss her lips were soft and warm and i could feel her breath swirling around in my mouth in little eddies and then she pulled away again and smiled i had sort of been hoping for something more passionate more bodice ripping on the other hand i liked the slow sweetness of it im glad you were the one who rescued me she said i would have hated to have to kiss scott that way id have hated that too listen chitra you look really beautiful by the light of that coke machine dont get me wrong but im wondering if we might go somewhere else a little more you know private are you trying to get me to go back to your room she asked i let out a nervous laugh that even i thought sounded dorky so we can see ronny neil again it wasnt really what i had in mind frankly i was thinking of anyplace with chairs we could call a cab get a drink or something just so long as we get away from here do you want to go get a hamburger no i said i really dont me either ill stop teasing you you know its amazing how you dont notice the things all around you you dont imagine possibilities even when those possibilities are right in front of your face i stared at her it sounded too damn much like something melford would say chitra i really like you but i have no idea what you are talking about her big eyes dark and wide locked on mine what im talking about is that rooms at this motel only cost thirtynine dollars per night i felt as though id been kicked in the stomach by the most pleasant foot on earth i was scared even terrified i wanted to say no to put on the brakes but that was another form of cowardice and i knew it really i said im quite sure theres a big sign out front with the price thats not what i meant i know what you meant id like to get a room with you i dont know what will happen in it but i think i can trust you i just want to get away from everyone and everything for a while to talk in private to have our own space i know a motel room is suggestive but i can trust that nothing will happen that i am not ready for cant i of course you can i told her strangely relieved that i might not have to lose my virginity just yet you know i said if they find out theyll fire you i dont want to come back not if youre not going to be here anymore this time the foot in the stomach was not quite so pleasant i hadnt told anyone about not planning on coming back not even melford how did you know that come on i saw you getting out of your friend melfords car tonight its clear youre not even trying to sell anymore thats pretty complicated i said you dont have to explain anything to me i want to but i cant right now is everything okay i mean hes not getting you involved in anything dangerous or reckless is he i didnt want to lie to her directly so i approached it obliquely melfords a complicated guy i notice you havent answered me i still think theres something strange about him theres nothing thats not strange about him but my not selling isnt really his doing its mine i dont want to do this anymore the money is good but its not worth it i know what you mean i made so much money last weekend that i hardly even noticed how miserable i was but this weekend it feels more like a forced march i was looking forward to seeing you again this weekend and if youre not going to be here i think i would be miserable i couldnt believe i was hearing these sweet words i felt unworthy i feel the same way i said stupidly i thought she laughed a little my father will be happy to hear about this we need the money but he hates me doing doortodoor sales you think hell like me better than teddy his name is todd and as long as you are neither todd nor pakistani everything is negotiable well theres two things going for me so lets get a room i told her its on me a woman loves a big spender we turned to head back to the stairs and we both stopped in our tracks bobby was standing there arms folded eyes little slits of judgment they told me you came this way bobby was glaring at us at me really his round face was red his eyes were red too as though hed been crying i opened my mouth to make some lame excuse like we were just getting an orange soda i decided to save it the gambler wants you in his room right now bobby said there was something dark in his voice it took me a moment to put my finger on it but once i found it there was no mistake it was more than anger rage what for just come along i looked at chitra i dont know i dont want to leave chitra alone ronny neil sort of attacked her before and he might still be hanging around looking for trouble its not safe no one likes a tattler bobby told me a tattler you cant tattle on attempted rape bobby seemed unmoved but chitra put a hand on my shoulder its okay ill go down to the pool make sure i stay with other people dont go anywhere alone she smiled i wont bobby sensed that our farewell had run its course so he pushed me forward i watched chitra descend the stairs and only when i saw her get to the pool safely did i turn my attention back to bobby so whats this all about like you dont know bobby said no i dont know tell me but it could only be about one thing i figured bobby had said something to the gambler about seeing me in his room and the chain reaction led to my being dragged off there my leg muscles stiffened and i was within seconds of darting off but then bobby said something else he said christ you dont deserve it but i didnt say anything to him about your being in his room you fucked me over but not enough for me to want to see you get your ass seriously messed up hed kill you if he found out okay so this wasnt about my being in his room i appreciate your not saying anything but if the gambler doesnt know about that then what is this about come off it lem you lied to me and you made me look bad maybe so bad that i wont be able to keep my job what are you talking about how did i lie to you give it up isnt it obvious that youve been found out bobby i have no idea what you mean bobby let out a sigh the reporter he said he then looked at me with a kind of i dropped the bomb on you baby smile the reporter what about the reporter the guy from the miami herald hes in the gamblers room that sounded like bad news hick cop jim doe might be too stupid and too invested in his own crimes to figure out what the hell had happened with bastard and karen but a reporter from the miami herald was something else entirely but if i had reason to be afraid i didnt know why bobby had reason to be angry what does this have to do with me i thought you were too smart to stab me in the back especially after everything i did for you and if youre not going to be too smart to stab me in the back id hope youd at least be smart enough to cover your own ass did you even tell the guy you werent supposed to help him out if you had he might not have come knocking on the gamblers door bobby this is all a big mistake and when i meet this guy hes going to tell you it was all a big mistake believe me i have no interest in talking to any reporters sure bobby said we were now outside the gamblers door bobby gave it a curt irritated knock and in an instant the gambler opened up he flashed a murderous glance and mouthed something that i couldnt quite get sitting near a glass table by the far window sat a man in a white linen suit with a black tshirt his eyes were hidden behind his glasses but i had the feeling he wasnt looking at me not really i thought that odd and i thought that he didnt look like any reporter i had ever seen not that id ever seen any in real life but this guy was way more miami vice than lou grant when the door opened wider i saw another man sitting on the opposite side of the glass table a steno pad rested against one folded knee and he twirled a felttip pen fingers twitching with desire to write this clearly was the reporter it was melford chapter i stared and started to speak but i checked myself id never asked what melford did for a living and he might as well be a reporter as anything else he might as well sell me down the river as anything else too but the thing was melford wasnt going to screw me over lightly not when we knew each others secrets the way we did at least thats what i had to assume so the best thing to do was to sit tight and follow melfords lead and hope to hell this thing didnt turn out to be the total disaster it looked like bobby took a seat on the dresser the gambler on the bed i eyed the older man with the linen suit to whom i hadnt been introduced i had the sense that this guy was important that he was maybe beyond names or something scary like that like maybe this was b b gunn so youre lem melford said standing up melford kean its finally nice to meet you in person he held out a hand his hair had been combed back he looked almost like a regular person though a tall and pale one we shook um weve never met before in any form in person or out of person lem melford said with a grave voice he shook his head as he sat back down its clear to me now that you werent supposed to talk to me if during our phone conversations you had told me that i wouldnt have betrayed your confidence but you didnt tell me did you i havent told you anything about anything i said weve never spoken lets be honest melford said theres no point in lying i had no idea what i was supposed to do should i go along with him or not though not going along with him would have involved exposing my connection to the murders but there was something encouraging in melfords eye and i was almost certain he wanted me to keep going the way i had been look im sure youre very good at your job i said but theres some fundamental mistake here ive never spoken to you about my work ive never spoken to you about selling encyclopedias and ive never spoken to you on the phone melford shook his head im sorry i got you in trouble but denying it isnt going to help i think maybe you should tell us why you called me in the first place maybe we can hash out some of your complaints in front of these guys in any case he offered with a selfsatisfied smile id like to hear how they respond to what you have to say i was floundering i didnt know what melford expected of me should i keep denying the charges would that be enough and why the hell would he do this to me without giving me a headsup you need to listen to me i said theres been a mistake jesus fucking dick the gambler snapped bb what do you want to do with this asshole the man in the linen suit looked up i dont really know im waiting for desiree to call me back i want to talk to her before i make any decisions the gambler snorted at me im getting sick of hearing you deny it youve spoken to him and we know it now say whatever it is you want to say so we can tell him what bullshit it is well i think maybe we should go a little more gently with mr altick melford suggested the fact is he was shy enough about talking to me in the first place that he disguised his voice on the phone i suddenly felt like i was being prompted disguised my voice i asked yeah it was a pretty good job you sounded totally different with your southern accent and all it was very convincing and your lisp and thats when i almost got it i hadnt realized that melford had overheard enough of my encounter with ronny neil and scott to have picked up on it but clearly he had i still had no idea why he was doing this but at least the what was clear i dont have a lisp i can see that now hold on one second bobby said the guy who called you had a lisp thats right did he have kind of a highpitched voice melford nodded now that you mention it fuck bobby said scott garland that piece of shit the gambler said i dont get it melford looked at them blankly you fucking asshole the gambler slammed his palm down hard on the table and then jabbed a finger in my direction did you have to piss him off so much that hed do something like this to get back at you i think bobby proposed that you may be taking this out on the wrong person he looked at me i owe you an apology lemmy i should have known you wouldnt do something like this give me a fucking break the gambler groaned get out of here he told me wait bb said i dont get it if i could suggest something else about scott and ronny neil i began but i didnt get any further get the fuck out of here the gambler shouted again and i did from the railings i could see chitra down at the pool drinking a tall boy and laughing at something that yvette from jacksonville was saying no sign of ronny neil or scott and i had a feeling that the two of them would be disappearing pretty soon the gambler wasnt going to take this lightly melfords ruse had been brilliant hed taken the heat off me while putting it onto my enemy granted this would have been a lot better if he had warned me but maybe not maybe melford could tell that i wasnt built for this kind of deception and that preparation would only have made things seem false none of that explained why he would bother to show up at all to help me exact petty revenge against ronny neil and scott because hed seen them picking on me it didnt ring true i glanced down at chitra once more i wanted to get that room with her more than ever but first i needed to make a call back in my room i dialed the number and a wearysounding miami herald operator picked up i asked if there was such a thing as a night desk editor i hadnt known that i was aware of any such position but there clearly was because without responding the operator put me through to a ringing line in a second a woman picked up the phone and mumbled her name with a fatigued slur something mcsomething i dont know if you can answer this i said but im calling from outside of jacksonville and im wondering if you have a reporter named melford kean on staff the woman laughed kean huh whats the trouble my stomach did little loops i was on to something no trouble im just wondering is all kean she said again is he bothering you please tell me hes bothering you hes not bothering me just confusing me a little yeah hes good at that i thought for a second what exactly did i hope to learn what story is he working on she laughed again what is he working on or what is he supposed to be working on anything is possible with that guy but he is a reporter at your paper yes like it or not he is and you dont like it nah she said moderating her tone the kids great just a little weird but that doesnt mean he doesnt do a decent job when he puts his mind to it or goes after the story hes assigned or makes deadline that bad i tried to sound sympathetic like the kind of person to whom she would want to open up how does he keep his job this is where being a pampered overeducated rich kid comes in handy for him hes the son of houston kean a big shot in the business community here the guy owns about a million car dealerships and he advertises a ton with us a ton so if the publisher wants this big advertisers son to remain employed she paused for a few seconds its late and im cranky forget i said any of that sure no problem but can you tell me what story hes working on i guess so i mean why not right there are two things one i cant tell you about except that we got a tip from another reporter one who didnt want to take the story herself a woman who works for one of the local tv stations but her beat is supermarket openings and celebrity visits so she passed it along theres some funny business going on in a trailer park near jacksonville but that happened after kean already left for jacksonville and its about as much as i can tell you and the other story get this she said as though we were old friends pets theres been a string of dog and cat disappearances in the area and he went down to investigate pets a hot piece of investigative journalism hes been working on the story for three weeks and hes yet to file a single paragraph its like he wants to get fired i dont get this guy i got him i got him with no trouble because suddenly everything started to make sense well not everything but some things and that was an improvement i was not about to waste any time i ran down the stairs and found chitra still in midchatter with a small cluster of friends she looked happy and radiant as though the business with ronny neil had never happened that was bad i wanted her to be afraid i took her hand come on i said as i yanked her up we have to go i pulled her by the hand into the little building with the registration desk i need a room i told sameen who appeared very disturbed that i was still holding on to chitra yes certainly he mumbled sameen i need it to be on the far side by the parking lot as far away from the educational advantage media group as possible i took out my wallet and put three twenties on the desk it was half the money i had on me and i hoped i wouldnt need it later this is a secret you understand sir theres a man in our group who tried to hurt this young lady tonight im trying to put her somewhere shell be safe the look on his face changed considerably he slid the money back toward me i do not need to be bribed to do the right thing he said softly you are a good boy to help her i blushed since i didnt feel like an especially good boy thanks i grabbed the key and still holding her hand half jogged around to the back of the motel where we found the room i opened the room led chitra inside and shut the door softly as though afraid to alert anyone thats some story chitra said she turned on the light and began to look around as though the room might somehow be different from the one she was already staying in the one with all her clothes i thought i took her hand again and kissed her swiftly on the lips listen chitra theres a lot going on and more than i have time to tell you i need to go somewhere and it is a little dangerous i dont want you to open the door for anyone but me and if im not back by meeting time tomorrow morning dont wait for them to come looking for you call a cab and get out of here go to the bus station just go home what is this about ronny neil cant be that dangerous can he i shook my head its not about ronny neil not the way you mean i think this whole operation educational advantage media all of it is a front for something else i dont know what exactly but it involves drugs and there are some pretty highpowered guys involved and people have already been hurt dont trust any of the bookmen especially not the gambler bobby might be okay but im not sure enough to tell you to trust him are you serious about all of this i nodded i wish i werent let me come with you she said i laughed a stupid guffaw of air its not a movie chitra i dont know what im doing and i dont want to take you along for the fun of watching me try to figure it out i just want you to be safe thats all thats how you can help by being safe she nodded all right remember dont let them come looking for you if im not back by nine tomorrow morning call a cab and go okay and give me your home phone number i said in case im not dead i want to call you chapter the reporter was gone convinced that the story was all a hoax hed seemed reluctant at first but a few hundred dollars had set him straight the gambler knew those guys liked to act all high and mighty but they were no better than anyone else now it was just him and bb he dumped some seagrams vodka into a plastic bathroom cup and then pulled the wet carton of orange juice from the ice bucket little disks of ice scattered over the brown carpet and he idly kicked them under the dresser while he mixed the drink you want he asked bb bracing himself for rejection since bb generally wouldnt drink anything but his fancy bullshit wine screwdrivers were beneath contempt bb shook his head nah weve got things to discuss the gambler said big strategic things that always work better with drinks you want to get some wine and then sit down to hash it out nah im okay jesus what was wrong with this guy another bombshell dropped and he sat there looking like a retard the screwdriver was too vodka heavy but he drank it down because why the hell not he then sat at the foot of the bed and looked at bb well lets do it what do you think about the kid the kid bb asked which one the older one holy hell he was still thinking about those boys outside his little empire was falling down around him and he was still thinking about sticking it to those boys outside altick the gambler tried to rein in his impatience you think hes probably okay yeah i think so what did desiree say about him she didnt see anything weird with him he said and then turned to look at the window even though the heavy cloth curtains had been drawn closed she said he seemed okay the gambler got the distinct impression that bb hadnt even talked to desiree not that it mattered altick was clearly a red herring in all this a poor asshole whod been in the wrong place at the wrong time not that it meant his troubles were over the way the gambler saw it doe was beyond corrupt they had a reporter snooping around the boss was coming undone by boy buggery and they had three dead bodies floating in a pit of pig shit and scott one of his own boys had been the one to tip off the reporter scott was going to have to go down for this why would scott do it the gambler had always taken care of him and ronny neil a sellout for big money he could understand but talking to a reporter out of some sort of resentment toward altick no doubt it was a bonehead move there could be no denying it but maybe the problem was that he hadnt given those boys enough to do maybe he needed to give them more responsibility in order to motivate them find a way to channel scotts rage so whats your next move he asked bb appeared suddenly to come awake i need to get my money gamb i cant have money like this just falling off the face of the earth weve got to face the real possibility that doe is bent and if he took the money were not getting it back without some serious violence you want to risk that i got the devildogs in gainesville bb said we know for a fact that it was doe we have them ride down here and beat it out of him the gambler shook his head bb was supposed to be the mastermind but hed become like a body without a head when his freaky bitch wasnt around the county has made life hell for motorcycle gangs here you know that the devildogs come riding in the sheriffs department is going to be all over them if a mayor and police chief get worked over and killed even a bullshit one like doe its going to mean a big investigation and were fucked if one of those numbnuts gets nailed by the cops you think theyre going to keep their traps shut next thing you know weve got the dea involved which means theyll find something or someone who will tell them about the lab and thats going to ultimately lead them back to us okay bb said quietly what do we do then how do we get the money i guess we have to figure out a way to get doe to find it to make him realize that it doesnt make any sense to rip us off how do we do that the gambler said nothing bb took this as a sign that the gambler too was out of ideas he stood up and walked to the door rested one hand on the knob lets wait until desiree gets back shell figure something out so thats it the gambler asked for now yeah thats it for now then all at once his face grew bright with a private joke therell be more later though and he was gone two drinks later his head filled with muted vodka clarity the gambler answered a knock at his door it was doe leaning against the doorjamb dressed in uniform bottle of yoohoo dangling in one hand i got a noise complaint he said neighbors say theres a sound of vibrating bullshit coming from your room the gambler stood aside to let him in and then quickly shut the door you want a drink he asked holding up his cloudy plastic cup doe held up his bottle i dont leave home without it the gambler sat in his chair by the window so what do you want i got a noise complaint he said neighbors say theres a sound of vibrating bullshit it wasnt funny the first time how about the second doe this isnt the tryouts for mad magazine so how about you tell me why youre taking up my time doe took a swig and flashed his crooked teeth i hate to bother you when youre sitting in a cheap motel drinking vodka by yourself and normally i wouldnt but hell gamb i think youll want to hear what i have to say then say it first of all lets cut the bullfuckingshit okay he walked over to the dresser and slammed the bottle down hard a crack appeared in the particleboard i know that you and bb are full of little ideas about how i ripped you off is that right that maybe i killed bastard and took the money and now im trying to pin it on this fucking hapless kid to get myself off the hook does that about cover it the gambler tried hard to look impassive this he knew was a showdown doe was there either to get himself off the hook for what hed done or to set the record straight fine either way it didnt much matter in the end since there were more important things than the the continuity of the operation for example and power when this little duel was over the gambler needed doe to think of him as tough decisive and in charge everything else even that chunk of cash was secondary he took a sip of his drink that pretty much covers it and you want me to come up with cash or face consequences i suppose ive had thoughts along those lines yes maybe you want to shut those thoughts the fuck up did you ever think of that no i never thought of that but since you did maybe you should tell me why doe shook his head in sad disbelief first of all i didnt kill bastard and that means someone did and that someone is still out there and has the money you can believe me or not but weve been doing this thing long enough that you know if id killed him id admit it hell if i stole the money and killed him id still admit to killing him id say he tried to rip us off and got caught and tried to kill me now that weve established how you would be lying if you were lying lets hear number two number fucking two doe said is why the fuck would i rip you off you cut me out or try to find the balls to take me out im worse off than if we keep going on like weve been im earning way too much from this shit to dick it up so think with your fucking head for a second instead of bbs snoop into my shit if you want i dont got any debts i got a pile in the caymans i want more and im not going to fuck with the system it was all true doe had relatively little to gain in the short term and nothing to gain in the long term by ripping them off in fact the only thing that made the gambler still doubt doe was the altick kid who said hed seen the chief snooping around bastards trailer but that could have had something to do with the girl he supposed he sat still looking thoughtful for a few more minutes and those are your two points no i got one more point point number three he said is that bb called the station today disguised his voice and said that you killed bastard and took the cash now i dont know who has the money but maybe that doesnt matter so much right now because bb has decided to fuck you up and i think you want me on your side how do you know it was bb if the voice was disguised because hes an asshole and i recognized him besides who knows that bastard is dead besides you me bb and his whore doe gave a half nod and how do i know you arent setting him up i guess you dont but you maybe want to decide what you believe because if bb figures out im not going to deal with you he might have a backup plan that takes you by surprise the gambler finished his drink and set down the plastic cup okay he said after a minute or so a minute he needed mostly to keep doe waiting ill keep this information in mind but lets be clear about something i dont care if you stole the money or not this is your house and your mess and you need to clean it up ill look into what you say about bb and id better not find out that youre fucking with me or im going to be pissed off but if youre not then were going to be under new management and new management says you clean up your fucking mess he stood up because if you cant get your act together then youre fucking worthless to me so by monday morning i want that money or i want to know what happened to it and if you go with choice number two youd better make me believe youre telling the truth now get the fuck out of here doe finished his bottle and dropped it on the floor i like that he said i like that forceful shit we need more of that around here he walked to the door and then turned around you want me to take care of bb why the gambler asked because things on your end are running so smoothly that you have lots of extra time no doe said because i figured you might want to keep your hands clean but have it your way boss when doe was gone the gambler rose to fix himself another drink fucking bb trying to screw him over why and his efforts were so inept it hardly mattered an anonymous phone call hed lost it completely and even if he hadnt been conspiring against the gambler hed have to go just for safetys sake so maybe there was some order in the universe he thought maybe there was a way to turn liabilities into assets and maybe he thought there was a way to turn scotts inappropriate rage into something more useful after his unsatisfying meeting with the gambler bb had gone out to a local mcdonalds for a strawberry milk shake and to take in the local scene he liked to go to mcdonalds there were always lots of happy kids getting the crappy food they loved in his work with the young mens foundation he saw only the unhappy boys he liked the happy ones too bb brought a newspaper with him but couldnt be bothered to read it he looked into nothingness and tried to avoid the stare of the bigeyed black kid behind the counter who acted as though hed never seen a man drink a milk shake before he ought to have seen it it probably happened pretty often in here after nearly an hour with no one interesting to look at bb went back to the hotel he figured he ought to be thinking about the money but that was desirees job and where was desiree he hadnt heard from her all day except for one hasty phone call in which shed said that the kid appeared to be hapless and clean but she was going to keep tailing him it wasnt like her not to check in more often approaching his room from the parking lot he could see there was a piece of paper taped to his door it was yellow widelined notebook paper with torn perforation when he pulled it free it took a good chunk of the doors aqua blue paint along with the tape it would be from the gambler or maybe doe possibly even desiree instead a clumsy childish hand had written in scrawling letters mister my dad called and said he wont be back before late and my little brother gone off with his aunt can i have that ice cream now and mabey talk about some stuff thats going on with my dad carl room bb folded up the note and held it in his hands then he unfolded it and read it once more he held the paper in one hand and then the other as though he could gauge its import from its flimsy weight could it be a joke who would play such a joke and what would be the point on the other hand how would that kid know his room number maybe hed asked the indian behind the counter the guy wasnt supposed to give out that sort of information but he probably didnt know any better since who knew what sorts of ideas about privacy they had in india where cattle wandered in and out of peoples houses besides carl was nothing but a little kid who surely didnt mean any harm carl he thought carl bb went into his room and washed his face combed his hair and put on a little bit of aftershave not too much since kids didnt like too much but enough so that hed smell mature and sophisticated thats what boys carls age wanted in a mentor they liked to be in the presence of a grown man who knew how to talk to a boy not that carl was worth all this fuss no reason to think he was back at home was chuck finn and chuck finn would be worth the fuss even so spending a little time with carl might be productive it would certainly be helpful to the young man and that was why he did this work after all he did it for the young men and for himself if he was going to be honest he liked the feeling of being helpful and there was something else too something on the edge of his vision just outside his range of hearing a smell too vague to identify but strong enough to notice but this wasnt the time maybe next week maybe with chuck but not just now bb felt as though something from the highway had soiled his suit so he dusted himself and headed out the door up the stairs and around back where he found the room somewhere in the distance he heard electronic pop from someones room assholes needed to learn to keep it down but carls room was mostly quiet the curtains were drawn but he could see a light on inside and vaguely hear a television droning before knocking he took out the note and read it once more making sure he had the room right and that he hadnt misunderstood the boys intentions no there could be no misunderstanding hed been invited bb knocked firmly yet kindly at least he hoped it sounded firm but kind in the distance he heard a voice say that he should come in he tried the handle and found it unlocked so he pushed it open on the bed he saw a yellow toy tractor so he knew he was in the right place but no sign of carl and inexplicably sheets of translucent plastic were covering the carpet hello he called out ill be right there came the voice high and childish bb felt himself smiling for just an instant he took another step inside and looked around it was like every other motel room but strangely neat for a place where two boys had been alone all day the bed was made no clothes around no toys but the tractor most of the lights were off and the tv which was tuned to a sitcom flashed blue into the gloom the laugh track erupted as someone did something and bb took a step closer to see what was so funny then it struck him the voice that called to him it didnt sound like the boy from the pool that boy hadnt sounded quite so young quite so childish in fact the more he thought about it the less that voice had sounded like a childs it sounded like someone imitating a child then he heard the door close behind him bb spun around and saw one of the gamblers assholes sitting there the fat one a rank odor like piss wafted up the kids piggy eyes were wide with excitement and he had a kind of openmouthed grin as though hed just issued the coup de grâce to a piñata and bb knew he fundamentally knew that this grinning asshole was the least of his worries he turned and saw the other one ronny neil ronny neil also had a goodsize grin going on in addition he had a wooden baseball bat with a fair number of dents in it dents that suggested it had been used for something other than drives to left field you sick fucking pervert ronny neil said the baseball bat arced high over his head and bb raised his hands to protect himself knowing even as he did it that his hands werent going to do him one bit of good chapter the walk to the kwick stop took a little over fifteen minutes at a brisk pace i was certain id seen an open hours sign out front and when i got there i bought a flashlight batteries and a large coffee to go i sat out front and loaded up the flashlight the coffee was lukewarm burned and too thick but i drank it quickly and within five minutes i was ready to go again i didnt much like the idea of wandering around meadowbrook grove after dark i would be in jim doe country and if the cop found me i had no doubt that id be in trouble serious trouble the kind of trouble from which you dont ever return but i was close to that kind of trouble now wasnt that what id learned from melford what id learned to put into practice that night with ronny neil it wasnt really a matter of how much trouble you were in but how you tried to get out of it i had to do something other than sit in the motel room i might have done that last week but not any longer i stayed off the roads i tried to stick to backyards ignoring the itch of insects and the various crawling hopping scurrying and slithering noises of the animals i startled from either sleep or their rounds i had to be careful of domestic animals too frantic barking would draw attention i knew from my late night rambles selling books those long hours after dark when i was trying desperately to bag one more shot at a sale before it was time to go home that dogs barked and owners ignored them at least they did at ninethirty but at close to two in the morning they might pay a bit more attention to furious barking when i turned onto bastard and karens street i stuck close to the trailers trying to keep out of the light it had been there all along the box of files in the trailer with oldham health services written along the side it held the key to everything to why melford had killed them and what he was hiding from me i felt a strange almost giddy excitement once i read through those files i would finally know i would finally know who melford really was what he was after and i would know if he really intended to let me out of all this unharmed i looked around the back of the trailer and saw that the door leading to the kitchen was open no sign of a car or of flashlight beams inside i went up to the door to listen no sound it was stupid idiotic i knew it but i went inside anyhow because i had to see i turned on the flashlight for a quick scan it was cheaply built and the light slouched out anemically but i still caught a glimpse of something on the kitchen floor i supposed i ought to be getting used to death but the sight of the body hit me like a punch in the gut i took a staggered step back and hit the kitchen counter i turned the feeble light on the figure again to be sure but there was no mistaking it in the distorting yellow of the flashlight beam i saw the face of the man whod been in the gamblers room the one in the linen suit the one whod looked as though he hadnt been paying much attention the one i believed to be b b gunn his face was well bloodied but i couldnt tell how he had been killed in fact i was largely past concerning myself i turned to rush out the door but a flashlight much brighter than my own hit my eyes i couldnt say i was particularly surprised in a way it seemed inevitable i stopped in my tracks the light was too bright for me to see who held it but i knew it could be only one person well well if it aint the hirer of private detectives jim doe said i stared at him how could he have known that you stupid fucking shit he said with a slight cackle you go to find out a thing or two about bb and you hire a buddy of mine to do it didnt you think for a minute that a guy who lives in meadowbrook grove might know me but i guess it dont matter because it seems to me like you are under arrest for murder there was a second maybe two seconds before i acted but i thought of lots of things in those couple of seconds i thought about how unlikely it was that doe would shoot me an unarmed encyclopedia salesman doe wanted to keep attention away from himself not draw attention closer considering that our earlier encounter had been observed by aimee toms the county cop the county cop who had warned doe to stay away from me a shooting now would only draw the kind of scrutiny doe could not afford on the other hand doe might easily shoot me and make me disappear and if that happened i would never see chitra again so i ran chapter the punk ran well what had doe expected that he would sit there and say i guess i got no choice but to come with you and probably get killed he was a fast runner too doe wasnt about to chase after him christ with the pain in his nuts he could barely walk let alone run he tried to pursue made it maybe a hundred feet before he had to stop as it was he felt like he might faint or puke well let him go it wasnt like doe needed to arrest someone for bbs murder he could just toss the body in the waste lagoon probably better that way anyhow now bent over breathing in hard painful bursts hands on his knees doe spent a minute just trying to clear his head get the swirling black things out of his vision the problem now was going to be getting rid of bb and it was pretty much does problem alone earlier that night his phone had rung and on the other end a disguised voice his second of the day but doe had known without a doubt that it was the gamblers punk asshole ronny neil had told him hed better get over to karens trailer there was a surprise waiting there he couldnt fault the little shit for being dishonest bbs dead body was a surprise all right hed been worked over good too beaten so that his legs were like jelly and his head half caved in one of his eyes bulging wide open was half out of its socket theyd killed him good and proper no message no instruction but doe didnt need to be told what it meant or what he needed to do the gambler had taken bb out which was only right if anything doe was relieved that the gambler had stepped up to the plate like hed said before there were bigger things involved here certainly bigger than his ego there was money and even if bb hadnt been fucking with the gambler hed been slipping up right good still this body presented some real problems the first being that the freaky cunt would think that doe had done it theyd dumped the body on does turf just to make trouble for him to make sure he knew this was the gamblers show doe didnt care doe didnt care who called the shots as long as the shots got called and as long as the money came with it the gambler thought he had some toughguy shit to prove that was just fine he thought he needed to put the pressure on doe say come up with the money or an explanation that was fine too doe didnt get to where he was by not being able to deal with the pressure hed do what the gambler wanted as a show of good faith so hed get the message that things were working and there was no point in messing up an orderly system the gambler would have to understand that this operation worked because it was under the radar it worked because no one was paying attention to them that had always meant small crews limited exposure and no bloodbaths four people had died this weekend and that was plenty no way the gambler was going to take him out even so he might get cut out or cut back or slighted begging to remain in good graces might be beneath his dignity but if it meant cash then doe would deal with it for now all of which meant getting to the bottom of this shit and that was fine too because doe knew what was what now he knew why the kid had squealed on him to the gambler and he knew where the money was it was now that simple find the kid find the money chapter i had never been by track team standards an especially fast runner i did better in longer races but even in those id win only rarely still i would do well once in a while with the fivehundredmeter with half marathons the point wasnt to win but to finish but if i hadnt been the fastest runner in the county or even at my own school i was a hell of a lot faster than an aging outofshape crooked cop with a bad haircut i cranked my legs into the darkness spinning them wildly until i felt like a cartoon character whose lower half was just a blurry wheel beneath the torso sometimes at the end of long runs i liked to push it and i marveled that my legs could do such things that i could move so fast and with such force without paying attention to how my feet hit the ground id never punched it like this in near total darkness with a cop on my trail it didnt matter i ran and i kept running until i was sure id gone two miles maybe more i was used to pacing myself attuning my speed to my natural rhythms but not now now there was only speed fast as i could go and nothing else mattered i was now out of the trailer park and into an area of small older homes it was the sort of place where halfrebuilt halfrusting cars sat in backyards where lawns were crisscrossed with missing grass where broken swing sets creaked in the wind and it was familiar i was sure id been here before i walked for a moment to catch my breath two miles wasnt much but id gone about as fast as i ever had then while walking bent over panting i realized i had indeed been there before i had sold books there i was just down the street from galen edwine at whose barbecue id sold four sets of books the fabled grand slam that had never paid off but galen edwine had taken a shine to me the way customers sometimes did with bookmen hed told me to come back anytime hed said let me know if you ever need anything i needed something now i needed shelter and a place to rest where jim doe would never look for me it took about five minutes to find the house i was sure it was the right place because of the garden gnomes that had so encouraged me that day it was well after two in the morning now and the house was entirely quiet and dark i rang the doorbell i rang it a couple of times to suggest urgency and to make certain that the unexpected chime didnt simply fade into a dream i saw a light go on in the bedroom and i heard a scrape just outside the door who is that asked a panicked voice galen its lem altick do you remember i tried to sell you some encyclopedias a couple of months ago you told me if i ever needed anything i let it hang the door opened slowly and galen wearing boxers and a tshirt stared at me with sleepy eyes that hung beneath a glossy slope of balding scalp i didnt expect you to take me up on it he said but there was nothing harsh in his voice if anything he seemed amused i have kind of an emergency i told him i need a place to stay just for a few hours galen scratched his head with one hand and opened the door the rest of the way with the other come on in then lisa galens wife came out in her robe yawned a hello and went back to sleep if she found something unusual in a doortodoor salesman returning to their home in the middle of the night she didnt say anything about it galen and i went to the kitchen where he put on some coffee and took out a box of chocolatecovered doughnuts i looked at the ingredients which included butter and milk and eggs i passed you want to tell me whats going on i told him not all of it not even most of it just enough i told him that id run afoul of jim doe from meadowbrook grove and that doe wanted to frame me for a murder that he had likely committed himself galen shook his head yeah i know that guy we all do around here hes bad news lem but ill tell you i know the sheriffs people have their eye on him and i wouldnt be surprised if the fbi did too he wont get away with it go to the county and tell them everything believe me theyll treat you like a hero i nodded and tried to look relieved but his suggestion didnt help me i didnt want to have to survive some longterm investigation that would eventually shift the blame from me to doe i just wanted to get out of there alive well galen said after a few minutes maybe you can look up something useful in those encyclopedias i bought from you i looked at him what do you mean what do you mean what do i mean i mean i said you never got those encyclopedias sure i did but the credit application never went through sure it did theres nothing wrong with my credit galen took me to the living room where the entire set rested in the place of honor on the bookshelves next to the television the rest of the shelves were filled with knickknacks and photographs of his son and older people i assumed were his parents and inlaws not another book in sight but they told me the credit app didnt go through i dont get it but i did i got it just fine what about your friends did they get theirs of course it was bobby goodguy bobby was skimming from his own sales force telling us sales didnt go through when they did so he could take the commission for himself they stole from you didnt they galen said with unexpected gravity yeah i told him they did i cant say im surprised those operations arent always as honest as you want and maybe yours is less honest than most you know the same weekend you were in town a couple of boys came by my younger brothers house twelve miles or so from here and they were selling books using a lot of the same language that you used my brother isnt married doesnt have kids so when he told them he didnt want anything they tried to sell him speed one of them seemed kind of pissed off that the other one had brought it up but my brother looks the part hes real skinny long hair tats they must have thought he was a kindred spirit and decided to take a chance you believe that i nodded i could believe it because thats what all of this had been about this whole thing was an excuse to distribute speed thats why ronny neil had said that bobby didnt know what was going on why it was better to be with the gambler than with bobby bastard had worked over at the hog lot i got the impression hed been in on the speed deal but when hed been shot jim doe and the gambler must have thought it was drug related thats why they got rid of the bodies they didnt want the county cops or the fbi getting involved messing up the operation do you think i could trouble you for a ride in the morning i asked of course i need to be at my motel before nine what do you plan to do i plan to get a friend of mine get the hell out of here and never come back galen nodded thats a good plan he said thanks to the magic of utter exhaustion i actually managed to get a few hours of sleep on galens couch before morning came i ate a strangely cheerful breakfast actually i just ate some fruit with galen lisa and their sixyearold son toby then galen told me hed drop me off on the way to work i asked him to let me out behind the motel and i thanked him profusely then i knocked on chitras door she didnt look as though shed slept much if at all her eyes were sunken and red and she might even have been crying lem she gasped she pulled me into the room and then pressed her whole body against mine and squeezed hard under the circumstances it was just what i needed the downside was that it seemed to me an inopportune time for an erection and there was no way she didnt notice but if she found it distasteful she was kind enough to keep it to herself tell me what is going on i told her as much as i could in a rambling fashion i told her about jim doe and the drugs and the pigs and murders though i left melford out of it it seemed to me too much to explain how it was that i knew melford was a killer and hadnt turned him in how id become friends with him it made no sense so it was best not spoken of particularly since she didnt much trust melford we need to go i told her the gamblers not going to be happy to see me and neither is this guy doe lets just call a cab and get out of here it doesnt matter where they dont want me around will probably hurt me if they see me but they wont come after us they just want me gone and i mean to give them what they want do you want to come with me to my house for a few days just to make sure they dont come looking for you at yours yeah i whispered i want to go with you we called the cab and in ten minutes we went outside determined to abandon whatever personal belongings selling clothes and toiletries mostly were still in our rooms too bad for us there was no way i was going back for that stuff idling in front of the motel was a yellow checker but as we walked toward it i caught the flashing lights out of the corner of my eye i saw in an instant because i was getting good at that sort of thing that it was a brown county car not a blue meadowbrook grove car and that was something but it wasnt much i felt that jarring electric zap in my stomach not a loose wire zap but a strapped to the electric chair with a black hood over your head sort of jolt and for an instant i felt that i would start running commanded by my feet and a base animal instinct i would simply take off and be gone but that never happened the woman from the day before aimee toms got out of the car her face was blank impassive strangely appealing in its authority i need to talk to you she said to me i want you to come with me am i under arrest i just want to ask you some questions i turned to chitra you go i said go to the bus station and go home ill call you ill come see you im not going without you she said you have to believe me im in way over my head but youre not in any real danger if im not around and ill be better off if i dont have to worry about you she nodded then she kissed me i couldnt say exactly what the meaning was but i can tell you that i liked it a whole hell of a lot and then officer toms led me into the back of the police car and drove me away chapter aimee toms stared straight ahead or i thought she did but i couldnt be sure with her eyes hidden behind her mirrored sunglasses even when she talked to me she didnt move her head sitting behind the passenger seat i watched her firm lower jaw work its way over a piece of gum that i knew without asking her or seeing it would be sugarless so whats your story kid she asked after wed pulled out of the motel i didnt kill them i was there but i didnt do it and i couldnt have stopped it the words sat there drew me in with their gravity well tried to shape my answer the way tracks shape the path of a train but i wasnt going to give in i was going to try to tough it out and if things became too frightening i could always break down later im just trying to make some money to go to college i told her i got into columbia but i cant afford it south carolina new york never heard of it the school not the city you look kind of collegey she observed which is why i dont understand why youre getting involved in all of this all of what my voice cracked like her gum you tell me im really sorry i trespassed yesterday i said but you didnt seem to think it was a big deal then why is it a big deal now trespassing isnt such a big deal officer toms agreed on the other hand drugs and murder now thats a big deal i dont understand i said it didnt sound convincing because the fear wafted out of my mouth the hot vapor of fear in the cold airconditioning of the car listen lemuel lem lem i confirmed listen lem im a pretty good judge of character i look at you i talk to you i see youre not a bad guy believe me ive been doing this long enough and it doesnt take that long im sorry to say to know that good people get mixed up in bad things sometimes they dont understand what theyre doing sometimes theyre just in the wrong place at the wrong time but instead of coming forward they hide and lie and break more laws to cover things up all of this came uncomfortably close to the truth and i knew there was nothing i could say that wouldnt reveal that closeness i looked out the window instead all im saying she continued is that if you tell me everything thats going on ill do all i can to help you out to see that youre not punished for being a victim of circumstance even if you think its too late to talk it isnt i dont know what you mean i said all i did was wander a little too close to a farm i dont see why its a big deal we can do it that way if you want she told me she didnt say anything else until we arrived at the station it looked like an old office building and except for their uniforms the cops inside might have been just generic weary civic employees the air conditioner gurgled mightily but produced little cold air and overhead electric fans turned slowly enough that documents would not dislodge from desks toms had a hand on my upper arm and squeezed with a kind of firm sympathy my arms were behind my back she hadnt cuffed me but it seemed like a good idea to keep them back there out of respect or to acknowledge that i knew she could cuff me so there was no point in flaunting my freedom as we walked down a pale green cinderblocklined hallway which looked like a forgotten annex of my high school we passed a uniformed officer walking a handcuffed black guy in the opposite direction he was just a teenager really tall and lanky with a shaved head and the ghost of a mustache he might have been my age but he had the hard look of a criminal in his eyes violent and seething and apathetic i cast him a glance as we passed as though to say that we were both victims of an oppressive system but the kid looked back with rage as if he would kill me if he ever had the chance toms shook her head george kingsley you get a good look at him enough to tell hed slit my throat just for the fun of it yeah hes like that the thing is lem i knew him when he was this smart little twelveyearold his father had all kinds of problems with the law which was why i knew him but his mothers a good lady who saw he got to school and stayed out of trouble but this kid did more than just follow the rules he was always reading and talking about stuff the ideas the political ideas youd hear from him a kid of twelve or thirteen he was going to fix all the problems in the world he was going to be a politician and help the black people and he knew which laws he would repeal which he would pass it was incredible i guess it didnt do him much good as near as i can figure it he was hanging with some of the wrong kids one day when one of them decided it was time to stick up a convenience store kingsley thought they were there for candy this other kid he pulled out a gun stupidest thing i dont think the others knew he was planning anything but they wouldnt lay it all on their friend so kingsley goes to juvie for deciding to buy a snickers with the wrong people he was only in for eighteen months but when he came out he was different it was like theyd beaten all the heart out of him he went in this lively engaged little spitfire someone on track to maybe really change the world for the better and he came out just another thug from the thug machine thats a real tragedy i said doing my best to sound as though i meant it i was having a hard time focusing on george kingsleys problems when i had some doozies of my own yeah it is a real tragedy you want that to happen to you you plan to head off to columbus university dont you how about the university of getting raped every night she was trying to unnerve me but what was the point i was already plenty unnerved i wasnt some tough kid who needed to be scared straight but i was a bit of a smartass if everyone knows that weaker prisoners are getting raped by more vicious prisoners i said how come no one does anything about it i dont know she said maybe you can raise that with the warden once youre inside i didnt want to think about melfords prison riddle but that was all i could think about because i now knew the answer i understood what melford had been getting at i understood why we had prisons if they didnt work i understood why we put lawbreakers in criminal academies to turn them into more dangerous more bloodthirsty more alienated criminals i knew why kingsley had gone in a victim and come out a victimizer prisons were set up that way because they did work they just worked at something more sinister than id ever realized we sat in a small interrogation room around a flimsy metal table that had been bolted to the floor i guess the cops thought some thief might try to make off with it if they werent careful the surrounding walls were all the same pale green cinder block as the hallways except for the billowy mirror facing me i had no doubt that someone could be watching from the other side though i thought it unlikely that anyone would be bothered toms sat across from me and leaned forward on her elbows okay she said you know why youre here no i dont i told her i have no idea why im here only partially true i had no idea what they knew and what they didnt know what struck me however was how calm i felt maybe it was because i believed aimee toms to be basically friendly and maybe because id faced scarier moments than this a whole bunch of them in the past couple of days i felt okay i felt like if i played it cool the way melford did id be all right lets talk about lionel semmes she said i felt myself suck in a breath not out of recognition but out of exasperation lionel semmes there was yet another player in all this how deep did all this go who is that toms sighed you might know him as bastard oh bastard right what about him tell me about him well i said thoughtfully i tried to sell him some encyclopedias but he and his wife didnt want to buy i remember him because i dont usually spend so much time with a family without making a sale plus he was kind of intense and creepy and i shrugged thats all i dont know anything else why bastard wasnt married but he and his girlfriend are missing no one has seen them since friday night as best we can tell you are the last person to see them alive that might or might not on its own make you a suspect but then i find you at bastards place of work being hassled by jim doe bastards employer and then you were going around to bastards neighbors asking questions about him you can see how my mind is working here cant you i suddenly felt dizzy at the time i had suspected the canvass of the neighbors to be a colossal mistake now i knew it why had melford insisted i do it i couldnt help but hear the echoes of chitras doubt in my head had he wanted me to be seen i never did that i lied we have neighbors who say they saw you yesterday asking questions about bastard and karen at least they say they saw someone who fits your description we can do a lineup if thats what you want but i think we both know what the lineup will show do a lineup i said with a shrug i could think of nothing to do but bear down act tough i had to choke back a little smile because i could feel it happening to me the way it happened to the others here i was nothing more than a suspect but the system was already turning me into something else something more badly socialized if i stayed in prison long enough i might even turn into something dangerous we searched his trailer aimee said we found blood samples i studied her she did not mention having found a dead guy with a combover so i could only assume that doe had removed him we found lots of fingerprints too i suspect that some will be yours i already told you that i tried to sell them books of course some will be mine she shrugged and what about the blood any thoughts not really no one was bleeding while i was there it could be theirs could be you killed them and cleaned up but made mistakes thats crazy why would i kill them i dont know them how would i have gotten rid of the bodies i dont even have a car my guess is that you had help im also guessing that whoever did it might have dumped the bodies in the waste lagoon and as soon as we have enough evidence for a warrant well find out it would explain what you were doing there officer you saw me did i look like id just hauled two bodies into a seething pile of pig crap i was a little beaten up and a little bloodied but i wasnt covered with sweat whatever she conceded the truth is we dont know were working on theories that blood might have been from bastard and karen it might not karens mother hasnt been seen for a couple of days so she might have killed them karens mother i thought the third body there are other possibilities she said bastard was into stealing pets the blood might be animal blood he was into stealing pets i tried to sound both surprised and disgusted what for hell if i know we had a bunch of complaints about it but we couldnt really prove anything i talked to him myself but she shrugged a lot of people were sure it was bastard but without evidence there wasnt anything we could do and if he was keeping any evidence he might have at his girlfriends trailer in does jurisdiction we were pretty well blocked since bastard worked for doe so you let him get away with it i asked he was taking peoples dogs and cats and you just let him do it like i said there wasnt much we could do legally not without proof that sounds pretty lame to me can we stick to the point here i guess so it just seems kind of odd to me is all the problem is not that dogs and cats are missing its that people are missing and might be dead and i think you know something about it i dont know anything about it should i have a lawyer youre not under arrest she said then can i go she appeared to be pondering this question when there was a knock at the door she excused herself and came back a minute later shaking her head we just got a call that bastard karen and karens mother checked in theyre visiting relatives in tennessee i guess karen called a neighbor who told her that everyone thought she was dead and so she called into the police station melford strikes again i thought i tried not to smile so if theyre not dead theres no murder and you no longer have to protect me from being wrongfully prosecuted she winced sure sounds that way doesnt it but i have to tell you im not convinced youve been honest with me i dont know what youre up to but take it somewhere else i dont want it going on around here i didnt say anything there was no percentage in denying it again and i didnt want to nod as though she were right i guess ill go then but maybe you should take that pet business more seriously why was i getting into this instead of getting the hell out of there look weve got robbery and drugs and murder and rape aplenty to keep us busy missing doggies and kitties are pretty low on the list of priorities so a guy like bastard can do what he wants so long as he denies it i applauded myself on the clever use of the present tense basically yeah besides next time you wander over to the hog lot take a look inside when you see how those pigs are treated maybe youll get a new perspective i mean how different are they from dogs and cats except theyre not cute and cuddly right so if its no big deal to kill one why not the other it was a good question but i suspected melford would say she was answering it the wrong way only once i got outside did i wonder how i was going to get back to the motel i went back in and told the cop at the front desk that i needed a ride this isnt a taxi service he said well i didnt ask to be picked up and taken here on charges of killing people who arent dead so maybe someone can give me a lift back this isnt a taxi service the cop said i conceded the point told him i understood it was a police station and asked if i could be put in contact with an actual taxi service im not a phone book the cop said can you please tell me how i can get a cab the guy shrugged reached behind his desk and handed me a yellow pages and then pointed to a pay phone at least i had some coins so i didnt have to hear how the cop was not a change machine with the cab on its way i returned the phone book and went to wait outside five minutes later the cab showed up i told him to take me to the bus station where i hoped i might still be able to catch chitra i slunk into the backseat and leaned against the torn leather closing my eyes almost ready for sleep when i felt the car slow down i opened my eyes again but we werent near the bus station yet instead we were on the grassy roadside a ten or fifteenfoot patch of crabgrass and weeds that separated the road from the algae green canal i saw flashing blue and red lights as the cab pulled over the car behind us was navy and white and i recognized the stretch of road we were in meadowbrook grove and i watched doe get out of his car and swagger over toward me chapter doe sauntered over to the car licking his lips he was enjoying this he peered at the cabbie for a minute you know you were speeding no sir i wasnt i know this is a fortyfive zone and i was going fortyfive you were going fortyseven doe said the cabbie laughed two miles an hour youre gonna write me up for that dont matter said doe thats the limit the limit aint a rough estimate its the limit its the speed over which you dont ever go not a speed you try to stick to that aint right the cabbie said take it to court he grinned at the driver he went back to his car and wrote up the ticket he returned and handed it over ill advise you not to speed anymore in my town the cabbie said nothing oh and by the way doe said you know you got a wanted criminal in the backseat he rapped on the window with his knuckles hey there friend youre under arrest this time at least he didnt bother with the handcuffs he just put me in the back of the car the whole thing had been a disaster i kept telling the cabbie to call the police and the cabbie kept saying that this guy was the police the county i said call officer toms at the sheriffs department and tell her that this guy arrested me look i dont know what you want the cabbie said while doe led me away i just told you what i want i shouted but after doe locked me away he went back for a few more words to the cabbie and i somehow didnt think the message would get through now in the back of does police car which smelled of stale french fries yoohoo and sweat i glanced out the window watching the bleak scrub brush on the empty lots pass by i could hardly feel the airconditioning in the back and the sweat was rolling down my sides not that my comfort much mattered since i might very well be dead soon i considered this idea with a measured calm though calm might be putting it too strongly resignation maybe i ran over all the possibilities i could think of doe would arrest me question me hand me over to the gambler torture me let me go all of it but i kept coming back to one inevitable conclusion it seemed pretty likely that doe would kill me sure there were reasons why it would be illadvised aimee toms had her eye on the situation and all that sort of thing but if doe killed me and hid the body it would look like id just taken off it was what id been planning on doing anyhow as long as they never found a body doe would be off the hook so it wasnt as though i were trying to convince myself that everything would be all right i didnt believe everything would be all right i thought it extremely unlikely that everything would be all right but there was a calm nevertheless like i imagined what a soldier must feel before he went into a hopeless battle or a fighter pilot on realizing that hed been critically hit and that he was going down with the plane so here i was crashing doe drove to the hog lot no surprise there he parked the car around the back where it would be invisible to any but the most diligent search party and then he shoved me still unhandcuffed toward the pig warehouse maybe i should make a break for it i thought id already outrun doe once and he walked like a man who had trouble moving legs wide apart ambling slow but there was too much open space and we were too far from anyone who might see or hear my efforts to escape doe would have an easy shot at me if he wanted a more heroic man might have tried to overpower the cop but i knew that would only end badly if not laughably so i allowed myself to be pushed forward and i waited for an opportunity and hoped for a lucky break or at least the ability to comport myself in a respectable way doe took out a set of keys and shoved one into the padlock on the door it opened blasting us in the face with heat and stench i winced but watched as doe didnt he was used to it i thought or he just didnt care doe pushed me inside the building and through the narrow corridors separating the pens i had seen it before of course but now in the dim light of the pig warehouse with the low and despairing grunts of the animals around me i felt a new and sharper sense of pity maybe it was identification the pigs backed away from us and the slow movement of the exhaust fans strobed their movements toward the middle of the room one of the pens contained a wooden chair the sort of thing you might see in an old schoolhouse the kind that had been standing since the fifties or longer i had seen such things at my own high school weird aberrations among the metalandplastic hybrids that dominated alone and out of place like a neanderthal among cromagnons doe opened the gate and shoved me inside then latched it closed again with me inside there was something comical in this the gate wasnt four feet high and it wouldnt have taken much of an effort to get out but then it was latched for the pigs somehow i was troubled by the indignity of his thinking i required no more safeguards than the pigs all right then he said looks like you aint going anywhere for a while so i figure we can have ourselves a little talk sounds like a plan i agreed my voice wavered but under the circumstances i thought i did the toughguy thing pretty well there was even a kind of pleasure a satisfaction in acting tough in projecting swagger even while still i understood now why people did it doe studied me for a moment what you probably know what you probably dont need me to say is that i want to know where my money is i figured that out i said i bet you did so where is it i dont know i shook my head the thing about pigs doe said is that theyll eat anything and they love the taste of blood they just love it and these here pigs havent been fed so good lately so theyre mighty hungry if i tied your leg to that there chair and cut it open those pigs are gonna be on you like a bunch of sharks theyre gonna be sticking their snouts in the wound pushing it open lapping it up next thing you know that whole leg is gone but theyre gonna keep eating theyre like piranhas on land you ever wonder if youd even be able to feel pigs eating your nuts if youd already had to live through them eating your leg i never wondered that i said i have wondered what it would be like to watch it happen i might just find out too if i dont get my money i took a deep breath listen i dont really know whats going on here i know you had something going on with the gambler and probably bastard and the guy in the linen suit sounds to me like you know a whole hell of a lot but thats about it and look i know that bastard is dead and the miamivice guy is dead im guessing your money is lost or theres only one person who might have it the gambler doe thought about that for a minute it crossed my mind but he says you told him i was hanging around before bastard got killed i think you wanted him to figure i took the money and that means youve been running some sort of scam on us listen to me i dont have anything to do with this im just trying to make it through this weekend i have no interest in turning you in or anything like that just let me go doe laughed aint no chance of that until i find out what happened to the money so tell me this what was going on with you and bastard me nothing i never met him before i knocked on his door the other night doe shook his head i dont buy it there was something with the two of you and you been asking about him even those morons at county think you had something to do with him youd still be there if i hadnt convinced one of karens neighbors to call in and say they were still alive doe had called at the time i had thought it was melford whod rescued me but it was doe well gosh thanks as far as im concerned you knew him and had something going with him something to do with that missing money now you want to tell me the rest and that was when i realized that all of this was because of melford melford had planned it all along the fingerprints on the gun which he claimed he would never use sending me to ask questions about bastard in meadowbrook grove so witnesses would report that id been hanging around asking questions about a guy the cops suspected had been killed had he even somehow arranged for me to sell encyclopedias at karens house i couldnt see how such a thing would be possible but melford was a mastermind anything was possible id thought he was my friend for trying to help me get the checkbook back but melford was so meticulous he would have gotten rid of the checkbook after hed killed his victims the budding friendship with desiree now struck me as implausible too theyd hit it off immediately despite the fact that she worked for b b gunn now i realized it wasnt despite the fact it was because of it he kept telling me to forget about the money and now i knew why because he had it himself i had been an idiot all the talk of prison riddles and animal rights and ideology had been a smoke screen why hadnt i listened to chitra shed seen it and i hadnt something shifted inside of me i was willing to be dignified in the face of adversity when i was the victim of a psycho cop but not when i was the victim of a double cross there was no way i was going to let melford get away with it doe might have been disgusting but melford i now saw was diabolical all right i said i think i have it figured out i think i finally understand theres this guy a strangelooking tall guy with white hair named melford kean he set this whole thing up he killed bastard and karen and then took the money and for the past two days hes been making it look like i did it but it was him the whole time it had to have been him look i dont like you and i dont want to help you but this guy has screwed me over and ill help you get him and your money all you have to do is let me go so this guy melford kean has the money doe said thats right and youll help me find him i will and when i find him ill get my money yes i said i dont think its that hard to understand it aint hard to understand your words doe said just why i should be expected to believe such a bullshit story why cant you believe it i asked almost pleaded i was sure i would be able to save myself with this or at the very least buy some time in which aimee toms might save me or i might think of something mostly doe explained because keans been working with me and there he was walking out of the shadows grinning at me do you really think im strange looking melford asked first you tell people im gay and then you tell them im funny looking thats hurtful and in the dimness of the pig barn under the flashing vents he looked more than strange he looked vampiric his hair stood out his face was long and pale and his eyes were wide not childlike wide but insane wide how had i not noticed it before how could you do this to me i cried out i felt the urge almost unbearable to leap up and rush him but does gun kept me in place you want me to explain myself to you when you were just about to sell me out thats pretty hypocritical dont you think look i went to jim when i realized there was money missing and he and i have been tracking it since yesterday and our efforts led us to you i thought you were clean at first but then all the evidence pointed to your outsmarting me and getting the money out of the trailer i think youd better start talking melford somehow believed truly believed that i had the money maybe he thought the encyclopedia business was all bullshit or maybe he found out that i hadnt told him about the gambler maybe because he played and manipulated and lied he thought everyone else did as well and that my complaints and fears and hesitation had all been in the service of tricking him and maybe hed killed bastard and karen for no more complicated reason than he wanted money and now he was willing to kill me to get it too i hadnt wanted to see it before but there it was it was ideology the one thing about which melford hadnt lied we see what we think is there not the truth never the truth this is bullshit i said with a kind of indignation i didnt know i could summon but it was bullshit that was the thing it was unadulterated cosmic bullshit doe studied me for a moment and then turned to melford you come to me you tell me you can hook me up now i better not find out that youve been fucking with me id never fuck with you jim dont sweettalk me asshole then how about this i want my cut so ive got no reason to fuck with you you sure hes got it cant be sure of anything in this crazy world some people think the lunar landing was a hoax of course that wasnt really in this world he paused and observed does expression im pretty sure hes got it okay doe said lets take it outside what happened to feeding him to the pigs melford asked i have a better idea with the glare of the sun in my eyes they marched me toward the waste lagoon i could barely breathe for the fear and the stench and i thought that i did not want to die with the smell of shit in my nostrils i didnt want to die at all but i knew that as options tightened goals grew more meager i knew doe and the gun were maybe ten feet behind me i could hear him walking with his wide awkward gait melford was between the two of us i suspect because whatever deal he and doe had struck there was no trust there doe told me to stop at the lagoons edge where the stakes in the dry earth marked the perimeter and the flies buzzed a greedy manic hum a single black mangrove tree its roots gnarling into the pond provided a modicum of shade doe told me to turn around the two men stood next to each other but only for an instant doe gestured at melford with his gun go stand over there a little ways i want to be able to keep my eye on you you dont trust me fucking shit no ill trust you when i got my money and i never hear from you again until then i figure youre about to doublecross me thats how you survive in this game does that mean i should figure youre about to doublecross me as well he asked just stand on over there and stop pissing me off always good advice when talking to an armed man at the shore of a waste lagoon melford said he took a few long strides over toward where doe had been gesturing so now he was the third point of an equilateral triangle doe probably figured he could keep an eye on melford from there but not shoot him accidentally if he needed to fire at me something like that i tried to resist making eye contact with melford the powerless rage i felt at that moment was so great that i couldnt endure looking at the source of those feelings i had broken into a criminals hotel room i had gone snooping around jim does backyard id been in a raid on an animal test facility id faced ronny neil cramer and id gotten the girl i had in short faced down powerless lem and replaced him with a new lem one who took charge of his own life and now i was being held at gunpoint on the shore of a sea of shit betrayed by a man i should never have trusted in the first place despite my wishes i made eye contact anyhow a flash of something impish crossed his face and he winked at me and with one finger pointed toward the ground i felt the thrill of exaltation a sign though an unclear one the wink i understood a universal sign after all but what did the ground mean what did any of it mean had melford screwed me over or not if he hadnt what was i doing here what was he planning on doing about doe no i could not assume this was anything but a trick a ruse to put me off my guard but to what end how you like that shithole doe asked me compared to other shitholes or compared to i dont know an orange grove you think youre mighty tough dont you i had to stifle the urge to laugh doe was buying the tough thing that was something not much but something im trying to make the best of a difficult situation i said melford cocked his head slightly the impish look the winking companion was gone he looked like a bird studying human commotion from a distance studying it with an amalgamation of curiosity and obliviousness in the sunlight he looked slightly less hellish than hed appeared in the pig shed but only slightly now he was only cadaverous and mean i always wanted to see someone drown in a pool of shit doe said ever since i was a little kid you also wanted to see someone get eaten by pigs i guess life is all about making choices it looks to me like im going to get at least one wish now before we even start negotiating i want you to step on in there wade in until youre about waist deep waist deep in the waste he laughed at that i looked at the lagoon i wanted to stay alive unpunctured by bullets but there was no way i was going in there no way besides once i did i was nothing more than the walking dead id never be able to escape i had to get away but if i did that now id be dead in seconds the determination to die on the run faded like a drop of food coloring in a still lake i would go along with what they asked i would stall for what time i could get and each second i would hope for something some miracle maybe in the form of a county police car or a helicopter or an explosion or something come on doe said move wait a second melford interjected lets give him a chance to answer some questions first doe whipped around to look at melford for an instant i thought fists would fly you getting soft on me he narrowed his eyes daring melford to piss him off its not my softness you want to worry about melford explained its the bottom of the lagoon its all settled shit in there and theres not going to be a solid bottom it could suck him in before we know what happens and then we get no answers no answers no money i guess well find out wont we he gestured toward me with the gun now get the fuck in there i wanna see him sink into that shit but thats exactly why i shouldnt go in there i said making a lame stab at deploying my sales technique doe only looked back at me with disgust i looked at the waste lagoon seething and clotted as devoid of life and light as a black hole i needed to go to columbia i needed to have sex with chitra i needed to live outside of florida i couldnt die in a pool of pig excrement it was too pathetic yet the only way i could think of was a tactic from the book of a thirdgrade prankster it was absurdly stupid but it was all i had so i took a crack at it thank god i said pointing to behind doe its the county cops doe spun his neck around studied the emptiness i didnt have time to turn to see what melford was doing because i was already charging doe i had no idea what i was going to do even if my charge was successful if i managed to knock doe down and took his gun id still have melford to deal with i would face melford i decided when i had to face melford id have to get that far i guessed i was ten long strides from doe and i had covered two of them before doe realized how idiotically hed been duped he turned and looked at me he began to draw his pistol at three steps he was raising it i was going to be shot i wouldnt even be halfway toward tackling him before i was gunned down it had been a foolish plan but at least i wasnt going to die in the waste lagoon at least i would die with dignity stride four and the gun was aimed but it wasnt aimed at me i managed a quick glance over my shoulder and saw melford looking at doe and raising his own pistol the wink had been real the rest had been a masquerade melford hadnt betrayed me not really i still had no idea what all of this was about why everything had happened but i knew that melford was not my enemy and that he was going to save me then i heard the crack of gunfire and the explosion came not from melfords weapon but from does i had come to believe so strongly in melfords magic that it hadnt occurred to me that doe might win the draw once melford entered the battle i had never doubted he would win six steps in and i dared another look behind me i saw a flash of blood spraying up toward the burning rage of the sun in a cloudless sky melford arms up in the air falling back staggering against the mangrove tree root falling into the waste lagoon doe flared his nostrils with rage i fucking knew but that was as far as he got because i think for the first time he saw me coming at him now only three long paces away in his irritation at melford and his complacency toward me doe skipped a beat before he began to level his gun at me then he moved it toward me but it was off center i knew i had seen that doe was a good shot and a fast shot but i would force him to become a desperate shot and hopefully that would be enough two steps now stood between us i stretched out with an aching hipstretching stride and i saw doe squint his right eye i saw the twitch in his wrist i shifted to my left doe hadnt fired so i hadnt dodged a bullet but now i was off my balance and the advantage was his i lurched forward now one more long step and then i was in the air i had never played football in my life other than the brutal touch football games id been drafted into during pe class and i knew nothing absolutely nothing about tackle theory i didnt know how to hit or where but i knew what to do now melford hadnt been pointing at the ground when hed winked hed been pointing toward his crotch and it wasnt his crotch he wanted me to think of it was does i aimed myself with instinct and impulse and a paucity of physics i landed with my shoulder and i landed low and hard jamming my weight into his testicles we collapsed together onto the hard ground i let out a loud groan but doe let out a howl so warbly that it sounded almost like tribal music i hadnt thought id hit him nearly hard enough i could feel the power of the blow diffuse go to waste as though something had been left behind but doe curled into the fetal position his hands including the one holding his gun folded over his crotch melford had been right my tackle should have hurt doe but not floored him i recovered my own balance squatting and tense ready to spring next to me powerless to do harm doe rocked back and forth his mouth open though he made no noise tears streamed from his eyes i reeled my arm back and with all the force of rage and anger and frustration i could muster i rammed my fist into the space directly between his legs i pulled back to do it again then stopped doe had opened his mouth to let out another yelp but he hadnt made it the color drained from his face his eyes rolled up and he was still i found it very hard to believe id killed him from a blow to the balls so i could only assume that hed passed out i took the gun heavy and sickening from his slack hands and rose i gave him a couple of hard taps with my foot to make sure he was out and then remembering melford i spun around i was just in time to see his form sink under the greasy skin of the waste lagoon i didnt know if he was dead before he hit the surface i didnt know if he was already drowned all i knew was that he hadnt betrayed me and he had saved my life i had to try to save his i darted to the shore of the lagoon by the mangrove only halfaware of what i had in mind on the surface above where hed sunk there was a slight indentation as though he were dragging down the mass of the pool with him i looked right and left for what i didnt know maybe some hope some option that would save me from doing what i did not want to do but i had to do it i set down the gun by the shore took a deep breath and tensed my muscles then i froze i couldnt do it i just couldnt everything about me my mind my heart my stomach the cells that composed my body screamed that i could not under any conditions do what i was proposing the core of my being rebelled against it the very stuff of life millions of years of primate genetic memory rebelled against it i did it anyhow i jumped in the first thing i thought was that it felt more like jumping on a mattress a hot horribly rotten mattress than jumping in water the next thing i thought was that i was dead ghastly congealed blackness rose up all around me sucking me down pulling as though weights were tied to my feet it was up to my waist and then in an instant my chest panic stormed the gates of my consciousness and i knew i had one chance before i lost myself in death and despair i struggled straining my muscles to reach up with one hand i gritted my teeth and finally forced the arm out of the muck and felt it break the surface i felt the relative cool of the air against it somehow i found one of the outstretched roots of the mangrove tree i clutched it tight feeling its sharp bark bite into my slick skin with the other hand still under the surface i began to probe moving around in a circular motion and then downward it was shallow and deep in the lagoon all at once i waved my hand as best i could as far as it would go i stretched as far as i could go afraid of losing my grip because if i did i would fly into the lagoon and i would be lost the heavy slowmoving waves smacked against my face i could taste the filth in my mouth smell its already drying crust in my nose mosquitoes like tiny buzzards had begun to buzz around me the strength of the sludge pulled against me with a grotesque sucking sensation and then all at once my mouth was under the surface then my nose everything in my being cried for me to pull myself out but i stretched farther went deeper under then i felt something hard the rubber and canvas of a chuck taylor i leaned forward to make sure i grabbed shin instead of shoe and i began to pull with my other hand at the mangrove root i broke the surface and gasped for air it turned out to be a horrible move since the waste slid into my mouth and my stomach lurched violently i wasnt going to vomit not yet i needed to stay in control with my free hand i clawed at the earth and gained purchase on the root another few inches and then another few and then it became easier my whole upper body was out and after that i had one knee up on the ground then the other i was out somehow i was out and i was pulling melford along after me onto the shore where i let go and sat next to him he looked much the way i must have like a man made of wet chocolate i kept telling myself chocolate hoping it would keep the nausea at bay i couldnt see the details of his form well enough to see how injured he was i couldnt see if he was alive i couldnt see blood and then there was the flicker of something his eyes opened wide spheres of brightness against the darkness of his fecescovered form his eyes lurched this way and that and there was a moment of stillness in the air then in an instant he grabbed the gun and fired off a shot and once more i heard doe scream holy shit i shouted stop shooting people the smell of gunpowder danced in the air only to be instantly subsumed by the foul headthrobbing stench of my lagooncovered body fifteen feet away from us doe lay on the ground once more this time clutching his knee from which blood flowed copiously he was coming right at us melford said he was now standing dark and wet and gelatinous as a swamp creature i supposed i was too and dont you want to ask if im okay i was still staring at doe listening to his whimpers yeah i said but im kind of getting the feeling you are i think so he said slow moving avalanches of pig waste rolled off his body and pooled around his feet the bullet just nicked my shoulder i dont even think its bleeding very much but the surprise of it made me trip and once i hit the lagoon i got sucked in right now i figure we have to worry more about things like dysentery and cholera cheerful thoughts doe meanwhile was trying to pull himself up into a onekneed crawl trying hard to pull himself away from us jesus fuck he said jesus fuck jesus fuck jesus fuck remember when i told you being shot in the knee would hurt melford asked me i wasnt kidding was i i mean look at that guy ouch he shook off his hands i could really use a shower it would be wrong to say that i enjoyed seeing doe laid low or that i was even used to this sort of thing by now but hed had it coming there was no doubt about it and my being covered in pig shit and piss because of his crimes tended to diminish whatever sympathy i might have had still it was hard to say if what i felt was satisfaction or relief i was as disgusting as a healthy human being could possibly hope to be but i was alive and melford was alive and he had never betrayed me you couldnt have shot him in the hog lot i asked him you had to scare the shit out of me like that i was hoping to avoid shooting him at all melford said he inspected his wound with a probing finger out of consideration for you i was hoping to not have to shoot him because i know you frown on that sort of thing anyhow i wanted to get him out of the lot since rescuing you is only part of what were doing here he looked over toward the hog warehouse i was planningcrap i didnt even have time to look before melford grabbed my arm and yanked me into a run enough had happened over the past couple of days that i had my feet moving and was following melfords lead before i glanced over toward the lot and when i did what i saw made me gasp pigs dozens and dozens of pigs running toward us no running not toward us toward doe their hooves galloping their mouths open and bloody their eyes wide with rage the ground shook against their pentup anger their fear the mad porcine lust of their freedom they were demons redtumored ungainly slackmouthed plump demons the pigs of the damned running toward doe who lay on the ground screaming trying to pull himself away he grabbed at the dry earth at the weeds at white fossilized shells trying to pull himself crazily pointlessly like an illtimed desert wanderer trying to escape the blast of a nuclear test his fingers dug deep into the soil as he tried to raise himself onto his one good leg but the pain outmatched the fear and he went down again he turned to look at the waste lagoon and for an instant i saw it in his eyes he was thinking about crawling in there he would try to swim through the pig shit to escape the pigs and if he could do it i thought there would be some sort of redemption in that surely then he was gone from our sight the pigs blocked our view before they descended on him and for an eerie instant there was only galloping and grunting and then there was does shrill scream more surprised than afraid the sound of his screams was nearly drowned out by the stampede sound of galloping pigs trying to make their way to does body they oinked furiously an oink oink here and an oink oink there melford led me around in a wide loop and we came back toward the lot in time to see the pigs clustered around the scream the ones in the back were now still and disoriented as though theyd just awoken then after a minute there was quiet the pigs remained motionless perhaps confused and then began to wander away from the shores of the waste lagoon as if waking up from a sleepwalk they made their way from the lot and toward the trees melford and i turned around to see desiree coming out of the lot she wore pink jeans and a green bikini top her body was slick with sweat and her scar looked like a wound raw and fresh sorry she called i didnt really mean for that to happen they got away from me hey what happened to you two we had an accident melford shouted back to her okay look i need a few more minutes theres a garden hose around the other side near the car maybe you two could wash off the various changes of clothes melford kept in the back of his car now came in handy it was too hot for sweats but that was all he had that fit me and once i was washed off and out of my wasteruined clothes i was willing to take the heat until i could get back to my room and have a proper shower with soap melford rinsed himself off carefully the bullet wound on his shoulder was about two inches long but hardly deep at all ideally he would have gone to the hospital but he had antibiotic ointment in his cars firstaid kit he applied it liberally and then had me use duct tape to strap down a heavy dose of gauze after that he collected our clothes in a plastic garbage bag grabbing them from the inside out so he wouldnt have to touch them he tied it tightly and then placed that in a second bag to contain the smell i assumed with all that done there was nothing to do but wait for desiree to finish up whatever she was doing the two of us leaned against the car me in the sweats he in a spare set of black jeans white buttondown and navy chuck taylors if his hair hadnt been wet there would have been no way to know hed just been through a staggeringly disgusting ordeal they ate him i whispered at last breaking what had been silence other than necessary procedural discussion he shrugged we didnt plan it that way if anything we planned somewhat humanely to do this without hurting anyone we wanted to free the pigs free you and let bb the gambler and doe work out their own problems with a little help from the law maybe i didnt know why but i thought it best to keep quiet about bb being dead maybe melford knew and maybe he didnt so was freeing the pigs part of the plan from the beginning i asked you told me bastard and karen didnt have anything to do with the pigs melford smiled youve been through a lot but youre still not ready to know youre not ready to hear it all i bit my lip halffull of pride and halffull of resentment that i had to present this information like an english schoolboy conjugating latin verbs we have prisons i announced not despite the fact that they turn criminals into more skillful criminals but because of it melford looked at me i think i underestimated you go on i thought of george kingsley the bright young teen toms had shown me the good kid who had turned into a hardened criminal a promising mind once set on turning his energy to reform and change now stripped of its promise and ambition turned to a felons life criminals are people who for the most part come from the fringes of society those who have the least to gain from our culture as it is they have the most to gain from changing society or even destroying it and replacing it with a new order that favors them maybe a better order maybe not it doesnt matter so because they are on the fringes they end up hanging out with those who break laws who teach them to break laws maybe they go to prisons and learn how to break even more important laws the next thing you know these potential revolutionaries are now criminals society can absorb criminals fairly easily revolutionaries less so criminals have a place in the system revolutionaries do not thats why we have prisons to turn misfits into murderers it may harm society make it less pleasant but it doesnt destroy it wow melford studied me with wonder you got it exactly right how do you know melford looked at him what do you mean i mean you are enveloped by ideology too right so how come youre right and everyone else is wrong how can you know it he nodded i cant which makes you doubly right but i have confidence in me you too now so you get to hear everything with desiree still somewhere in the barn melford started up the car and turned on some raucous music which he played at low volume he stared at the warehouse and i could see he worried about desiree the way i worried about chitra and that made me like him more feel i understood him better whatever insane things hed done whatever unspeakable principles by which he ran his life he seemed to me just then gentle and familiar he had done terrible things things i could never condone yet despite the moral gulf that lay between us we were linked by this emotion this love we felt for someone special and bold in that we were not so different bookman and assassin maybe he would argue it linked us as clearly as id been linked with those pigs who had been in the warehouse who had known torment and imprisonment and terror and then known freedom and revenge it was the dogs and cats i said by way of getting him started you came here to investigate a story about missing pets you found out bastard and karen were abducting them and selling them to oldham health services for medical research thats right melford said very good you know i grew up with a cat a big tabby named bruce my best friend then maybe the best friend id ever had when i was sixteen he was in a neighbors yard and this guy who was a big drunk exhigh school football player beat him to death with a football helmet just for the hell of it he didnt like me thought i was weird so he killed my cat bruce was as much of a person as anyone if theres such a thing as a soul he had one he had desires and preferences and people he loved and disliked and things he liked to do and things that bored him he might not have been able to balance a checkbook or understand how electric lights work but he was still a sentient being thats awful i said not sure what else to say i was about as devastated as ive ever been my relatives and friends kept saying it was just a cat as though somehow his being a cat diminished how i should feel about this living feeling creature being murdered i went to the cops and i got a lot of its terrible but its your word against his his parents will swear the cat leapt at him tried to claw his eyes out that sort of thing i kept pushing but people started getting angry the parents of the kid who killed my cat complained to my parents about my being a pest and my parents never pushed back instead they scolded me and then finally offered to buy me a new cat like he was a typewriter one works just as well as another maybe a new one works even better is that when you became interested in being a vegetarian no id been one for years id made the connection long before that if bruce was like a person then so was the animal that my steak came from its just that id never met that person but when bruce was killed it made me determined to stop being quiet about it my mother always told me that i shouldnt tell people not to eat meat that it was rude but how is it rude to ask people to stop their immoral behavior its like saying that the police are rude for arresting criminals so when you found out about bastard and karen you went after them more complicated than that ive been engaged in guerrilla actions for years now the drunk football player melford shook his head died tragically actually had too much to drink one night and fell into a pond and drowned very sad business so you go around killing people who kill animals thats crazy its justice lem i dont hurt people who raise animals for food they dont believe theyre doing anything wrong i agree with the movement that our job is to reeducate but sometimes people hurt animals when they know they are doing something wrong so when i got the story over the wire just a throwaway paragraph about all the missing animals here i came to look into it not really thinking about resolving the problem myself but thinking to expose it then i got the same problems here that i had with bruce the cops didnt want to know about it they gave me a lot of bullshit about no proof you know what they didnt tell me that oldham health services buys stray animals no questions asked you show up with an animal say its a stray you get fifty bucks and oldham is a big employer for this area a lot of jobs and a lot of revenue are tied up in its wellbeing so maybe they dont have evidence that pets are being abducted for animal research but maybe they dont want to have that evidence either so you decided to kill bastard and karen there was no other way lem just like today with doe it was him or you with bastard and karen i tried to do the right thing but if i had left without acting and even more animals had been tortured and killed how could i have lived with that i paused for a minute the thing is melford were talking about animals not people you may have a bond with an animal but that doesnt make it the same as a person weve been at this long enough for me to get the sense that youre coming over to my side melford said so do you think its wrong for them to take animals away from the people who love them to visit torture and death on the pets and sadness and pain on their owners you think that doing that simply to make money is acceptable of course i dont but no buts its wrong to abduct animals and ship them off to be the subject of unnecessary torture weve established that okay so if i knew they were killing cats and i went to the authorities and the authorities werent interested what should i do then i dont know youre a reporter you could have written a story thats true i could have i even did but my editor didnt want to run it said i hadnt proved anything i even got my father to lean on them but no deal so ultimately what were talking about is the choice between stopping them or simply shrugging it off with a feeling that i gave it my best but this cant be the right way to do things there has to be a better way than assassinating the people who dont share your values a lot of people would agree with you even virtually everyone involved in the underground animal rights movement they wont so much as consider my methods even though their enemies perpetrate cruelties on a scale never before imagined in human history i respect the principles of the pacifists i even envy them but someone has to pick up the sword and that someone is me and its not as though what im doing is wrong it is simply outside the margins of what ideology will allow look at the great heroes of the civil war for the south robert e lee theres a guy who led thousands upon thousands of men to their deaths led them to kill thousands upon thousands of men for what so that people whose ancestors came from africa could remain slaves and they name high schools after this guy its not the same thing i understand melford i really do i just cant get past the idea that it is wrong to kill a person for the sake of an animal it doesnt ring true to me because youre not trying to get out of the system your mind is trying to pull away but you get too far and the tendrils of ideology reach up and pull you back youre not struggling hard enough remember the hog lot remember how you looked at it and while you were looking at it you told me that it couldnt be true your mind rebelled against your senses because your senses gave you information that didnt mesh with what you are supposed to believe because i hadnt yet broken free of ideology youll never break free maybe none of us ever will but im not going to stop trying i will do what i believe to be right for as long as i can and if i go down for it im willing to face the consequences bastard and karen had to be stopped and no one was willing to do it so i did it thats what i do i shook my head but you dont have to do it of course not melford nodded just tell yourself that and the rip in the fabric of reality will mend itself soon youll even doubt you ever met me everything in your experience will tell you that i must have been a figment of your imagination and reality will swallow up poor melford into the oblivion of bills and tv commercials and a weekly paycheck ill miss you i said but im kind of looking forward to it too when i looked up i saw desiree running toward us her scantily covered breasts swung wildly and she was gesturing with her hands i didnt know what it meant but it looked significant she threw open the back door and jumped in drive fast she said to melford he put the car into gear and slammed down on the gas it was an old car and didnt respond exceptionally well but it still responded and we were off the farm and on the dirt road heading toward the highway before melford even had a chance to ask its the lab she said i rigged it to blow but im not sure how much time we have i figured it would be best to make sure we were away from the explosions and toxic fumes theres no arguing with good logic i thought still her panic proved unnecessary and we were a good three or four miles away before the thick cloud of black smoke rose behind us we never heard the blast just the long serenade of police sirens chapter by the time we got back to the motel there were half a dozen or more county sheriffs cars parked outside their lights flashing silently against the black cloud wed left behind us all the guests stood outside their rooms some fully dressed some in bathrobes or pajamas or boxer shorts a little girl in a pink nightgown clutched a stuffed giraffe in one hand and her distracted mothers sweatshirt in the other we got out of melfords car just in time to see the cops leading the gambler away he was in handcuffs and bent over doing what i would later hear called the perp walk just behind him a pair of cops were leading away ronny neil and scott officer toms was taking statements from some of the people from the gamblers crew bobby stood by looking stunned maybe before id learned about his little trick id have felt bad even guilty about ruining his career i figured unemployment was the least he deserved this is unexpected i said softly to you perhaps didnt you wonder why i showed up at the motel room to tell them you were my source in part it was to get your enemies in trouble sure but there was more and what was that more i planted a few choice items from bastards trailer in the room and then made an anonymous call it wont take that much digging for them to connect the gambler to the drug trade he had going with jim doe and the rest of them it will all make perfect sense i shook my head the gamblers a bad guy dont get me wrong but he didnt kill all those people hes going to be charged with multiple murders yeah melford said all he really did was use his encyclopedia salesmen to peddle speed to teenagers many of whom are no doubt dead of those who live virtually all will lead lives only a shadow of their former potential boy how unjust his punishment will be but dont you think that that what that i should take the blame myself so the gambler can walk free forget it im a postmarxist vigilante and i have a job to do i make the world a better place and that world will do very nicely without the gambler on the streets is the world better off without b b gunn too hes dead you know yeah i know either the gambler or doe killed him so either way justice is served your justice who is fit to judge all mankind if not me he went around to the back of the car and opened up the hatchback he lifted up the carpeted floor and revealed a briefcase thats yours not right now when there are cops everywhere but before we part ways what is it melford laughed dont play dumb with me boy you know what it is its the forty thousand dollars theyve been looking for you take it and go to college who knows you might even still be able to secure a place for the coming year holy shit what else do you say at a time like that why do you want to give it to me melford shrugged and slammed shut the hatch because if i take money for what i do i become corrupted i cant ever think not for a second that im engaging in an action for the money or ill lose my way youve felt the tendrils of ideology and i have to do all i can to resist them i think ive set you on the right path over the past few days you go off get a good humanities education study literature and philosophy get your fill of the social sciences and try to do something useful with your life im supposed to refuse to take it i said call it dirty money tell you i want no part of it ill be very disappointed if you do that dont be another automaton lemuel who embraces a false morality while ignoring the real evil all around you take the money and escape from florida i nodded okay i will melford laughed i think were getting somewhere with you then i felt someone grab me i almost lashed out with an elbow to the assailants head but something in my reptile brain recognized a scent and i froze it wasnt a grab it was a hug i turned and saw chitra smiling at me her eyes were wide her lips red and slightly parted i thought i told you to leave town i said i didnt listen im so glad you are all right but why are you dressed like that i looked down at my sweats long story i kissed her comfortably as though wed been together for so long that we didnt have to think about kissing ill give you two kids a minute melford said he walked over to the car and got inside i heard him put on some music and watched while he nodded his head to the beat chitra pulled away but not unkindly i think that probably ends things for the encyclopedia business looks that way i thought about her father needing money and i thought about the suitcase in melfords hatchback all i needed for college was thirty thousand several thousand of which id already saved that meant i had a comfortable surplus how squeamish are you about matters of ethics when it comes to money i asked her not very she said good i put my arm around her shoulder and pulled her close breathing in the wonderful musty scent of her hair are you hungry she asked i performed a robotic search of my systems it took a moment but i realized i was hungry very i said then maybe its time we got that hamburger does your offer still stand she smiled at me maybe yes maybe no you eat the hamburger and then ill tell you her grin was so delightfully devilish it made my knees weak i had been so much seen so much id almost died in the worst way humanly imaginable id seen a man eaten alive by pigs never had i felt more alive its very tempting i said its hard to say whether or not youll abandon your principles until you are tested by temptation youre being tested by temptation now she said and i am very curious to see what happens i thought about it for a minute maybe two and then i gave her my answer acknowledgments more so than with my previous novels ive relied on the advice of smart and attentive readers to help me figure out what worked and didnt i owe a great deal to sophia hollander jim jopling mark haskell smith tammar stein and billy taylor for their time attention patience encouragement and excellent suggestions many people assisted me in my research for this novel so i am truly grateful to everyone who gave of their time and energy jim leljedal of the broward county sheriffs department joe haptas and ingrid newkirk at the people for the ethical treatment of animals animal rights activist extraordinaire don barnes jimmy the shac guy last name unknown and the animal liberators with whom i corresponded currently serving time in prison whose names i withhold upon their request while animal rights issues were always at the core of this project the novel began with a very different story and i must thank those who helped me research the material for the earlier incarnation even though i didnt end up using it michael l wiederhold of the university of texas health science center and jon ronson author of the absolutely terrific them adventures with extremists ill write a book about the bilderberg group one of these days once again i must thank the incomparable liz darhansoff for her tireless efforts and support id hate to think where id be without her but it would surely be someplace dingy likewise supereditor jonathan karp whose advice guidance friendship and openmindedness helped make this book possible and since i am lucky enough to live in a parallel universe in which an author gets to keep the same terrific publicist for all his books let me put a long overdue thanks in print to sally the marvinator marvin
