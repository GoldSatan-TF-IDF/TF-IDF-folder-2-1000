by the sword mercedes lackey book two twoedged blade eleven great jaesel shallan said her bright blue eyes widening in awe at the sight of what blocked the wellpounded trail what in hell is that she must have unconsciously tightened her legs because her highstrung gelding bucked then bounced a little sideways blundering into hellsbane troublekero exerted immediate pressure on the reins so the mare only laid her ears back rather than reacting with the swift snap of teeth she would ordinarily have indulged in shallan swore made a fist and thumped her restive mount between his ears and the fractious beast subsided once again the scouting party turned their collective attention toward the untidy sprawl of humanity across their path sprawl was definitely the operative term kero decided there was a tangle of about twenty or thirty men some standing most in variations of fallen all interlaced with tenfoot thankfully headless pikes didnt the sergeant from bornams bastards say something about recruiting from the area last night asked a male voice from right behind kero gies she identified automatically of the twins he had the deeper voice i think so replied his identicallyswarthy brother tre and she knew shed picked the right name for the right twin the sergeant wasnt real optimistic id say he had reason not to be shallan replied shaking her iceblonde head in disgust and from the look of this wed better detour before they get themselves sorted out and stand up a few more of the men got themselves untangled from the rest and stood aside their sergeant wasnt shoutingmostly because from the crimson color of his face kero reckoned that he was holding off a fit of apoplexy by will alone aye to that kero said she was nominally the head of this group but only during the actual scouting foray and they werent in the field at the moment lets take the back way the four scouts turned their horses heads and went back the way theyd come in following the poundeddirt track between hackedoff patches of scrubby brush behind them the sergeant finally regained his voice and began using it the four companies menmelliths council had hired for bandit eradication had bivouacked in a canyon but not a blind one there were at least four ways into the area that kero knew of and she had no doubt the twins knew a couple more the back way which was the other nominally traveled route in took them over some rough ground but their horses could handle it they were all shinainbred a few furlongs along the scrublined dirt trail which steady commerce over the past few days had pounded into the soil the human track was bisected by a game trail that led off through the weatherbeaten bushes and tired stunted oaks that back way was good for a goat or a mountaindeer but not terribly attractive to humans afoot or humans with horses which made it unlikely that theyd run into any more delays getting back to camp in fact the back way was so quiet there was still wildlife living along it birds flew out of the trees as they passed and a covey of quail watched from beneath the shelter of a thornbush gods shallan said thumping her horse again as he shied at a rabbit bolting across their path gods green recruits thanks be to saint keshal that lerryn wont put greenuns in the field could be worse tre observed could be levied troops from menmellith and rethwellan out here shallan groaned but kero shook her head menmellith maybe but not rethwellan rethwellan wont even officially be our hire officially theyve loaned the council the cash to pay for us got that from a letter she didnt say from whom everyone in the skybolts knew about her friendship with darenand knew equally well that she wouldnt trade on it but she could and would pass along any information he happened to drop whether by accident or design oh shallan and the other two looked studiously indifferent which told kero they hadnt heard this particular tidbit of gossip whys that simple enough we all know that karse is funding these banditsassuming they arent already part of the karsite army but outside of these borders kero shrugged anyway thats why its us and why rethwellans out of it were not official units of any army whatever we do it cant cause a diplomatic incident and if we happen to get carried away and it turns out that the subsequent bodies were part of the karsite army well karse has violated the code so many times that the guild not only wouldnt fine the offenders they might even be rewarded unofficially of course of course tre agreed brightly kero looked back over her shoulder the identical smiles on both twins faces could only be described as bloodthirsty or maybe it was just greed it wasnt too often that a bonded company had free rein to loot but thats exactly what the menmellith counciltheir putative employershad given them not that kero blamed them probably half of what was in the possession of the bandits had belonged to folk hereabouts first if anybody got it the locals would rather it was friends than enemies rethwellan had granted menmellith clientstate status and semiautonomy shortly after daren had been born supposedly this was a kind of thanksoffering for the birth of a third son in actuality now that shed seen the state with her own eyes kero suspected that the king had seized on the first available excuse to liberate his land from a considerable drain on the royal coffers menmellith was mostly mountain hellishly hard to travel in constantly raided by karsite bandits and probably impossible to govern or tax effectively now it was governed by its own fractious taciturn folk served as a buffer between karse and the lusher lands of rethwellan and the king need only hire the occasional merc company to clean things out now and again instead of being forced to keep a detachment of the army there on permanent duty were fairly useless at the moment you know shallan said as her horse picked its way daintily across a dry streambed that formed part of the trail theyre just sending the scouting parties out to make sure everythings still where its supposed to be i know kero sighed if there was one thing shed learned with the skybolts it was that warfare consisted mostly of waiting im not even supposed to report to anyone unless we do see something odd i suppose it wouldnt be so damned bad if we could see something going on but the bastards are not coming out of that canyon cant say as i blame them gies said laconically if id got mself trapped in a blind canyon wouldnt be comin out either they cn hold us off long as the foodnwater last an we just might get bored an go away shallan laughed not a sound of amusement it was a particularly ugly laugh between them the wolflings and the bastards are likely to make things real uncomfortable for them in there then when they pop out well be waiting and so will the earthshakers kero preferred not to think too much about that it was going to cost the two companies of foot quite a bit in blood to shake the bandits out of their lair by contrast the company of heavy cavalry and the skybolts skirmishers had it easy if dull but when the bandits did emerge theyd be like any desperate and cornered creatures and shallan was likely to get a bellyful of fighting but it wouldnt profit anyone to say that out loud so kero held her peace and kept her eyes on the uncertain trail the last thing she needed to do would be to lame hellsbane stand kero told hellsbane the gray stamped restlessly once more but then obeyed with no other sign of rebellion kero tapped her right foreleg and the warsteed lifted the massive hoof and set it in keros waiting hands she pulled the hoofpick out of her belt and began cleaning the packed muck out of it with studious care there was a lot of gravel around here and kero did not intend to find herself with a lamed horse because of a moments carelessness shallan had already lost the use of her remount that way i could really get to hate menmellith she told hellsbane conversationally the gray flicked her ears back with every evidence of intelligent interest i can see why jad let them hare off and become a clientstate theres nothing here but sheep rocks and boneheaded shepherds certainly nothing worth keeping why karse keeps trying to invade them ill never know she thought for a moment then added unless its just one more example of how crazy the karsites are she finished with the right forehoof and moved back to the hind stand she repeated with a little more force this time as some noise from the next camp over made hellsbane roll her eyes and fidget she straightened long enough to see what all the fuss was a small forest of poles was marching straight for the picket lines and horses up and down the line were starting to stamp and look nervous blessed agnirapikemen again thats jeffreys wolflings what fool sent pikemen to drill next to picketed horses dont they know how much battletrained horses hate pikes theyre going to have the whole line spooked in a minute she was just about to head them off by intercepting them and launching into a powerful flood of abuse when someone beat her to it alt damn yer ides i said right march not bleedin left the line came to an abrupt and pictureperfect halt the wolflings pikesergeant strode around the back of the now stationary formation face red as a sunset veins bulging out on his forehead jecrenas bleedin arse he bellowed yed think ye was a lot o plowboys not perfeshnal sojers from there his tirade went into extreme sexual and scatological detail as to the habits and probable ancestry of his charges kero leaned against hellsbanes rump listening in astonished admiration his language was colorful original and quite entertaining shed been with the skybolts for quite a few years now and had never quite heard anything like it i should be taking notes she thought watching the sergeant get his men turned back in the right direction the horses were definitely calming down now that the pikes were going the other way you never hear anything like that around our camp but that was at least in part because horseback skirmishers didnt drill the way pike and line swordsmen did no sergeants for one thing kero went back to hellsbanes hooves glad to have thought of something to do theres a lot of waiting involved in warfare tarma had said many times over kero had never quite believed her at the time she did now well it could be worse she consoled herself we could have rethwellan regulars with us then every merc in the companies would be getting the longnosed look when he dared poke his head out of camp what in hell is it that makes every conscript farmboy who cant tell his brain from his backside and wouldnt know what three quarters of the code meant think hes morally superior to a merc she sighed the question wasnt worth losing sleep over every merc ever born was a misfit thats why most of them wound up as mercs in the first place lady knows im no exception she thought glumly last time i went home dierna acted like i was going to eat the baby and lordan carried on as if he thought i was planning on stealing the boys the horses the sheep or all three each time she visited she was more of a stranger and after the last time shed just about made up her mind never to go back again my only real friends are here anyway she reflected picking at a bit of gravel lodged in hellsbanes left hind hoof the warsteed switched her boundup tail restlessly but didnt object kero had remarked once that hellsbanes behavior was a lot more like a dogs than a horses and tarma had only smiled and replied cryptically why do you think we wont let them breed to anything but their own kind after that kero had taken extra care when spring came around and hellsbane went into season then she discovered that such care was entirely unneeded the warsteed was perfectly capable of fending off unwanted advances and she evidently hadnt yet found the stallion that measured up to her own high standards hooves clean kero loitered on the lines replaiting the grays tail and watching the wolflings drill those long pikes were a lot harder to manage than anyone but a fighter could imagine all in all it made her grateful to be with the skybolts twoblades company actually began as what idras sunhawks came to be an entirely mounted force of specialists in every one of the campaigns kero had served in up until now theyd been constantly busy their greatest asset was that they were versatile as well as highly mobile every one of the skybolts could double as a scout and when they werent on the battlefield they could ride messenger detail not this time or at least not now there were constant scouting forays of course just to make sure that the enemy hadnt found a way out of the trap but that was the only thing like work going on for the skybolts that unwonted leisure was beginning to have an effect on the company which is why im out here and not in camp in general there were only three pursuits available to a merc when forced into idleness gambling drinking and sex kero was too shrewd to be lured into the first too cautious for the second and as for the third im an odd fish in a pond full of odd fish she thought a little sadly between the sword and this socalled gift of mine the gift was the main reason she didnt drink when she did her carefullywrought shields came down and the guard came off her tongue only once had she let that happen shed frightened a tavern full of hardbitten soldiers into sobriety with the things shed said about them only some fancy verbal footwork the next day enabled her to convince them that theyd misheard most of it and luck had given her the rest so she didnt drink at all now at least not to get drunk and not in company which set her apart from most of the rest of the company she was terrified of what would happen if they ever did find out the truth mercs have too many secrets to appreciate anyone even someone they trust to be rummaging around in their minds every one of us was driven into this life by something and most of us dont want anyone else to know what that is even me if anyone ever found out about this gift of mine i dont know what id do the sword nowthat set her apart in another way she was kethrys granddaughterthat was no secretand by now everyone seemed to have heard the song of kerowyns ride it would have been impossible to hide the fact that she still had the blade she wore it all the time and wouldnt take it off so common gossip had it if she went to bed with someone well that wasnt quite truebut shed learned that being too far away from it could be torture thered been a really bad rainy season a couple of years ago theyd had to cross a floodswollen river and keros packhorse had gone under that was before shed taken to wearing the blade all the time shed thought for the crossing that it was safer strapped to the packs shed just barely made it onto the riverbank when the pain of the overstrained soulbond started the company healer had thought it some sort of curse until shed gasped out an explanation of just what it was shed lostbetween spasms of blinding agony that left her helpless even to speak the entire company had gone out into the storm to look for the damned thing and bring it back theyd found it before sunsetbut that put her in a position of debt she was determined to repay after a lot of careful thought and consultation with the company hedgewizard shed found a way shed coaxed the blade with much emphasis on how many females were in the skybolts into extending its antimagic protection to include a fair amount of ground in her immediate vicinity actually her protections covered more area than the company mages could which made her rather popular when the magebolts began to fly thinking about that she patted the hilt of the sword the way she patted hellsbanes neck now that ive got you cooperating my lady youre even more useful than you were to kethry ive heard more than one skybolt say hed sooner trust your abilities than that hedgewizard of ours for a moment at the back of her mind she seemed to hear a kind of sleepy murmur of pleasure but it was too faint for her to be certain shed never yet figured out how muchor how littleintelligence the sword had or how much it understood or even heard of what she said to it these occasional little whispers like the vague mutterings of a sleeptalker were the closest she ever got to communication many of the skybolts were a little fearful of the blade as well as respectful of it and its powers so that set her apart as well then there was the problem of sex not within the company theres too much potential for trouble and i have to live with these people there were pairings within the company and some of them worked very well but some of them didnt and when that happened it spilled over onto everyone else and in the middle of a campaign that could get people killed tarma had warned her about that too and shed been right you dont sleep around in the company shed said theyre your family and you dont bed your brothers or sisters shed added as an afterthought wise advice but it made kero very much a lonerand in a case like this bivouacked leagues away from civilization it also didnt leave her very much to do all my jewelrycarving equipment is back at the winter quarters i never thought id need it now i suppose i could go find the healer and get her to teach me how to knit those anklebraces she thought combing her fingers through hellsbanes coat or i could roach the mares mane or i could poultice the stonebruise on shallans remount or i could find some flat river pebbles and draw up another set of houndandstag stones for someone come to think of it shallan wanted a set as if the thought had summoned her shallan strolled up to the picket line currycombs in hand hoofpick in her belt short whiteblonde hair gleaming like a cap of silvergilt in the sun whats the word kero asked her anything new on the grapevine word is that were supposed to take prisoners she replied tossing one of the currycombs to kero word is theres some pretty good circumstantial evidence that these whoresons really are karsite regulars but nothing direct lerryn wants to prove it and the rest of the captains are in agreement so we take prisoners kero asked which means afterward we make somebody talk contract says theyre bandits shallan pointed out with bloodthirsty glee karse says theyre bandits bandits dont fall under the code which means when weve got em we make em talk however and if it turns out theyre karsite regulars kero persisted shallan shrugged fluidly the leather of her tight black tunic moving with her shoulders five years ago bandits murdered just about every man in feldars teeth after theyd surrendered three years ago a halfdozen men from the doomslayersactually prisoners of war and waiting for guild ransomwere tortured by karsite priests and what was ransomed later was a clutch of completely mindless husks two years ago more of these bandits overran the hooters winter quarters and killed the civilianswhile the hooters themselves were out putting down a rebellion in ruvan and werent even near karse shallans voice betrayed the tense anger her face and posture wouldnt reveal each time the guild levied a big fine each time karse just paid it no denial not even a commentthey just paid it kero frowned dusting her hands off on her mudbrown leather breeches thats odd odd great gods its a slap in our face its like theyre saying were so lowly such vermin that they want everyone to know what they did she dropped her voice so that kero had to lean closer to hear look kero i know im a year younger than you are but ive been in the business since i was fourteen my mama was a sunhawk ive seen a hell of a lot most of it not real pretty by civilian standards and most of it doesnt bother me any more this is my job you understand and i dont get worked up about things that go on in itbut ill tell you right now for what ive seen the karsites do to my friends and their friends well id kill em for free and dance on the graves after kero knew shallan was tough for all that shallan was a head shorter than she was and looked frail enough for a wind to blow away that fragility was entirely false shallan was as tough as the black leather she wore and as impervious to damage and in all the time shed been with the skybolts kero had never seen shallan frightened but she was frightened now afraid of the karsites and all her brave words about killing them for free and dancing on the graves couldnt hide that for a heartbeat or two kero felt trapped by the blue intensity of shallans eyes then she broke free of that hypnotic gaze aided by hellsbanes restive stamping shallan could do that now and again but only when she felt so strongly about something that it was worth living or dying to her i dont know about taking prisoners she said quietly turning away and going back to work on the grays dusty hide the more i hear about the karsites the less i want to do with them almost seems like if you acted like they do youd be in danger of becoming like them but if lerryn wants prisonerswell thats an order isnt it aye that shallan agreed kero did not like the tone of her voice dear gods she sounds like shed be perfectly happy to volunteer for the crew whore going to be persuading these prisoners to talkassuming we catch any and now that i think about it shes not the only one to sound that way about these socalled bandits or the karsites in general she felt a little sick for all that they were the enemy for all the atrocities they had meted out she couldnt picture herself handing the same treatment back to them kill them yes but cleanly she couldnt agree with shallans attitude theyre so damned vindictive about this all of them but maybe im the one whos out of line here shallans lover lost a sister in some fight or othertherere others in the skybolts that lost friends and family along through here over the past five years or so maybe its me maybe i just dont feel that angry at them because i just cant seem to get really attached to anyone not even my own bloodkin she leaned into the strokes of the currycomb and thought back to the incidents that had started her on this whole career trying to recapture exactly how she felt when she saw her brother wounded her father dead justresponsibility thats all i really felt that i can remember that someone had to take care of the mess and i was the only one possible dear gods whats wrong with me why am i so cold maybe its just that ive never really had anyone get close enough that i could honestly say i loved him except mother but that didnt seem natural either other people seemed to be falling in and out of love all the time but for her nothing ever seemed to get involved but her body and sometimes her mind the first lover is supposed to be such a big thingbut with daren there didnt really seem to be more at stake than friendship andwellthe desires of the moment she cast a glance over at shallan when she thought the other woman wouldnt notice her companion couldand didwax passionate about causes and people at the drop of a gauntlet this got her into trouble more often than not but shallan had no intention of changing maintaining that it was better to live life hard and completely kero was just the opposite after those flareups with daren she had never again actually fought with anyone she saved her anger and her energy for the battlefield off the field she thought everything through planned for every possible contingency then went coldly and selfreliantly straight for her goal sometimes i go after what i want with such singlemindedness that i frighten myself she thought watching shallan grooming her horse as if by brushing out every speck of dirt she could wipe the karsites from the face of the earth id hate to see what the others think of me uncomfortable thoughts and not likely to improve her disposition she was glad to have them interrupted by a shout from the direction of camp she looked up over hellsbanes shoulder as tre waved his dull scarlet shirt identifying him even at a distance hed never yet worn the thing out on scout but he inevitably changed back into it as soon as they hit camp kero shal back to camp on the double meeting she waved back to show that theyd heard and tossed the currycomb to shallan the younger woman caught it deftly and the two of them ducked under the picket line and trotted toward the mess tent i wonder what its about shallan said trotting along with an ease that reminded kero of warrls lazy lope her eyes glinted with an eagerness that kero thought held just a hint of battle madness maybe theyve decided to put on a push so we can get this over with at that point they reached the edge of the growing crowd so kero was saved from having to make a reply most of the skybolts had already gathered at the mess tent when they arrived they worked their way around to the side as leader of a scout party kero had just enough rank to get in fairly close to their captain lerryn twoblades did not look like much of a fighter he wore the same scuffed leathers as any of his company his only concession to rank was a round pin of carved silver kero had made him showing two crossed swords bisected by a lightning bolt thin and not particularly tall and just now at rest he wasnt very imposing either but when he rose to speak it was immediately apparent that he was whipcord and steel over bone and moved with a lazy grace that spoke volumes to anyone who had studied handtohand combat those limpid brown eyes missed nothing those foppish curls covered a skull with frightening intelligence inside it there wasnt one single horse in the entire camp he couldnt handle up to and including hellsbane which had surprised the hell out of both kero and her horse and all he had to do was say three words and it was no secret why the skybolts were fanatically devoted to their captain he scanned the crowd slowly to let the muttering die away only when he had relative silence did he speak in a calm but carrying voice weve voted and weve decided to make a push he said otherwise we let these whoresons force us to piss away our troops against them while there may be groups out there we havent bottled up taking pieces out of the border there was the start of a cheerwhen he raised his hand for silence he got it toosomething that never failed to impress kero the skybolts wont be fighting he said firmly and im not taking any volunteers to go on temp to the other companies and thats an order agniratherere going to be some objections to that and for sureand there were a storm of them people began shouting and waving their hands to get his attention for all the world like a crowd of unruly children lerryn simply let the hotheads have their say then held up his hand again its not our kind of fight he told them his eyes moving from face to face so that in the end every one of them would have been willing to swear that the captain talked to him directly we arent trained any of us in the kind of line fighting theres going to be most of us are runty little bastards he continued with a rueful grin that included himself with them we couldnt take on a big man in a shouldertoshoulder situation not when weve built careers and training on speed and agility we couldnt use our shortswords or horsebows and those little round target shields would be damned useless against maces and axes we cant do any damn good with unfamiliar weapons afoot against heavy infantry and if you all really think about that and are honest youll agree with me there was more muttering and some vehement headshaking but not much lerryns words made sense even to the most belligerent among them the captain spread his hands in a gesture that said wordlessly look i dont like this any more than you do but we all know the facts when we see them weve done our job he said no one can fault uswere the ones who tracked them and were the ones who harried them and trapped them here in the first place its time for the others to do their job and now we have to get out of the way so they can do it without interference hmm he tilted his head slightly to one side there was more mutteringshallan predictably was one of the mutterersbut it quickly died away dont think were getting off easy he said im deploying half of you as outriders to make sure nobody gets away if theres a breakout youll be fightingand you outriders are as important as the front liners more thats the place where well have a good shot at taking prisoners we dont want anyone to escape to take word back towherever tactfully not saying what everyone is thinking keros lip twitched we can say it but because hes captain he cant not till its proved that wherever is karse and if they get back with word of this the karsites may send a bigger force before were ready for it lerryn looked them all over once again the breeze blowing his long hair back from his face the rest of you get the camp packed up and ready to move on the instant pack up your friends if theyre out on patrol once the siege is broken well be moving as fast as we can back to a secured zone again not saying what he cantbut he expects there to be prisoners and ill bet my next bonus hes been toldwell have custody of them were the fastest and if we can get the prisoners to a secure lockup we can have them singing like woodlarks before the karsites even know we have them id bet on abevell for that secure lockup towns practically carved into the side of the mountain lerryn waited for any further comment but the skybolts knew their leader and that his decisions were final later when they were all behind friendly walls theyd find out why those decisions had been made until then they were willing to take it on faith that there were reasons dismissed he said and singled out a dozen scoutleaders with a pointed finger before they all dispersed those chosen followed him back to his tent the rest milled restlessly for a moment then drifted back toward the camp in twos and threes to begin the breakdown kero was not among the select but she hadnt expected shed be after all her group had already been out this morning and lerryn wasnt the kind of captain to impose double duty on someone without a compelling reason she was relieved both that the skybolts were not going to be involved in the fight and that she wasnt going to be part of the harriers its too much she decided making noncommittal answers to shallan as they walked through the orderly rows of tents to their own running people down on horseback like i was hunting rabbitshellfires i dont even hunt rabbits on horseback im just glad i dont have to be part of that i think maybe the captain figured that out too he gave me that kind of look i dont think he likes it either shallans tent was the closest and the blonde dove into it with another moan of complaint and just my luck rellis with hagen which means shell be in on it and ill have to pack her stuff up sure enough the tent was empty and shallan threw herself at her lovers belongings with grim determination kero took herself off before she could be coerced into helping relli was something of a clotheshorse and kero did not want to take responsibility for the least little crease that ruined a tunic her own tent was the same size as shallans but seemed larger since she had to it herself technically these were fourman tents but only if you stacked everyone together like logs and no one had more than a single backpack of possessions two fit fine one was perfect so far as kero was concerned lerryn didnt care about sleeping arrangements so long as everyone was under canvas and someone took responsibility for the tent itself if they took on anyone without his own shelter and they ran out of company tents kero might be ordered to share but until then she had her privacy she was glad of it as she packed her belongings down with practiced ease and began rolling her bedding the trapped bandits were going to be massacred she knew how completely logical that was and she didnt like it if shed had a tentmate shed have had to talk about it and she didnt want to the sooner i can shake the dust of this place from hellsbanes hooves the better im suddenly she heard something on the edge of the camp confused shouting too far away to make out words but there was no mistaking the tone there was something wrong desperately wrong for only the second time since shed joined the skybolts she dropped her mental shields and searched for a coherent picture among the jangle of thoughtslooking for the person who knew what was going on lerryn she found him on the picket line directing incoming scouts who were galloping up to the line in panic while the company hedgewizard sent up the emergency come in signal beside him the thoughts in his mind were clear and organized as cool and unpanicked as her own would be if she were in his place though what she read there would have sent anyone else into the kind of panic the rest of the camps were showing for all the guesses had been rightthese were no bandits the companies had pinned these were karsite regulars but somehow some way they had gotten word of their position across the border and karse had sent out a real army to close in behind and catch the companies in a pincer maneuver the odds depending on who lerryn talked to were either two or three to one in the karsite favor kero pulled out of lerryns mind as invisibly as she had insinuated herself in glad now that she had not given in to temptation and had brought only what hellsbane could comfortably carry the tent would have to be abandoned of course there was no percentage in standing and fighting and there was only one way of dealing with this trap before they were all caught in it run each captain cared only for his own at this pointwhich was the biggest weakness of a force comprised of mercs kero could not help but pity the heavy infantry the wolflingsthey had no one to cover for them and harry their pursuers she had no idea how they would get away on the other hand she thought with a twinge of guilt at her selfishness i dont want to be the one covering their rear either she flung herself out of her tent with all of those things of her worldly goods that she needed to survive on her back and in her two hands no more with the addition of a ration pack for herself and her horse than hellsbane could carry and still run everything else she left without a second thought not everyone was so pragmatic she and shallan had to physically tear relli away from her wardrobe and drag her toward the picket lines the wolflings in the next camp over were already on their way out pouring over the back way as fast as their feet could march the skybolts of all the companies were the likeliest to survive intact with each of them mounted on light agile horses and with so much broken ground available to hide them that is the company would survive as always the survival of an individual was problematical shallan and relli were nearly the last to arrive relli took one look at lerryns grim expression and shut her mouth on the last of her laments without another word the trio accepted their ration sacks from the quartermaster tied their packs behind their saddles and mounted up lerryn waited until the last straggler joined them before mounting his own beasta rawboned roan a full hand taller than anyone elses beastthat was renowned for being able to lose any rider but lerryn within ten heartbeats of mounting were in trouble people he said without preamble the karsites have the main road blocked the back way is full of foot troops and the other four tracks in have watchers on them we stayed till last to give the foot a head start and let our own scouts get in now it looks like were stuck suggestions east for karse gies said they wont be expecting that and we found a game trail over the top of the cliff at the northeast end of the valley we never bothered using it cause its a bitch to get up well take it lerryn said instantly gies the scout took the lead the rest fell in behind him in a loose formation as the last of the wolflings vanished over the game trails kero wished luck on their departing backs they were all going to need it twelve there had been watchers on that game trail not as many as on the other ways out but enough gies thought he had all of them tagged and lerryn sent skybolts out to take care of thembut either gies had missed one or someone slipped up one of the watchers had gotten away from their counterambush no one knew until theyd gotten out of the valley and were headed toward one of the roads that would bring them back to safety that was when they discovered that the karsites had mounted skirmishers too with more bows and faster horses andmost telling of allmore men the escape had turned into a rout fighting then running then fighting again somehow they all managed to stay together desperation gave them speed and cunning they didnt know they had they managed to leave their attackers behind in confusion giving them just enough lead to get reorganized they headed north at top speed taking advantage of a stream to break their trail at least temporarily at sunset lerryn had split the force taking half of them with him leaving half with his second in command shallan and relli had gone off with the captain kero had stayed with icolan ar perdin the second a dour little man who had survived more routs than kero cared to think about the half with lerryn had ridden south icolan took his group northward again and a little east they hoped to confuse their pursuers enough to give both halves time to get to safety but bad luck followed icolans troops for the karsites made up their minds quickly on discovering the split trail and chose their half as the ones to follow bad luck or a curse kero thought as she guided hellsbane afoot through the darkness stumbling now and again over a root or a rock some of the others were already muttering things to that effect for it seemed uncanny the way the karsites had been able to find them after the split no matter what they did how carefully they covered their trail if they stopped to rest even for a moment a scout sent along the backtrail would return with the unwelcome news that they were still being followed she held her mares rein loosely hellsbanes ears and nose were infinitely superior to hers and hellsbane had twice been able to detect followers before kero had unless i unshielded and looked for them with my thoughts noim afraid to what if theyve got someone stronger than me with them warrl had warned her about the dangers of meeting someone unfriendly with a far more powerful gift such a one could take kero over hearing with her ears seeing with her eyes for everyones sakes i cant take the chance she decided as long as i dont crack my shields im safe if i doi could be risking more than myself i could betray the entire group that was something she would not chance however tempting it was to use that ability of hers to check on their pursuers hellsbanes natural sensitivities of ear and nose were why they were tailmost ready to call an alert in case the karsites found them yet again it might have been a curse following them it might also have been the workings of sunlord vkandis the karsite god kero was pretty certain that she had seen priestly sorts among those bandits but hadnt had any hard evidence although shed reported her suspicion lerryn had just shrugged hed never had any dealings with a deity or demideity friendly or otherwise and so was inclined to doubt the power of clerics but kero had a feeling that it had been the priests of the sunlord that had gotten word back to karse of the siege and not by physical messengers either as kero had every reason to know there were other means of communication besides physical messengers they were practically on the karsite border and kero had heard from tarma the kind of proprietary interest a deity could have for her peopleand the ways in which she could if she chose intervenedown on the dhorisha plains if the sunlord chose to enlighten his priests as to the location of their avowed enemieswell it certainly wouldnt be unheard of or there was another more arcane explanation the religion of the sunlord forbade the use of magic but the ability to work magic was both an inborn gift as well as the result of study so where did all the mages born in karse go kero had her suspicions and had ever since she found out about the prohibition the mages born with the gift went into the priesthood of course the priests of the sunlord could easily say their magics were godgranted miracles and no one would be any the wiser that could be the other reason for being pursued they could have a mage on their trailand since the hedgewizard tarres had gone with lerryns half of the skybolts it didnt take much guessing to figure which half would be followed the half without the mage attached would be much easier for another mage to track especially since tarres was undoubtedly working his earthmagics to hide the mercs from magesight kero had tried to communicate with her sword to get the damned thing to cover their trail magically but it had been as unresponsive as an ordinary piece of steel the trail ahead opened up into a clearing suddenly there were stars overhead instead of interlacing tree branches kero picked out the sounds of many horses and a few whispers and deduced that icolan had decided to halt them whats up she whispered as soon as she came within range of the closest shadowshape conference the shape whispered back one hand on its horses nose to keep it silent not a halt for rest then that was a disappointment but hardly a surprise kero turned hellsbane around and pointed her head along the backtrail making use of the mares superior senses to keep watch for the rest of the party guard she said into the grays ear and slipped the rein over her arm leaving hellsbane relatively free while the mare guarded the trail with ears and nose kero slipped her water bottle off the front of the saddle and took a longwishedfor drink her stomach was too knotted with fear and tension to even think about eating but some of the others had taken advantage of the brief rest to snatch a mouthful or feed a handful of grain to a horse finally the word went around the circle theres a fork in the game trail were splitting again kero sighed it was a logical move but not one she relished and it meant theyd be moving on into the night she patted hellsbanes neck comfortingly the mare wasnt going to like this either they split twice more during the grueling halfblind trek through the darkness and when dawn trickled pale pink light over the hilltops and through the thick trees there were no more than twenty riders left in keros group she didnt know any of them terribly well except for the leader the head of all the scoutgroups a colorless woman known only as lyr she mounted with the rest at lyrs signal and they formed a group around her i know youre all tired the scoutleader said in a flat voice but we still have at least one party on our tail im going to try something back there in the dark they may have lost track of who was following what and if youre with me on this i want to head straight across the border into karse itself the hardbitten man in worn leathers on keros right coughed as if he was holding back an exclamation or objection lyr turned her expressionless eyes on him for a moment i know what youre thinking tobe she said with no sign of rancor youre thinking im crazy cant say i blame you heres my thought if we head straight across the border open like and stop trying to hide the backtrail they may think theyve gotten confused in the dark and theyre following one of their own groups border wont be patrolled that thickly here they save the heavy patrols for farther in they do said a stocky girl that had just joined before the beginning of this campaign a brownhaired browneyed brownskinned girl with farmer all over her but she had to be good or she wouldnt be a skybolt why bandits lyr said succinctly real ones karsites let em stay here both to confuse the issue when their regulars come across raiding and to discourage their own people from trying to cross over into someplace else so theres a kind of buffer zone along here that the karsite patrols dont bother with the girl nodded her lips tightening a little which means thats something well have to look out for too lyr shrugged its them or the real karsites behind us bandits would only kill us if we lost a good point the girl replied bleakly and from her tone kero guessed that this was yet another skybolt who had personal experience of the karsites sounds like a good plan to me kero said quietly when lyr looked to her and she saw several others nodding including the brown girl then lets go for it lyr turned her horse around and sent the beast trotting east toward the border during the night they had gone from dry scrubcovered hills to lusher lands thickly covered with the kind of trees kero felt justified in calling a tree the hills were taller too and although they were also rockier and more precipitous the soil seemed richer here if this was the kind of territory karse was trying to claim kero could understand their reasoning although she obviously couldnt agree with it within a few furlongs the game trail came out above a real trail one with the signs of shod hoofprints on it instead of avoiding the trail as they had been lyr led them right down onto it and they rode along single file as if they belonged here kero who was riding tail again had to keep reminding herself not to turn and look behind it felt as if there were eyes and arrows trained on her back the moment they broke out of cover even though she knew their followers couldnt possibly have gotten within lineofsight yet only the presence of birds and an occasional rabbit or squirrel along the trail gave her any feeling of real comfort if there had been someone ahead of them there wouldnt be any birds to startle up as they were doing if there was someone following them off the trail the birds would be similarly disturbedand the only birds on the wing kero saw were those who were going about normal business not those whose straightline flights showed them to be frightened into taking wing she saw lyr watching the birds too and coming to the same conclusions for the scout leaders shoulders relaxed marginally gradually as the morning lengthened and the sun rose above the trees she lost that feeling of having watchers behind her lyr stopped the group from time to timebut she didnt send one of the others back to look for pursuers as kero had expected she would she went herself the first two times she returned with the faintest of frowns but the third just before noon she returned with just as faint a smile she let them all stop when their path intersected with a clear cold river which horses and riders were equally grateful for she didnt say anything but everyone knew they were no longer being followed and it was safe to rest for a little eat and rest and water the horses watering the horses came first for all of them at the beginning of their flight quite a few of the skybolts had remounts with themvery few horses had the stamina of hellsbane and most scouts had two or even three extras now those remounts were gone lost in the fighting and after a steady night of riding the beasts were weary not lathered but worn without any reserves when lyr finished watering her horse unsaddled and quietly tethered it and spread some grain for it to eat the rest of the group sighed with relief and followed her example their horses were their lifeand it had worried all of them to have to treat them this way who wasnt out yesterday lyr asked and got four hands in reply all right she said you four are first guard wake four more about midafternoonwhore my volunteers kero was about to raise her hand but someone else beat her to it so instead she tethered hellsbane munched a handful of dried fruit and laid herself down on what looked like bracken with her bedroll for a pillow pausing only long enough to loosen the straps of her armor a little she was asleep as soon as shed wriggled into a marginally comfortable position it seemed as if shed just closed her eyes but when she woke to a hand shaking her right shoulderright was for safe waking left for when you wanted someone to wake up quickly and quietly because of a bad situationshe sat up and rubbed her eyes without a grumble her waker was tobe and he smiled sympathetically as she blinked at him however short a time it had seemed the sun was a lot farther west than it had been when shed dropped off to sleep and there was no doubt shed gotten the full amount of rest promised satisfied that she was awake tobe moved on to the next fallen body kero levered herself up out of the bracken wincing a little at bruises and rubbed places and glad she was still too young to suffer from jointache from sleeping on the ground and gods be thanked for keeping me in one piece through all thismay you continue to do so she walked stiffly to streamside up current of where the horses were and knelt down on a wide flat stone on the bank tobe joined her as she gathered a doublehandful of cold water and splashed it over her face it felt wonderful especially on her gritty eyes fill your water skin he advised lyr says were right off our maps and she has no idea when well hit water next kero nodded and splashed her face again wishing she dared bathe going dirty could be dangerous as well as unpleasant if the enemy used dogs or pigs as guards or if their horses were trained as was hellsbane to go alert at an unfamiliar scent you were a fool not to bathe as often as you could but there was no hope for it there was no time she compromised by taking just long enough to strip off her armor and change the tunic and shirt underneath lyr and several of the others were already doing the same so it was safe to assume she wouldnt take keros head off for causing an unnecessary delay dirty shirt and tunic were rolled as small as possible and went into the bottom of the pack food and drink came next hellsbane got her full ration of grain first plus kero pulled a good armful of grass for her then kero dug out a handful of dried meat and another of dried fruit she resaddled hellsbane while both of them were eating promising the mare a good grooming as soon as possible a kettle was making the rounds when she accepted it from the brown girl it proved to be half full of some kind of herb tea kero raised an eyebrow at her but the girl shrugged so kero dipped the tin cup in it and drank it down it was fekalea doublestrength and unsweetened it was bitter as death and a powerful stimulant some of the scouts used it on long patrols lyr must have found someone with a supplyassuming she didnt have any herselfand made up a sunbrew while they all slept a black kettle left in the sun to steep made tea as strong as anything boiled and lyr was too canny to risk a fire theyd probably all need this tea before the night was over too little sleep had killed plenty of times as someone nodded out and fell behind the rest on a trek like this one when the kettle finished its round lyr took it from the last to drink and beckoned them all close to her they stood shoulder to shoulder in a huddle like children before a game were in karse now in the buffer zone she said quietly therell be no fires while were here nothing to bring us to the attention of anyonea karsite patrol wouldnt have a fire either they make cold camps always unless theyre in a siege were going a little farther east riding this trail until just after sunset then well be turning north through the night then west as soon as we hit anything that looks like a road once we start going west well be traveling entirely by night the karsites do that sometimes and itll be harder for someone to tell that we arent a patrol of theirs if we meet em after dark if that happens is there anybody who speaks karsite better than me the brown girl spoke up me mums karsite she offered can you give me a bit of a speech about going west to harass the heathen with all the sunlord crap attached the girl spouted off a bit of liquid gabble difficult to believe that a people as intransigent and violent as the karsites had such a beautiful language kero didnt understand it but lyr evidently did she nodded in satisfaction better than me by a good furlong right if we run into a patrol youre the leader think you can reckon what to tell em without me coachin you aye the girl asserted sturdily blushing a bit mum useta tell us what them officers was likebit like the rethwellan reglars only stuffed full of that religious dung and stricter about orders and rules so long as i keep insisten its orders were followin and praise vkandis often enough should be all right the half of em cant read nor write so havin verbal orders isnt going to make em think twice lyr looked satisfied and patted the girl on the shoulder right then lets mount up and make some time they turned to their horsesand that was when hellsbane flung up her head and screamed a warning kero didnt even stop to think she just threw herself across the clearing and into the saddle she didnt quite make it before the horse lunged she only got halfway over clinging with both hands and gritting her teeth as the mare threw herself sideways to avoid a swung ax the ground had sprouted armed men it seemedhellsbanes scream had been the only warning before the attack lyr must have left someone as a guard but just as surely those guards were dead now hellsbane pivoted kero managed to use the mares momentum to swing herself properly up into the saddle she pulled need then and looked for a target battle fever took over she was wide awake and alert feeling as fresh as if shed risen from a feather bed with a full nights sleep behind her there was someone else operating behind her eyes now someone who took a fierce enjoyment in dealing death and evading it later shed be tired and a little sickbut not now not now when her heart raced and the blood sang in her ears and everything seemed sharper and clearer than it ever was outside of a fight she had plenty of targets to choose from as motley as these attackers were they had to be real bandits but they outnumbered the skybolts and they knew how to fight in general a mounted fighter has the advantage over an unmounted man but these bandits knew how to negate that advantage in fact even as she looked for a target she spotted a snaggletoothed bearded man swinging for kero with a hooked pike designed to catch in her armor and unhorse her assuming hellsbane let him the mare saw him as soon as kero did she reared a little in place to warn her rider then reared to her full height flailing out with both hooves and crowhopping forward on her hind legs as she did so he was not expecting that and froze mouth open staring at the horse those powerful hooves caught and splintered the pike then came down squarely on the head of the wielder he collapsed going down without a sound hellsbane dropped down on his body just to make sure of him then spun on her hindquarters to take out the axwielder shed evaded earlier with her formidable teeth while kero took care of a swordbearer who had come up on the opposite side the fool shouldnt have been flinging a sword around his head kero took off the swordsmans hand while hellsbane snapped inches away from the axmans face the axman tried to get out of her way stumbled backward and fell and she surged forward to trample him a large shadowhoofbeatskero sensed someone coming up from behind but hellsbane was already ahead of her the mare lashed out with her hindfeet and caught another horse squarely in the jaw kero clung to the saddle while the mare pivoted again quick as a snake bringing her into striking position as the injured horse started to stumble hellsbane lashed out with forehooves this time and caught the horse in the neck and shoulder the other horse started to fall the rider was flailing both arms for balance and wide open keros slash opened his stomach leather armor and all hellsbane scrambled over their bodies pivoted again and kero found herself facing a pair of swordsmen this time she signaled hellsbane to charge them they werent quite ready and she figured theyd scatter if they saw the mare coming for them they did kero cut at one as she passed though she didnt think shed done him any real damage that gave her a bit of breathing space and now that she had a chance to look up she saw that she was alone and no longer in the clearing the others were just barely within sight far downstream somehow shed gotten separated from themand it seemed as if the bandits thought she was a far better prospect and were concentrating their efforts on her maybe its hellsbane she thought parrying yet another swordstroke just now noticing that her arm was getting tired and heavy shes a tempting target even if they dont know what she is dear gods what am i thinking ive got to get back to the rest she urged the mare in the direction of the others but once again they were cut off and kero had a confusing impression of being forced step by step toward the bank of the river the river if i can get to it ill at least have one direction they cant come at me from she gave hellsbane the signal the mare needed no further urging she gathered herself and surged toward the beckoning water while the bandits tried to intercept them she wouldnt have any of it though they prevented her from making that bank she got within a few feet running two of the bandits right off the bank in the process she screamed and rushed again heading farther downstream away from the vanishing skybolts but once more toward the riverbank kero blinked as they burst through the brush and came out on a low bluff above the water this didnt seem to be the same river theyd camped beside it was much wider and deeper the opposite side farther than kero would care to swim seeing how rapid the current was but this higher bluff made a good place to make a stand hellsbane had other ideas she had no intention of stopping on the top of the bluff she plowed through the last of the bushes kept charging straight on and plunged over the edge headfirst into the cold water well kero said to her horse as she was wringing out her shirt at least we lost them hellsbane munched soaked grain and dry grass stolidly ignoring the results of keros nonetoogentle ministrations the mare had quite a few wounds after the encounter cuts and slashes and a few scrapes none of her injuries were too deep but kero had stitched them anyway hellsbane was amazingly good about being doctored she didnt even object too strenuously to having minor wounds stitched up as for herself shed come out of it pretty much unscathedother than being halfdrowned soaked but unwounded bruised and battered by the rocks in the river tired to death and cold she hadnt lost any equipment this time which was no small blessing but she was completely lost she had no idea of where she could be either she had a vague idea of where they had gone in at least in relation to a mental map shed been constructing but once off that map she might as well have been on the other side of the world the rivers powerful current had swept them downstream to the south the opposite direction shed last seen the rest of the troop heading hellsbane had hit the water right where it swirled away from the bank in an irresistible flow and once out of the grip of it she could not get the mare turned to take the western bank that shed jumped from there was no help for it the mare was convinced that the western bank held nothing but enemies and would not swim back to it kero had given up and let her make for the opposite shore by the time hellsbane had made the eastern bank theyd been carried at least a league downstream now the western sky was a bloody red above the trees night would be falling soon and she was out in the middle of karsite territory completely alone with every possession she still owned soaked through and through even if shed had a map it wouldnt have survived there were a few notable exceptions to the destruction her bow had been wrapped in oiled cloth which had fortunately survived the plunge it was all right as were her little medical pack and her fire kit but everything else was a wet mess unfortunately that included the rations the journeybread was inedible the rest jerked meat and dried fruit and hellsbanes grain was in a sad state the little that was left would last a couple of days before going bad after that she and hellsbane would have to live off the land i could look on the bright side she said to the mare at least we have water and i got that bath but im cold now with no chance to warm up the best i can do is wring my clothes as dry as i can stuff myself on what food hasnt been ruined and walk hellsbane north if im lucky my clothes will dry on me without sending me into a chill then she thought better of that idea theres only me and no road maybe not maybe id just better see if i cant rig up a shelter and try for a trail or a path in the morning tarma had taught her how to rig a shelter in about any territory in a forest it wasnt too difficult a task a little work with her ax and she had enough supple willow and pine branches to weave into a leanto as the last sliver of the sun vanished on the horizon she fabricated a woven mat that should cut the wind and shed most of the rain if she happened to be completely out of luck with the last of the light she gathered dry leaves and layered first leaves then all her clothing then another layer of leaves beneath it the watersoaked jerky was even less appetizing than it was when dry but she wolfed it down anyway it was still food and if she didnt eat it shed have to throw it away she hung hellsbanes saddle blanket under a bush and turned the saddle upside down to dry that was all she could do at this point except to tell hellsbane guard the mare went on the alert and kero crawled into her bit of shelter already shivering she was sure shed never get warm and equally certain shed never sleep she was wrong on both points north or south she asked hellsbane the mare flicked her ears forward but made no commentary her clothing was dry her bedroll still soggy hellsbanes blanket was dry though so after she saddled the mare and strapped the packs on her she opened up the bedding and draped it over hellsbanes rump like a pathetic attempt at barding the mare craned her head around for a look and snorted in disgust there was a vague tugging sensation that kero recognized as coming from need west it urged she took one look at the river even wider here than where shed gone in and told it to hold its tongue or whatever it used for one she mounted settling herself over bedding and all hoping they wouldnt encounter anything unfriendly if they had to make a run for it theyd lose the bedroll south i guess she said out loud i havent a chance of catching up with the others and they wont wait for me we were going north and east so if i go south and can get back across this river i should be in the right area to make for the border again nothing answered her not even a bird she could hear birds elsewhere off in the forest but her movements had frightened them into silence here it made her feel like a creature of illomen a harbinger of death something even the birds avoided until she caught sight of a bold greencrested jay swooping down out of the trees to steal a bit of the ruined discarded journeybread then she laughed shakily and cast off her feelings of impending disaster hellfires she thought as the mare picked her way between the trees ive already had my quota of disasters i should be about due for some good luck but the imp of the perverse wasnt finished with her yetor else perhaps there truly was a curse in operation she found a patha wellworn path leading from the riverand followed it just out of sight afoot leaving hellsbane tethered in a safe place hidden by the underbrush it was just as well that she hid the horsebecause the path led to a village one with formidable walls and the village was placed across the only real road south she discovered by watching the place for half the morning that it was a very active villagethe headquarters so it seemed for the local karsite patrols the riders coming in and going out were not in uniform but they rode with military discipline and precision and kero twice saw priestly robes among them she cursed to herself but crawled back to where she had left hellsbane and retraced her steps to her cold camp where she destroyed every sign that a scout had been there there was no hiding the fact that someone had been here but she did her best to make it look as if the camp might have been the work of children i only hope that karsite younglings run off to play soldier in the woods the way we did she thought grimly as she sent hellsbane picking her way through the forest trying to keep her on things that wouldnt show hoofprintsstone pine needles and the like shed muffled the mares hooves in leather bags which should confuse things a little but hellsbane hated the boots and kero wouldnt be able to keep them on her for very long the river turned west but the terrain forming its bank worsened and they had to leave it and move farther east by midafternoon they hit another trail this one also had the tracks of horse hooves on it but they were broad hooves unshod and hopefully marked only the passage of farm animals late afternoon brought increasing signs of habitation and once again kero tethered the mare deep in the brush and went on alone afoot the territory away from the river was turning drier there were woods down in the valleys but the hills themselves supported mostly grass and bushes she climbed a tree when she picked up sounds of humans at work and realized as she surveyed this newest village from the shelter of its highest boughs that this change of vegetation was going to make traveling even more difficult it would be hard to stay hidden and impossible to disguise the mare as anything but what she was this village was much smaller than the first and did not appear to be harboring any of the karsite forces other than a single priest he herded every soul in the village into the center of town as the sun went down leading them in a longand evidently boringreligious service kero snickered a little watching some of the worshipers nodding off in the middle of the priests main speech when the last edge of the scarlet sun finally sank below the horizon he let them go they lost no time in seeking their own little cottages kero watched them until full dark then went back for hellsbane satisfied that no one would be stirring out of doors except to visit the privy as darkness covered the cottages her sharp ears had caught the sounds of bars being dropped over doorways all across the village these people feared the dark and what it heldtherefore darkness was her friend therefore i wont be getting any sleep tonight she added with a sigh as she took hellsbanes reins in her hand and moved cautiously toward the sleeping village walking on the side of the road and ready to pull the mare into cover at the first sign of life other than herself i wonder how they get the troops to travel at night if the common folk are so afraid of the dark then again maybe the troops are what theyre afraid of the village itself was not the kind of untidy sprawl of houses she was used to this place was a compact huddle of thirty or forty singlestoried cottages mostly alike ranged on three sides of the village square the fourth side was taken up by four larger homes and what kero presumed to be the temple and the entire village was surrounded by an area that had been cleared entirely of brush and trees leaving nothing but grass the arrangement made it possible for her to skirt the edge of the village without leaving the shelter of the trees and still see anything moving among the houses the place was uncanny that much was certain once again she had the feeling that there were eyes out there but this time she also had the feeling those eyes were somehow missing her there was definitely something in that village something that held the inhabitants silent and hidden in their houses something that scanned the night for anything that didnt belong there like me she thought glad shed put hellsbanes boots back on and equally glad that the mare was too welltrained to give her away with a whicker to the farm beasts its looking for something like me only it cant find me maybemaybe needs finally doing something damned if im going to drop shields to find out it seemed to take half the night to creep past the village and once past she didnt relax her vigilance in the least she stayed in the shadow of the trees for furlongs then she mounted the mare and rode out on the road to the east and she didnt leave that cover not even when the village was long past that vigilance paid off shortly before dawn when she thought she heard hoofbeats ahead of her the sound faded after only an instant but she found a gap in the brush and dismounted to lead the mare into its concealment there she waited and waited she began to feel like a fool but not even that would send her out onto the road again before she knew without a shadow of a doubt that there was no one else on it thenshe felt that searching again and froze once again it passed over her but she felt as helpless as a mouse stuck in an open field knowing theres a hawk overhead ready to stoop the moment it moves the feeling passed but before she could take hellsbane out onto the road she heard hoofbeats the same as before but much nearerpractically on top of her position some quirk of the hills echoed them up in time to warn me she realized numbly blessed agnira if i hadnt heard them it was a long time before she could convince herself to move east and north a little west then north again never any closer to her goal never any idea of where she really was she was in sheep country nowthere were fewer priests which was a blessing but shepherds are lonely and inquisitive folk the kind she wanted to avoid at all costs twice she dropped all caution and used her gift to help her raid farms for food each time she felt that searching eye pass over her some time later as if she had inadvertently set off some kind of alarm by her use of thoughtsensing after the second time she resolved to tighten her belt further nothing was worth feeling that presence out there looking for her hellsbane was a hardy soul and could live quite happily on grass alone since she wasnt seeing heavy activity in fact fully half the time kero walked and led her instead of riding especially at night she slept by day whenever she could find cover enough to hide the mare she dreamed almost every night vague odd dreams involving need need and an old woman and a very young girl barely into her teens they werent very coherent dreams and they involved things that seemed to be right out of the wildest of legends so far in the past that they bordered on incomprehensible it was after the first of those dreams that she encountered the first priestessas opposed to priestof vkandis she had slept most of the day knowing that there was another village to pass that night and at sundown had worked her way down toward that village to keep watch until everyone was safely tucked up for the night right on schedule a cowled and robed figure appeared from the rockwalled temple and assembled the villagers she wondered idly if this villages sunset service was going to be as dull as the other ones shed overseen when the figure threw back its cowl to reveal a head of wild scarlet curls and an unmistakably feminine face shock held her in place further shock kept her frozen for a moment as the priestess raised her head and stared directly at the place where she lay concealed only the sun saved her there was a service to conduct and kero was under the impression that if there was an earthquake battlecharge or erupting volcano in progress at sunset the followers of vkandis would still conduct their devotions to the last ray of light halfway into the service kero managed to shake off her paralysis and crawl back to where shed left hellsbane tethered this time she did not wait until sunset she mounted hellsbane and rode farther eastward giving the village a wide berth and pulling every trick tarma had ever taught her to confuse and conceal her trail thereafter following every one of those dreams shed encounter a female devotee of vkandis and every single one of them seemed able to detect either her or the sword it was unnerving not the least because she hadnt knownnor had anyone else to her knowledgethat there were women placed so highly in vkandis priesthood up until this time everyone shed ever talked to had spoken of the cult as being exclusively male and certainly the little anyone outside of karse knew of it painted the credo as being thoroughly misogynistic certainly the karsites had very little use for women in general and positively despised fighting women like the ones in the ranks of the skybolts reserving particularly gruesome treatment for them when caught and yetthe order of vkandis was a militant order every one of the women kero had seen had worn a sword the order of vkandis deplored the use of magicyet she had felt magic searching for her and these women seemed perfectly willing to employ something like enough to magic as to make no difference it appeared that whatever the outside world knew of karse and the state religion there were things going on within it that were not to be discovered until one penetrated into the country itself what those things meant kero had no idea except that she had better keep her head down and her behind wellhidden or she wasnt going to be telling anyone of her discoveries except perhaps an inquisitor i think ive been in hiding forever she thought dispiritedly from her concealment among the rocks above the road sundown would be soon and then she could get on her way for all the good it does me hoof beats signaled a karsite patrol shed learned that the military were the only groups that traveled mounted she watched yet another of those womanpriests riding by her this one evidently in too much of a hurry to do more than raise her head in startlement as she passed keros hiding place in the rocks above the road and once again she wondered what the presence of highranking women in the priesthood meant maybe all that it means is that they havent much use for women except inside boundaries like its fine for women to do anything for the glory of the sunlord but outside the priesthood theyd better not even think of doing anything besides stay at home and breed more worshipers for the sunlord not for the first time she wondered if she ought to abandon need shed had half a dozen very narrow escapes so far and she had the feeling that the only reason she hadnt been caught was the blades belated realization that just because these were women they were not friendly toward needs current bearer but if she did abandon it the thing would only end up in the hands of some poor ignorant child who would very probably be dead the first time one of the male priests took advantage of his power and position to abuse one of his flock kero had long ago realized the same thing could have happened to her if tarma hadnt been playing guardian that night the blade had no sense of proportion and seemed to have a varying regard for the safety and health of its bearer or worse the thing could end up in the hands of one of these priestesses and kero couldnt even guess what would happen then anything she reflected brooding down on the now empty road i think need is a whole lot older than even grandmother guessed that probably accounts for a lot of the things it does anything that old has a set of priorities and plans that are a whole lot different from those of us whore likely to die if someone puts a hole in us in fact the more she thought about it the easier it was to imagine some of the things it was likely to do take over one of those priestesses and lead a religious crusade for one thing the karsites tend to go in for that sort of amusement in a big way seems to me that was how the sunlord ended up as the state religion in the first place at least i think i remember one of those history books saying something like that and thats when the karsites really got strange she snorted to herself figures make someone a devout fanatical anything and his brain turns to mulch well i sures fire dont want to be the cause of another crusade among the karsites and there was no indication the sword would even let her go in the first place if she tried to abandon it she might end up in agony dusk was falling and it was time to be on her way over the past few days the sparselyforested hills had been giving way to pine groves with mountains looming up in the distance kero had the feeling she was very near the karsevaldemar border she was certainly far enough north shed never expected to get up here in her lifetime i wish to hell i wasnt here now she put her head down on her arms and allowed herself a painful lump in her throat i want home i want out of here she wailed inside her mind i want to see the winter quarters and shallan and trei want cooked food and a real bedi want a bathi want to sleep without having to wake every few breaths because i think i hear something she was tired right down to the bone and her nerves were like redhot wire she started out of sleep lately at the least little sound but she knew if she didnt keep herself at this kind of a pitch shed lie down one night and wake only with the point of a karsite sword in her throat but worse than the rest was despair the feeling that shed never get back never see familiar faces again never see home or what passed for it and the loneliness shed thought she was cold unfeelingnow she knew differently she might not need people as desperately as shallan did but she needed them all the same usually she could shake the mood after letting it have her for a few moments but not tonight tonight despair followed her down off of the hill to the little valley and the brook shed left hellsbane tied beside it rode as her companion unseen but profoundly felt as she followed behind the karsite patrolbehind always being the safest place to be with the karsites it covered her with a gloom as thick as the duskand it was almost the death of her it was only when hellsbane snorted and balked and the sword threw a jab of agony into her head that she pulled up and realized that there were voices ahead of her she rode hellsbane off into the forest and dismounted leading the horse quietly under the pines and up onto a tiny game trail above the floor of the valley and the road running through it the crushed pine needles gave off a sharp scent that made her pause for a moment that scent could disguise the mares and make it possible for them to work around the patrol ahead of them without alerting the karsites horses she took handfuls of needles stripped from the bough crushed them between her palm and her armor and rubbed the resulting mass over hellsbanes coat the mare sneezed once and gave kero a rather astonished look but didnt really seem to object that accomplished she spotted a good place to overlook the road tethered the mare and wriggled her way down to it on her stomach a rock outcropping offered little in the way of concealment but the dusk itself provided that she got into place just in time to see the patrol that had passed her earlier returning with a prisoner a very obvious prisoner a man tied to the saddle of a muchabused mule a man dressed entirely in white thirteen something about the white uniform tugged at a halfburied memory in the back of her weary mind something to do with a priesthood no that cant be it she was still trying to make the connection when she saw something else moving below her something moving so silently that if it hadnt been for the coloror lack of itshed never have spotted it and if it hadnt been for the man she wouldnt have thoughthorseshed have thoughtghost or fog that was what it resembled a bit of fog slipping through the trees but put whiteclad man together with white horse and even a tired numbbrained merc knew what that meant this prisoner was one of the heralds out of valdemar and the karsites appreciated the heralds even less than they appreciated female fighters that horse is no horse at all at least not according to tarma she thought keeping her eyes glued to the vague white shape as it flitted from one bit of cover to another she said it wasleshya i think a spirit huh looks pretty solid for a spirit doesnt look particularly magical either the karsite troop had stopped in the middle of the road and were conferring quietly with anxious looks cast up at the mountainside above them and back behind them where they had been thewhat was itcompanion she remembered nowthe companion froze where it was the man seemed oblivious to it all slumped in his saddlebut kero had the oddest feeling that he wasnt as badly hurt or as unaware as he seemed but its going to take a lot more than wits and a magic horse to get you out of this one my friend she told him silently an army would be nice or at least one friend free and able to convince the karsites he is an army or she instantly she berated herself for thinking like a fool this man had no claim on her or her sympathy valdemar hired no mercs and probably never would she had no loyalty to his land and no personal feeling for him except that the karsites were not going to be gentle with him and there but for need and the blessings of the gods rode she damn it youre almost out of here you arent an army you arent even in good fighting shape right now and he isnt a female so need wont give a fat damn about him the priestess gave a peremptory order cutting off all further discussion the rest of the party dismounted and began leading their horses off into a little blind canyon probably to make camp while she took charge of the prisoner she rode up beside him pulled his head up by the hair and slapped his face so hard it rocked him in his saddlehe would have fallen but for the grip she had on his hair the slap echoed among the rocks as she let go and he slumped forward over the pommel even as far away as kero was there was no mistaking the priestess smile of cruel anticipation kero made up her mind then and there fine hes a herald theres probably going to be a reward if i rescue him and even if there isnt he can get me out of here through valdemar im getting him away from that bitch part of her yammered at the back of her mind telling her that she was insane for doing this for even thinking about rescuing the stranger after all she wasnt in the clear yet she was all alone and the idea of rescuing someone else was sheerest suicide she ignored that part of herself and wriggled backward keeping herself right down on the rock and ignoring scrapes until she was out of sight of the road but though she ignored good sense she did not ignore cautionthere was no telling if the karsites had deployed a scout to check the woods she kept as low and as quiet as a hunted rabbit slipping from one bit of cover to the next working her way toward hellsbane by a circuitous spiraling route the woods seemed empty of everything but birdsof course another scout a good one might not have disturbed them any more than kero did still there was no one out here that she could spot which probably meant that the karsites felt secure enough not to bother with perimeter checks which meant they also might not bother with perimeter guards if so her task took on the aura of the possible when she reached her horse she tied up hellsbanes stirrups fastening them to the saddle before muffling the mares hooves in her boots hellsbane pricked up her ears at that she knew very well what it meant though it wasnt something kero did often she was to guard keros back following her like a dog until kero needed her tarma had drilled both of them remorselessly in this maneuver it wasnt something every warsteed could learn to do but hellsbane was both obedient and inquisitive and those were marker traits for a mare that could learn the trick hellsbane had learned her lessons well the priestess and her charge had already moved on but it wasnt at all hard to guess where they had goneeven lordan could have figured it out the troop had trampled down vegetation on both sides of that little path leading off the main road kero waited watched and listened long enough for her nerves to start screaming she crossed the road in a rush like a startled deer then went up the side of the hill planning to follow their trail from above hellsbane followed making no more noise than she did she found them at the end of the path bivouacked in a little blind canyon thick with trees and by now the sun was setting somewhere beyond the trees it was slowly growing darker that was bad enoughit was going to be damned difficult to get him loose in a setup like that and harder still to get him outbut worse was that there were more of them now than shed seen in the original group where they came from or whether they were already here when the priestess and her charge arrived she had no idea it didnt much matter the odds had just jumped from five to one to about twenty to one hellfires she thought watching some of the new ones tie their prisoner securely the karsite idea of secure was enough to make her joints ache in sympathy ankles tied to wideset stakes arms bound behind his back over a thick tree limb wrists secured to ankles so that his only possible posture was kneeling and no position could be comfortable even if he was as boneless as tre that was no way to treat anyone you intended to keep for very long which argued that they didnt intend to keep him for very long i can still walk away from this she told herself settling her chin on her hands the smell of old leaves thick in her nostrils im not involved yet they havent seen me and not even his horse knows im thereand he isnt a woman so need wont give me any trouble about leaving him but the more she saw the less palatable the idea of leaving him in their hands became whatever else he was this herald was a fellow human being and a pretty decent one if all the things tarma and kethry had said about his kind were true from the look of things the priestess was about to try a little interrogation and kero knew what that meant shed seen the results of one of those sessions and was not minded to leave even a stranger to face it besides if these bastards were stopping this close to the border to question him there must be an urgent reason to do so which meant that the reward for his release would be a good one and the information he held in his head must be valuable to someone and if she could get him loose he must know the quickest way out of karse and across that border into valdemar where shed be safe if not welcome and from there she could get home that clinched it the thought of home set up a longing so strong it overwhelmed any other consideration there has to be a way she thought darkly there has to be she watched through narrowed eyes as the woman rolled up the arms of her robes and picked up one of the irons shed placed in the fire examining it critically then replacing it huh so far that priestess hasnt even looked up once so either she cant sense me or needor whichever of us these women are somehow detectingor else shes too busy either way if im very careful i might be able to do a little reading of their thoughts maybe ill overhear something thatll help she unshielded carefully a little bit at a time and sent a delicate wisp of thought drifting down among them the barest possible disturbance of the currents down there and suddenly her little finger of thought was seized and held in a desperate mental grip blessed agnira panic gave her strength she didnt know she had she snatched her mind away and lay facedown in the leaves heart pounding wildly with fear her first panicked thought was that it was the priestess her second that it was some other mage down below there but there was no sign of disturbance in the camp and no one shouted a warning or pointed in the direction of her hiding place she throttled down her panic and extended her probe a second time looking for the presence that had seized her it snatched for her again a little less wildly but no less desperate who are you she thought forming her statement clearly as warrl had taught her eldan who are you i thought i was the only one out here kerowyn you have to help me get loose he demanded interrupting her his mental voice voice shaking but firm beneath the fear ive got to get back to report fine she told him whats it worth to you or should i say to valdemar that stopped him what he seemed baffled rather than shocked he literally did not understand what she meant that was crystal clear from his thoughts what is it worth to you to be freed how much she repeated patiently money my friend whats the reward for getting you loose im not in this for my health therere easier ways of making a living he faltered ii thought you were a herald silence then as he began to take in the fact that she plainly was something else obviously not friend to clarify things for you im a professional soldier a mercenary now do you want me to get you free or not she couldnt resist a little barb those irons are going to be very hot in a moment she waited for him to respond and it didnt take long he named a figure she blinked in surprise it was more than she would have considered asking and she would have expected to be bargained down either hes more important than i thought or he has an inflated opinion of his own worth either way im holding him to it bond on it she asked he gave his bond seeming a little miffed that shed asked my companion will help you on this too he added well that only bore out everything tarma had told her about the spirithorses all right she said and noted that he seemed a little surprised that she took that last so calmly heres what well do the karsites had counted on the fact that they were in a blind canyon to protect them from attack on three of the four sides and probably were assuming that since the canyon was thickly wooded that would make fighting difficult for an opponent but while the slope kero was hidden on was indeed steep it was not too steep for a shinain warsteed and she had trained in the woods they charged silently without a cry kero knowing that the karsites would not recognize the crashing of her horse through the underbrush for an attack until it was too late she had her bow out and neither her aim nor her arrows had suffered from lack of practice the enemy fighters silhouetted themselves most considerately against the fire she picked off four of the karsite guards two of them with heartshots and two through the throat while still on the way in already battle fever had her and her world narrowed to target response there was no room for anything else meanwhile commotion at the mouth of the canyon signaled the companions charge kero had felt a little guilty about putting the unarmed horse there but the companion was not going to be able to cut eldan free and she was hellsbane skidded to a halt beside the kneeling herald and kero swung her leg over the saddlebow and vaulted off her back letting off another arrow and getting a fifth score as she did so weeks spent behind the karsite lines had given her a rough command of their language she heard the shouts and realized that from the plurals being used that they had mistaken the gray warsteed for a white companion and herself for another heraldit would have been funny if shed had any time to think about it she slashed at the heralds bonds while the companion charged down and trampled two more karsites in his way and hellsbane reared on her haunches and bashed out the brains of a third the ropes to his ankles and wrists were easy enough to handle but just as she was getting ready to saw at the thongs binding eldans arms to the log two more of the karsites rushed her she tossed a knife at the heralds feet while parrying the first karsites rather clumsy attack he was easily dispatched but his friend arrived and another with him hellsbane got there first halfreared and got the first from behind and the companion fought his way to the heralds side now at least she didnt need to worry about having to guard him while he cut himself free she thought shed been hit a couple of times but the wounds didnt hurt since they werent slowing her down she ignored them as usual the horses were doing the job of four or five fighters charging and trampling every sign of organization and scattering people before them like frightened quailand kero began to think this was going to workthen she wheeled to face an opponent she sensed coming up behind her and her sword froze her in midslash the new opponent was the warriorpriestess a woman and need would not permit her to carry out her attack letmegoyoustupidbitchofahunkoftin she screamed mentally at the blade seeing her death in the smiling eyes of the priestess in the cruel quirk of her lips in the slow preparatory swing of the priestess macethen a tree limb swung down out of the gathering darkness and with a resounding crack broke in half over the womans head the priestess dropped the mace and fell to the ground like a stone need let kero go muttering into the back of her mind in sleepy confusion then subsiding into silence thanks she told the herald with all the sincerity she could manage anytime he replied grinning but there were still far too many karsites in this camp and the stunned disbelief that took them when their leader went down wasnt going to last much longer kero made a running jump for hellsbanes saddle vaulting spraddlelegged over the mares rump and landing squarely in place the herald followed her example a half breath behind and she couldnt help itshe indulged in a bloodcurdling shinain warcry as they thundered out the canyon mouth running over two more karsites who werent quick enough to get out of the way let em figure that out have we gone far enough do you think she asked eldan wearily about a candlemark before dawn i certainly hope so he replied his voice as dull and lifeless as hers and i doubt very much theyre going to follow our trail where in havens did you learn all that that trailmuddling stuff i mean its my job she reminded him and looked up at the sky critically there were still stars in the west but the east was noticeably lighter above the thick pines it was time to find somewhere to hide for a while we need a cave or a ledge overhanging some bushes or something she continued were going to need to hide for at least two days maybe three maybe more so its going to have to stand up to some scrutiny i want a cave i really do he looked bewildered and not particularly happy two days three but she cut him short i know what youre thinking trust me on this one im hurt youre hurt and the karsites are going to expect us to make straight for the border we need time to recover and we need time for our trail to age if we hole up back here and stay here well get in behind them they wont look for us to come from that direction herald eldan was hardly more than a dark shape against the lighter sky and she realized that she really didnt know what he looked like he shook his head dubiously then shrugged all right you obviously know what youre doing you did get me out of there he gestured grandly lead on my lady ordinarily that would have caused her to snap im nobodys lady much less yours but something about eldanan unconscious graciousness a feeling that hed treat a scullery maid and a princess with the same courtesy made her smile and take the lead afoot with hellsbane trailing obediently behind like an enormous dog she knew what she was looking for when shed started searching here among the cliffs off the road following the barest of game trails and she had the feeling shed find it in these uneven limestone slopes a cave somewhere they could could hide and rest and not have to worry about searchers above all though their hiding place had to be big enough for the horses toomaybe eldans companion could make himself into a drift of fog and escape notice but hellsbane was all too solid she tried several places that looked promising but none of them were near big enough she began watching the sky with one anxious eye the rising sun had begun to dye the eastern horizon a delicate pink and once the karsites had completed their morning devotions the hunt would be well and truly up there was one advantage a small one bats would be returning to their lairs for the day and bats meant caves there was a ledgeand she thought she saw a dark form flit under it she fumbled her way up to it tired limbs no longer responding reactions gone all to hell predictably she tripped completely lost her balance and grabbed for a bush she missed it entirely she fell down the slope with a strangled cry rolling over and over landing in a tangle of bushes and falling through the clutching spiky branches into blackness with a notsostrangled shriek she got a face full of gravel and rolled farther finally hitting her head and seeing stars for a moment she lay on her back in the darkness her ears ringing wondering what she was doing there kerowyn she blinked trying to remember where she was and who that voice could belong to kerowyn the voice certainly sounded familiar she sat up and her head screamed a protestbut it all came back eldan the rescueright im in here she cried hearing her voice echo back at her from deeper in the darkness with an elation not even her aching head could spoil are you all right she looked in the direction of the voice and saw a lighter patch in the dark that must be the entrance screened off by bushes so thick she hadnt even guessed it was there pretty much she replied getting carefully to her feet and sitting right back down again prudently when her head began to spin can you bring the horses in here right now my knees are a little shaky i think so there were sounds of someone thrashing his way through bushes leaving then returning it looks big enough hang on im going to make a light she winced at the sudden flare of light and looked away toward the rear of the cave interestingly she couldnt see an end to the darkness when she looked back again eldan had a candle in one hand and was leading hellsbane in the horse whickering her protest at being taken through scratchy bushes but obeying him readily enough which was a miracle she should be breaking your arm you know she said conversationally as eldan coaxed the mare down the slippery gravel slope to the bottom of the cave shes trained not to obey anyone but me or someone ive designated that shes worked with in my presence she should be trying to kill you or at least hurt you one of my gifts is animal mindspeech he said just as casually then he dropped the reins grinned at her thunderstruck expression and scrambled back up the slope leaving the candle stuck onto a rock oh she said weakly to the mare animal mindspeech of course i should have known doesnt this hurt eldan asked peeling bloodsoaked and dried cloth away from a slash on her leg the wound wasnt deep but it was very messy she was bleeding like the proverbial butchered pig and now that they were safe it definitely did hurt quite a bit as a matter of fact yes she replied from behind gritted teeth it hurts then why dont you yell a littleit might do you some good it isnt going to do any good to howl much as id like to she pointed out and there might be someone out there to hear me he sighed and repeated what hed just told her earlier one of my gifts is animal mindspeech my lady if there was anyone out there the wild things would know it and id know it the only creatures that are going to hear you are some deer and a couple of squirrels call it force of habit then she replied clenching her fists while he continued to clean the wound as he talked shed already done the same service for him finding mostly bruises and a couple of nastylooking cuts and burns where the priestess had tried a little preliminary work on him he proved to be quite a handsome fellow lean and muscular a little taller than she was with warm brown eyes and hair of sablebrown but with two surprising white streaks in it one at each temple he had high cheekbones a stubborn chin and a generous mouth that looked as if he smiled a great deal i dont think this needs to be stitched he said finally just bandaged really well thats a relief she allowed herself to smile thanks for taking care of everything im sorry i had to find this place with my head eldan had spent a couple of candlemarks pulling up armloads of grass and bringing it into the cave for the horses then hunting up food for the humans that was when hed assured her that his gift of understanding animal thoughts would keep him safe somehow she hadnt been too surprised that hed brought back roots edible fungus and fish obviously if there was going to be any red meat or fowl brought in she would have to be the hunter and that would have to wait until tomorrow since shed managed to give herself a concussion when she fell but the ceiling of the cave was high enough that a fire gave them no problems and the hot fish wrapped in a blanket of clay and stuffed with the mushrooms together with the roots roasted in hot ashes tasted like the finest feast shed ever had how in the havens did you ever become a mercenary eldan asked wrapping a bandage around her leg and securing it sort of fell into it i suppose she replied i expect this is going to sound altogether horrible to you but i happen to be good at fighting and i didnt want the kinds of things considered acceptable for young ladies like husbands and children to her mild amazement eldan nodded my sister felt the same way its just that i cant imagine anyone with the gift of mindspeech being comfortable with killing people i dont use it much the gift i mean wouldnt miss it if it got taken from me she felt a little chill eldan was the only person besides warrl to know about this socalled gift and the idea frightened her as nothing else in the past five years could dontlet anyone know all right theres no reason why i should he assured her and somehow she believed him but i must admit i dont understand why youd want to keep it secret if you dont use it that much i live with mercenaries she pointed out to him people who value their privacy and who generally have secrets ah he nodded where among the heralds such gifts are commonplace and we understand that one doesnt go rummaging about in someone elses mind as if it were a kind of oldclothes bin theres a certain protocol we follow and even the ordinary ungifted people understand that in valdemar for a moment she tried to imagine a place where that would be true a land where she wouldnt be avoided for such an ability or considered dangerous she shook her head places like that were only in tales well were different he admitted let me look at that slash along your ribs hmm she pulled off her tunic and pulled up her shirt without thinking twice about it shed have done the same with tre or gies or shallan but when eldan cleaned the long shallow cut with his gentle hands she found her cheeks warming and she discovered to her chagrin that she found his touch very arousing thats not surprising she rationalized we both came very close to death back there the body does that gets excited easily after being in dangerive seen shallan vanish into the nearest bushes with relli both of them covered in gore coming close to death seems to make life that much more important hellfires ive felt that way plenty of times i just never did anything about it because there wasnt anyone around that i wanted to wake up with hes somebody i wouldnt mind waking up with she caught the way her thoughts were tending and sternly reprimanded herself but thats no reason to start with him you know my lady whispered a little caress of a thought across the surface of her mind just because youve always been afraid of something thats no reason to continue to fear it for a moment she was confused then angry with him for eavesdropping on her thoughts until she realized he was talking about mindspeech not sex but the touch of his mind on hers was as sensuous as the touch of his hands just under her breasts the only other mindspeaker shed ever shared thoughts with was warrl and he was not only unhuman he was a neuter she had never felt anything quite so intimate as eldans thought mingling with hers there were overtones that speech alone couldnt convey a sense that he found her as attractive as she found him an intimation that his body was reacting to the nearbrush with death in the same way were going to have to stay in here until the hunt dies down she thought absently more than half her attention being taken up with the feel of his warm hands soothing her aching ribs and the silken touch of his thoughts against her mind its going to happen sooner or laterwere both young and were both interested theres no earthly reason why we shouldnt if we dont things are only going to get very strained in here she caught his hands just as he finished bandaging her ribs and slowly and quite deliberately drew him toward her he was surprisedoh not entirely just surprised that she was so forward she suspected there was just a sudden flash of something like shock and only for a moment she deliberately kept her mind open to his touch and after a brief hesitation his thoughts joined hers as their lips met and he joined her on her bedroll she prepared to kiss him parting her lips only to find hed done the same she chuckled a little at his evident enthusiasm he slid his hands under her shirt over the breasts he had been trying very hard not to touch a moment before she undid the fastenings of his breeches and helped him to get rid of them while he rid her of shirt and underdrawers tired and battered as they were they moved slowly with each other taking their cues from the things picked out of each others minds making love mindtomind like this was the most incredibly intimate and sensuous experience kero had ever experienced and it was evident that eldan was no stranger to it in fact given the evidence of her senses shed have to account him as very experienced in a number of areas with a formidable level of expertise quite a difference from daren at some point the candle burned out leaving only the fire for illumination she hardly noticed she saw him just as clearly with hands and mind as she did with her eyes one more thing that was different from daren incredible patience it had been a very long time since her last lover eldan was understanding and gentleand made certain she was fully satisfied sated in fact before taking his own pleasure pleasure in which she joined thrilled by the overwhelming urgency she felt rushing into her from his mind he arched his back and cried out then slowed breathing ragged and spent and came to rest atop her they lay together entwined and gradually kero realized he was falling asleep and fighting it she soothed the back of his neck with a delicate brush of fingertips and he sighed at the wordless exchange and gave up the fight he withdrew from her gently and slowly still aware of all the sensations of each others bodies when she was certain he wasnt going to wake she carefully disengaged herself found another dry piece of wood and threw it on the fire giving her a little more light to see by she reached out and caught a corner of his bedroll shook it out and draped the blankets over both of them as she settled in beside him she noticed the companion stare at him and sigh before turning toward the entrance of the cave in a guard stance that was the last thing she saw as she fell asleep when she woke eldan was already awake and about in fact that was what had awakened her wisely he did not attempt to move quietlyanything that sounded like stealth would have sent her lunging to her feet with a weapon in hand she woke just enough to identify where she was and who was with herthen enjoyed the unwonted luxury of taking her time about coming to full consciousness there was no hurry she certainly wasnt going anywhere especially not today today she was one long ache from the soles of her feet to the top of her head just bruises and muscle aches of course the cuts would be halfhealed scars by now or more accurately halfhealed scars she suspected that the wounds she had taken had been a great deal worse when shed gotten thembut one of needs attributes was that she healed the bearer of just about anything short of a deathwound shed surreptitiously made certain that the sword was under her bedroll well padded to avoid making a lump before shed undressed to have eldan tend to her injuries she didnt have to be in physical contact with it for it to heal her it just had to be nearby but under her bedroll was where she liked to put it when she had hurts that needed to be dealt with she certainly would never have slept with a concussion without needs healing she wondered what eldan would make of her rapid recovery i hope hell just think a little selfhealing is one of my abilities id rather not have him asking too many questions about need grandmother said there was something odd about heralds and magic and id rather not find out what it is eldan had set about organizing the cave into a place where they could stay comfortably for several days just now he was heaping bracken into a depression and covering it with a layer of grass and after a moment she figured out why it was to be a bed of course much more comfortable than a couple of bedrolls on the cold stone floor she watched him blinking sleepily as he laid her saddle and his own upside down to dry and spread both horse blankets out to air a nest little hawk youre far more ambitious than i am she said with a yawn he looked up and grinned here he said tossing her clothing its clean i washed it all while you were asleep she shrugged off the covers and ran a hand through her hair grimacing at the feel of it i almost hate to get into clean clothing when im as dirty as i am thats easily remedied too he told her this is a limestone cave and that means water theres a tiny trickle at the back of the cave enough to keep all of us supplied and clean up a little too one of the things shed stolen on her forays after food had been a bar of rough brown soap harsh with lye but it would get her clean it had been in her packs eldan had evidently found it when hed rummaged around looking for the medical supplies such as they were he handed the soap to her with a scrap of cloth that had once been part of her shirt he didnt have much besides his bedroll and some clothing come keep me company she said heading to the back of the cave and the promised water sure enough there was a little stream running across the back of it in one side and out the other with a rounded pool worn by its motion cold too she winced as she stuck her hand in it but cold was better at this point than dirty so how did you manage to find such attractive company she asked as she scrubbed ruthlessly at dirt that seemed part of her harsh soap cold water and all well i was all tied up at the time i meant the karsites loon she said splashing water at him he ducked and grinned be careful or youll put out the candle he warned and i dont have many we really ought to make do with firelight so you want to know how i happened to be keeping company with karsites ill tell you what you answer a question and ill answer one fair enough well she said cautiously id like to know where you got such good training in your gift if you never told anyone about it he interrupted eagerly your control is absolutely amazing i told one otherperson she admitted reluctantly actually he came to me because i wasuhmaking it hard for him to sleep at night she ducked her head in the cold water more than the chill of her bath making her shiver years of concealing her abilities had made a habit of secrecy that was just too much a part of her to break with any comfort the silence between them lengthened look she said awkwardly her hair full of soap id rather not talk about it itit just doesnt seem right i really dont use it that much and id rather forget i had it he sighed but didnt insist i guess its my turn hmm well its stupid enough or rather i was stupid enough i was just across the border in a little village not spying precisely just picking up commonplace information gossip news that kind of thing she turned to stare at him wearing that blessed agnira what kind of an idiot are you not that much of an idiot he snapped then said sorry i wasnt that stupid no i was wearing ordinary enough clothing and id walked in id left ratha out in the woods outside the village walls i thought my disguise was perfect and i thought my contacts were trustworthy but obviously something went wrong i think someone betrayed me but ill probably never know for sure anyway when they first hauled me outside the walls there were only a couple of the guards and no priestess ratha tried to get me loose and they got one of my saddlebags even though they couldnt catch him and when they found the uniform they couldnt resist dressing you in it she rinsed out her hair and dried herself with the rag he handed her with a smile of amusement she recognized the rest of her ruined shirt i can see their reasoning makes it all the more evident to the priestess that they really had caught a herald he nodded and she pulled the clean clothing on dripping hair and all so thats it short and unadorned except for the reason you were over here just gathering information hmm with the ability to read thoughts not bloody likely you were posted to that village to eavesdrop on everything you could and youre more of a fool than i think you are if you havent realized id figure that out so you heralds arent quite as nobleor as stupidas you claim theres such a thing as morality but theres such a thing as expediency too i just hope you save your expediency for your enemies but she didnt say anything just strolled over the uneven surface of the cave floor to their fire so how did you end up here he asked handing her a roasted tuber and her water skin the closest fighting i know of is on the menmellith border and youre leagues away from there sheer bad luck she told him the worst run of luck i could have had except for one thingnobodys managed to kill me yet that i know of he smiled at that and she described the rout the flight the dive into the river and her continued flight deeper and deeper into enemy lands so i ended up here she finished like i said sheer bad luck not for me he pointed out she snorted well if your chosen deity brought me all this way to save your hide its going to cost you double i may not be able to collect from a god but i can certainly collect from you he laughed if any outside forces had any part in bringing you up here it wasnt at my request he protested i mean not that i wasnt praying for rescue but they caught me only yesterday and youve been on the run forwhat weeks at least she said glumly seems like months sometimes i think im never going to make it back home alive you will he replied softly she just shrugged so are you going to introduce me to your friend it hardly seems polite to keep acting like hes no brighter than hellsbane eldan brightened you mean you my weaponsmaster told me about companions she said cutting him off theyress and suddenly she was tonguetied she literally could not say the word spirit special she got out sweating with the effort absolutely the intellectual equals of you and me right exactly he beamed ratha this is kerowyn kerowyn companion ratha zhahaiallava ratha she said politely as the companion left his selfappointed watch post at the entrance and paced gracefully toward her thats shinain the greeting of my adopted clan she told both ratha and his herald it means wind beneath your wings my clans the talesedrin the children of the hawk she didnt know why the shinain greeting seemed appropriate it just fit ratha nodded to her with grave courtesy eldans eyes widened shinain he exclaimed and turned to look at hellsbane dozing over her heap of freshpulled grass thensurely thats not shes a warsteed all right kero said with pride and probably the only one youll ever see off the plains her names hellsbane smart as a cat obedient as a dog and death on four hooves if i ask it of her that much i saw he got up and walked over to the mare who woke when he moved and watched him cautiously hellsbane kero called catching the mares attention kathal desteredre hellsbane relaxed and permitted herself to be examined minutely eldan looked her over with all the care of a born horseman finally he left her to return to her doze and seated himself back by the fire amazing he said in wonder ugliest horse ive ever seen but under that hideif i were going to build a riding beast for warfare starting from the bone out thats exactly what id build my weaponsmaster claims thats what the clans did do kero said the gods alone know how they did it or even if they did it but thats what she claims amazing he repeated shaking his head then he raised it so tell me about this weaponsmaster of yours and how in the havens did you manage to get adopted into a clan she smiled its a long story are you comfortable they were both a lot wearier than either of them thought he told her to start at the beginning and she took him at his word she told him about the rideand to her embarrassment discovered that the song had made it as far as valdemar once past the decision to leave home and beg some kind of instructions from her grandmother she caught him yawning im notohthat boring am i she asked finding the yawns contagious no he said its just that i cant keep my eyes open well i dont think any karsites are going to creep up on us in the dark she admitted and its well after sundown i never once noticed anyone moving around after dark except army patrols and even they wouldnt go off the roads she did not mention the strange and frightening instances when shed felt as if she was being hunted she had no proof and anyway nothing had ever come of it she got up and went to the tangled heap of blankets intending to throw them over that invitingly thick bed of bracken hed made eldan joined her in the task still yawning they seem to think that demons travel by night he said shaking out his blanket it seems that people vanish out of their houses by nightwhole families sometimesand are never seen again and not surprisingly the ones that vanish are the ones that are the least devout or have asked uncomfortable questions or have shown some other signs of rebellion she thought about the army patrols shed seen moving about at night and was perfectly capable of putting the two together hmm demons on horseback do you suppose in uniform perhaps a good guess he acknowledged makes me very grateful i wasnt born in karse eldan spread the last of the blankets over the improvised bed and tilted his head to one side not all the vanished end up dead my lady he said some of them end up in the priesthood not a chance she exclaimed i hadnt finished they retain their skillsbut theyve forgotten everything about their old life everything it happened to someone i was watching as a possible contact she had a gift of mindspeech one that was just developing when i next saw her she didnt recognize anyone she had known before her mind was a complete blankand her devotion to the sunlord was total he nodded as she felt the blood drain from her face you meaneverybody with these gifts winds up in the priesthoodand someone in the priesthood strips their minds the idea was horrible more horrifying than rape and torture somehow rape and torture still left you with your own mind your own thoughts someone in the priesthood wipes their minds clean everything that made them what they are is gone ive been able to trigger old memories in someone suffering from forgetfulness after a head injury she filed that away for future reference but i have never been able to do so in one of the priestesses he sighed some would say that they are still better off that way than dead but i dont know she shivered uncontrollably id rather be dead he put his arms around her to still the shudders now ive told you something thats sure to make you have nightmares he said apologetically i am sorry i didnt mean to she snuggled closer in a lightning change of mood heat in her groin kindled by the warmth of his arms around her and the feel of his strong body against hers you can do something to make me forget she pointed out and nibbled delicately on his earlobe so i can he laughed and proceeded to do just that today there were hunters out there though none were near the cave and neither of them wanted to risk going out quite a few hunters were prowling the hills in factand at least a halfdozen priests the escaped herald and his rescuer it seemed were very much sought after ratha was the one who warned eldan about the priests fortunately before the herald tried any thoughtsensing with that in mind he pinpointed the enemy and identified the priests through the eyes of the animals about them he would have liked very much to touch the minds of their horses so that he could overhear what they were saying to each other but both of them felt that particular idea was far too risky maybe if youre ever in a trap you cant break out of she said in fact ill tell you what id have done if id been in your shoes with your gift back when they had you id have waited until they were sure i was helpless and then id have spooked their horses run a couple of them through the fire to scatter it and they wouldnt have been able to see you getting away then i would have hidden real close to the camp until i saw a good chance to get the hell out of there like i told you they dont expect a prisoner to stick around eldan looked at her with considerable respect there are times i wish i could convince you to come back with me and this is one of them id love to put you in charge of a class at the collegium she shuddered thank you no id rather face a siege there were other more disturbing searchers twice kero felt those searching eyes shed sensed beforethis time they were angry and she could feel the heat of their rage preceding and following them the first time she was watching at the entrance to the cave and didnt get a chance to see if eldan felt them too but the second time was just after dark when they were both lounging beside the barest coal of a fire not wanting to risk a light being seen and she instinctively flattened herself against the stone floor of the cave blood turning to icewater in her veins she looked over at a whisper of sound and saw that eldan had done the same thing what is that she hissed as if speaking aloud would bring the thing back you felt it too he also seemed impelled to whisper his words i dont know what it is it isnt any kind of thoughtsensing ive ever run up against before it doesnt seem exactly like thoughtsensing its like he groped for a description like theres actually some thing moving half in our world and half in another and the reason we can feel it is because it happens to be leaking its thoughts like it isnt shielded she considered that for a moment and demons walk at night she said he stared at her demons are only in stories he exclaimed indignantly as if he thought she was trying to make a fool out of him then he faltered as she continued to watch him soberly arent they not in my grandmothers experience she said sitting up slowly though i cant vouch for having seen one myself but consider how some of the people who vanish at night do so out of their own houses with no one else in the family aware that theyre gone until the next day he contemplated that for a moment as he pushed himself off the floor and she watched his face harden if thats got even the barest possibility of being true then its all the more important that i get back to report he did not at that moment look like a man she wanted to cross im doing the best that i can she pointed out without losing her temper after all i have quite a bit riding on getting you back myself he stared at her for a moment as if he wasnt certain just what she was she watched curiosity slowly replacing anger in his expression finally he asked if i hadnt agreed to your price back there would you have left me in their hands it would serve you right if i said yes she thought but honesty compelled her to answer otherwise if i could have gotten you loose without getting myself killed i would have she said but instead of taking you to valdemar id have convinced you it was safer to go through menmellith and once across the border and with my company id have turned you over to the mercenary guild as a war prize they would have ransomed you back to valdemar id have lost ten percent on the deal but i still would have gotten paid he stared at her shocked and offended i dont believe you he spluttered i cant believe anyone could be soso mercenary she suggested mildly that shut him up and after a few moments his anger died and was replaced by a sense of the humor of the situation all right i was out of line you have a right to make a living thanks for your permission she replied sarcastically im really getting just a little tired of his attitude he threw up his hands i give up i cant say anything right can i im sorry i dont understand you and i dont think i ever will i fight for a cause and a country and i fight for a living she shrugged im just as much a whore as any other men or women that make a living with their bodies and i dont pretend im not and maybe thats the real difference between us mercs are the same as whores people who devote themselves to causes are like one half of a lifebonded couple we do exactly the same things just i do it for money and you do it for love which may be another form of payment somaybe he still should do something about that attitude she shrugged feeling somehow just a little hurt and oddly lonely it appeared that being able to read peoples minds didnt necessarily make for less misunderstandings which is as good a reason as any to keep from using it so much i come to depend on it she decided if it cant keep two people who like each other from making mistakes about each other it isnt going to keep me from making mistakes about other things so she said when they knew there probably werent going to be any repetitions of their visitation and both of them had gotten a chance to cool down a little i dont know about you but i am not going to be able to get to sleep for a while not after having that cruise by overhead eldan sighed and looked up from the repairs he was trying to make to his clothing using a thorn for a needle and raveled threads from a seam im glad im not the only one feeling that way i was afraid you might think i was being awfully cowardly like a youngling afraid of the dark if stuff like that is out in the dark id be afraid of it too she relaxed a little he isnt going to be difficult thank the gods i dont know if being awake is going to make any difference to that but id rather meet it awake than asleep so lets talk you know everything thats important about me he started to protest then saw the little grin on her face grinned back and shrugged all i know about you is that at some point in your life you decided to make a big fat target out of yourself she fixed him with a mockstern glare so talk eldan put down his sewing and moved over to her side of the fire stretching himself out on their combined bedroll also a good sign to start with i didnt decide to become a herald no one does i was chosen the way he said the word made it pretty clear that he was talking about something other than having some senior herald come up and pick him out as an apprentice to kero it had the sound of a priestly vocation before that i was just an ordinary enough youngling one of the middle lot of about a dozen children we had a holding big enough that my father could call himself lord if he chose but he made all of us learn what hard work was like when we were under twelve we all had chores and over twelve we all took our turn in the fields with our tenants one day i was out weeding the whiteroot patch when i heard an animal behind me i figured one of our colts or calves had gotten outagainand i turned around to shoo him back to the pasture only it wasnt a calf it was ratha eldan sighed and closed his eyes as the firelight flickered over his peaceful expression kero guessed that memory must be one of the best of his life silence for a moment so whats ratha got to do with it she asked when he didnt say anything more whatsoh sorry the companions choose us you cant just march up to haven and announce you want to be a herald and your father cant buy you an apprenticeship only the companions make the decision on who will or will not be a herald ratha whickered agreement and kero glanced over to see him nodding his head well if theyre like the leshyae kalenedral that makes sense a spirit would be able to see into someones heart to know if hes the kind of person likely to forget how to balance morality and expediency ratha looked straight at her for a moment and his blue eyes picked up the firelight in a most uncanny manner and he nodded again she blinked more than a little taken aback when theyre ready to go out after their chosen companions will show up at the stable and basically demand to be saddled up its kind of funny especially to see the reaction of new stablehands he chuckled i was there one day when six of them descended on the stable each one making it very clear he wanted to be taken care of right now thank you i had someone call in some of the trainees before the poor stableboy lost his mind anyway i knew what rathas standing in the middle of the vegetable patch meant though to tell you the truth id always fancied myself in a guard uniform not heralds whites i think my parents were rather relieved all things considered one less youngling to have to provide for and we werent that far from haven they knew id be back for visits probably even several times a week mama made a fuss about her baby growing up of course but its always seemed to be more as if she did it because she thought she should both of them grinned at that couple of my mates have had sendoffs like that kero offered and no doubt in anybodys mind that they werent just as caredfor as anyone else in the family just when the tribes that big somebody has to go eventually and its a relief when its on their own aye eldan nodded vigorously other than that things were no different for me than for any other youngling at collegium average in my classes only thing out of the ordinary was the animal mindspeech had a turn for disguise got to know this little bit named selenay pretty well gave me a bit of a shock when i found out she was the heir though knows the queen by given name hmm the thought was a little chilling it pointed up the differences between them to cover it she teased if id known that your price would have been higher he opened his eyes to see if she was joking and smiled when he saw that she was thats it he concluded thats all there is to know about me no famous rides no bad scrapes until this one nothing out of the ordinary kero snorted as if heralds could ever be ordinary right tell me another one i collect rocks he offered great pastime for someone who spends his life on horseback i didnt say it was easy he protested laughingly kero laughed with him i should confess then i make jewelry actually i carve gemstones now that is a portable hobby i used to write bad poetry she glared at him i stopped she made a great show of cleaning her knife and examining the blade wise man if youd told me you still did id have been forced to kill and eat you and the world would have been safer theres nothing more dangerous than a bad poet unless its a bad minstrel she said that with such a solemn face that he began laughing i think i can see your point he chortled i think in your position id start using my extra pay to put bounties on bards ive thought about it she said wryly and not entirely in jest traditional bardic immunity can lead to some misusing their power and bards have no one making sure they behave themselves the way the healers and you heralds do only the guild he acknowledged soberly theyre pretty careful in valdemar but outside i dont know ill bet karse is using theirs theyre using their healers kero pointed out no healing done outside a temple of the sunlord when theyre in the mood they even go hunt down their poor little herbmen and wisewomen the only reason they dont go after midwives is because the priests cant be bothered with something that is only important to females eldans expression sobered considerably i didnt know that there wasnt anyone like that in the villages id been watching makes you wonder about what else theyre using i mean that it does said kero who had a shrewd notion of what they were using dark magics it was likely and no one to stop them you might as easily stand in the path of a whirlwind and all that was pitted against the two of them the night seemed darker outside their cave after that and when they made love it was as much to cling to each other for comfort as anything else the hunt stayed in their area for longer than kero had expected which led her to believe that the priestesses were getting some kind of indication of where they were during that time she got to know eldan very well possibly better than he knew a mercenary learns quickly how to analyze those he will be fighting against or besideand everything kero learned led her to trust eldan more despite having used his powers to spy on the karsites he was truly sincere in his refusal to abuse them he hadnt been so much prying into peoples minds as simply catching stray thoughts usually when people were speaking among themselves as kero had herself learned there was a preecho of what they were about to say a moment before the words emerged and to someone with her gift those thoughts could be as loud as a shout to keros mind that was no more immoral than setting spies in taverns and establishing listening holes wherever possible as her concussion healed they split the chores between themthe only exceptions being hunting eldan would happily eat what she killed but he couldnt bear to kill it himself that was fine with kero he knew what plants and other growing things were edible and she didnt so she hunted and he gathered in the intervals between karsite patrols a situation she found rather amusing two days after the hunt moved on they left their hiding place the hunters had made no effort at concealing their tracks which pleased kero no end that meant that the karsites were convinced their quarry was somewhere ahead of them and they wouldnt be looking for them in the rear they traveled by night despite the demons or whatever they were kero had the feeling that need was both attracting the things and hiding herself and the herald from them kero did her best to recall every little tidbit shed ever read or heard about such things some information didnt seem to apply like tarmas story about thalkarsh whatever was being used to find them didnt seem terribly bright which argued for it being something less than a true demon maybe a magical construct but more likely an abyssal plane elemental just about any masterlevel mage could command one of those and they werent too bright they were attracted by places where the magical energy in something or someone made a disturbance in the normal flows of such energybut once they were in the area they would not be able to find the source of the disturbance if it was strong enough to hide itself well just as it was easy to see a particularly tall tree from a distance but next to impossible to find it once you were in the forest that was how she explained it to eldan anyway but something forced her to couch it in vague terms that could apply to the mental gifts as well as the magical although she couldnt explain away the part about it being magicmade itself she found herself telling him glibly that the thing might be a creature out of the pelagirs invisible and intangible but nevertheless there where that explanation came from she had no idea but she sensed that he accepted it a little better than he would have taken anything that smacked of true magic they found a hiding place by the light of dawnan overgrown hollow covered completely with leafy vines so that she wouldnt have guessed it was there if she hadnt been paying close attention to the topography of the land the vines themselves were supported by bushes on either side of the hollow but nothing actually grew down in the hollow itself it wasnt as secure as a cave and it certainly wouldnt form much of a shelter if it rained but it was big enough for all four of them and offered excellent concealment it was then as they made love in sundappled shade that kero realized there was something out of the ordinary in her relationship with this man she felt much closer to him than she had ever felt to anyone except perhaps tarma and warrl and found herself thinking in terms of things he might want as much as things she wanted it was such a different feeling that finally she was forced to admit she was falling in love with the man not just lust though there was certainly enough of that in the relationship but love shallan would have laughed her head off she always claimed that one day the ice maiden would thawand when she fell shed go hard looks like she was right kero thought with a feeling very like pain curling up against his back with her head cradled just behind the nape of his neck and one hand resting on his hip damn her eyes anyway i wonder how much money she had riding on it it certainly hadnt been hard to fall for him he was kind personable clean very easy on the eyes a gentleman in every sense of the word he treated her like a competent human being neither deferring to her in a way that made it seem as if he was patronizing her nor foiling to say something when he disagreed with her he did not treat her like a freak for being a fighting woman the way most civilians did in fact he treated her like one of the skybolts would have if shed taken one as a lover he treated her like a partner an equal in all things she moved a little bit closer it was cold down in the hollow but she wanted spiritual comfort as well as physical right now she was feeling very lost he knows my bestkept secret hes shared his thoughts with me was that enough to make up for the differences between them was anything eldan crouched in the shelter of the branches of a tree beside kerowyn and fretted i have to get back selenay needs to know all this and she needed to know it a month ago every moment wasted here could cost us but the karsite patrols on the road below didnt seem in any mood to indulge his needs even though the sun was setting painting the western sky in pink and gold the riders on the blueshadowed road running between the hills below them showed no signs of heading back to their barracks kerowyn glanced over at him and her lips thinned a little youre not making them get out of the way any faster by fuming she whispered and youre tying your stomach up in knots relax theyll leave when they leave she just doesnt understand he thought unhappily as the riders disappeared around a bend heading north how am i ever going to get it through to her she doesnt care when she gets homehellfires she hasnt even got a home look i need to get back to the bolts just as badly as you need to get home she continued interrupting his train of thought we could still try cutting back toward menmellith if we go to menmellith itll take three times as long to get back dammit why cant she understand he knew if he said anything hed sound angry so he just shook his head vehemently and tried to put on at least the outward appearance of calm she looked away her expression brooding the last rays of the sun streaking through the boughs of the tree and striping her hair with gold he wondered what she was thinking she wants to avoid valdemar i want to bring her into valdemar with me if she can just see what its like shell understand i know she will somewhere north above the road ratha was scouting uncannily invisible among the trees he settled his mind closed his eyes and reached out for the dear familiar presence hola hayburner yes oh hairless ape ratha had seen an animal trainer with an ape at one of the fairs and the beast had sported a pair of twin streaks in its hair that were nearly identical to eldans the companion hadnt let him forget it since never let up do you im trying to lighten your mood chosen the companion replied you are going to fret yourself right off that branch if you dont calm yourself is that second patrol showing any sign of moving he asked anxiously ignoring the advice he felt ratha sigh relax will you theyve settled in but they havent set up a permanent camp i think they plan on moving before nightfall in any case we can get by them above the road i found a goat track eldan stifled a groan the last time ratha had found an alternative route theyd been all night covering a scant league of ground howahchallenging a goat track there was a hint of amusement in rathas mindvoice challenging enough itll be good for you eldan sent an image of his stilllivid bruises thats what you said about the last one you found i have four legs instead of two no hands and i weigh a great deal more than you do if i can make it over you can ratha sounded a little condescending and more than a little impatient all the fuming in the world isnt going to get us to valdemar any faster well get there when we get there you sound like kero eldan replied opening his eyes a little and taking a sidelong glance at the mercenary she had been watching him and he saw her swallow and look away she knew he was mindspeaking ratha and as always it bothered her i wish shed get over that too shes had many lessons in patience you could profit by her example ratha hesitated for a moment and eldan had the feeling the companion would have said more but was uncertain if he should on the road below them the karsites finally reappeared going back the way they had come that just left the patrol ratha was watching as the last of the sun dropped below the horizon the wind picked up and gusted a chill down eldans neck he felt a little more of a chill at rathas next words you are veryfond of this woman ratha said finally i think im in love with her eldan told his companion cautiously relieved to have it out in the open between them at last but not certain he liked the phrasing or the tone of rathas statement ithink you are too ratha replied obviously troubled i am glad for you and yet i wish you were not eldan had never hidden anything from his companion and he didnt intend to start now why he asked bluntly determined not to let things rest with that whats wrong with her i know you like her the patrol is moving off now ratha replied brightly thank you and youre changing the subject eldan wasnt about to let ratha get off that easily i wont be able to move out of this tree for at least half a candlemark im not going anywhere just what exactly is wrong with kero ratha sounded reluctant to answer she doesnt understand youus she cant understand how we can be loyal to people weve never seen be willing to stand between them and harm and for no gain she does not understand loyalty to a cause and yet what yet there is something about her that is very noble she abides by her own code and she has been very good for you you are morealive since being with her i feel more alive eldan pondered rathas statements caught kero watching him with an odd little smile on her face and felt his heart clench this strange frighteningly competent woman was not like anyone else hed ever encountered she waslike a perfect masterwork sword she could have given any of the famous beauties at court tough competition with her long blonde hair her finely chiseled features her pale aquamarine eyes competition no shed never take second place to anyone shes not only beautiful shes polished theres nothing about her that hasnt been honed and perfected until its the best it can be beside her any other woman looks like a pretty doll no fire no spirit except maybe the heraldsbut his relationships with other heralds had never gone beyond friendship and a little intimate company and he almost always had to initiate the latter kero initiated lovemaking as often as he did pouncing on him giving him soft little lovebites and growling like a large playful catlanguidly rubbing his shoulders or scratching his back then turning the exercise into more intimate caresses he shivered a little a smile playing around the corners of his mouth she was a truly remarkable exciting bedmate but she was more than that she treated him outside of bed like an absolutely equal partner taking on her share of the chores without a quibble substituting things he couldnt dolike huntingwithout an argument and she had entered his thoughts the way no one else man or woman ever had he wanted to show her his home to see her excitement her reactions he wanted to share everything with her he wanted most of all to make her understand because he wanted to hear her say she was willing to be his partner from now on i want to get her into valdemar i know once i get her there shell understand shell see what its like for us and shell understand everything if she ever could she the companion cut the thought off and eldan wondered what it was he almost said she what it doesnt matter not now just an idle speculation i agree we should get her into valdemar if we can i think it would make all the difference he felt rathas reticence and didnt press whatever it was if it was important enough ratha would tell him in his own time you are clear now the companion concluded i will check ahead eldan doublechecked the road through the eyes of every bird and beast he could touch and confirmed rathas statement he opened his eyes again and touched kero on the elbow carefully we can go he said quietly weve both checked good she replied a hint of relief in her voice i was beginning to wonder if i was going to spend the night in this tree she caught the branch she was sitting on and swung down to the one below eldan followed her marveling at her agility and her ability to move so well in the twilight gloom oh i can think of worse places to spend the night than in a tree he replied lightly as he lowered himself down onto the ground beside her so can i and ive probably been in most of them can we take to the road she dusted her hands off on her breeches and unwound hellsbanes reins from the snag shed tethered the mare to so far rathas going on ahead he says hes found a goattrack we can use if more of those patrols show up she turned a sober face toward him i hope hes finding cover for us in case more of thosethingsshow up i dont want to meet one of them out in the open with nowhere to hide no more do i he shuddered at the thought of it and marveled at her courage whod encountered the creatureswhatever they werealone without panicking shes incredible he thought for the hundredth time as he followed directly in hellsbanes tracks i have to get her back to valdemar i have to shell never want to leave fourteen theyre thinking at each other again kero observed trying not to cringe with eldan sitting and the companion lying beneath a roof of living pine boughs the herald gazed deeply into rathas eyes both of them oblivious to everything around them the ground was invisible under a litter of pine needles that must date back ten or twenty years theyd left kero on guard while the two of them conferred if kero hadnt known the sky was clear shed have sworn there was a storm coming it was that dark under this tree she looked away after a few moments and decided that halfway up this same pine tree would be just about the best lookout point she should be able to see quite a distance up the main valley from there and she wouldnt have to watch eldan and his companion as usual theyd traveled by night stopping just before dawn to find a place to hole up in during the day for the past night theyd been paralleling the main road down the center of a series of linked valleys the closer they got to the valdemar border the less populated the countryside becamebut the terrain was a lot rougher and the alternatives to the main roads fewer their hiding place this time had been a little pocketvalley off the main vale and it wasnt a place where kero would have stopped if shed had any choice there was a shepherds townnot a village but a town rating a main square a marketplace and the largest temple of the sunlord kero had seen yetat the head of the valley this had been the best they could do and it hadnt been a terribly secure place to stay a goodsized stand of tall pines with branches that drooped down to the ground ensured that there was no grass here there was no water either no one would stumble across them bringing his sheep to pasture the pines themselves provided cover one sheltered hellsbane one protected ratha and one kept the two of them hidden beneath the tentlike boughs but it was still open and too close to that town to make any of them feel comfortable kero knew she slept lightly and she was fairly certain the same could be said of eldan and ratha after they woke eldan seemed preoccupied and finally asked kero to stand watch while he and his companion talked kero had a shrewd notion that strategy was not going to be the subjectthat she was she had gotten the impression more than once that ratha liked her but didnt entirely approve of her certainly the companion wasnt likely to approve of her as a longterm liaison for his herald he thinks a lot like his herald she reflected climbing through the scratchy pine boughs carefully to avoid making the tree shake they couldnt afford any carelessness there had been too many nearescapes in the past few days the hunters were getting thicker and more not less persistent somehow in the next couple of days they had to make a try at the border which meant that parting from him was only days away she settled herself on a sturdy limb and blinked her burning blurring eyes back into focus blessed agnira what am i going to do standing watch didnt occupy a great deal of her attention which meant she had more than enough left over to worry im in love with this man hes in love with me should be a happy ending in there somewhere if this was only a ballad she bit her lip to keep from crying the whole relationship is impossible thats all there is to it its all the same problems that i had with daren only worse because i do love him i want to be with him more than ive ever wanted any other person in my life but that was the key any other person her independence had been dearly bought and she wasnt about to give it up now if she went with him giving up her position in the skybolts what would she do in valdemar the regular army might not take her and if they did she would undoubtedly find herself on the wrong end of rules and regulations every time she turned around with her record she could ask for concessions from a company that she could never get from a regular army force her peculiar talents did not fit into the parameters of a regular army she wasnt a foot or line soldier she wasnt heavy or even light infantry and she was in no way going to fit into heavy or light cavalry she was a scoutwell that was a job for the foot soldier she was a skirmisherthat was under the aegis of either light infantry bow or light cavalry sword she knew more about tactics than most of the regulation officers shed met and that would certainly earn her no points lerryn encouraged the input of his junior officers but that simply wasnt so outside of mercenary companies that assumed theyd even take her in the first place many regular armed forces wouldnt accept former mercs because they tended to have an adverse effect on discipline which would leave me living on his charity not a chance i wont ever put myself in that position again despite the lump in her throat and the ache in her chest at the thought of parting from eldan the resolution remained never i have my own life and im going to lead it he just didnt understand what could lead someone to fight for a living and it didnt look as though he ever would shed tried to point out that if a relatively ethical person didnt do the fighting that would leave it to unethical peoplehed stared at her as if she was speaking shinain for her part she could not understand his fanatical devotion to an abstract a country what on earth was there about a piece of property that made it worth dying for never mind that territorial disputes were what paid for a mercs talents more often than notshe still didnt understand it in a way she was as alien to him as one of those karsite priestesses she disturbed him more than they did because he knew they were alienshe was the woman he loved and seemed completely rational to himuntil she would say something that completely eluded him or he would say something that made no sense to her there were other differences too serious ones like his attitude toward mindspeech the way he shared his thoughts so freely with ratha made her skin crawl and her shoulders tighten defensively no one should be able to get inside your mind that closely it makes you vulnerable she thought with a shiver of real fear what happens when you open yourself that much to anyone gods and demons the power that gives them over you even if they never use that power its a point of weakness that someone else can exploit and will theres never yet been a breached wall that someone doesnt use to invade then there was that fanatical devotion to duty of his hed make it back to valdemar if it killed him just to get information back there personally it isnt sane she thought grimly it just is not sane there are a dozen ways he could get that news back and if he took all of them that would virtually guarantee it would get there maybe not as quickly but it would get there but it has to be by his own personal hands he frightened her as much as she loved him she feared him and feared for him she was torn between that love and that fear and when you added in her reluctance to place herself in a position where she would be dependent on him there was only one conclusion she could come to its impossible oh gods its impossible and i still love him she clutched the trunk of the tree in anguish bark digging into her palm the pain keeping tears out of her eyes she fought to keep control finally attaining it just as eldan himself appeared under the tree waving at her to come down she took a couple of deep breaths to make sure the lump wasnt going to return and to steady her nerves then she waved back grinning down at him as if nothing was wrong the faint frown left his brow and he grinned in return weve more important things to worry about she told herself as she slipped down the tree as carefully as she had climbed it right up at the top is staying alive to reach the border in the first place a rock was digging a hole in keros stomach but just now she didnt want to move to dislodge it where are they all coming from eldan whispered as they watched yet another of the sunlords priestesses pause just below the entrance to their current hiding place she pulled back the cowl of her robe and stared up at the face of the cliff above her it looked blank from that angle the ledge they were lying on obscured the entrance and kero had seen it only because she had been up in a sturdy oak spying out the land when shed spotted it and it couldnt be reached from the floor of the valley theyd had to backtrack and come up over the ridge to get down to it hopefully that meant no one would look for it except the priestess like all the others seemed to have sensed something from up here they couldnt make out her features they could just barely distinguish her face from her blonde hair the scarlet robe she wore was a sure sign of high rank thoughthe only rank above scarlet wore gold and there were never women in gold robes against the green meadow below them she looked like some kind of exotic flower i have no idea where theyre all coming from kero whispered back that was at least half a lie at this point she was fairly sure they were tracking need somehow it would make sense since neither she nor eldan ever used unshielded mindspeech since magic was forbidden it followed that the priesthood had some way of detecting its use and need was created with magic even when she wasnt actually doing something she must be visible to someone capable of detecting magic and no doubt she could hide herself but she had to know she was endangering her bearer and her bearer wouldnt know that until a priestess actually was in sight kero held her breath waiting surely this time the camouflage would break theyd be spotted this redrobe was the highest ranking priestess theyd seen yet all the rest had been white blue or blackrank surely this time would mark the end the woman pulled her hood back up over her head and rode off across the meadow kero let out the breath shed been holding eldan put his arm across her shoulders and hugged her wordlessly she snuggled into his shoulder for a moment content just to enjoy it and his warm presence but her mind wouldnt stop operating thats the third priestess today we see two and three search parties every day its getting harder and harder to find a place to hide by dawn some of that was to be expected they were right on the border now and there were regular border patrols all the time eldan had mentioned that and mentioned too how hed avoided them in the past but he had not mentioned ever seeing the clergy out on these hunts before an omission kero found interesting but although he was trying to pretend that this kind of activity was entirely normal it was fairly obvious that he was worried quite worried which meant that a good number of these patrols were new and probably called out to find them he knew the priestesses were able to pick up something about them but he didnt know what and so far kero had been able to keep needs abilities from him so far he hadnt asked any awkward questions and so far he didnt seem to have made the connection that only the female clergy were detecting whatever it was it helped that he seemed utterly incurious at moments when shed have expected a barrage of questions that was odd but no odder than the fact that she was literally unable to talk about anything involving real magic to him absolutely physically unable shed tried and in the end couldnt get the words out of her mouth she suspected need had a hand in both those conditions though she had no idea what it was doing or why but she was getting used to that she didnt like it but she was getting used to it and it was doubtless the fact that need was attuned to womens problems that was the reason for the priestesses detecting her and not the priests that maddeningly logical part of her kept right on reasoning as she tried to enjoy the moment with his arm around her weve had three narrow escapes it said scoldingly each one got narrower than the one before it theres no doubt about it need is bringing in the priestesses were never going to make it across the border together hed given his word to send her his ransom and she had every reason to believe his word was good she had no logical reason why she should stay with him in fact if she wanted to ensure his survival she should leave him with the target traveling westward this little section of the border should be empty long enough for him to get across she inched back into the cave grating along the sandstone with a hollow feeling in the bottom of her stomach shed known all along she was going to have to face this moment but that didnt make it any easier now that it was here she stood up and dusted herself off once inside it would be stolen rations tonight karsite rations one of those narrow escapes had been just this morning and had ended in the death of the scout whod discovered them making their way across the ridge his body was in a tiny hollow just below the trail stuffed into a cavelet barely big enough to conceal him his horse had been run off in a state of sheer animal panic thanks to eldan his rations now resided in their saddlebags eldan had been a little squeamish about robbing the dead but shed just taken everything useful without a comment and after a moment hed done the same eldan joined her back in the tiny cave there was just barely enough room for them and the horses though she could never bring herself to think of ratha as a horse she never looked at him without a feeling of surprise that there was a horse standing there and not another human eldan handed her a strip of dried meat she accepted it and pulled her water skin out of the pile of her belongings so he said around a mouthful of the tough tasteless stuff it looks like tomorrow isnt going to be a good day to try a crossing she swallowed her own mouthful it had the consistency of old shoes and was about as appetizing she found herself longing for the skybolts trailrations something shed never have anticipated doing at least those had been edible we probably ought to hole up here for a while she offered feeling her heart sink and tears threaten at the lie probably theyll give up when they dont find anything and leave this area clear for us to make a try eldan nodded that sounds right and weve got supplies enough all we need is water and one of us can go down after it about midnight ill do that tonight she replied im better at nightmoves than you are he smiled in the way that made her blood heat ill agree to that he said huskily and weve got all day to wait what do you say to doing something to make the time pass a little faster yes she said simply and reached for him even as he reached for her desperation making her want him all the more for this would be the last time the very last time she shielded her thoughts and exercised every wile she had to exhaust him both out of a desire for him that made her ache all over and out of the need to make him sleep so deeply that little would wake himand certainly not her departure then she dozed in his arms wanting to weep and far too tired to do so finally the sun set and she woke out of a restless halfsleep full of uneasy dreams fragments of things that made no sense she extracted herself from his embrace without making him stir packed up her things and waited while the sky darkened and the rising moon illuminated the meadow below tears kept blurring her vision as they trickled unheeded down her cheeks she wasnt even going to get to say goodbye shed left a note for him on top of the remaining rations advising him to stay where he was for as long as they held out then make his crossing attempt she told him that she loved him more than she could ever tell himand dearest gods those words had been hard to writeand she told him that she could not go with him were too different shed said and were too smart not to know that soi took the cowards way out of this i admit it im running away besides i hate saying goodbye and dont you forget you owe me i have to replace my gear somehow she didnt look back at him where he was curled up against the back wall of the cave that would only make it harder to leave instead she saddled hellsbane and strapped on the packs then led her toward the mouth of the cave knowing that the familiar sound of hooves on rock would never wake him but ratha was suddenly there between her and the entrance blocking her way before she could react to that a strange voice echoed in the back of her mind where are you going it said sternly and why are you leaving in stealth she gulped too startled by this sudden manifestation of rathas powers to do anything more than stare but the companion did not move and finally she was forced to answer him mindspeech was not what she would have chosen if shed been offered a choice but if she spoke aloud she might wake eldan and then shed never be able to leave him so although it made her stomach roil to answer the companion that way she ordered her thoughts and spoke as clearly as warrl had taught her i have to go she told ratha im putting eldan in danger while im with him he was in danger when you found him the companion pointed out with remorseless logic what difference does your leaving make she took a deep breath and rubbed her arms to get rid of the chill this conversation was giving her its the sword she said finally its magic and im fairly sure thats what has brought the hunt down on us more than that it is magic that only works for a woman which may be why the priestesses are involved and its very powerful i really dont know how powerful the companions blue eyes held her without a struggle so ratha said finally your sword must be attracting these women i agree that may be why no priests have hit on the trail why not abandon it and leave it for them to find she flared do you want something like that in the hands of your enemies it may not let me go but if it does be sure it will have a new bearer before the sun dawns my bet would be on a priestess finding it which might be good for your land or bad i dont think any of us dare take a chance on which it would be true ratha seemed to look on her with a little more favor and by taking this sword of yours away the hunters all follow you and you leave the border here open to our crossing you sacrifice your safety for ours becoming a target leading away from us i think so she said with a sigh i hope so im going to double back to menmellith which would have been our logical move if wed been blocked here that should make sense to them and since theyve been following the sword and not an actual trail theyll follow me and ignore you the companion nodded you are very wiseand braver than i thought thank you he moved out of the way and she led hellsbane past him onto the narrow ledge and the path that led up to it still refusing to look back good luck she heard behind her as she emerged into the moonflooded night may the gods of your choice work on your behalf kerowyn you are deserving of such favor and may we all one day meet again that started the tears going again she blinked her eyes clear enough to see the path but no more she had to move slowly because she was feeling her way and she was profoundly grateful that hellsbane was surefooted and could see the path she couldnt stop crying until shed reached the ridge above the cave there she took several deep breaths and forced herself to stare up at the stars until she got herself under control its over and ive finished it myself ratha and his own sense of duty will keep him from following it never had a chance of working between us anyway and at least ive ended it while we were still in love she closed her eyes and rubbed them with the back of her hand until the last trace of tears and grit was gone then she set hellsbanes nose westward and descended the ridge heading for menmellith soon the hunters would be following and she needed a head start ive done brighter things in my life than this she thought cowering in the shadow of a huge boulder and wishing that she wasnt quite so exposed on the top of this ridge but this was the only place she had been able to find that had any cover at all and she had to see down her backtrail without eldan and his ability to look through the eyes of the animals about him she was finding herself more than a bit handicapped the hunters had found her in the middle of the night as she crossed from the heavy oakandpine forests into pineandscrub shed felt those unseen eyes on her just about at midnight and this time they hadnt gone away until she had crossed and recrossed a stream hoping the old saw about magic cant cross running water was true by the time dawn bloomed behind her the human hunters were hot on her trail and not that far away either the best she could figure was that the whateveritwas had alerted its masters and they in turn had alerted the searchers directly in her path dawn saw her doggedly guiding the mare over low mountains or very tall hills that were more dangerous than the territory shed left behind because the shalelike rock they were made of was brittle and prone to crumbling without warning she didnt dare stop when she actually saw a search party top a ridge several hills behind her and caught the flash of scarlet that signaled the presence of the redrobe among them so there was to be no rest for her today instead she set hellsbane at a grueling pace across some of the grimmest country shed ever seen this area was worse than the nearvirgin forest because she kept coming on evidence that people had lived here at one time secondary growth was always harder to force a path through than an old forest tangly things seemed to thrive on areas that had been cleared for croplands or where people had lived this growth was all second and thirdstage pine trees and heavy bushes thorny vines and scrubby grass all things that seemed to seize hellsbanes legs and snag in keros clothing she had left hellsbane drinking and got up on another ridge to look back about noon and as she peered around her boulder she saw the trackers still behind her spotting them as they rode briefly in the open before taking to cover this time they werent several ridges away they were only one she swore pungently every heartache and regret shed been nursing since leaving eldan forgotten she had something more important to worry about than heartbreak survival hellfires theyre good better than i thought and they were gaining on her with every moment she dallied she slid down the back of the ridge and slung herself up on the mares back sending her out under the cover of more pine trees and the only thing she could be grateful for was that the day was overcast and hellsbane was spared the heat of the sun theyre going to catch up she thought grimly they know this area and i dont thats what let them get so close in the first place im in trouble and i dont know if im going to get out of it this time she wanted to look back at her pursuers tempted to use her gift for the first time in a long time and stopped herself just in time that isnt me she realized urging hellsbane into greater speed as they scrambled down a gravelcovered slope something out there wants me to use my gift probably so they can find me or catch and hold me until they come she fought down panic hellsbane was a good creature and bright beyond any ordinary horse but if she panicked so would hellsbane and the warsteed might bolt if hellsbane took it into her head to flee kero wasnt sure shed be able to stop her until shed run her panic out and that could end in her broken neck or the mares or both kero kept hellsbane in the cover of the trees even though this meant more effort than riding in the open she looked automatically behind her as they topped the next hill and saw not one but two parties of pursuers both coming down off the slope shed just left and both parties so confident of catching her now that they werent even trying to hide they couldnt see her but they could see her trail she wasnt wasting any time trying to hide it they were perhaps a candlemarks ride from her if she stopped right now the temptation to leave cover and make a run for it was very great if she let hellsbane run she might be able to lose them as darkness fell assuming that their horses werent fresh hellsbane had been going since last night and she couldnt do much of a run at this point they could and would kero sent the mare across a section of open trail when they dropped out of sight hoping to get across it before they got back into viewing range this was one of the worst pieces of trail shed hit yet barely wide enough for a horse bisecting a steep slope with a precipitous drop down onto rocks on one side and an equally precipitous shale cliff on the other no place to go if you slipped and nowhere to hide if you were being followed she breathed a sigh of relief as they got into heavier cover before the hunters came into view she hadnt wanted to rush the mare but her back had felt awfully naked out there thunder growled overhead kero looked up pulling hellsbane up for a moment under the cover of a grove of scrub trees just tall enough to hide them she hadnt been paying any attention to the weather but obviously a storm had been gathering while she fled westward because the sky was black in the west and the darkness was moving in very fast how fast she didnt quite realize until lightning hit the top of a pine just ahead of her startling hellsbane into shying and bucking and halfblinding her rider the thunder that came with it did deafen her rider and the downpour that followed in the next breath damned near drowned her rider it was like standing under a waterfall she couldnt see more than a few feet in front of her she dismounted and automatically peered through the curtain of rain back down the trail behind her just in time to see it disappear melting beneath the pounding rain she stared in complete disbelief as the trail literally vanished leaving her pursuers no clue as to where she had gone or where she was going in fact the part of the trail she and the mare were standing on was showing signs of possible disintegration taking the hint she took hellsbanes reins in hand and began leading her through the torrent of water streams poured down the side of the hill and crossed the trail the water was ankledeep and carried sizable rocks in its churning currents she found that out the hard way as one of them hit her ankle with a crack that she felt rather than heard she went down on one knee eyes filling with tears at the painbut this was not the time or the place to stop no matter how much it hurt she forced herself to go on while icy water poured from the sky and she grew so numb and chilled that she couldnt even shiver and grateful for the rescue too grateful even to curse that errant rock thisthingcame up so fastshe thought peering at the little she could see of the footing ahead of her leading hellsbane step by painful step itcould almost besupernatural in fact a suspicion lurked in the back of her mind perhaps need had had something to do with it there was no way of telling and it could all be just sheer coincidence still there was no doubt that it had saved her always provided she could find some shelter before it washed her away and wouldnt that be ironic she found herself thinking wryly saved from the karsites only to drown in the storm whoever says the gods dont have a sense of humor fifteen im glad hellsbane can see because i cant kerowyns eyelids were practically glued shut with fatigue she rode into the skybolts camp in a fog of weariness so deep that she could hardly do more than stick to hellsbanes saddle the mare wasnt in much better case she shambled rather than walked with her head and tail down and kero could feel ribs under her knee instead of the firm flesh that should be there she rode in with the rain rain that had followed her all the way from beyond the karsite border or maybe she had been chasing a storm the entire time she wasnt sure all she did know was that the rain had saved her and continued to save her as she traveledwashing out her tracks as soon as she made them for one thing it also seemed as if it was keeping those supernatural spies of the karsites from taking to the air for another at any rate she hadnt felt those eyes on her from the moment the rain started to come down and last of all the mud and rain had completely exhausted her pursuers horses who had none of hellsbanes stamina from the exact instant when the first storm hit shed been able to make her soggy way across karse virtually unhindered she hadnt been comfortable in fact she spent most of the time wet to the skin and numb with cold but she hadnt had to worry about becoming a guest in a karsite prison her only real regret shed had to ride hellsbane after the first storm slackened that rock hadnt broken her ankle but it had done some damage a bonebruise she thought she wasnt precisely a healer but that was what it felt like shed hated putting that much extra strain on the mare but there was no help for it luck or the sword or some benign godlet had brought her across the border at one of the rare menmellith borderposts shed introduced herself and showed her mercenary guild tag and her skybolt badge shed hoped for a warm meal and a dry place to sleep but found cold comfort among the army regulars they damn near picked me up and threw me out bastards they could at least have given me a chance to dry off at least theyd told her where the skybolts had gone to ground shed ridden two days through more heavy rains to get there so numb that she wasnt even thinking about what she was likely to find the camp didnt seem much smaller shed feared the worst that half or threefourths of the skybolts were gone but it was much shabbier the tents were make do and secondhand and the banner at the sentry post was clumsily sewn with a base of what looked like had once been someones cloak the rain slacked off as they reached the perimeter of the camp itself hellsbane halted automatically at the sentry post the sentry was a youngster kero didnt recognize probably a new recruit he seemed very young to kero so new he hasnt got the shiny rubbed off him yet and he looked eager and a little apprehensive as he eyed her probably because i look like i just dragged through the ninth hell she dragged out her skybolt badge and waved it at him scout kerowyn she croaked days and nights of being cold and wet having left her with a cough and a raspy throat reporting back from the menmellith border before the boy could answer there was a screech from beyond the first row of tents and a blackclad wraith shot across the camp toward her vaulting tent ropes and the tarpcovered piles of wood beside each tent kero shallan screamed again and heads popped out of some of the tents nearest the sentry post hellsbane was so weary she didnt even shy she just flicked an ear as shallan reached them and grabbed keros boot kero youre alive of course im alive kero coughed slowly getting herself out of the saddle i feel too rotten to be dead by now more than heads were popping out of the tents and she and shallan had acquired a small mob all familiar faces kero hadnt realized she missed until now they crowded around her shoving the poor young sentry put of their way all of them laughing some with tears in their eyes shouting trying to get to kero to hug her or kiss herit was a homecoming the kind shed never had she looked around in surprise some of her tiredness fading before their outpouring of welcome she hadnt known so many people felt that strongly about her and to her embarrassment she found herself crying too as she returned the embraces the infrequent kisses the more common backpoundings and wellmeant curses theyre family theyre my family more than my own blood is this is what tarma was trying to tell me the way it is in a good company this is what makes lerryn a good captain i have to report she shouted over the bedlam shallan nodded her blonde head and seized her elbow wriggling with determination through the press of people gies showed up at hellsbanes bridle and waved to her before leading the mare off to the picket line she knows himyes shes going shell be fine word began to pass and the rest parted for her when they realized what shed said a merc unit didnt stand on much protocol but what it did it took seriously somewhere in the confusion someone got the bright idea that they should all meet at the mess tent the entire mob headed in that direction while shallan took kero off in the direction of the captains tent ive got the legendary good news and bad news they slogged through mud up to their ankles and kero blessed lerryns insistence on camp hygiene in a morass like this fevers and dysentery were deadly serious prospects unless a camp was kept under strict sanitary conditions the blonde looked up as the gray sky began dripping again scowling in distaste so what do you want first the bad and make it the casualties kero sighed and braced herself to hear how many friends were dead or hurt beyond mending this was the last thing she wanted to hear but the very first she needed to to know who am i going to be mourning tonight she asked herself the thought weighing down her heart the way the sticky clay weighed down her steps right shallan grimaced thats the worst of the bad because number one was lerryn and number two was his second icolan in fact most of the officers didnt make it out its like every one of them had a great big target painted on his back ive never seen anything like itshe glanced over to see how kero was taking the newsand kero didnt know quite what to say or do it was just too much to take all at once she felt stunned as if someone had just hit her in the stomach and it hadnt begun to hurt quite yet lerryn dear agnethait didnt seem possible lerryn was everything a good captain had to be there was no way he should be dead he his she said sharply as the sense of what shed just heard penetrated shallan never worded anything by accident does that mean shallans head bobbed her short hair plastered to her scalp by the rain both the women made it the only problem is that the higherranked one is ardana flinteyes kero took in a deep breath and held it that was bad news for the company or so kero judged and she was fairly certain shallan felt the same way ardana should by rights never have risen above the rank shed held before the rout shes a good fighter but shes got no head for strategy she blows up over the least little thing and stays hot for months andi dont like her ethics no thats not true i dont like the fact that she doesnt seem to have many so ardanas a topranker not over worse shallan said grimly then looked significantly at the captains tent with its tattered standard flying overhead it wasnt the crossed swords anymore it was flint and steel striking and casting a lightning bolt shes the captain kero whispered appalled by the prospect shallan nodded once kero took a deep breath the company had to go to someone at least ardana had experience and with this company it was better than disbanding well it was probably better than disbanding she stopped where she was and stared at the new standard oblivious to the rain pouring down on her after all she was already soaked the good news is that all the scouts made it shallan said hurriedly as if to get her mind off the uneasy prospect of ardana as captain and ive got a tent a whole one it fits four and theres only me and relli you can come on in with us we dont mind kero sighed shed rather not have shared with anyone but she doubted there was a choice it was shelter and the company was good shed rather have her ownbut maybe she could manage that in the next couple of days obviously the company had lost all of the equipment left behind during the rout ill take you up on that she said surprised at the gratitude she heard in her voice beneath the weariness she straightened her back and squared her shoulders might as well get this over with while i can still stand she smoothed back her soaked hair with both hands and smiled slightly at the younger woman shallan patted her shoulder encouragingly and led the way kero stared up at the stained and mildewspotted canvas overhead it wasnt her tent but it was waterproof and shallan and relli had gotten the mildew stink out of it somehow she was happy just to be lying down and dry and warm granted that the bedroll was looted from who knew where smelled of horse and had seen better days that didnt matter dry and warm counted for a lot right now the interview with ardana had not proved the ordeal kero feared it might be except that she ignored half of what i said about the karsites where lerryn would have had me in there till i fell over taking notes that was disturbing more disturbing was that ardana really didnt seem interested in the things she had asked about it was as if she was going through the motions as if she had some other opponent in mind than the karsites but just about everyone had deduced from hellsbanes condition what keros must be like when ardana let her go theyd sent shallan over to bring her to the mess tentbut then they sat her down and got her fed and didnt ask too many questions then someone had brought in a spare shirt and someone else produced breeches and socks and a third party a heavy woolen sweater theyd stripped her to the skin right there in the mess tent amid a lot of laughter and rude jokes about how it would be more fun to bed her sword than her right now so change that shed retorted you can all start buying me steaks meanwhile she had been pulling on the first warm dry clothing shed had in a week then they ran her over to shallans tent under a pilfered tarp so she wouldnt get wet again it had all been a demonstration of caring that had left her a little breathless maybe that was why she was having trouble falling asleep i was right she thought staring at the mottled ceiling listening to the rain drum on it i was right to come back this is where i belong i could never fit in with eldan with his friends no more than i could have with daren and the court id have only made both of us miserable trying her eyes burned she sniffed and rubbed them with her sleeve glad that shallan and relli were off somewhere else probably in the mess tent they were both passable fletchers and the skybolts had lost a lot of arrows a lot of other things too kero thankfully shifted her thoughts to the general troubles the company was in trouble equipment lost officers decimated about a third of the roster gone and another third on the wounded listand menmellith had declined to pay them more than half their fee on the grounds that they hadnt stopped the bandits and they hadnt come up with real proof that they were operating with more than the karsite blessing the guild when appealed to had reluctantly ruled in menmelliths favor it could always be worse the wolflings are going to have to find another company to combine with theres hardly enough of them left to fill out one rank dearest goddess im going to miss lerryn there were a lot of people she was going to miss and right on the top of the list was eldan her throat closed again and she choked down a sob i love him and it would never have worked i love him and im never going to see him again he probably thinks i deserted him under fire or something shed been hoping for some kind of message from him when she reached the camp he knew what her company was and messages moved swiftly through the aegis of the guild but there had been nothing he probably got back to valdemar and came to his senses hes probably sitting with friends now with pretty little court ladies all around him thinking what a lucky escape he had that he could have been stuck with this barbarian merc with a figure like a sword and a face like a piece of granite she blinked and a couple of hot tears spilled down her temples into her hair hes probably so grateful i left that hes burning incense to the gods hes probably even making jokes about me like how many mercs does it take to change a candle more tears followed the first it doesnt matter i love him anyway ill always love him and im better off alone we both are she turned over on her side and faced the canvas wall with one of the blankets pulled up over her head so theyd think she was asleep if anyone came in she muffled her face in her sleeve and cried as quietly as she could manage with hardly even a quiver of her shoulders to betray her only the occasional sniff and the steady creeping of tears down into her pillow and somehow she managed to cry herself to sleep when she woke the tent was dark and there was breathing on the other side of it the steady breathing of sleep somehow shallan and relli had come in and settled down without her being aware of it she didnt wake very thoroughly just enough to register that she wasnt alone and remember who it was im not alone somehow that was a comforting thought i have friends i can live without him that was another holding those thoughts warmed her and warmed she fell back asleep it was raining again a halfdozen of them were in the mess tent attaching heads and feathers to grooved arrow shafts kero reckoned up the weeks in her head and came to a nasty total this is the winter rains isnt it kero asked shalian as they reached for feathers at the same moment weve gone over into winter havent we shallans studious inspection of the arrow fletchings didnt fool kero a bit come on she said warningly im going to find out sooner or later cough it up weve hit the winter rainy season yes shallan replied glancing uneasily over her shoulder at kero it did come awfully early but but nothing if this is winter why arent we in winter quarters kerb lowered her voice after a warning look from relli what are we doing still out in the field she hissed well shallan said unhappily taking a great deal of time over setting her feather you know we didnt get paid enough and we lost a lot of manpower and material and so kero had a feeling she knew what was coming up and she wasnt going to like it thats what the reserves are for right welluh shallan floundered finally relli came to her partners rescue we arent going to use the reserves she said tersely ardana has a line on a job that was what i was afraid of in winter shallan nodded in winter its south of here kero just snorted i come from south of here were going to be fighting in cold rain if were lucky if were notsnow up to our asses for the next three months and ice i trained in weather like that but most of the rest of you didnt think what its going to do to the horses if you wont think of yourself its not that bad relli said sturdily though she wouldnt look kero in the face its in seejay flat as your hand and not more than a couple of inches of snow all winter and its not supposed to be a hard jobits a merchants guild thing economic one side or the other is going to get tired of paying and we can go home frankly its better to fight there in winter than summersummer youre like to cook in your armor so instead we drownprovided we dont die of exhaustion on a forced march down through ruvan so is this just a rumor or have you got something more substantial she asked im pretty sure its going down relli told her i got it from willi since willi was the company accountant it was a pretty fair bet that the bid was in kero sighed i suppose it could always be worse three months later she found herself wishing for that hipdeep snow she cleaned mud off her equipment and shallans scouring savagely at the rust underneath on shallans scalemail rain dribbled down on the roof of her tent and down the inside of the shabby walls practically anything would have been better than the bog that was seejay in winter a cold bog one that froze overnight and thawed by midday only to freeze again as soon as the sun set and they were the only company that had been hired that should have told us something from the start she told herself for the thousandth time we should have walked before we took this one fighting beside them were the cheapest of freelancers one step up from prison scum drunks and madmen vicious alley rats whod knife an ally quick as an enemy no point in depending on themand no turning your back on them the sentries caught the bastards sneaking around camp every night and most days and everyone had something missing facing them were more prisonscum and a company of nonguild conscripts old men too damned stubborn to quit fighting and bewildered farmers hauled in after the harvest that was the reason for holding this war in winter in the first place it was after harvest and trading season no moneymaking opportunities lost to combat she thought cynically as witness the little bazaar just outside camp everything they think a merc could want from flearidden whores to watered wine this entire setup had kero completely disgusted ardanas dealsuch as it washad been for half pay and half resupply first of all she should have known never to trust them on that secondly she should have gotten the resupply in advance the total had come to half their usual fee which ardana covered stridently defensive by pointing out that they were undermanned and she couldnt ask the full fee for what was effectively half a company then the resupply train had shown uplateand there was nothing ardana could say that would defend what came in with that we got tents all rightold enough to have served the sunhawks in grandmothers fighting days patched and rotting we got armorcheap and rusted we got weaponsand i practiced with better under tarma dull potmetal that wouldnt hold an edge if you got a godsblessing on it and foodstale journeyrations that could have given the karsites lessons in tasteless barrels of meat too salty to eat flour full of weevils and as for the horseskero shuddered theyd had to shoot half of them and half of the ones theyd shot had been so disease and parasiteriddled they couldnt even be eaten by then it was too late theyd given their bond if they defaulted the skybolts reputationalready suffering from the defeat in menmellithwould be decimated we should have defaulted kero thought angrily cursing under her breath as the metal scales on shallans armor came off in her hands we should have defaulted anyway anything is better than this the guild would back us once they heard about the supplies the war had turned out to be waged within a house two factions of the same merchants guild kero wasnt sure what it was aboutmines or some other kind of raw material she thoughtand she wasnt sure she cared neither side gave a rats ass about the welfare of the troops theyd hiredthe skybolts were just so many warm weaponwielding bodies to them and if they thought about it at all they probably assumed that the company members welcomed a certain number of losses as it made for fewer to split the pay at the end kero had been made the officer over the scouts and that made it all the worse for her she was the one who had to take ardanas stupid ordersdistilled from the even stupider orders of their employersand try and make something of them that stood any kind of chance of working kero dug into her kit for some of the halfcured horsehide that was all they had been able to salvage from those poor slaughtered nags and laboriously patched it into the back of shallans mailcoat then she stitched the scales that had come off back into that cursing when the holes broke where theyd rusted through fewer and fewer of her friends came back after each foray shed managed to keep most of the scouts alive but as for the rest it was pretty demoralizing ardana didnt have any strategy worth the name the merchants dictated and she followed their orders directing the skyboltsskirmishers allto fight like a company of light cavalry theyd been cut down to twothirds normal strength by the menmellith affairnow they were down to half of that mostly wounded thank the gods and not deadbut definitely out of the action she shook the corselet and growled under her breath like the situation with her command it was so tempting to just do what she could and leave the rest to the godsbutdamned if im going to leave my friend halfprotected she cut the stitching on the faulty scales took a rock from her hearth to use as a hammer a bit of wood to use as an anvil and a nail for a awl and punched new holes below the old ones then stitched them back on miserable cheap bastards if id gone with eldan whod be doing this for her if shed gone with eldanthe thought occurred a dozen times a day and it didnt hurt any the less for repetition i didnt go with eldan i came back to my people if ardana wont take care of them i have to do what i can to make up for that and part of that was making sure her scouts stayed wellprotected she held up the corselet and shook it frowning at it just as shallan burst through the tent door ripping one of the tiecords loose as she did so were being hit she cried as a firearrow lodged in the canvas of the tent wall kero lurched to her feet just as something large and panicked crashed into the tent wall kero came to lying on her back with her left arm and shoulder on fire literally there was a firearrow lodged in her arm she screamed as much from shock as pain and rolled over into the mud she put out the fire but she broke the arrow off and drove the head deep into her shoulder and passed out again from the pain the next time she woke she wished she hadnt she couldnt believe how much she hurt without opening her eyes she took slow deep breaths the way tarma had taught her hoping it would make the pain ebb a little just had need she had never been wounded before without having the sword with herand now she realized just what a difference that made she forced her eyes open and blinked away tears of pain until she could see canvas she turned her head to the left since turning it to the right only made things hurt worse evidently she wasnt the only victim of the camp raid there were a dozen others laid out in various stages of injury within easy reach someone stood up just beyond the last one the company healer eren she tried to move a little too far and gasped he jumped as if he was the one whod been shot and somehow turned in midair so that he came down facing her he didnt say a word just moved while her eyes blurred and seemed to materialize beside her what is it he asked resting his hand lightly on her bandaged shoulder the pain ebbed enough for her to speak i need that damned sword she whispered itsi need it thats all to her relief since she hadnt told anyone about everything the blade could do he just nodded if you have it can i get rid of you she nodded and he narrowed his eyes in thought for a moment anything that saves my strength is a bonus ill send somebody off for it he took his hand away and the pain surged over her in a wave she just endured for half an eternitythen with no warning at all the pain was gone she gasped again but this time with relief and opened her eyes slowly shallan knelt beside her with one hand over keros right which in turn she was holding clasped to needs hilt what happened she asked only now able to think of anything besides her own pain the last straw shallan looked like she hadnt slept in a while or rather several last straws first we got hit by the natives theyre tired of having their farms trampled their houses looted and their daughters raped but we didnt she stopped at the look shallan gave her much shallan amended you officers havent been told everything no rape anyway the lads know us womend have them singing a permanent soprano when we found out about it but when were hungry and cold and mad as hell things happen anyway mostly it hasnt been us they just didnt give a damn about who it was what happened then kero asked shamed past blushing have we come that low so fast you were about the only real casualty in that particular raid we lost a couple of horses couple of tents but mostly it looked worse than it was all these she waved her hand at the wounded lying beyond kero were from the guerrilla ambushes theyve been laying for both sides youve been out of things for about four days theyre whittling us down by ones and twos is what theyre doing caught one the other day twelveyearold kid said theyre trying to make life miserable for us the skybolts so well pack up and leave he said their leader figures when we leave the fights over icant fault his reasoning this was not why shed gotten into fighting to destroy the lives of ordinary people shallan shrugged no more can i she admitted well the absolute last straw just showed up today the merchantmen demanding to know why we havent won this thing for them since were supposed to be so good outrage filled her and died just as quickly these fat complacent sidelinesitters didnt know fighting and didnt care they probably worked their beasts the sameuse them up throw them away after all were only mercs no one is going to miss us ardanas called a meeting shallan concluded the shrewd and calculating expression on her face telling kero that shed read every thought as clearly as if shed had keros thoughtsensing ability think youre up to it kero attempted to sit and succeeded and for the first time in a long time felt unleavened gratitude for need give me a hand up and a shoulder to lean on and im up to it she asserted though her head swam for a moment her shoulder didnt hurt it itched itched horribly which made her think that the sword was making up for the four days it had been away from her all at once with every moment she felt stronger and as shallan helped her to her feet she was able to ignore what pain there was and keep herself upright with a minimum of help which is just as well i have the feeling im not going to like this meeting by the time they reached the mess tent only iron will kept her from tearing the bandage from her shoulder and scratching the wound bloody she ground her teeth with the effort it took to leave the thing alone shallan found a place for them by dint of glaring at a couple of the skirmishers until they gave up their seats on the splintery halflog benches a few more arrived after they did not many though and when kero looked around she realized with a start that the company was down to less than half the strength theyd had when they rode in here ardanas incompetence had decimated them that badly but worse than the numbers was the fact that many of the mercs wouldnt meet her eyes or looked away after a moment there was no sense of unity as there had been whenever lerryn held a meeting only unhappiness and unease and a feeling of resignation as if they all knew the orders would be bad and no longer cared ardana finally showed up with one of the merchants following like a fat shadow stalking to the front of the tent with a jerky stifflegged gait that reminded kero of a halfmad halfstarved dog shed seen once that was trying to face down a much bigger animal over a bone outmatched but too crazy to admit it ardanas scowl which had become as much a part of her face as her flinthard eyes didnt do anything to change that assessment she knows she cant handle this but she cant give it up kero thought wonderingly shes so eaten up with the importance of being captain that she wont step down even though shes killing off her own company what is wrong with the woman did she get hit over the head when we werent looking what turned her into this monster the captain tugged at the hem of her tunic constantly trying to pull out wrinkles that werent there like the scowl it was a nervous habit that had emerged after her elevation to captain our employers arent happy with our progress the woman said into the sullen silence that followed her entrance they say they have reason to believe that were slacking off a few months ago that pronouncement would have been met with angry shouts nowa low rumbling a weary growl was all the captain got as a response they dont care anymore not about our reputation not about pridetheyre like saddlegalled horses still going only because theyre being prodded and quitting hurts more ardanas lips tightened in what kero read as satisfaction when no one said anything i told them were going to end this now tomorrow i want every one of you up and ready to ride and the orders she outlined were nothing less than suicide a straight charge right up onto the line when they had nothing backing them and their opponents had holed themselves up in the ruins of a village the place was a maze of halfruined buildings ideal for defense and impossible for cavalry and that was if the skybolts actually were cavalry kero listened with her mouth agape unable to believe the monumental stupidity of such a plan its them the merchants she thought slowly putting what she was hearing together with what she was not hearing but sensing from the merchant she opened her mind to him and was sickened by what she found there dearest gods i should have read their thoughts when they were here the first time i should have because what she read was worse than anything she had imagined these men had no intention of paying the rest of their feebut they were going to solve the problem by making certain there was no company left to be paid so far as they were concerned this final charge would solve all their problems very neatly most of the skybolts would die the rest would drift away leaderlesssix months ago that would have been unthinkable but demoralized as they were now it was not only possible it was probable and the suicidal charge would also decimate the enemy ranks enough that the freelancers could mop them up and would probably be only too willing for the sake of the looting involved im on the wounded listi wont be going out therethat had been her first reaction when ardana had outlined the battle plan now she blushed with shame at her own reaction even ive sunk that low thinking only of myself how can i fault the others but the fact that she was on the wounded list gave her a weapon this fat merchant could never have anticipated she would sacrifice her careerbut better that than to see the last of her friends going down to physical and moral death by guild rules anyone on the wounded list could sever his contract though hardly anyone ever did maybe if she walked now shed wake them up force them to see what they were being lured into it was worth a try she stood up and suddenly every eye in the room was on her even ardana stopped in midsentence and stared at her in mild surprise ive never heard such a crock of shit in my life kero said loudly and bluntly she pointed an accusatory finger at the merchant he is going to get every one of us killed she pointed at ardana and you are going to let him get away with it lerryn has to be spinning in his grave like an expresswagon axle ardanas mouth dropped open beside her the fat merchant registered equal shock he wasnt thinking just reacting surprise that any of these stupid mercenaries had seen what the master plan was and outrage that the same stupid mercenary would have the audacity to challenge him on it kero looked around her slowly and deliberately in fact i dont see anyone here id be willing to call a skybolt she turned back to ardana ripped the badge off her sleeve and threw it at the captains feet im severing my contract go hire some of that scum outside the camp to take my place if you can find one stupid enough to go along with this she turned and started to shove her way through the crowd behind her ardana suddenly woke up and stridently ordered her to halt she ignored the orderas she ignored those that followed each more hysterical and shrill than the last finally orders were issued to someone elseto stop and arrest her for courtmartial that was when kero turned back and stared her former captain in the eyes putting hand to hilt i wouldnt try that she said mildly into the deathly quiet that followed the simple action i really wouldnt you wont like the result and she drew about an inch of blade ardana went red then white and her hand crept to her own hilt that was when a halfdozen of the scouts leapt to their feet and tore their own badges off throwing them beside keros then ten more then twenty until the air was full of the sound of tearing cloth and there were too many people between them for kero to even see ardana though she could still hear her stridently shouting for order order which she was never going to be able to command again kero turned and shoved her way past the remaining skybolts suddenly terrified of what shed done she still has a couple of loyal followers she has people that merchant has bought she can order them to get me make an example of meits the only way shell get anybody to fall into line now she half fell across someones feet as she stumbled out toward her tent to grab whatever she could and make for the road north while ardana was still too confused to think the tent was not too far away and while she was winded by her weakness and her run thanks to needs work she was fully capable of riding and hellsbane could easily outdistance any other horse in the skybolts picket line especially now she flung herself into the tent and tore open her saddlebags blessed agnira she prayed fervently while she stuffed belongings into the top blessed agnethaonly keep her confused just give me that head start sixteen hellsbane regarded the pile of dead and wilted grass under her nose with uniquely equine doubt she gave kero a sorrowful look one as filled with entreaty as any spaniel could have managed and pawed the hardpacked snow sorry girl kero told her wearily all too conscious of her own hunger and of the cold that made her feet and hands numb thats all there is and you should be glad you can eat grass youre doing better than i am she doubted that the warsteed understood any of that but the mare was at least someone to talk to and talking kept her mind off of how tired she was shed avoided settlements since she began this run back up north figuring that whatever ardana had decided to do about her it wasnt going to be to keros advantage theyd ridden from dawn to sunset every day since shed left the skybolts camp while the rain became sleet then real snow and the snowcover grew thicker all the time shed been grateful then for all of tarmas training for without it shed never have been able to live off the land in late winter she and hellsbane were both in sad condition but they were at least alive and still able to travel if they had to the hard run was almost over now by nightfall shed be at the skybolts winter quarters shed collect her gear and get on out of there once she had her gear which included her mercenary guild identification shed be in a position to take her case to the guild itself she looked up at the leaden sky and thought bitterly that it was too bad that ardana would never be called to account for her blundering kero had no hope that ardana would be punished in any wayafter all there was no point in punishing someone for being stupidbut at least thered be that much warning in the guild for anyone thinking of joining the skybolts and kero would get her name and record clear of any charges ardana levied against her then i can go freelance she thought chewing on some nourishing if tasteless cattail roots shed grubbed up for herself out of a halffrozen stream her teeth hurt from the cold and her hands ached as much as her teeth damn that bitch im guiltless shes the one who should get it in the teeth but im the one whos going to suffer with a record of insubordination even if it was legal and justified no bonded company is ever going to be willing to take a chance on me again ive got a brand of troublemaker on me for all time but better that than dead she waited until hellsbane had eaten her own rations down to the last strand of grass tightened the girth and remounted the ache of her feet only partially relieved by tucking them in close to the mares warm body riding your horse just after shes eaten isnt exactly good horsemanship sorry hellsbane i dont have much of a choice id spare you if i could the mare shook herself and snorted but settled to the pace willingly enough they rode on at a fast walk under lowering skies just as they had for days past counting long dull days that meant nothing more than so many leagues toward their goal but keros calculations had been right on the money sunset saw her riding up to the village that supported the skybolts winter quarters a kind of snowcapped stockaded heart in the midst of a cluster of buildings kero looked up and saw it in the distance and felt the same kind of rush of relief and homecoming shed felt on riding up to the skybolts camp she quickly repressed it but not without a lump in her throat this wasnt and would never again be home not for her the village was made up of fairly unusual buildings if one supposed this to be an ordinary village three inns a blacksmith an armorer and several other less identifiable places that were obviously businesses of some sort no sign of a village market no signs of craftsmen or farmers the one aspect that dominated everything was that stockade at the heart of the place every town that served as winter quarters to a company looked like this more or less the company would build or buy an appropriate establishment several buildings were needed for a company of any size barracks for one thing and you could add armory trainingground stables and administrative office at the least once the place was up and tenanted and past its first year of occupancy the rest would follow the only craftsmen that would establish themselves would be smiths and armorers for the rest members of the merchants and traders guilds would take care of anything material the wintering troops needed to spend money on and for their nonmaterial needs the innkeepers would take care of anything they might desire the skybolts hadnt been established long enough to acquire an entire town about their walls as old members retired and chose to stay nearby and raise families hawksnest the sunhawks wintering quarters supported a thriving population of noncombatants a token force stayed behind even during fighting season to train new recruits and see to the upkeep of the place those were usually members of the company that were no longer fit for field duty but couldnt or wouldnt retire if the captain judged them fit enough and if there were positions open they could become caretakers and trainers especially if theyd been officers there was no sense in wasting resources evidently word of her defection hadnt preceded her for the guard at the front entrance to the stockade a taciturn oneeyed fellow she knew only vaguely welcomed her in through the gates with no comments opening the smaller side gate for her rather than forcing the great gates open against the piledup snow she was mortally glad he was the one on duty he seldom spoke more than three words in a row and then only if spoken to first she didnt want to have to answer questions and she most especially didnt want to have to lie she feigned a weariness only a little greater than she felt she knew she and the mare were thin and worn and those things evidently were all the excuse she needed for silence the snowcovered trainingground was silent and looked curiously unused as she rode past she thought perhaps all the new recruits were eating dinner but when she dismounted and brought the mare into the darkened redolent stables and saw how few horses there were there she realized that for the first time in her knowledge there were no new recruits evidently since the skybolts werent going to be there to train them the riders recruited and roughtrained during the summer months had been sent down south to join the rest of the company which meant that in order to take any kind of job in the normal fighting season what was left of the company would have to accept green recruits or freelancers whod never been with a company before and put them right into the front lines with the rest that was just more evidence of the kind of shortsighted thinking ardana had been displaying all along while it was true that the skybolts had only accepted seasoned fighters without proper drilling and practice new recruits were twice as likely to die as old hands and that was in a nonspecialist company in a company of skirmishers kero wouldnt have given a new recruit a rats chance of surviving the first fight but that certainly explained where all the new faces had come from while shed been across the karsite border and it would give ardana a fine excuse for why the casualty figures were so high if the guild made inquiries she left hellsbane under saddle just backed her into the nearest empty stall and gave her a good feed then went off to the empty barracks to retrieve her gear there wasnt much of it but there were warm winter clothes to replace her threadbare garments some weaponry to replace things lost or left behind and as for the personal gear every little bit would help shed undoubtedly have to sell the semiprecious gems shed stored to carve into little figurines this winter the carving equipment itself wasnt worth much and didnt take up a great deal of room shed keep it a while on the chance that she would one day be able to carve again the barracks were dark with most of the windows shuttered her footsteps echoed hollowly and her breath showed white in the gloom telling her that the place hadnt been heated at all this winter somehow the very emptiness oppressed her more than the entire trip back maybe it had something to do with actually seeing the place that should have been full of people standing deserted she didnt bother with pulling off her worn gloves or cloak it was too cold she had no intention of sleeping here if she found herself with enough breathing space shed draw on the little credit she had at the woolly ram and spend the night there she felt her way across the building and climbed the creaking stairs to the veterans floor and sought her own little niche in the barracks cold penetrated her cloak and depression weighed heavily on her shoulders she threw open the shutter to get the last of the light beside her bare bunk was her armorstand with her spare suit of chain which could be sold easily enough at the foot of the bunk was the locked chest where she kept the smaller objects she didnt want to carry with her on campaign and under the bunk was the clothespress that held the rest of her wardrobe winter clothing all of it and she bundled it all up and bound it into a pack with a spare blanket she unlocked the chest and looted it just as thoroughly though there was considerably less in it knives her jewelcarving supplies a couple of pieces shed finished various odds and ends some were too bulky to take with her some impractical it was only after shed made it all up into packs that she saw the letter lying on the shelf above her bed with the odd bits and carvings shed picked up over the years the sentimental things she could not take with her who would send me a letter my brother but the seal was unfamiliar and the handwriting on the outside none shed seen before she picked the folded parchment up her hands trembling for no reason that she could think of and opened it breaking the strange blueandsilver seal it contained two pieces of paper the first was a simple note of two lines and a name i kept the letter of our agreement but you cant fault me for arranging the terms to suit myself it read if you want to redeem this youll have to come here and youll have to see me and it was signed simply eldan the other paper was a draft in valdemaran scrip for the amount of the heralds ransom she would have to go to valdemar in person to cash it in more specifically she would have to go to the capital of haven as the draft had been written on a crown account there and it had to be countersigned by the issuer which in this case was eldan himself to claim her reward she would have to confront him on his own ground and deal with him and all her tangled feelings about him it was a bitter sort of salvation he offered if she went to him to valdemar her troubles would be over temporarily at least she would have ready cash to tide her over until she managed to land a freelance position she might even be able to get a position within valdemar surely they needed bodyguards personal guards and caravan guards even there but if she went eldan would undoubtedly try to persuade her to stay with him perhaps even teaching at that collegium of his as he had suggested and right now she had no better prospects than to give in to that persuasion but if she did give in shed be right back in the situation she had fled from in the first place first from lordans keeping then from his the idea of being completely dependent on someone else made her feel as if she was being stifled if she did that she wouldnt have proved anything not even to herself but shed be with the one man shed ever been able to love to give herself completely to heart and mind and soulbecause he had given himself to her in the same way she stood there staring at the blank wall above the shelf unaware that she had crushed both papers in her hand until a clamor from beyond the gates of the stockade woke her out of her trance there was no mistaking that kind of noise friendly shouts whinnies someone pounding on the gate all the sounds indicating a crowd of riders wanted entrance she stuffed the papers into her beltpouch hastily she could decide what to do about them later right now she needed to get out of there and quickly ardanas messengers must have been right behind me she thought shutting out panic i have to get to the guild before they throw me in detention she had no doubt that ardana would courtmartial her if the captain ever got her hands on her if ardana had her way kero would never even see a guild arbitrator she grabbed up her packs and bolted down the stairs just as she heard from the open window behind her the sound of the great gates being forced open groaning against the load of snow pressed up against them she thought about her possible exits as she ran down the stairs and out the side door of the barracks there was a back posterngate that selflocked right behind the barracks kero waited for a moment until she was certain that no one was in a position to see her then dashed across the open space between the buildings into the stables she fumbled open the stall door and grabbed hellsbanes reins to lead her out now she heard people and horses milling around just inside the gates at least twenty if not more it would take them a few more moments to get organized then they would have to explain their mission to the guard and the guard would have to remember what direction shed taken that would all take time precious time time she could use to make her escape she threw the packs over hellsbanes rump without fastening them and led hellsbane in back of the stables past the odorous manure pile to the back of the stockade itself there was the postern gate narrow scarcely tall enough for a led horse not tall enough for a rider and a real test of a riders ability to get his horse to pass through something the animal judged to be too small but the mare would follow wherever kero led such was her training and breeding and the trust they had built together kero had to pull the packs off and pitch them into drifts beside the gate to get her through but the mare gave no trouble with squeezing through the gate even though the saddle scraped on the stockade walls on either side of her the counterweighted gate swung shut behind her horses tail and the lock clicked hellsbane flicked her ears at the sound and whickered nervously kero pulled the packs out of the snow and swung them back up behind the saddle fastening them as best she could to the lean packs that were already there she mounted as soon as the packs were in place every heartbeat counted at this point i had no idea they were so close behind me she thought worriedly i know we didnt make the best time because we had to keep backtracking to avoid the townsand i know hellsbane wasnt in the best shape either but i thought we were farther ahead of them than that there was another possibility as well if ardana had wanted her badly enough to mount up the freshest horses and the best riders in the company to go after her with enough money to permit them to change horses at every postinghouse they could have caught up with her quite easily and that made getting to a town with a strong representation of the mercenarys guild all the more important even if it meant riding all night it had meant more than riding all night it had meant riding past dawn kero had never known a person could be so tired so deepdown exhausted and still be standing she stifled a yawn as she recited her story for the third time before the representatives of the guild each time she had faced a different set of people the first time was right after shed come through the city gates she wanted bed and food but with ardanas flunkies out there looking for her she knew she didnt dare stop for either shed breathed a whole lot easier after she passed the door of the guild a sturdy stone edifice that didnt look a great deal different from the guildhall of any other guild once inside she asked for directions to the arbitrators she had been sent up a flight of worn wooden stairs to a tiny office where shed told a shortened version to a stonefaced secretary of some kind he gave her a chair when shed finished and went off somewhere when he came back his stonelike demeanor had thawed a little and he took her to another office that was where she had told the story a second time to a much friendlier and sympathetic officialone who seemed to strive to make her feel comfortable and to convince her that she could trust him she didbut mostly because she was convinced she was in the right and she was only trying to protect herself and her standing within the guild she could see how someone with a falsified tale could easily get himself in deep trouble with this man he had asked many careful questions all designed to make her incriminate herself or uncover flaws in her story that would reveal it to be a fabrication that had taken the better part of the morning and she was dizzy with fatigue when he was finished with her she didnt try to touch his thoughts but she had a very real sense that everything he said was part of a carefully prepared script and that he wasnt about to deviate from it except in the most extreme circumstances she couldnt help but wonder how many cases the arbitrators saw that never got beyond this man probably quite a few judging by his reactions to her although he didnt actually say anything that probably fell outside his prepared speeches she got the distinct impression that he was warming to heroutside of the hailfellowwellmet facade he presented once again she was sent off to wait this time in a little room with three other people all as silent as she and two of them looking considerably more harried the third was black and blue with splints on one arm she got the feeling that this man was desperate under the fog of his painkillers if the arbitrators denied him his perceived justice he might well do something something excessive he was the first called and she didnt see him again evidently petitioners did not leave by the same door they came in because the other petitioner was called a few moments later and when kero was summoned into the room there was no sign of either of them she found herself in a large welllit barren room empty of everything except a long table with three chairs behind it in those chairs sat the arbitrators two men and a woman all three of them the very image of the perfect soldier all three sat as erect as if this was a parade ground all three wore identical longsleeved tunics of brown leather and all three wore their graying hair closecropped this third and final time she recited her entire story to the panel of three guild arbitrators who all remained as impassive and unemotional as statues she thought that was probably a good sign this town of selina was completely outside ardanas immediate reach and had a strong town council of its own and the administrative branch of the guild here was well known for fair play their completely impartial attitudes let her know they would be weighing not only everything she said but how she said it by now she was exhausted and she greatly envied hellsbane safely and warmly installed in the guild stables fed and groomed and probably now asleep she tried to tell things simply and clearly with as little emotional weight as possible tried to act as impassive and neutral as her judges seemed to be but she heard herself slurring words as if she was drunk and so she was but with weariness not wine it wasnt hard to sound impassive after all as she did her best to make sure she kept all her facts straight she discovered that right at this moment she didnt care much about anything all she was really aware of was her acute need to sleep and the hollow emptiness of her stomach too late she thought perhaps that her approach was all wrong maybe she should have been passionate and full of righteous angermaybe she wasnt convincing them maybe they read her stoicism as the facade of someone who was making everything up but it was too late to change now and besides she was too tired it was all she could do to keep her narrative clear and answer their questions with some semblance of intelligence finally she came to the end of her story and the arbitrators came to the end of their questions they sent her out through a second door on the opposite side of the room where she found a small chamber identical to the one shed waited in before her audience it was a tiny windowless box of a room stuffy and airless there were three chairs all empty all equally uncomfortable which was just as well she wouldnt have been able to resist the implied comfort of a padded chair and once settled into something like that shed have fallen asleep for certain she took her seat to await their decision in the middle of the three chairs a highbacked unyielding piece so tired that only the deep ache of hunger kept her awake that and the fact that her imagination began to run wild being alone like this with nothing to think about except her performance and possible fate only made her worry more what if they dont believe a word i said what if they think im lying there had been no way to tell what they were thinking while she was talking if they hadnt been breathing occasionally she would nave taken them for corpses but what possible motive could i have for lying ambition i was promoted under ardana revenge she never did anything to me directly but that might not make any difference people had mutinied against their leaders with no apparent reason before this she worried the fear until the edges were frayed but she couldnt dismiss it it seemed to be taking forever for the arbitrators to make their decision she got up and paced the floor hands clasped tightly behind her back trying to walk softly but unable to keep her boots quiet against the hard wooden floor what if ardanas flunkies went here first instead of the winter quarters what if they told ardanas version and the arbitrators believe her it was possible if they had changed horses and gone by the trade roads they could have beaten her here easily but she cant argue away the casualty rate she cant argue away her lack of strategy there were plenty of excuses ardana could make for those things though and keros imagination was quick to supply them illness inexperience treachery on the part of their allies unfamiliar territory a chain of command fundamentally new to their positions she had managed to work herself up to such a pitch that when the door opened behind her she jumped and uttered a muffled and undignified squeak of alarm she was so rattled that she turned and just stood there staring at the newcomer heart pounding unable to speak for a moment standing framed in the doorway was her second questioner the friendly middleaged man who had crossexamined her so skillfully he stared at her for a moment obviously taken aback by her nervous response to the simple act of a door opening behind her iim sorry she stammered im kind ofjumpy im letting my nerves get the better of me he recovered his aplomb and smiled and this time she had the feeling it was a genuine smile and not the facade hed worn for her the first time theyd met im the one who should apologize he said i knew very well what youd been through and i didnt make allowances for it im lucky all you did was jumpwith that poor fellow whose case was heard first i might have found myself on the floor with a knife at my throat she smiled wanly and he waved her through the door the arbitrators have decided in your favor kerowyn he continued tugging his leather tunic straight with a gesture that seemed to be habit but they want you to hear it from them even though this is a decision for you it may not be everything you were hoping for all of the tension drained out of her leaving her limp and ready to accept just about anything she obeyed his direction and found herself back in front of the table facing the three granitefaced arbitrators now that she knew theyd decided for her she looked at them a little more closely all three of them were older than shed first thought old enough to be grandparents though she had no doubt that any of the three could challenge her at their chosen forms of combat and quite probably beat her they all had that indefinable air of the professional mercenary cool calm unruffled and quite able to take on whatever needs doing two men and one woman all three had probably worked themselves up from the ranks she smiled a little to herself if they had come up from the ranks they werent going to appreciate what the skybolts captain had done to her people ardana was going to get short shrift from them if she hadnt already the woman spoke she had the seat on keros left and looked a little older than the other two weve decided in your favor kerowyn she said her voice surprisingly soft and melodic we agree that you had every right and every reason to sever your contract and that you did so legally that was all she had ever wanted to hear thank you she started to say but the woman interrupted her with an upraised hand your captain was and is a fool she said but theres nothing in the guild code preventing fools from being in command or from getting their people hurt or killed we arent in the business of telling captains how to command we only deal with violations of the code the guild allows only one kind of retribution for captains of her sortthe kind you took severing contracts neatly and legally until she is in command of nothing do you understand me kero put a lock on her reaction of disappointment and nodded what youre saying is pretty much what id expected she replied trying not to think of those friends still trapped under ardanas command until the end of the company contract only then could they sever their relations with her of course they would have one advantage over kero there would be no record of insubordination in their files the woman smiled ever so slightly the barest hint of a curve to her weathered lips unfortunately no matter what we put in your record it is unlikely that any bonded company will ever accept you again i hope you realized that if not when you severed at least when youd had a chance to think all this out mercenaries who sever contracts in the field even under extreme provocation such as you experienced tend to be viewed with a jaundiced eye by other commanders after all by their way of thinking if you do it once whats to stop you from doing it again to them its just another form of desertion under fire well that was what i thought although id rather she hadnt said it kero sighed i understand that sir she said rocking a little back and forth to ease her aching feet but i wonder if you really know what that means in terms of the immediate present the woman persisted this is the lean season the only places hiring right now are companies i understand that you have very little in the way of savings you are going to find it all but impossible to find work here in selina and you wont have the wherewithal to go elsewhere kero blinked butwhat about going bonded freelance she asked wondering what on earth she was missing i thought bonded freelancers were always in demand all anyone is going to check is whether or not i am bonded if you can find work the woman told her you have no experience outside of a company this is winter no caravans no warfare no hunting where someone might need a tracker who is also a fighter no work as a city guard and damned near no bodyguard work nothings moving no one is going anywhere i can promise you that there is no work in selina for someone of your talents kero swallowed i never had any idea it was going to be this bad but groveling isnt going to help i have to put a good face on this falling apart is not going to earn me anything certainly not their respect i think i have that now i dont want to lose it she stiffened her back and raised her chin ill have to manage she replied i have other skills i can handle horses or train them no matter how difficult they are i can work a tavern if i have to i even have some experience with medicine tarmamy teacher told me to learn other things because i might have to fall back on them the other two nodded although the woman looked dubious even if you get freelance work youve never worked anywhere except within a company she persisted you have no idea what its like to work freelance its hard enough for a man but for a woman ill manage kero replied im tougher than i look thank you for your judgment in my favor i had heard that the guild was fair and i will be very happy to confirm that the woman shook her head but said nothing more kero bowed slightly and turned the friendly man was still standing beside the second door he beckoned a little and she followed him out of it youre entitled to three days here in the guildhall he told her three days bed and board for you and your beast she sighed that was one worry out of the way three days of grace three days where she wouldnt have to fret about where she was going to lay her head ill take you up on that she told him because right now i couldnt find my way to an inn even if i could afford to pay for it i thought as much he replied with real unfeigned sympathy i took the liberty of having your things taken to one of the rooms the food is nothing to boast about and the room isnt fancy but its safe and it has a bed and right now thats all i need she said wearily ill work on solutions for my problems when ive got a mind to work with maybe im being too optimistic but i cant believe that someone with my skills cant find work after a day and a night of solid slumber and half a day of hunting she came to the conclusion that the woman arbitrator was right there was no work in selina for a merc of any kind much less a female that left other options first before the day was over she sold everything she didnt actually need that left her with one suit of armor her weapons her clothing and hellsbane and her tack the guild gave her a decent price for the armor and weaponrydecent by the standards of a town in midwinter at any rate decent considering that her secondbest suit of chain was now her best and the suit she was willing to sell had been immersed in a river drenched with rain covered with mud and generally abused what she wound up with would pay for room and board for her and hellsbane for a fortnight she counted the pitiful little pile of coins carefully but they didnt multiply and the numbers didnt change she started to put them back in her beltpouch and her hand encountered something that crackled she pulled it out puzzled for a moment then felt the blood drain from her face as she recognized eldans letter and voucher it would be the easy answer her fortnights worth of coin if augmented by living off the land would take her to valdemar i dont have to do anything she thought reluctantly all i have to do is go i can just collect my money and leave i dont have to listen to anything he says she was lying to herself and she knew it she shoved the parchment back into the pouch and dropped the coins on top of them with a little groan she lay back on the bed and rubbed her aching temples ill go up there and hell tell me how much he loves me and hell offer me some sinecureand ill take it i know i will then ill be trapped because itll be his job and probably itll be no more than a token a pretensejob to make me feel less like hes giving me everything and gods i do love him itd be so easy to accept that but love wasnt enough not for her she had to have freedom too she had to know that she was earning her way not just playing someone elses shadow no she gritted her teeth stubbornly no not unless theres no choice ill go to the plains first and become a nomad like my crazy cousins and i havent exhausted all my options i still have two more days as it happened it wasnt until sunset of her third graceday that she found work it wasnt what she had expected she was looking for work as a groom shed tried all the places mercs frequented then the places that were the haunts of the city guard and finally started trying tradesmens inns no one had a place for her not even after she demonstrated her ability with a couple of surly troublemaking beasts one of the last places on her mental list was a peddlers inn a cheap place mostly used by traveling peddlers and minor traders it wasnt a place where she would have worked if shed had a choice but the fact was she didnt have a choice she walked into the stable yard and right into a fight the conflict was complicated by the involuntary involvement of a donkey and a pony both kicking and protesting at the tops of their lungs kero was tempted to wade straight in but years of tavern brawling had taught her not to get involved in an ongoing fight without reinforcements there were an assortment of servants and stablehands gawking at the fracas she grabbed them all and formed them into an assault force which she led into the fray when the pony and donkey were on opposite sides of the yard several heads had been knocked together and calm had been restored she turned to what she thought was the head groom who now sported an impressive black eye i need work she said shortly im a bonded freelance merc but im willing to do just about anything especially if it has something to do with horses think your master could find a place in the stables for me the man squinted against the light of the setting sun holding a handful of snow against his eye theres nothin open in the stables he said with what sounded like mixed admiration and regret she turned to go without waiting to hear what else he would say the bitter taste of disappointment in her mouth once again wait she heard behind her she almost hurried her steps not wanting to listen to another offer of a meal or worse an offer that she whore for the owner but this time something stopped her perhaps it had been the honest admiration in the mans voice perhaps it was her own desperation she stopped and slowly turned we don need anyone in th stables the man said limping toward her but we sures fire need a hand like you i th taproom i dont whore she said shortly knowing that this inns servinggirls were expected to do just that whore the man seemed genuinely surprised hellfires no yed be wasted as a whore need i th taprooms fer a peacekeeper a what she raised both eyebrows trying not to laugh peacekeeper break up fights throw them as makes too much trouble out on th ear the man seemed earnest enough and kero kept a straight face ye unnerstand men won reckon on pickin fights wi a wench see big hulkin brute they kick up dust just t challenge im wench they don see as worth makin trouble with then trouble does start they won be lookin t a wench t stop it see oddly enough kero could see the sense of it how did you figure this out she asked the man sighed had a wenchs peacekeeper fer years lost er t th wolflings thats cause all we cn give is roomnboard been hopin t replace er but aint seen nobody id trust much less a bonded thatd work fer that kero was still skeptical but her time was running out and she needed somewhere to go this was the only decent offer shed had and how do i know your master will go along with this she asked the man grinned cause th masters me an yere hired f yell take just roomnboard startin tnight it was better than shed feared but no place to rest or recover hellsbane had to winter in the corral since the stable was reserved for paying customers she had to sleep on the floor with the rest of the helpwith the exception of the serving girls who spent the nights with customers the floor was packed dirt and cold and halfhealed wounds ached at night she could understand his reasoninghe only had three sleeping rooms upstairs but that didnt make her position any easier the food was fresh and filling and she could eat all she could hold but it was poor stuff thin soup and coarse bread for the most part she never felt quite right and never regained her lost weight even though she was stuffing herself at every meal the innmaster a cheerful little squirrel of a man was fair and decent to her and backed her on every decision she made he was all right but the rest of the staff avoided her especially after she brained a peddler who caught her out in the stable and tried to rape her she lost track of the days she was exhausted by the time the inn closed and never seemed to get enough rest each day blurred into the next and she was never able to get up enough energy to go out and hunt down other jobs as she had intended to her little store of coins steadily dribbled away as she had to replace clothing that wore out and repair armor and tack even the sword seemed to have given up on her she never felt so much as a prod from it anymore she leaned up against the bar carefully positioning herself in the shadows and surveyed the crowd there was a larger group than usual here tonight which had rudi bouncing with joy but didnt exactly make her feel like singing more people meant more chances of fighting and more people meant that some of them would likely buy places on the floor paying customers got the places nearest the fire leaving the help to shiver in their blankets a cold night meant aches in the morning maybe i can talk rudi out of some something hot to drink she thought rubbing one thumb along needs grip or maybe wine then i can at least fall asleep quickly goddess im tired i wish i could have a bed for just one night there was a little eddy of raucousness over by the door she wasnt sure who or what was causing it and she decided to keep a sharp eye on it the disturbance moved nearer laughing and cursing in equal amounts marked the trail of one customer as he made his way toward the bar finally the cause of the commotion got close enough for kero to see him and she grimaced as she realized why no one was willing to take exception to his behavior it was a city guardsman drunk as a lord and throwing his weight and rank around no one here wanted to touch him and risk arrest and he was taking full advantage of the fact her heart sank when she saw him peering around as if he was looking for something then grin when he finally spotted her he shoved a couple of drovers aside and shouldered a potter out of his place next to her welladay he said nastily f it isn rudis lil sheman watcha still doin here sweetheart ain never foun a man f take ye outa them britches an put ye in a skirt she ignored him at first he didnt seem to notice that she was staring off into the crowd with a completely bored expression on her face shed learned long ago that the worst thing she could do would be to respond at all to bullies like this one her only possible defense was to do nothing eventually they tended to get bored and go away this one was remarkably persistent though and he got in one or two shots that came too damn near the bone and made her blood boil but tarma hadnt taught her control in vain she kept a tight rein on her temper and continued to ignore him even though a crowd was collecting around them waiting to see if he could goad her into a fight he was drunk but only enough to make him belligerent not enough to slow him down or fox his reactions shed be a fool to give him the fight he wanted twice a fool since it was against the law to lay a hand on a city guardsman so she kept silent and finally he did seem to get bored with his game he started to lean close and she saw what was coming the old ploy of accidentally spilling liquor on someoneher to be specific she decided shed had enough just a heartbeat before the guardsman moved she reached out and pulled one of the watchers into her place then slipped into the mob before the guardsman could stop her since she was shorter than most of the patrons it wasnt hard to keep herself hidden long enough to get into the safe haven of the kitchen the kitchen staff stared at her as she passed through and out the rear door but they didnt say anything she waited just inside the kitchen door for a moment making sure the kitchen yard outside was clear there wasnt so much as a cat moving out there she closed the door behind her and rubbed her eyes with the back of her hand they felt gritty and sore from all the smoke and she wondered just how long it was going to be before rudi closed up dear gods im tired even though her stomach was full she felt empty without any energy that guardsmani hope he leaves i dont want to have to take him on i dont think rudi could protect me from the town law if i had to hit him im not sure the guild could and im not sure theyd be willing to either she walked slowly across the uneven kitchen yard treacherous where snow had melted and refrozen in ruts the moon was in its last quarter and cast thin light that did little to help her in seeing her way might as well check on the stable maybe by the time i get back that drunk will have gotten tired of looking for me or maybe hell get so drunk hell pass out either will do there were only two horses in the stable tonight and both were asleep one of the stableboys dozed beside the door but leapt to his feet when she passed him she patted his shoulder suppressing a tired smile good lad she said calmly and with reassurance as she would to a dog just checking on things he stared at her with wide halffrightened eyes and she felt the sting of rejection she turned away without saying anything more she knew there were several other animals in the paddock with hellsbane but she seldom bothered to check them the mare herself was more than enough guard she stopped by the fence suddenly lonely for any kind of a friendly face even a horses but hellsbane was asleep and kero decided on reflection not to wake her what would be the use after all the warsteed was only a horse not an intelligent creature like a companion hellsbane couldnt talk to her and probably wouldnt even know how unhappy her mistress was she turned her back on the paddock and began the long walk back to the inn just as she passed the stable something jumped out of the shadows of the stable door her reactions numbed by weariness and inadequate food were not what they had been before she could turn to meet her attacker he was on top of her and hit her in the back with a scabbarded blade she saw stars of pain and went down breath driven out of her the unknown grabbed her arm before she had a chance to recover and hauled her to her feet she tried to make her arms and legs move but they wouldnt obey her she was hauled around to face her attacker and he seized a handful of her tunic and pulled her nosetonose with him his alesour breath made her cough and even in the dim light she had no trouble recognizing him or his uniform it was the guardsman still drunk and obviously alecrazed thought yed slip out on me sheman he snarled couldn face a real man m minded t gi ye a lesson i th way a wench should mind erself a hand as massive as the business end of a club holding a sword hilt connected with the side of her face so hard her teeth rattled that was a mistake for the blow managed to knock her out of the stunned daze she had been in she brought up her kneenot into his crotch which he was expecting but in order to stamp down hard on his instep she was wearing riding boots with a hard heelthey were the only footcovering she had he was wearing soft townshoes something cracked under her heel he screeched and let go of her but only for a moment hed taken in so much aleor possibly other thingsthat the pain was only temporary while she was still trying to get her breath and to clear her eyes of the tears of pain he swung out and bashed her in the side of the head with his stillsheathed blade she cried out and grabbed automatically for the hilt of her own sword as she went down to one knee and need took over even while her mind was still reeling her body jumped to its feet unsheathed blade in hands driving straight for the guardsman he parried clumsily with his weapon need came in over the top of his blade and only by slipping and falling on an ice patch did he escape a heartthrust he scrambled back up to his feet if anything more enraged than before while kero slipped on another bit of ice the blades control faltered for a moment still halfstunned she tried to get control of her own body back as need reasserted control and forced her to attack again and again while the guardsman scrambled backward after the second attack he seemed to have gotten the idea that he was in imminent danger of being killed now he was only trying to get away from her finally the guardsman fetched up against the wall of the stable there were lights and shouts behind kero now but she paid no attention to them she was far too busy trying to get the upper hand before the blade killed the man need caught the mans blade in a bind and disarmed him kero thought for a moment that the sword would release her then but it held her as tightly as ever evidently the mans crimes against women were such that the blade had no intention of letting him get away the guardsmans eyes were wide with fear reflecting the torchlight behind her and he flung up both his hands in a futile attempt to ward her off as need drove toward his throat and at the last moment kero got just enough control back to reverse the blade and punch the man in the chin with the pommel as he slumped to the ground and the blades control over her vanished hands seized her from behind kero lay on her stomach on the hard wooden shelf that served as a bed in her damp unheated cell it hurt too much to lie on either her back or her side she hadnt been treated badly theyd brought her food and water earlier but stabbing pains ran down both legs every time she tried to move so she ignored both her back hurt so much she was afraid that the guardsman might have broken something not that it mattered drawing steel on a city guardsman was an offense punishable by a flogging and exile from the city stripped of all possessions which in her circumstances was tantamount to a sentence of death right now she couldnt have moved to save herself even with need in her hand and in full control theyd taken the sword away from her of course which meant she was without its healing and painblocking powers again shed collapsed in agony the moment it had left her hand but it wasnt likely anyone had made the connection probably theyd assumed shed been in the same kind of berserk rage as the guardsman certainly they wouldnt have left it with her even if they had known she was injured she didnt expect anyone to speak for her most city guardsmen had one or more influential friends rudi wouldnt dare go against anyone who could close down his inn the guild had already told her not to expect help if she caused trouble and even if he dares to speak for me hell have to fire me which will put me right back in the same situation only inside the city gates in fact it probably would take less time for someone to find me and kill me i dont think even need can fix this back in a few moments worst of all she was more alone than shed ever been in her life there was no one in all this city who would be willing to stand by her or take her inor even offer a friendly word her entire family was somewhere in the southassuming that even they still felt kindly toward her which might be assuming a lot after what shed done at least if they convict me anyone who tries to take hellsbane is going to see a lot of hoof she thought between the stabs of pain from her back i hope its that bastard who tried to beat me serve him right to get his brains bashed in by a mare she knew she should be trying to think of a way out of her trap but she couldnt muster the energy to think at all much less to plan a defense all she could do was try and lie as quietly as possible and endure the pain of her back and bruised and swollen face slow hot tears trickled down and pooled under her cheek as she listened to heavy footsteps passing outside the door of her cell it sounded like a regular patrol she had no idea how long shed been in here and the windowless cell gave no clues either the fellow with the food and water had come in oncewhich might mean a day or only a few hours the sound of those boots on the stone only made her more acutely aware of her own isolation faced away from the door as she was her only warning that some of those footsteps were for her was the rattle of the key in her lock she tensed herself against seizure and gasped as her back sent rivers of fire down her legs for a moment she couldnt think of anything but the pain guildsman kerowyn said a strange masculine voice please dont move please dont move she had expected to be hauled summarily to her feet the request came as such a surprise that she probably couldnt have moved if shed wanted to a gentle hand touched her backawaking agony beside which the previous several hours had simply held common aches she yelped once and passed out when she came to again most of the pain was gone subsided to a dull but bearable level whoever had touched her back was gone but she sensed that there was still someone in the cell with her by the little sounds she heard beside the door she levered herself up and turned toward the sounds another city guardsman stood there a real giant of a man a good two heads taller than anyone kero had ever seen before kero gawked up at him a tiny idle part of her mind wondering how on earth he ever found uniforms to fit him guildsman kerowyn the man said in a surprisingly soft voice several witnesses have come forward to testify that guardsman dane provoked you and you took no action in the inn the stableboy has come forward to testify that the guardsman struck the first blow your guild has said that you are a sober and reliable professional with no history of troublemaking based on all these testimonies it has been determined that you acted only in your own defense although we strongly recommend that in the future you choose a weapon other than an unsheathed blade within the city walls she blinked at him feeling more than usually stupid because he provoked the fight the guardsman continued guardsman dane has been fined and the proceeds used to pay for a healers services which you just received the giant paused and seemed to be waiting for her to say something and finally she managed to get her mind and mouth working enough to string a couple of words together so that means what she asked your injuries have been treated youre being released he explained patiently and stood aside the door behind him was wide open and she rose shakily to her feet to stumble out of it the guardsman took her arm to help hershe had no doubt that if he wanted to he could have picked her up like a loaf of bread and carried her off but he limited his aid to only what was necessary they stopped at the room at the end of the long stone corridor and he took her weapons from the guard stationed inside and gave them to her with his own hands as she buckled need back on she felt a hundred times better the remaining pain vanished that healer had been goodbut need was better she was still numb with surprise though as the guardsman led her up the stairs to the wooden building above the jail cells and opened the door for her to walk out rudi spoke for meand the stableboyand the guild is this more of needs magic or is it something ive done and if its me what on earth did i do to make them speak for me but that surprise was nothing to the one waiting for her outside the prison gates there was a crowd waiting there a crowd wearing the silver and gray tabards she used to sport with a device of crossed lightingbolts on the sleeve a crowd that cheered the moment she came stumbling out into the sunlight squinting against the sudden glare what she stuttered whwhat someone took her arm she turned at a flash of familiar golden hair shallan stood right at her elbow grinning like a fool you sure do get yourself in messes dont you captain she said several hours later she finally had a glimmer of the story but only after putting together all the bits and pieces of it that had been flung at her during the long ride back to the skybolts winter quarters and it took a good meal a sleep from dawn to dawn and another good meal before she was ready to try to make sense of it all she called a halfdozen of her old friends together in the outer room of the captains quarters that she still had trouble with she didnt feel like a captain and no matter how often someone called her that she kept looking over her shoulder to see who they were talking to she ordered hot tea all around from the orderly feeling very uneasy about doing so even though the onearmed twentyyear veteran who had served lerryn seemed equally content to serve her let me see if ive got this straight she said as the others nursed their mugs in hands that looked fully as thin as hers when i walked you lot kept ardana from sending her hounds after me then you called a vote its an old law part of the oldest part of the code that goes right back to the oathbreaking ceremony tre said solemnly nobody uses it much but nobodys ever revoked it what it mounts to is any company thats lost moren half its officers an a third of the rest can call the captaincy to vote from the ranks me an shallan wed been talkin bout that since youd got hurt lot of the rest was thinkin it was a good notion but nobody wanted t start it he took a sip of his tea and smiled ruefully not even me but when you walked like that an ardana was gonna haul you back in chains for takin your rights well it made everybody mad shallan ran her hands through her short hair and scratched at a new scar so since we knew everybodyd been told about voteright we started hollerin for it next thing you know ardanas out out of captain and out of the company tre took up the thread again so we needed a captain and the only person evbody could agree on was you blessed agnira she covered her face with both hands this isnt something im ready for but who is asked a little voice in the back of her mind the guild representative that had come with them spoke for the first time neither tre nor kynan are trained in tactics logistics and supply the way you are kerowyn their expertise stops at groups larger than a squad and neither of them care for mages which is a definite liability she though reluctantly one thing this company needs badly is a couple of competent hedgewizards how do you know ill be any better she asked dropping her hands you cant be worse shallan replied emphatically youve seen for yourself how vulnerable a company is to bad leadership the guildsman said solemnly we think that judging by your past performance you would step down rather than cause the company harm she stared at his impassive face he was cut of the same cloth as the arbitrators if a great deal younger you know i would she thought at him as if he could hear her these are my friends my family it would be hell on earth to spend the rest of my life leading them into situations where some of them are going to get killed but it would be worse watching someone wellmeaning but incompetent or untrained double those deaths and worse to ride off on my own knowing it was going to happen i havent a choice theyre my people and my responsibility and in that moment she suddenly understood eldan and the way he felt about his duty and his own people his company was simply very much larger than hers she tightened her jaw and raised her chin a little all right she told them all youve convinced me shallan let out a whoop and the others started to congratulate her but she held up a hand to forestall them lets first find out if we actually have a company left she turned to the company accountant and quartermaster scratcher how bad is it the man she queried did not much resemble a scholar he was as lean and hard as any of the rest of the skybolts but there was a shrewd mind behind those enigmatic eyes he chewed the end of his pen studied the open book before him and muttered to himself a little finally he looked up with all the losses we took in people and supplies captain were going to exhaust the bank just replacing them we arent going to have enough to take us out again in the spring we may not have enough to last the winter the guild representative stirred a little and kero took the chance to read his thoughts we couldshouldextend them a loan but i dont have the authority she ground her teeth silently take a loan that would be years in repayment and what if we have a bad year or a bad run of years what then she shifted her weight and a crackle of parchment in her belt pouch made her frown what in then she remembered eldans ransom which she couldnt get but the guild she smiled slowly and pulled it out leaving the letter within here she said handing it to the guildsman this is from the herald i pulled out of the fire i think you can see hes played fast and loose with the conditions think the guild can do something about that the flatfaced mercenary took the parchment from her opened it and his lips pursed in a soundless whistle all that for a mere herald are you certain he wasnt a prince she shrugged all i care about is that right now that little piece of paper can make us if we can redeem it the guildsman scrutinized the writing carefully then suddenly unexpectedly smiled it specifies that the holder of the note is the one who has to redeem it in person he pointed out if you signed it over to us in return for an immediate sum minusohten percent our representative would be the holder hell never forgive me done she said reaching for scratchers pen send it half in supplies and weapons the guild i trust the rest was over quickly leaving kero alone in the wardroom her hand clenched around the letter still in her otherwise empty pouch slowly she drew it out she stared at it for a long moment her mind tired and blank then she folded it and tore it into precise halves then quarters then repeated herself until there was no piece larger than the nail of her little finger she stared at the pile of pieces stirring them a little with her forefinger a noise from outside made her look up and through the window that gave out on the practice grounds shallan was running a new recruit against the archerytarget at the trot he jounced painfully and his arrows went everywhere except in the straw dummy her
