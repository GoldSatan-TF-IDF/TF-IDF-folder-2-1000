rhiannons women siawn leader of brynns fighting band other firaz ibn bakir merchant of fezana in the khalifate of alrassan one a horse he came to understand was missing until it was found nothing could proceed the island marketplace was crowded on this grey morning in spring large armed bearded men were very much present but they were not here for trade not today the market would not open no matter how appealing the goods on a ship from the south might be he had arrived clearly at the wrong time firaz ibn bakir merchant of fezana deliberately embodying in his brightly coloured silks not nearly warm enough in the cutting wind the glorious khalifate of alrassan could not help but see this delay as yet another trial imposed upon him for transgressions in a less than virtuous life it was hard for a merchant to live virtuously partners demanded profit and profit was difficult to come by if one piously ignored the needsand opportunitiesof the world of the flesh the asceticism of a desert zealot was not ibn bakir had long since decided for him at the same time it would be entirely unfair to suggest that he lived a life of idleness and comfort he had just endured with such composure as ashar and the holy stars had granted him three storms on the very long sea journey north and then east afflicted as always at sea by a stomach that heaved like the waves and with the roundship handled precariously by a continuously drunken captain drinking was a profanation of the laws of ashar of course but in this matter ibn bakir was not lamentably in a position to take a vigorous moral stand vigour had been quite absent from him on the journey in any case it was said among the asharites both in the eastern homelands of ammuz and soriyya and in alrassan that the world of men could be divided into three groups those living those dead and those at sea ibn bakir had been awake before dawn this morning praying to the last stars of the night in thanks for his finally being numbered once more among those in the blessed first group here in the remote pagan north at this windscoured island market of rabady he was anxious to begin trading his leather and cloth and spices and bladed weapons for furs and amber and salt and heavy barrels of dried cod to sell in ferrieres on the way homeand to take immediate leave of these barbarian erlings who stank of fish and beer and bear grease who could kill a man in a bargaining over prices and who burned their leaderssavages that they wereon ships among their belongings when they died this last it was explained to him was what the horse was all about why the funeral rites of halldr thinshank who had governed rabady until three nights ago were currently suspended to the visible consternation of an assembled multitude of warriors and traders the offence to their gods of oak and thunder and to the lingering shade of halldr not a benign man in life and unlikely to be so as a spirit was considerable ibn bakir was told ill omens of the gravest import were to be assumed no one wanted an angry unhoused ghost lingering in a trading town the furclad weaponbearing men in the windy square were worried angry and drunk pretty much to a man the fellow doing the explaining a baldheaded ridiculously big erling named ofnir was known to ibn bakir from two previous journeys he had been useful before for a fee the erlings were ignorant treeworshipping pagans but they had firm ideas about what their services were worth ofnir had spent some years in the east among the emperors karchite guard in sarantium he had returned home with a little money a curved sword in a jewelled scabbard two prominent scars one on top of his head and an affliction contracted in a brothel near the sarantine waterfront also a decent grasp of that difficult eastern tongue in additionusefullyhed mastered sufficient words in ibn bakirs own asharite to function as an interpreter for the handful of southern merchants foolhardy enough to sail along rocky coastlines fighting a lee shore and then east into the frigid choppy waters of these northern seas to trade with the barbarians the erlings were raiders and pirates ravaging in their longships all through these lands and waters andincreasinglydown south but even pirates could be seduced by the lure of trade and firaz ibn bakir and his partners had reaped profit from that truth enough so to have him back now for a third time standing in a knifelike wind on a bitter morning waiting for them to get on with burning halldr thinshank on a boat with his weapons and armour and his best household goods and wooden images of the gods and one of his slave girls and a horse a pale grey horse a beauty halldrs favourite and missing on a very small island ibn bakir looked around a sweeping gaze from the town square could almost encompass rabady the harbour a stony beach with a score of erling ships and his own large roundship from the souththe first one in which ought to have been splendid news this town sheltering several hundred souls perhaps was deemed an important market in the northlands a fact that brought private amusement to the merchant from fezana a man who had been received by the khalif in cartada who had walked in the gardens and heard the music of the fountains there no fountains here beyond the stockade walls and the ditch surrounding them a quilting of stony farmland could be seen then livestock grazing then forest beyond the pine woods he knew the sea swept round again with the rocky mainland of vinmark across the strait more farms there fishervillages along the coast then emptiness mountains and trees for a very long way to the places where the reindeer ran they said in herds that could not be numbered and the men who lived among them wore antlers themselves to hunt and practised magics with blood in the winter nights ibn bakir had written these stories down during his last long journey home had told them to the khalif at an audience in cartada presented his writings along with gifts of fur and amber hed been given gifts in return a necklace an ornamental dagger his name was known in cartada now it occurred to him that it might be useful to observe and chronicle this funeralif the accursed rites ever began he shivered it was cold in the blustering wind an untidy dump of men made their way towards him tacking across the square as if they were on a ship together one man stumbled and bumped another the second one swore pushed back put a hand to his axe a third intervened and took a punch to the shoulder for his pains he ignored it like an insect bite another big man they were all ibn bakir thought sorrowfully big men it came to him belatedly that this was not really a good time to be a stranger on rabady isle with the governor they used an erling word but it meant as best ibn bakir could tell something very like a governor dead and his funeral rites marred by a mysteriously missing animal suspicions might fall as the group approached he spread his hands palms up and brought them together in front of him he bowed formally someone laughed someone stopped directly in front of him reached out unsteadily and fingered the pale yellow silk of ibn bakirs tunics leaving a smear of grease ofnir his interpreter said something in their language and the others laughed again ibn bakir alert now believed he detected an easing of tension he had no idea what hed do if he was wrong the considerable profit you could make from trading with barbarians bore a direct relation to the dangers of the journeyand the risks were not only at sea he was the youngest partner investing less than the others earning his share by being the one who travelled by allowing thick rancidsmelling barbarian fingers to tug at his clothing while he smiled and bowed and silently counted the hours and days till the roundship might leave its hold emptied and refilled they say ofnir spoke slowly in the loud voice one used with the simpleminded it is now known who take halldr horse his breath very close to ibn bakir smelled of herring and beer his tidings however were entirely sweet it meant they didnt think the trader from alrassan the stranger had anything to do with it ibn bakir had been dubious about his ability with two dozen words in their tongue and ofnirs tenuous skills to make the obvious point that hed just arrived the afternoon before and had no earthly or other reason to impede local rites by stealing a horse these were not men currently in a condition to assess cogency of argument who did it ibn bakir was only mildly curious servant to halldr sold to him father make wrong killing sent away son have no right family now lack of family appeared to be an explanation for theft here ibn bakir thought wryly that seemed to be what ofnir was conveying he knew someone back home who would find this diverting over a glass of good wine so he took the horse where into the woods ibn bakir gestured at the pines beyond the fields ofnir shrugged he pointed out into the square ibn bakir saw that men were now mounting horses therenot always smoothlyand riding towards the open town gate and the plank bridge across the ditch others ran or walked beside them he heard shouts anger yes but also something else zest liveliness the promise of sport he will soon found ofnir said in what passed here in the northlands for asharite ibn bakir nodded he watched two men gallop past one screamed suddenly as he passed and swung his axe in vicious whistling circles over his head for no evident reason what will they do to him he asked not caring very much ofnir snorted spoke quickly in erling to the others evidently repeating the question there was a burst of laughter one of them in an effusion of good humour punched ibn bakir on the shoulder the merchant regaining his balance rubbing at his numbed arm realized that hed asked a naive question bloodeagle death maybe said ofnir flashing yellow teeth in a wide grin making a complex twohanded gesture the southern merchant was abruptly pleased not to understand you see her you see firaz ibn bakir a long way from home shook his head he could blame his father and curse him even go to the women at the compound outside the walls and pay to have them evoke seithr the volur might then send a nightspirit to possess his father wherever he was but there was something cowardly about that and a warrior could not be a coward and still go to the gods when he died besides which he had no money riding in darkness before the first moon rose bern thorkellson thought bitterly about the bonds of family he could smell his own fear and laid a hand forward on the horses neck to gentle it it was too black to go quickly on this rough ground near the woods and he could notfor obvious reasonscarry a torch he was entirely sober which was useful a man could die sober as well as drunken he supposed but had a better chance of avoiding some kinds of death of course it could also be said that no truly sober man would have done what he was doing now unless claimed by a spirit himself ghostridden godtormented bern didnt think he was crazed but hed have acknowledged freely that what he was doingwithout having planned it at allwas not the wisest thing hed ever done he concentrated on riding there was no good reason for anyone to be abroad in these fields at nightfarmers would be asleep behind doors the shepherds would have their herds farther westbut there was always the chance of someone hoping to find a cup of ale at some hut or meeting a girl or looking for something to steal he was stealing a dead mans horse himself a warriors vengeance would have had him kill halldr thinshank long ago and face the blood feud after beside whatever distant kin if any might come to his aid instead halldr had died when the main crossbeam of the new house he was having built with money that didnt belong to him fell on his back breaking it and bern had stolen the grey horse that was to be burned with the governor tomorrow it would delay the rites he knew disquiet the ghost of the man who had exiled berns father and taken his mother as a second wife the man who had also not incidentally ordered bern himself bound for three years as a servant to arni kjellson recompense for his fathers crime a young man named to servitude with an exiled father and so without any supporting family or name could not readily proclaim himself a warrior among the erlings unless he went so far from home that his history was unknown his father had probably done that raiding overseas again redbearded fiercetempered experienced a perfect oarsman for some longship if he didnt kill a benchmate in a fury bern thought sourly he knew his fathers capacity for rage arni kjellsons brother nikar was dead of it halldr might fairly have exiled the murderer and given away half his land to stop a feud but marrying the exiles wife and claiming land for himself smacked too much of reaping in pleasure what hed sowed as a judge bern thorkellson an only son with two sisters married and off the island had found himself changedin a blur of timefrom the heir of a celebrated raiderturnedfarmer to a landless servant without kin to protect him could any man wonder if there was bitterness in him and more than that hed loathed rabadys governor with cold passion a hatred shared by more than a few if words whispered in ale were to be believed of course no one else had ever done anything about halldr bern was the one now riding thinshanks favourite stallion amid stones and boulders in cold darkness on the night before the governors pyre was to be lit on a ship by the rocky beach not the wisest action of his life agreed for one thing he hadnt anything even vaguely resembling a plan hed been lying awake listening to the snoring and snorting of the other two servants in the shed behind kjellsons house not unusual that wakefulness bitterness could suck a man from sleep but somehow hed found himself on his feet this time dressing pulling on boots and the bearskin vest hed been able to keep so far though hed had to fight for it hed gone outside pissed against the shed wall and then walked through the silent blackness of the town to halldrs house frigga his mother lying somewhere inside alone now without a husband for the second time in a year hed slipped around the side eased open the door to the stable listened to the boy there snuffling in the dreams of a strawcovered sleep and then led the big grey horse called gyllir quietly out under the watching stars the stableboy never stirred no one appeared in the lane only the named shapes of heroes and beasts in the gods sky overhead hed been alone in rabady with the nightspirits it had felt like a dream the town gate was locked when danger threatened but not otherwise rabady was an island bern and the grey horse had walked right through the square by the harbour past the shuttered booths down the middle of the empty street through the open gates across the bridge over the ditch into the night fields as simple as that as lifealtering lifeending was probably the better way to describe it he decided given that this was not in fact a dream he had no access to a boat that could carry the horse and come sunrise a goodly number of extremely angry menappalled at his impiety and their own exposure to an unhoused ghostwould begin looking for the horse when they found the son of exiled thorkell also missing the only challenging decision would be how to kill him this did raise a possibility given that he was sober and capable of thought he could change his mind and go back leave the horse out here to be found a minor disturbing incident they might blame it on ghosts or wood spirits bern could be back in his shed asleep behind arni kjellsons village house before anyone was the wiser could even join the morning search for the horse if fat kjellson let him off woodsplitting to go theyd find the grey bring it back strangle and burn it on the drifting longship with halldr thinshank and whichever girl had won her spirit a place among warriors and gods by drawing the straw that freed her from the slow misery of her life bern guided the horse across a stream the grey was big restive but knew him kjellson had been properly grateful to the governor when half of red thorkells farm and house were settled on him and he had assigned his servants to labour for thinshank at regular times bern was one of those servants now by the same judgement that had given his familys lands to kjellson he had groomed the grey stallion often walked him cleaned out his straw a magnificent horse better than halldr had ever deserved there was nowhere to run this horse properly on rabady he was purely for display an affirmation of wealth another reason probably why the thought of taking it away had come to him tonight in the dangerous space between dream and the waking world he rode on in the chill night winter was over but it still had its hard fingers in the earth their lives were defined by it here in the north bern was cold even with the vest at least he knew where he was going now that much seemed to have come to him the land his father had bought with looted gold mostly from the celebrated raid in ferrieres twentyfive years ago was on the other side of the village south and west he was aiming for the northern fringes of the trees he saw the shape of the marker boulder and guided the horse past it theyd killed and buried a girl there to bless the fields so long ago the inscription on the marker had faded away it hadnt done much good the land near the forest was too stony to be properly tilled ploughs broke up behind oxen or horses metal rending snapping off hard ungiving soil sometimes the harvests were adequate but most of the food that fed rabady came from the mainland the boulder cast a shadow he looked up saw the blue moon had risen from beyond the woods spirits moon it occurred to him rather too late that the ghost of halldr thinshank could not be unaware of what was happening to his horse halldrs lingering soul would be set free only with the shipburial and burning tomorrow tonight it could be abroad in the darkwhich was where bern was he made the hammer sign invoking both ingavin and thünir he shivered again a stubborn man he was too clever for his own good his fathers son in that hed deny it at a blades end this had nothing to do with thorkell he was pursuing his own feud with halldr and the town not his fathers you exiled a murderer twice a murderer if need be you didnt condemn his freeborn son to years of servitude and a landless fate for the fathers crimeand expect him to forgive a man without land had nothing could not marry speak in the thringmoot claim honour or pride his life and name were marred broken as a plough by stones he ought to have killed halldr or arni kjellson or someone he wondered sometimes where his own rage lay he didnt seem to have that fury like a berserkir in battle or like his father in drink his father had killed people raiding with siggur volganson and here at home bern hadnt done anything so direct instead hed stolen a horse secretly in the dark and was now heading for want of anything close to a better idea to see if womans magicthe volurscould offer him aid in the depths of a night not a brilliant plan but the only one that had come to him the women would probably scream raise an alarm turn him in that did make him think of something a small measure of prudence he turned east towards the risen moon and the edge of the wood dismounted and led the horse a short way in he looped the rope to a tree trunk he was not about to walk up to the womens compound leading an obviously stolen horse this called for some trickery it was hard to be devious when you had no idea what you were doing he despised the bleak infliction of this life upon him was unable it seemed to even consider two more years of servitude with no assurance of a return to any proper status afterwards so no he wasnt going back leaving the stallion to be found slipping into his straw in the freezing shed behind kjellsons house that was over the sagas told of moments when the heros fate changed when he came to the axletree he wasnt a hero but he wasnt going back not by choice he was likely to die tonight or tomorrow no rites for him when that happened there would be an excited quarrel over how to kill a defiling horse thief how slowly and who most deserved the pleasure of it they would be drunk and happy bern thought of the bloodeagle then pushed the image from his mind even the heroes died usually young the brave went to ingavins halls he wasnt sure if he was brave it was dense and black in the trees he felt the pine needles underfoot wood smells moss pine scent of a fox bern listened heard nothing but his own breathing and the horses gyllir seemed calm enough he left him there turned north again still in the woods towards where he thought the volurs compound was hed seen it a few times a clearing carved out a little way into the forest if someone had magic bern thought they could deal with wolves or even make use of them it was said that the women who lived here had tamed some of the beasts could speak their language bern didnt believe that he made the hammer sign again however with the thought hed have missed the branching path in the blackness if it hadnt been for the distant spill of lantern light it was late for that the bottom of a night but he had no idea what laws or rules women such as these would observe perhaps the seerthe volurstayed awake all night sleeping by day like the owls the sense of being in a dream returned he wasnt going to go back and he didnt want to die those two things together could bring you out alone in night approaching a seers cabin through black trees the lightsthere were two of themgrew brighter as he came nearer he could see the path and then the clearing and the structures beyond a fence one large cabin smaller ones flanking it evergreens in a circle around as if held at bay an owl cried behind him a moment later bern realized that it wasnt an owl no going back now even if his feet would carry him hed been seen or heard the compound gate was closed and locked he climbed over the fence saw a brewhouse and a locked storeroom with a heavy door walked past them into the glow cast by the lamplight in the windows of the largest cabin the other buildings were dark he stopped and cleared his throat it was very quiet ingavins peace upon all dwelling here he hadnt said a word since rising from his bed his voice sounded jarring and abrupt no response from within no one to be seen i come without weapons seeking guidance the lanterns flickered as before in the windows on either side of the cabin door he saw smoke rising from the chimney there was a small garden on the far side of the building mostly bare this early in the year with the snow just gone he heard a noise behind him wheeled it is deep in the bowl of night said the woman who unlocked and closed the outer gate behind her entering the yard she was hooded in the darkness it was impossible to see her face her voice was low our visitors come by daylight bearing gifts bern looked down at his empty hands of course seithr had a price everything in the world did it seemed he shrugged tried to appear indifferent after a moment he took off his vest held it out the woman stood motionless then came forward and took it wordlessly he saw that she limped favouring her right leg when she came near he realized that she was young no older than he was she walked to the door of the cabin knocked it opened just a little bern couldnt see who stood within the young woman entered the door closed he was alone again in a clearing under stars and the one moon it was colder now without the vest his older sister had made it for him siv was in vinmark on he mainland married two children maybe another by now theyd had no reply after sending word of thorkells exile a year ago he hoped her husband was kind had not changed with the news of her fathers banishment he might have shame could come from a wifes kin bad blood for his own sons a check to his ambitions that could alter a man there would be more shame when tidings of his own deeds crossed the water both his sisters might pay for what hed done tonight he hadnt thought about that he hadnt thought very much at all hed only gotten up from bed and taken a horse before the ghost moon rose as in a dream the cabin door opened the woman with the limp came out standing in the spill of light she motioned to him and so he walked forward he felt afraid didnt want to show it he came up to her and saw her make a slight gesture and realized she hadnt seen him clearly before in the darkness she still had her hood up hiding her face he registered yellow hair quick eyes she opened her mouth as if to say something but didnt speak just motioned for him to enter bern went within and she pulled the door shut behind him from outside he didnt know where she was going he didnt know what shed been doing outside so late he really didnt know much at all why else come to ask of womens magic what a man ought to do for himself taking a deep breath he looked around by firelight and the lamps at both windows and over against the far wall on a long table it was warmer than hed expected he saw his vest lying on a second table in the middle of the room among a clutter of objects conjuring bones a stone dagger a small hammer a carving of thünir a tree branch twigs soapstone pots of various sizes there were herbs strewn everywhere lying on the table others in pots and bags on the other long surface against the wall there was a chair on top of that table at the back and two blocks of wood in front of it for steps he had no idea what that meant he saw a skull on the nearer table kept his face impassive why take a dead mans horse bern thorkellson bern jumped no chance of concealing it his heart hammered the voice came from the most shadowed corner of the room near the back to his right smoke drifted from a candle recently extinguished a bed there a woman sitting upon it they said she drank blood the volur that her spirit could leave her body and converse with spirits that her curse killed that she was past a hundred years old and knew where the volgans sword was how how do you know what i he stammered foolish question she even knew his name she laughed at him a cold laughter he could have been in his straw right now bern thought a little desperately sleeping not here what power could i claim bern thorkellson if i didnt know that much of someone come in the night he swallowed she said you hated him so much thinshank bern nodded what point denying i had cause he said indeed said the seer many had cause he married your mother did he not that isnt why bern said she laughed again no do you hate your father also he swallowed again he felt himself beginning to sweat a clever man thorkell einarson bern snorted bitterly couldnt help it oh very exiled himself ruined his family lost his land a temper when he drank but a shrewd man as i recall is his son he still couldnt see her clearly a shadow on a bed had she been asleep they said she didnt sleep you will be killed for this she said her voice held a dry amusement more than anything else they will fear an angry ghost i know that said bern it is why i have come i need counsel he paused is it clever to know that much at least take the horse back she said blunt as a hammer he shook his head i wouldnt need magic to do that i need counsel for how to live and not go back he saw her shift on the bed then she stood up came forward the light fell upon her finally she wasnt a hundred years old she was very tall thin and bony his mothers age perhaps more her hair was long and plaited and fell on either side of her head like a maidens but grey her eyes were a bright icy blue her face lined long no beauty in it a hard authority cruelty a raiders face had she been a man she wore a heavy robe dyed the colour of old blood an expensive colour he looked at her and was afraid her fingers were very long you think a bearskin vest badly made buys you access to seithr she said her name was iord he suddenly remembered forgot who had told him that long ago in daylight bern cleared his throat it isnt badly made he protested she didnt bother responding stood waiting he said i have no other gifts to give i am a servant to arni kjellson now he looked at her standing as straight as he could you said many had reason to hate halldr was he generous to you and the women here a guess a gamble a throw of dice on a tavern table among beakers of ale he hadnt known he would say that had no idea whence the question had come she laughed again a different tone this time then she was silent looking at him with those hard eyes bern waited his heart still pounding she came abruptly forward moved past him to the table in the middle of the room longstriding for a woman he caught a scent about her as she went pine resin something else an animal smell she picked up some of the herbs threw them in a bowl took that and crossed to the back table for something beside the raised chair put that in the bowl too he couldnt see what with the hammer she began pounding and grinding her back to him still working her movements decisive she said suddenly you had no thought of what you might do son of thorkell son of frigga you just stole a horse on an island is that it stung bern said shouldnt your magic tell you my thoughtsor lack of them she laughed again glanced at him briefly then over her shoulder the eyes were bright if i could read a mind and future just from a man entering my room id not be by the woods on rabady isle in a cabin with a leaking roof id be at kjarten vidursons hall in hlegest or in ferrieres or even with the emperor in sarantium jaddites theyd burn you for pagan magic she was still amused still crushing herbs in the stone bowl not if i told their future truly she said sun god or no kings want to know what will be even aeldred would welcome me could i look at any man and know all of him aeldred no he wouldnt she glanced back at him again you are wrong his hunger is for knowledge as much as for anything your father may even know that by now if hes gone raiding among the anglcyn has he gone raiding there he asked before he could stop himself he heard her laughing she didnt even look back at him this time she came again to the near table and took a flask of something poured a thick pasty liquid into the bowl stirred it then poured it all back into the flask bern felt afraid still watching her this was magic he was entangling himself with it witchery seithr dark as the night was as the way of women in the dark his own choice though he had come for this and it seemed she was doing something there was a movement from over by the fire he looked quickly took an involuntary step backwards an oath escaping him something slithered across the floor and beneath the far table it disappeared behind a chest against that wall the seer followed his gaze smiled ah you see my new friend they brought me a serpent today the ship from the south they said his poison was gone i had him bite one of the girls to be sure i need a serpent they change worlds when they change skin did you know that he hadnt known that of course he hadnt known that he kept his gaze on the wooden chest nothing moved but it was there coiled behind he felt much too warm now smelled his own sweat he finally looked back at her her eyes were waiting held his drink she said no one had made him come here he took the flask from her hand she had rings on three fingers he drank the herbs were thick in the drink hard to swallow half only she said quickly he stopped she took the flask and drained it herself put it down on the table said something in a low voice he couldnt hear turned back to him undress she said he stared at her a vest will not buy your future or the spirit worlds guidance but a young man always has another offering to give he didnt understand at first and then he did a glitter in her coldness she had to be older than his mother lined and seamed her breasts sunken on her chest beneath the dark red robe bern closed his eyes i must have your seed bern thorkellson if you wish seithrs power you require more than a seers vision and before daybreak or they will find you and cut you apart before they allow you to die her gaze was pitiless you know it to be so he knew it his mouth was dry he looked at her you hated him too undress she said again he pulled his tunic over his head it ought to have been a dream all of this it wasnt he removed his boots leaning against the table she watched her eyes never leaving him very bright very blue his hand on the table touched the skull it wasnt human he saw belatedly a wolf most likely he wasnt reassured she wasnt here to reassure he was inside another world or in the doorway to it womens world gateway to womens knowing shadows and blood a serpent in the room on the ship from the south they had traded during the banned time before the funeral rites he didnt think somehow they would be troubled by that here they said his poison was gone he felt whatever he had just drunk in his veins now go on said the seer a woman ought not to watch like this bern thought tasting his fear again he hesitated then took off his trousers was naked before her he squared his shoulders he saw her smile the thin mouth he felt lightheaded what had she given him to drink she gestured his feet carried him across the room to her bed lie down she said watching him on your back he did what she told him he had left the world where things were as they ought to be he had left it when he took the dead mans horse she walked about the room and pinched shut or blew out the candles and lamps so only the firelight glowed red on the farthest wall in the neardark it was easier she came back stood over against her bed where he layan outline against the fire looking down upon him she reached out slowlyhe saw her hand movingand touched his manhood bern closed his eyes again hed thought her touch would be cold like age like death but it wasnt she moved her fingers down and back up and then slowly down again he felt himself even amid fear and a kind of horror becoming aroused a roaring in his blood the drink this wasnt like a romp with elli or anrida in the stubbled fields after harvesting in the straw of their barn by moonlight this wasnt like anything good whispered the volur and repeated it her hand moving it needs your seed to be done you see you have a gift for me her voice had changed again deepened she withdrew her hand bern trembled kept his eyes tightly closed heard a rustling as she shed her own robe he wondered suddenly where the serpent was pushed that thought away the bed shifted he felt her hands on his shoulders a knee by one hip and then the other smelled her scentand then she mounted him from above without hesitation and sheathed him within her hard bern gasped heard a sound torn from her and with that he understoodwithout warning or expectationthat he had a power here after all even in this place of magic she needed what was his to give and it was that awareness a kind of surging that took him over more than any other shape desire might wear as the womanthe witch volur wise woman seer whatever she would be namedbegan rocking upon him breathing harder crying a name then not his her hips moving as in a spasm he made himself open his eyes saw her head thrown back her mouth wide open her own eyes closed now upon need as she rode him wildly like a night horse of her own dark dreaming and claimed for herselfnow with his own harsh torn spasmthe seed she said she needed to work magic in the night get dressed she swung off his body and up from the bed no lingering no aftermath the voice brittle and cold again she put on her robe and went to the near wall of the cabin rapped three times on it hard she looked back at him her glance bleak as before as if the woman upon him moments ago with her closed eyes and shuddering breath had never existed in the world unless youd prefer the others see you like this when they come in bern moved as he hurried into clothing and boots she crossed to the fire took a taper and began lighting the lamps again before they were all lit before he had his overshirt on the outside door opened and four women came in moving quickly he had a sense theyd been trying to catch him before he was dressed which meant they had he took a breath he didnt know what it meant he was lost here in this cabin in the night one of the women carried a dark blue cloak he saw she took this to the volur and draped it about her fastening it at one shoulder with a silver torque three of the others none of them young took over dealing with the lamps the last one began preparing another mixture at the table using a different bowl no one said a word bern didnt see the young girl whod spoken to him outside after their entrance and quick glances at him none of the women even seemed to acknowledge his presence here a man meaningless he hadnt been just before though had he a part of him wanted to say that bern slipped his head and arms into his shirt and stood near the rumpled bed he felt oddly awake now alertsomething in the drink shed given him the one making the new mixture poured it into a beaker and carried it to the seer who drained it at once making a face she went over to the blocks of wood before the back table a woman on each side helped her step up and then seat herself on the elevated chair there were lights burning now all through the room the volur nodded the four women began to chant in a tongue bern didnt know one of the lamps by the bed suddenly went out bern felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand up this was seithr magic not just foretelling the seer closed her eyes and gripped the arms of her heavy chair as if afraid she might be carried off one of the other women still chanting moved with a taper past bern and relit the extinguished lamp returning she paused by him for a moment she squeezed his buttocks with one hand saying nothing not even looking at him then she rejoined the others in front of the elevated chair her gesture casual and controlling was exactly like a warriors with a serving girl passing his bench in a tavern berns face reddened he clenched his fists but just then the seer spoke from her seat above them her eyes still closed hands clutching the chair arms her voice highgreatly alteredbut saying words he could understand theyd given him back his vest which was a blessing the night felt even colder after the warmth inside he walked slowly eyes not yet adjusted to blackness moving away from the compound lights through the trees on either side he was concentrating on finding his way and on remembering exactly what the volur had told him the instructions had been precise magic involved precision it seemed a narrow path to walk ruin on either side a single misstep away he still felt the effects of the drink a sharpening of perception a part of him was aware that what he was doing now could be seen as mad but it didnt feel that way he felt protected he heard the horse before he saw it wolves might eat the moons heralding the end of days and the death of gods but they hadnt found halldrs grey horse yet bern spoke softly that the animal might know his voice as he approached he rubbed gyllirs mane untied the rope from the tree led him back out into the field the blue moon was high now waning the night past its deepest point turning towards dawn he would have to move quickly what did she tell you to do bern wheeled sharpened perceptions or not he hadnt heard anyone approach if hed had a sword hed have drawn it but he didnt even have a dagger it was a womans voice though and he recognized it what are you doing here saving your life she said perhaps it may not be possible she limped forward from the trees he hadnt heard her approach because shed been waiting for him he realized what do you mean answer my question what did she tell you to do bern hesitated gyllir snorted swung his head restive now do this tell me that stand here go there bern said why do all of you enjoy giving orders so much i can leave the young woman said mildly though she was still hooded he saw her shrug and i certainly havent ordered you to undress and get into bed for me bern went crimson he was desperately glad of the darkness suddenly she waited it was true he thought she could walk away and hed be exactly where hed been a moment ago he had no idea what she was doing here but that ignorance was of a piece with everything else tonight he could almost have found it amusing if it hadnt been so thickly trammelled in woman things she made a spell he said finally up on that chair in the blue cloak for magic i know about the chair and cloak the girl said impatiently where is she sending you back to town shes made me invisible to them i can ride right down the street and no one will see me he heard the note of triumph enter his voice well why not it was astonishing im to go onto the southerners shiptheres a ramp out by law it is open for inspectionand go straight down into the hold with a horse he nodded they have animals theres a ramp down too and then stay there till they leave and get off at their next port of call ferrieres probably he could see she was staring straight at him invisible with a horse on a ship he nodded again she began to laugh bern felt himself flushing again you find this amusing your own volurs power womens magic she was trying to collect herself a hand to her mouth tell me she asked finally if you cant be seen how am i looking at you berns heart knocked hard against his ribs he rubbed a hand across his forehead found that he couldnt speak for a moment you ah are one of them part of ah the seithr she took a step towards him he saw her shake her head within the hooded robe she wasnt laughing now bern thorkellson i see you because you arent under any spell you will be taken as soon as you enter the town captured like a child she lied to you he took a deep breath looked up at the sky ghost moon early spring stars his hands were trembling holding the horses reins why would she said she hated halldr as much as i did thats true he was no friend to us thinshanks dead though she can use the goodwill of whoever becomes governor now her capturing youand they will be told before midday that she put you under a spell and forced you to ride back to themis a way to achieve that isnt it he didnt feel guarded any more we need food and labour out here she went on calmly we need the fear and assistance of the town both all volurs require this wherever they are you become her way of starting again after the long quarrel with halldr your coming here tonight was a gift to her he thought of the woman above him in the bed lit only by the fire in more ways than one the girl added as if reading his thoughts she has no power no seithr i didnt say that although i dont think she does theres no magic nothing to make a man invisible she laughed again if one spearman cant hit a target when he throws do you decide that spears are useless it was too dark to make out any expression on her face he realized something you hate her he said thats why you are here because because she had the snake bite you he could see she was surprised hesitating for the first time i dont love her no she agreed but i wouldnt be here because of that why then bern asked a little desperately again a pause he wished now that there were light he still hadnt seen her face she said we are kin bern thorkellson im here because of that what he was stunned your sister married my brother on the mainland siv married no athira wedded my brother gevin he felt abruptly angry couldnt have said why that doesnt make us kin woman even in darkness he could see that he had wounded her the horse moved again whickered impatient with standing the woman said i am a long way from home your family is the closest i have on this island i suppose forgive me for presuming his family was landless his father exiled he was a servant compelled to sleep in a barn on straw for two more years what presumption bern said roughly that isnt what i meant he wasnt sure what hed meant there was a silence he was thinking hard you were sent to the volur they reported you had a gift the hood moved up and down curious how often unwed youngest daughters have a gift isnt it why did i never hear of you we are meant to be unattached to be the more dependent thats why they bring girls from distant villages and farms all the seers do that ive spoken to your mother though you have what why the shrug again friggas a woman athira gave me a message for her you all have your tricks dont you he felt bitter suddenly swords and axes are so much better arent they she said sharply she was staring at him again though he knew the darkness hid his face too were all trying to make ourselves a life bern thorkellson men and women both why else are you out here now bitterness still because my father is a fool who killed a man and his son is what a fool about to die before the next moon rises a good way to make a life isnt it useful kin for you to have she said nothing looked away he heard the horse again felt the wind a change in it as though the night had indeed turned moving now towards dawn the snake he said awkwardly is it im not poisoned it hurts you walked out here a long way theres one of us out all night on watch we take turns the younger ones people come in the dark thats how i saw you on the horse and told her no i meant just now to warn me oh she paused you believe me then for the first time a note of doubt wistfulness she was betraying the volur for him he grinned crookedly you are looking right at me as you said i cant be that hard to see even a pissdrunk raider falling off his horse will spot me when the sun comes up yes i believe you she let out a breath what will they do to you he asked it had just occurred to him if they find out i was here i dont want to think about it she paused thank you for asking he felt suddenly shamed cleared his throat if i dont ride back into the village will they know you warned me her laughter again unexpected bright and quick they could possibly decide you were clever by yourself he laughed too couldnt help it was aware that it could be seen as a madness sent by the gods laughter at the edge of dying one hideous death or another not like the mindlessness of the waterdiseasea man bitten by a sick foxbut the madness where one has lost hold of the way things are laughter here another kind of strangeness in this dark by the wood among the spirits of the dead with the blue moon overhead pursued by a wolf in the sky the world would end when that wolf caught the two moons he had more immediate problems actually what will you do she asked the third time shed seemed to track his thoughts perhaps it was more than being a youngest daughter this matter of having a gift he wished again he could see her clearly but as it happened he did know finally the answer to her question once years ago his father had been in a genial mood one evening as theyd walked out together to repair a loose door on their barn thorkell wasnt always drunk or even often so being honest with his own memories that summer evening he was sober and easy and the measure of that mood was that after finishing the work the two of them went walking towards the northern boundary of their land and thorkell spoke of his raiding days to his only son something that rarely happened thorkell einarson had not been a man given to boasting or to offering scraps of advice from the table of his recollections this made him unusual among the erlings or those that bern knew at any rate it wasnt always easy having an unusual father though a boy could take some dark pride in seeing thorkell feared by others as much as he was they whispered about him pointed him out carefully to merchants visiting the isle bern a watchful child had seen it happen other men had told the boy tales he knew something of what his father had done companion and friend to siggur volganson himself right to the end voyages in storm raids in the dark escaping the cyngael after siggur died and his sword was lost a journey alone across the cyngael lands then the width of the anglcyn kingdom to the eastern coast and finally home across the sea to vinmark and this isle i recollect a night like this a long time ago his father said leaning back against the boulder that marked the boundary of their land we went too far from the boats and they cut us offcuthbertshousehold guard his best menbetween a wood and a stream cuthbert had been king of the anglcyn in the years when thorkell was raiding with the volgan bern knew that much he remembered loving moments such as that one had been the two of them together the sun setting the air mild his father mild and talking to him siggur said something to us that night he said there are times when all you can do to survive is one single thing however unlikely it may be and so you act as if it can be done the only chance we had was that the enemy was too sure of victory and had not posted outliers against a night breakout thorkell looked at his son you understand that everyone posts outlying guards it is the most basic thing an army does it is mad not to they had to have them there was no chance they didnt bern nodded so we spoke our prayers to ingavin and broke out thorkell said matteroffactly maybe sixty mentwo boats worth of usagainst two hundred at the least a blind rush in the dark some of us on stolen horses some running no order to it only speed the whole thing being to get to their camp and through ittake some horses on the run if we couldcut back towards the ships two days away thorkell paused then looking out over summer farmlands towards the woods they didnt have outliers they were waiting for morning to smash us were mostly asleep a few still singing and drinking we killed thirty or forty of them got horses for some of our unmounted took two thegns hostage by blind luckcouldnt tell who they were in the dark and we sold them back to cuthbert the next day for our freedom to get to the boats and sail away hed actually grinned bern remembered behind the red beard his father had rarely smiled the anglcyn in the west rebelled against king cuthbert after that which is when athelbert became king then gademar and aeldred raiding got harder and then siggur died in llywerth thats when i decided to become a landowner spend my days fixing broken doors hed had to escape first alone and on foot across the breadth of two different countries you act as if it can be done im crossing to the mainland bern said quietly to the girl in that darkness by the wood she stood very still steal a boat he shook his head couldnt take the horse on any boat i could manage alone you wont leave the horse i wont leave the horse then swim said bern clearly he smiled but she couldnt see it he knew she was silent a moment you can swim he shook his head not that far heroes came to thresholds to moments that marked them and they died young too icy water end of winter the stony shore of vinmark a world away across the strait just visible by daylight qui f the mist didnt settle but not now what was a hero if he never had a chance to do anything if he died at the first threshold i think the horse can carry me he said i will act as if it can he felt his mood changing a strangeness overtaking him even as he spoke promise me no monsters in the sea i wish i could said the girl well thats honest he said he laughed again she didnt this time it will be very cold of course it will he hesitated can you see anything she knew what he meant no am i underwater he tried to make it a joke shook her head i cant tell im sorry im more a youngest daughter than a seer another silence it struck him that it would be appropriate to begin feeling afraid the sea at night straight out into the black shall i any word for your mother it hadnt occurred to him nothing had really he thought about it now better you never saw me that i was clever by myself and died of it in the sea you may not she didnt sound as if she believed that she would have been rowed across from vinmark coming here she knew the strait the currents and the cold even if there were no monsters bern shrugged that will be as ingavin and thünir decide make some magic if you have any pray for me if you havent perhaps well meet again i thank you for coming out you saved me from one bad kind of death at least it was past the bottom of the night and he had a distance to go to the beach nearest the mainland he said nothing more and neither did she though he could see that she was still staring at him in the dark he mounted up on the horse he wouldnt leave for halldr thinshanks funeral rites and rode away some time before reaching the strand southeast of the forest he realized he didnt know her name or have any clear idea what she looked like unlikely to matter if they met again it would probably be in the afterworld of souls he came around the looming dark of the pine woods to a stony place by the water rocky and wild exposed no boats here no fishermen in the night the pounding of the sea heavy sound of it salt in his face no shelter from the wind the blue moon west behind him now the white one not rising tonight until dawn it would be dark on the ocean water ingavin alone knew what creatures might be waiting to pull him down he wouldnt leave the horse he wouldnt go back you did whatever was left and acted as if it could be done bern cursed his father aloud then for murdering another man doing that to all of them his sisters and his mother and himself and then he urged the grey horse into the surf which was white where it hit the stones and black beyond under the stars two our trouble muttered dai looking down through greengold leaves at the farmyard is that we make good poems and bad siege weapons a siege in fact wasnt even remotely at issue the comment was so inconsequential and so typical of dai that alun laughed aloud not the wisest thing to do given where they were dai slapped a hand to his brothers mouth after a moment alun signalled he was under control and dai moved his hand away grunting anyone in particular youd like to besiege alun asked quietly enough he shifted his elbows carefully the bushes didnt move one poet i can think of dai said unwisely he was prone to jests his younger brother prone to laughing at them they were moth prone under leaves gazing at penned cattle below theyd come north to steal cattle the cyngael did that to each other frequently dai moved a hand quickly but alun kept still this time they couldnt afford to be seen there were just twelve of themeleven with gryffeth now capturedand they were a long way north into arberth no more than two or three days from the sea dai reckoned though he wasnt sure exactly where they were or what this very large farmhouse below them was twelve had been a marginal number for a raiding party but the brothers were confident in their abilities not without some cause besides in cadyr it was said that any one of their own was worth two of the arberthi and at least three from llywerth they might do the arithmetic differently in the other two provinces but that was just vanity and bluster or it should have been it was alarming that gryffeth had been taken so easily scouting ahead the good news was that hed prudently carried aluns harp with him to be taken for a bard on the road the bad news was that gryffethnotoriouslycouldnt sing or play to save his life if they tested him down below he was unmasked and saving his life became an issue so the brothers had left nine men out of sight off the road and climbed this overlook to devise a rescue plan if they went home without cattle it was bad but not humiliating not every raid succeeded you could still do a few things to make a story worth telling but if their royal father or uncle had to pay a ransom for a cousin taken on an unauthorized cattle raid into arberth during a heralds truce well that was going to be quite bad and if owyn of cadyrs nephew died in arberth it could mean war how many do you think dai murmured twenty give or take a few its a big farmhouse who lives here where are we alun was still watching the cows dai saw forget the cattle dai snapped everythings changed maybe not we let them out of the pen tonight four of us scatter them north up the valley the rest go in after gryffeth while theyre rounding them up dai looked thoughtfully at his younger brother thats unexpectedly clever he said finally alun punched him on the shoulder fairly hard hump a goat he added mildly this was your idea im getting us out of it dont be superior which rooms he in dai had been trying to sort that out the farmhousewhoever owned it was wealthywas long and sprawling running east to west he saw the outline of a large hall beyond the double doors below them wings bending back north at each end of that main building a house that had expanded in stages some parts stone others wood they hadnt seen gryffeth taken in had only come upon the signs of struggle on the path two cowherds were watching the cattle from the far side of the fenced enclosure east of the house boys their hands moving ceaselessly to wave at flies none of the armed men had emerged since a cluster of them had gone in through the main doors talking angrily just as the brothers had arrived here in the thicket above the farm once or twice theyd heard raised distant voices within and a girl had come out for well water otherwise it was quiet and hot a sleepy afternoon late spring butterflies the drone of bees a hawk circling dai watched it for a moment what neither brother said though both of them knew it was that it was extremely unlikely they could get a man out of a guarded room even at night and with a diversion without men dying on both sides during a truce this raid had gone wrong before it had even begun are we even certain hes in there dai said i am said alun nowhere else likely could he be a guest um could they have dai looked at him gryffeth couldnt play the harp he carried was wearing a sword and leather armour had a helmet in his saddle gear looked exactly the sort of young manwith a cadyri accent toowhod be up to mischief which he was the younger brother nodded without dai saying anything it was too miserably obvious alun swore briefly then murmured all right hes a prisoner well need to move fast know exactly where were going come on dai figure it out in jads name where have they got him in jads holy name brynn ap hywll tends to use the room at the eastern end of the main building for prisoners when he has them here if i remember rightly they whipped around dais knife was already out alun saw the world was a complex place sometimes saturated with the unexpected especially when you left home and the trappings of the known even so there were reasonable explanations for why someone might be up here now right behind them one of their own men might have followed with news one of the guards from below could have intuited the presence of other cadyri besides the captured one and come looking they might even have been observed on their way up what was implausible in the extreme was what they actually saw the man whod answered aluns question was smallish greyhaired cheeks and chin smoothshaven smiling at the two of them he was alone hands out and open weaponless and he was wearing a faded telltale yellow robe with a golden disk of jad about his neck i might not actually be remembering rightly he went on affably it has been some time since ive been here and memory slips as you get older you know dai blinked and shook his head as if to clear it after a blow theyd been completely surprised by an aging cleric alun cleared his throat one particular thing had registered powerfully did you er say brynn ap hywll dai was still speechless the cleric nodded benignly ah you know of him do you alun swore again he was fighting a rising panic the cleric made a reproving face then chuckled you do know him of course they did we dont know you dai said finally recovering the capacity for speech hed lowered the knife how did you get up here same way you did i imagine we didnt hear you evidently i do apologize i was quiet ive learned how to be not quite sure what id find you know the long yellow robes of a cleric were ill suited to silent climbing and this man was not young whoever he was he was no ordinary religious brynn alun muttered grimly to his brother the nameand what it meantreverberated inside him his heart was pounding i heard what evil jadcursed luck yes well said dai he was concentrating on the stranger for the moment i did ask who you were id count it a great courtesy if you favoured us with your name the cleric smiled pleased good manners he said were always a mark of your fathers family whatever their other sins might have been how is owyn and your lady mother both well i dare hope it has been many years dai blinked again you are a prince of cadyr he reminded himself your royal fathers heir born to lead men to control situions it became a necessary reminder suddenly you have entirely the advantage of us said his brother in all ways i can imagine aluns mouth quirked he found too many things amusing dai thought a younger brothers trait less responsibility all ways well one of you does have a knife said the cleric but he was smiling as he said it he lowered his hands im ceinion of llywerth servant of jad alun dropped to his knees dais jaw seemed to be hanging open he snapped it shut felt himself going red as a boy caught idling by his tutor he sheathed the knife hurriedly and sank down beside his brother head lowered hands together in submission he felt overwhelmed a saturation of the unexpected the unprepossessing yellowrobed man on this wooded slope was the high cleric of the three fractious provinces of the cyngael he calmly made the sign of jads disk in blessing over both of them come down with me he said the way we came unless you have an objection you are now my personal escorts were stopping here at brynnfell on our way north to amrens court at beda he paused or did you really want to try attacking brynns own house i shouldnt advise it you know i shouldnt advise it alun didnt know whether to laugh or curse again brynn ap hywll was only the subject of twentyfive years worth of songs and stories erlings bane theyd named him here in the west hed spent his youth battling the raiders from overseas with his cousin amren now ruling in arberth of whom there were stories too with them in those days had been dai and aluns own father and uncleand this man ceinion of llywerth the generation that had beaten back siggur volgansonthe volganand his longships and brynn was the one whod killed him alun drew a steadying breath their father who liked to hold forth with a flask at his elbow had told tales of all of these men had fought withand then sometimes againstthem he and dai and their friends were alun thought as they walked down and out of the wood behind the anointed high cleric of the cyngael in waters far over their heads brynnfell this was brynnfell below them they had been about to attack it with eleven men this is his stronghold he heard dai asking i thought edrys was his castle it is of course northeast by rheden and the wall and there are other farms this is the largest one hes here now as it happens what here himself brynn alun worked to breathe normally dai sounded stunned his brother who was always so composed this too could almost be funny alun thought almost ceinion of llywerth was nodding his head still leading the way downwards hes here to receive me actually good of him i must say i sent word that i would be passing through he glanced back how many men do you have i saw you two climbing but not the others the clerics tone was precise suddenly dai answered him and how many were taken just the one dai said alun kept quiet younger brother his name is gryffeth thats ludhs son dai nodded hed simply overheard them alun told himself this wasnt jads gift of sight or anything frightening very well said the cleric crisply turning to them as they came out of the trees and onto the path id account it a waste to have good men killed today i will do penance for a deception in the name of jads peace hear me you and your fellows joined me by arrangement at a ford of the llyfarch river three days ago you are escorting me north as a courtesy and so that you might visit amrens court at beda and offer prayers with him in his newbuilt sanctuary during this time of truce do you understand all that they nodded two heads bobbing up and down tell me is your cousin gryffeth ap ludh a clever man no said dai truthfully the cleric made a face what will he have told them i have no idea dai said nothing alun said he isnt quick but he can keep silent the cleric shook his head but why would he keep silent when all he had to say was that he was riding in advance to tell them i had arrived dai thought a moment then he grinned if the arberthi took him harshly hell have been quiet just to embarrass them when you do show up my lord the cleric thought it through then smiled back owyns sons would be clever he murmured he seemed pleased one of you will explain this to ludhs boy when we are inside where are your other men south of here hidden off the road dai said and yours my lord have none said the high cleric of the cyngael or i didnt until now you are my men remember you rode alone from llywerth walked but yes alone some things to think about and theres a truce in the land after all with outlaws in half the forests outlaws who know a cleric has nothing worth the taking ive said the dawn prayers with many of them he started walking dai blinked again and followed alun wasnt sure how he felt curiously elated in part for one thing this was the figure of whom so many stories were told some of them by his father and uncle though he knew there had been a fallingout and a little part of why for another the high cleric had just saved them from trying a mad attack on another legend in his own house a man of cadyr might be worth two arberthi but that did notharpboasting and aleborn songs asideapply to the warband of brynn ap hywll these were the men who had been fighting the erlings before dai and alun were born when the cyngael lived in terror of slavery and savage death three seasons of every year taking flight into the hills at the least rumour of the dragonprows it was clear now why gryffeth had been captured so easily theyd have had no chance trying to attack this farm tonight theyd have been humiliated or dead a truth to run back and forth through the mind like the shuttling of a loom alun ab owyn was very young that day a prince of cadyr and it was greenest springtime in the provinces of the cyngael in the world hed no wish to die something occurred to him my cousin was only carrying the harp for me by the way if anyone asks my lord the cleric glanced back over his shoulder gryffeth cant sing dai explained not that aluns much good a joke alun thought good dai was feeling himself again or starting to there will be a feast i expect ceinion of llywerth said well find out soon enough im actually better with siege weapons alun said not helpfully he was rewarded by hearing his older brother laugh and quickly smother it your royal father i knew very well fought against him and beside him a disgraceful youth if i may be blunt and a brave man it would be too much to hope that we might one day receive such a judgement from you my lord but to that we will aspire dai bowed after he spoke they were in the great hall of brynnfell beyond the central doors a long corridor behind them ran east and west towards the wings it was a very large house gryffeth had already been releasedfrom a room at the end of the eastern corridor as the cleric had guessed alun had had a whispered word with him and reclaimed his harp dai straightened and smiled you will permit me to add my lord that disgrace among the arberthi is sometimes honour in cadyr we have not always been favoured with the truce that brings us here as you know alun smiled inwardly kept his expression sincere dai had had a lifetime shaping this sort of speech he thought words mattered among the cyngael nuance and subtlety so did cattleraiding mind you but the days game had changed the scarred older warriora head taller than the two brothersbeamed happily down on them brynn ap hywll was big in every wayhands face shoulders girth even his greying moustache was thick and full he was red and fleshy and balding he wore no weapon in his own home had rings on several thick fingers and a massive golden torc around his throat erling work the hammer of the thunder god replaced by a suspended sun disk something hed captured or been offered as ransom alun guessed if ceinion of llywerth felt displeasure at seeing something made to hold pagan symbols of ingavin he didnt show it the high cleric was not at all what alun had expected him to be though he couldnt have said what he had expected certainly not the man who had been kissed so enthusiastically by the lady enid as her husband smiled approval alun had a recollection that the clerics own wife had died long ago but he was murky about the details you couldnt remember everything a tutor dictated or a talespinning father by the fireside well spoken young prince brynn boomed bringing alun back to the present their host looked genuinely pleased with dais answer hed a voice for the battlefield brynn one that would carry their arrival at brynnfell had gone easily after all alun had a sense that things tended to go that way when ceinion of llywerth was involved if there had been something odd about the cleric arriving with a cadyri escort when he usually walked alone to his destinations and was widely known not to have spoken to prince owyn for a decade and more well sometimes odd things happened and this was the high cleric brynn was prepared to play along it seemed whatever he might privately think alun saw the big mans gaze slide to where ceinion stood smooth face benign and attentive slender hands folded in the sleeves of his robe indeed it would seem you have set your feet on the path of virtue already serving as escorts to our beloved cleric avoiding the scandalous conduct of your sire in his own youth dai kept a level expression his lordship the high cleric is persuasive in his holiness we are honoured and grateful to be with him ive no doubt said brynn ap hywll just a little too dryly dai was afraid alun would laugh but he didnt dai was fighting to control exhilaration himself this was the dance the thrust and twist of words of meanings halfshown and then hidden that underlay all the great songs and deeds of courts the erlings might choose to loot and burn their way to some glorious afterlife of more looting and burning but the cyngael saw the glory of the world jads holy gift of itas embodied in more than just swords and raiding though that perhaps might explain why they were so often raided and lootedfrom vinmark overseas and under pressure from the anglcyn now across the rheden wall hed said it himself today poems over siege engines words above weapons too often he wasnt dwelling upon that now he was exulting in the presence of two of the very great men of the west as a springtime raid conjured out of boredom and their fathers absence hunting without them owyn was meeting a mistress had turned into something quite otherwise young dai ab owyn was in other words in that elevated state of mind and spirit where what occurred that evening could almost have been anticipated he was alert receptive highly attuned vulnerable at such times one can be hammered hard by a variety of things and the effect can last foreverthough it should be said that this did happen more often in tales bardspun in meadhalls than on an impulsive cattle raid gone strange just before the meal began alun had taken the musicians stool at the lady enids request brynns wife was tall darkhaired darkeyed younger than her husband a handsome woman with no shyness among the men in the hall none of the women here seemed shy come to think of it he was tuning his harp his favourite crwth made for him trying not to be distracted they were playing the triad game in the hall drinking the cup of welcome after the invocation by brynns own cleric before the food was brought ceinion had predicted a feast and had been proven right they were drinking wine not ale brynn ap hywll was a wealthy man some of the company were still standing others had taken their seats it was a relaxed gathering this was a farmhouse not a castle large and handsome as it might be the room smelled of new rushes freshly strewn herbs and flowersand hunting dogs there were at least ten wolfhounds grey black brindled brynns warband those with him here were not men to put great weight on ceremony it seemed cold as called out a woman near the head of the table alun hadnt sorted the names yet she was a family cousin he guessed roundfaced light brown hair cold as a winter lake answered a man leaning against the wall halfway down the room cold was an easy start they all knew the jokes womens hearts or the space between the legs of some of them those phrases wouldnt be offered now before the drinking had properly begun and with the ladies present cold as a loveless hearth said another worn phrases too often heard one more to complete the triad alun kept silent listening to his strings as he tuned there was always one song before the meal he was being honoured with it wasnt sure what he wanted to sing cold as a world without jad said gryffeth suddenly which wasnt brilliant but wasnt bad either with the high cleric at the head table it got him a murmur of approval and a smile from ceinion alun saw his brother next to the cleric wink at their cousin mark one for cadyr sorrowful as said another of the ladies an older one trust the cyngael alun thought wryly to conjure with sorrow at a spring banquets beginning we are a strange wonderful people he thought sorrowful as a swan alone a thin satisfiedlooking man sitting close to the high table the ap hywll bard his own crwth beside him an important figure accredited harpists always were there was a rustle of approbation alun smiled at the man received no response bards could be prickly jealous of privilege dangerous to offend more than one prince had been humiliated by satires written against him and alun had been asked to take the stool first tonight a guest indeed but not a formally trained or licensed bard best to be cautious he thought he wished he knew a song about siege engines dai would have laughed sorrowful as a sword unused said brynn himself leaning back in his chair the big voice predictable pounding of tables as the lord of the manor spoke sorrowful said alun surprising himself since hed just decided to be discreet as a singer without a song a small silence as they considered it then brynn ap hywll banged a meaty hand down on the board in front of him and the lady enid clapped her palms in pleasure and thenof courseso did everyone else dai winked again quickly and then contrived to look indifferent leaning back as well fingering his wine cup as if they were always offering such original phrasings in the triad game back home alun felt like laughing in truth the phrase had come to him because he had no song yet and would be called upon in a moment needful as suggested the lady enid looking along the table a new phrase this time alun looked at brynns wife more than handsome he corrected himself there was beauty there still glittering with the jewellery of rank upon her arms and about her throat more people were seated now servants stood by awaiting a signal to bring the food needful as warmed wine in winter someone alun couldnt see offered from down the room approval for that a nicely phrased offering winter memory in midsummer the phrase near to poetry their hostess turned to dai politely beyond her husband and the cleric to let the other cadyri prince have a turn needful as nights end dai said gravely without a pause which was very good actually an image of darkness the fear of it a dream of dawn when the god returned from his journey under the world as the real applause for this faded as they waited for someone to throw the third leg of the triad a young woman entered the room she moved quietly clad in green belted in gold with gold in the brooch at her shoulder and on her fingers to the empty place beside enid at the high tablewhich would have told alun who this was if the look and manner of her hadnt immediately done so he stared knew he was doing so didnt stop as she seated herself awarevery obviously awarethat all eyes were upon her including those of an indulgent father she looked down the table taking in the company and alun was made intensely conscious of dark eyes like her mothers very black hair under the soft green cap and skin whiter than any easy phrase that came to mind and then he heard her murmur voice rich husky for one so young unsettling needful as night i think many women would rather say and because this was rhiannon mer brynn through that crowded hall men felt that they knew exactly what she was saying and wished that the words had been for their ears alone whispered close at candletime not in company at table and they thought that they could kill or do great deeds that it might be made so alun could see his brothers face as this greengold womangirl turned to dai whose phrase she had just echoed and challenged and because he knew his brother better than he knew anyone on the gods earth alun saw the world change for dai in that crossing of glances a moment with a name to it as the bards said he had an instant to feel sorrow the awareness of something ending as something else began and then they asked him for a song that the night might begin with music which was the way of the cyngael brynnfell was a spacious property well run by a competent steward showing the touch of a mistress with taste access to artisans and a good deal of money still it was only a farm and there were a dozen young men from cadyr now staying with them over and above the thirty warriors and four women whod accompanied ap hywll and his wife and oldest daughter here space was at a premium the lady enid had worked with efficiency informed by experience meeting with the steward before the meal to arrange for the disposition of bodies at night the hall would hold fighting men on pallets and rushes it had done so before the main barn was pressed into use along with two outbuildings and the bakehouse the brewhouse remained locked best not to put such temptation in mens way and there was another reason the two cadyri princes and their cousin shared a room in the main house with a good bed for the three of themhonour demanded the host offer as much to royal guests the steward surrendered his own chamber to the high cleric he himself would join the cook and kitchen hands in the kitchen for the night he was grimly prepared to be as stoic as an eastern zealot on his crag if not as serenely alone the cook was notorious for the magnificence of his snoring and had once been found walking about the kitchen waving a blade and talking to himself entirely asleep hed ended up chopping vegetables in the middle of the night without ever waking as his helpers and a number of gathered household members watched in rapt silence peering through the darkness the steward had already determined to place all the knives out of reach before closing his eyes in the pleasant chamber thus yielded to him ceinion of llywerth finished the last words of the days office offering at the end his customary silent prayer for the sheltering in light of those he had lost some of them long ago and also his gratitude intensely felt to holy jad for all blessings given the god had purposes not to be clearly seen what had happened todaythe lives he had likely saved arriving when he didwas deserving of the humblest acknowledgement he rose showing no signs of a strenuous day or his years and formally blessed the man kneeling beside him in prayer he reclaimed his wine cup subsiding happily onto the stool nearest the window it was generally believed that the night air was noxious carrying poisons and unholy spirits but ceinion had spent too many years sleeping out of doors on walks across the three provinces and beyond he found that he slept better by an open window even in winter it was springtime now the air fragrant night flowers under his window i feel badly for the man who yielded me his bed his companion shifted his considerable bulk up from the floor and grasped his own cup refilling it to the brim without water he took the other sturdier chair keeping the flask close by and well you should brynn ap hywll said smiling through his moustache brynnfells bursting since when do you travel with an escort ceinion eyed him a moment then sighed since i found a cadyri raiding party looking at your farm brynn laughed aloud his laugh like his voice could overflow a room well thank you for deciding id sort out that much he drank thirstily refilled his cup again they seem good lads mind you jad knows i did my share of raiding when young and their father jad curse his eyes and hands brynn said though without force my royal cousin in beda wants to know what to do about owyn you know i know ill tell him when i get to beda with owyns two sons beside me the clerics turn to grin this time he leaned back against the cool stone wall beside the window earthly pleasures an old friend food and wine a day with some good unexpectedly done there were learned men who taught withdrawal from the traps and tangles of the world there was even a doctrinal movement afoot in rhodias to deny marriage to clerics now following the eastern sarantine rule making them ascetics detached from distractions of the fleshand the complexities of having heirs to provide for ceinion of llywerth had always thoughtand had written the high patriarch in rhodias and othersthat this was wrong thinking and even heresy an outright denial of jads full gift of life better to turn your love of the world into an honouring of the god and if a wife died or children your own knowledge of sorrow might make you better able to counsel others and comfort them you lived with loss as they did and shared their pleasures too his words written and spoken mattered to others by jads holy grace he was skilled at this sort of argument but didnt know if he would be on the winning side of this one the three provinces of the cyngael were a long way from rhodias at the edge of the world the misty borders of pagan belief north of the north wind the phrase went he sipped his wine looking at his friend brynns expression was sly at the moment amusingly so happen to see the way dai ab owyn looked at my rhiannon did you ceinion took care that his own manner did not change he had in fact seen itand something else shes a remarkable young woman he murmured her mothers daughter same spirit to her im an entirely beaten man i tell you brynn was smiling as he said this we solve a problem that way owyns heir handled by my girl ceinion kept his look noncommittal certainly a useful match the lads already lost his head id wager he chuckled not the first to do so with rhiannon and your daughter ceinion asked perhaps unwisely some fathers would have been startled or offered an oathwhat mattered the girls wishes in these things but brynn ap hywll didnt do that ceinion watched and by the lamplight saw the big man his old friend grow thoughtful too much so the cleric offered an inward mildly blasphemous curse and immediately soughtalso silentlythe gods forgiveness for that interesting song the younger one sang before the meal wasnt it there it was a shrewd man ceinion thought ruefully much more than a warrior with a twohanded sword it was he said still keeping his own counsel this was all too soon he temporized your bard was out of countenance amund it was too good you mean the song not that though it was impressive no alun ab owyn breached the laws for such things only licensed bards are allowed to improvise in company your harper will need appeasing spiky man amund not easily softened if you are right i am right call it a word offered the wise brynn looked at him and your other question about rhiannon what sort of word was that ceinion sighed it had been a mistake i wish you werent clever sometimes have to be t o keep up in this family she liked the song you think i think everyone liked the song he left it at that both men were still awhile well brynn said finally shes of age but theres no great rush though amren wants to know what to do about owyn and cadyr and this owyn ap glynn isnt the problem neithers amren or ielan in llywerth except if they cling to these feuds that will end us hed spoken with more fire than hed intended the other man stretched out his legs and leaned back unruffled brynn drank wiped his moustache with a sleeve and grinned still riding that horse and i will all my life ceinion didnt smile this time he hesitated then shrugged wanted to change the subject in any case ill tell you something before i tell it to amren in beda but keep it close aeldreds invited me to esferth to join his court brynn sat up abruptly scraping the chair along the floor he swore without apologizing then banged his cup down spilling wine how dare he our high cleric he wants to steal now i said hed invited me not an abduction brynn even so doesnt he have his own jadcursed holy men among the anglcyn rot the man he has a great many and seeks more not cursed i hope ceinion left a pointed little pause from here from ferrieres even from rhodias he is a different sort of king my friend i think he feels his lands are on the way to being safe now which means new ambitions ways of thinking hes arranging to marry a daughter north to rheden he looked steadily at the other man brynn sighed id heard that and if so there goes that rivalry on the other side of the wall which weve relied upon our danger is if we remain the old sort of princes there were three oil lamps burning in the room one set in the wall two brought in for a guest extravagance and respect in the mingling of yellow lamplight brynns gaze was direct now ceinion accepting it felt a wave of memory crash over him from a terrible glorious summer long ago this happened more and more as he grew older past and present colliding simultaneous visions the present seen with the past this same man a quartercentury ago on a battlefield by the sea the volgan himself and the erling force theyd met by their boats there had been three princes among the cyngael that day but brynn had led the centre a full head of dark hair on him then far less bulk less of this easy humour the same man though you changed and you did not change you said hes after clerics from ferrieres picking up the other thing that mattered so he wrote me it starts with clerics doesnt it ceinion gazed affectionately at his old friend sometimes they are notoriously aloof my colleagues across the water but if not if it works opens channels if the anglcyn and ferrieres join to push away the erling raiders on both sides of the strait and mayhap a marriage that way too then the erlings come here again i would think ceinion finished the thought if we remain outside whatever is happening thats my message to beda when i get there he paused then added the thought hed been travelling with there are times when the world changes brynn a silence in the room no noises from the corridor either now the household abed or most of them some of the warband likely dicing in the hall still perhaps with the young cadyri money changing hands by lantern light he didnt think there would be trouble brynns men were extremely well trained and they were hosts tonight the night breeze came through the window sweetened with the scent of flowers gifts of the gods offered world not to be spurned i hate them you know the erlings and the anglcyn both ceinion nodded said nothing what was there to say a homily about jad and love the big man sighed again drained his cup one more time he showed no effects from the unwatered wine will you go to him to aeldred he asked as ceinion had expected i dont know he said which had the virtue of being honest brynn left not down the corridor to his own bedchamber but for one of the outbuildings a young serving lass waiting for him no doubt ready to slip out wrapped in a cloak as soon as she saw him go through the door ceinion knew it was his duty to chastise the other man for this he didnt even consider it had known ap hywll and his wife for too long one of the things about living in and of the world you learned how complex it could be he doused two of the lamps disliking the waste a habit of frugality he left the door a little ajar as a courtesy with brynn outside the lord of the manor would not be his own last visitor of the night hed been here and in ap hywlls other homes before somewhat as an afterthought while he waited he went to his pack and drew from it the letter he was carrying with him northwest to beda on the sea he took the same seat as before by the window no moons tonight the young cadyri princes would have had a good black night for a cattle raid and theyd have been slaughtered bad luck for them that brynn and his men would have been here but you could die of bad luck jad of the sun had allowed him to save lives today a different sort of gift one that might have meaning that went beyond what a man was permitted to see his own prayer every morning was that the god see fit to make use of him there was somethingthere had to be somethingin his arriving when he did looking up the slope seeing movement in the bushes and following for no very good reason besides a knowing that sometimes came to him more than he deserved that gift flawed as he knew he was things he had done in grief and otherwise he turned his head and looked out saw stars through rents in moving clouds caught the scent of the flowers again just outside in the night needful as nights end needful as night two subtle offerings in the triad game then a song improvised as they listened three young people here on the cusp of their real existence the possible importance of their lives and two of them would very likely have been lying dead tonight if hed been a day later on the road or even a few moments he ought to kneel and give thanks again feel a sense of blessing and hope and those things were there truly but they lay underneath something else more undefined a heaviness he felt tired suddenly the years could creep up on you if a day lasted too long he opened the letter again the red broken seal crumbling a little whereas it has for some time been our belief that it is the proper duty of an anointed king under jad to pursue wisdom and teach virtue by example as much as it is our task to strengthen and defend with the lamps doused there wasnt enough light to read by particularly for a man no longer young but he had this committed to memory and was communing with it more than actually considering the contents again the way one might kneel before a familiar image of the god on ones own stone chapel wall or the thought came to him the way one might contemplate the name and stonecarved sun disk over a grave visited so many times it wasnt really seen only apprehended as one lingered one more time until twilight fell and then the dark in the dark from the corridor she knocked softly then entered taking the partially open door for the invitation it was what said enid setting down the tall candle she carried still dressed and not in the bed id hoped youd be waiting for me there he stood up smiling she came forward and they kissed though she was kind enough to let it be a kiss of peace on each cheek and not more than that she wore some sort of perfume he wasnt good at naming these womanscents but it was immediately distracting he was suddenly aware of the bed shed intended that he knew he knew her very well enid looked at the wine cups and the widenecked flask did he leave any for me not much i fear there may be some and water to mix enid shook her head i dont really need she took the seat her husband had so recently vacated to go out with whichever girl had been waiting for him in the softer light she was a presence sitting near to him a scent a memory of other nightsand other kisses of peace when peace had not been what shed left behind when she went away his restraint not hers or even brynns for these two had their own rules in this long marriage and ceinion had years ago been made to understand that his restraint a woman very dear you are tired she said after a moments scrutiny he gets the best of you coming first and then i arrivealways hopingand find a man not worthy of you a man not susceptible to my diminishing charms im getting old ceinion i think my daughter fell in love tonight he took a breath ill say in sequence no and no and perhaps let me work that out he could see she was amused you are finally yielding to me i am not yet old in your sight rhiannon might be in love there was something about enid that always made him want to smile no alas and yes indeed and perhaps she is but the young always are and those of us not young ceinion will you not kiss me it has been a year and more he did hesitate a moment for all the old reasons but then he stood up and came forward to where she sat and kissed her full upon the lips as she lifted her head and despite his genuine fatigue he was aware of the beating of his heart and the swift presence of desire he stepped back read her mischievous expression an instant before she moved a hand and touched his sex through the robe he gasped heard her laugh as she withdrew her touch only exploring ceinion fear me not no matter what you say to be kind there will come a night when i cant excite you any longer one of these visits the night i die he said and meant it she stopped laughing made the sign of the sun disk averting evil or trying to they heard a cry from outdoors through the window as he quickly turned ceinion saw the arc of a thrown and burning brand then he saw horsemen in the farmyard and screaming began alun thought hed seen his brother this way before if not quite like this dai was restless irritable and afraid gryffeth staking out the left side of the justwideenough bed made the mistake of complaining about dais pacing in the dark and received a blisterinducing torrent of profanity in return that wasnt called for alun said dai wheeled on him and alun in the middle of the bed having drawn the short straw stared back at his brothers straining rigid outline through the darkness come to bed get some sleep shell still be here in the morning what are you talking about dai demanded gryffeth unwisely snorted with laughter dai took a step towards him alun actually thought his brother might strike their cousin this anger was the part that wasnt quite as it had been before whenever dai had been preoccupied with a girl that and the fear doesnt matter alun said quickly listen if you cant sleep theres sure to be dicing in the hall just dont take all the money and dont drink too much why are you telling me what to do so we can get some rest alun said mildly go with jad win something dai hesitated a taut form across the room then with another flung distracted curse he jerked the door open and went out wait alun said quietly to gryffeth they waited side by side in the bed the door swung open again dai strode back in crossed to his pack grabbed his purse and went back out now said alun you can call him an idiot hes an idiot gryffeth said with feeling and turned over in bed alun turned the other way determined to try to sleep it didnt happen the tapping at their doorand the womans voice from the corridorcame only moments later it was obvious from heldas expression and her darting glances at rhiannon that she was concerned their young cousin had thrown herself on her bed as soon as the four of them had returned from the hall to her chambers she lay there still in the green belted gown an extravagance of light blazing in the two rooms with meredd away forever now among the daughters of jad rhiannon had claimed the adjoining chamber for the other three women she looked if truth were told genuinely unwell feverish brighteyed without a word spoken the three had resolved to humour her and so nothing had been said in opposition to her immediately voiced demand for all the lights to be lit or the next request either rania had the purest voice in chapel and banquet hall and eirin the best memory theyd gone off to the other room together murmuring and now returned through the connecting doorway eirin smiling rania biting her lip as she always did before singing i wont do very well she said we only heard it once i know rhiannon said unusually mild her voice at odds with her look but try they had no harp here with them rania sang unaccompanied it was well done in truth a different tone given by a womans voice in a quiet toobright room late at night as compared to the same song heard in the hall as the sun was going down when the younger son of owyn ap glynn had given it to them the halls of arberth are dark tonight no moons ride above i will sing a while and be done the night is a hidden stranger an enemy with a sword beasts in field and wood the stars look down on owl and wolf all manner of living creature while men sleep safe behind their walls the halls of arberth are dark tonight no moons ride above i will sing a while and be done the first star is a longedfor promise the deep night a waking dream darkness is a net for the hearts desire the stars look down on lover and loved all manner of delight for some do not sleep in the night the riddle of the darkest hours has ever and always been thus and so it is we can say needful as nights end needful as night by the holy blessed god they are both true the halls of arberth are dark tonight no moons ride above i have sung a while and i am done rania looked down shyly when she finished eirin clapped her hands beaming helda older than the other three sat quietly a faraway look on her face rhiannon said after a moment by the holy blessed god it was unclear whether she was echoing the song or speaking from the heart or whether both of these were true they looked at her what is happening to me rhiannon said in a small voice the others turned to helda who had been married and widowed she said gently you want a man and it is consuming you it passes my dear it really does do you think said rhiannon and none of them would ever have matched this voice to the tones of the one who normally controlled them allthe three of them her sisters all the young women of household and kinthe way her father commanded his warband it might have been amusing it should have been but the change cut too deeply and she looked disturbingly unwell im going to get you wine eirin rose rhiannon shook her head her green cap slipped off i dont need wine yes you do said helda go eirin no said the girl on the bed again that isnt what i need you cant have what you need helda said walking over to the bed amusement in her voice after all eirin a better thought go to the kitchen and have them make an infusion the one for when we cant sleep well all have some she smiled at the other three ten years younger than she was too many men in the house tonight is it too late could we have him come here what the singer helda lifted her eyebrows rhiannon nodded her eyes beseeching it was astonishing she was pleading not giving a command helda considered it she wasnt sleepy at all herself not alone she said finally with his brother and the other cadyri but i dont need the other two rhiannon said a hint of herself again you cant have what you need helda said again rania took a candle and went for the infusion eirin bolder was sent to bring the three men rhiannon sat up in the bed felt her own cheeks with the backs of her hands then rose and went to the window and opened itagainst all the best counselto let the breeze cool her if only a little do i look all right she asked it doesnt matter said helda maddeningly i feel faint i know i never feel this way i know said helda it passes will they be here soon alun dressed at speed and went to find dai in the banquet hall leaving gryffeth in the corridor with the girl and the candle neither of them seemed to mind they could have gone to the womens rooms around the corner and waited there but they didnt seem inclined to do that he carried his harp in its leather case the woman had specifically said that the daughter of brynn ap hywll wanted the singer the brownhaired girl telling him this at the door before gryffeth got out of bed had smiled her eyes catching the candlelight she carried so alun went to get dai found him dicing at a table with two of their own friends and three of the ap hywll men he was relieved to see that dai had a pile of coins in front of him already his older brother was good at dice decisive in betting and calculating and with a wrist flick that let him land the bonesanyones boneson the short side more often than one might expect if he was winning as usual it meant he might not be too badly disturbed after all perhaps one of the others noticed alun in the doorway nudged dai his brother glanced up and alun motioned him over dai hesitated then saw the harp he got up and came across the room it was dark except for lamps on the two tables where men were awake and gaming most of those bedding down here were asleep by now on pallets along the walls the dogs among them what is it dai said his tone was curt alun kept his own voice light hate to take you from winning money from arberthi but weve been invited to the lady rhiannons rooms what i wouldnt make that up dai had gone rigid alun could see it even in the shadows we all of all three of us he hesitated told truth better here than there she um asked for the harp i gather who said that the girl who fetched us a short silence someone laughed loudly at the dicing table someone else swore one of the sleepers along the wall oh jad oh holy jad alun why did you sing that song dai asked almost whispering what said alun genuinely taken aback if you hadnt dai closed his eyes i dont suppose you could say you were sleepy didnt want to get out of bed alun cleared his throat i could he was finding this difficult dai shook his head opened his eyes again no youre already out of bed carrying the harp the girl saw you he swore then to himself more like a prayer than an oath not at alun or anyone else really dai lifted both his hands and laid his fists on aluns shoulders the way he sometimes did lifted them up and brought them down halfway between a blow and an embrace he left them there a moment then he took his hands away you go he said i dont think i am equal to this im going outside dai go said his brother at some limit of control and turned away alun watched him walk across the room unbar the heavy front doors of brynn ap hywlls house open one of them and go out alone into the night someone got up from the gaming table and barred the doors behind him alun saw one of their own band look over at him he gestured and their friend swept up dais purse and winnings for him alun turned away and in that moment he heard his older brother scream an urgent desperate warning from the yard outside the last word he ever heard him speak then the hoofbeats of horses were out there drumming the hard earth and the war cries of the erlings and fire as the night went wild three she is curious and too bold always has been from first awakening under the mound a lingering interest in the other world less fear than the others though irons presence can drain her as easily as any of them tonight there are more mortals than she can remember in the house north of the wood the aura is inescapable no moons to cast a shadow she has come away to see passed a green spruaugh on the way seethed at him to stop his chattering knows he will go now to tell the queen where she is no matter she tells herself they are not forbidden to look the cattle are restless in their pen first thing she knows an awareness of that the lights almost all doused in the house now shining only in one chamber window two and in the big room beyond the heavy doors iron on the doors mortals sleep at night fearfully she feels hooves on the earth west of them her own fear before sight then riders leaping the fence smashing through it into the farmyard below and fire is thrown and iron is drawn is everywhere sharp as death heavy as death she hasnt come for this almost flees to tell the queen the others mays up above unseen flicker in the darkleaved trees brighter and lesser auras all around the farmyard the doors bursting open men running out from house from barn iron to hand in the dark a great deal of noise screaming though she can screen some of that away mortals too loud always they are fighting now a feeling of hotness within her dizziness blood smell in the yard she feels her hair changing colour has seen this before but not here memories long ago trying to cross to where she is she feels ill thinned by the iron below clings to a beech draws sapstrength from that keeps watching cold and shivering now afraid no moons she tells herself again no shadow or flicker of her to be seen unless a mortal has knowledge of her world she watches a black horse rear strike a running man with hooves sees him fall there is fire one of the outbuildings ablaze now a confusion of dark and roiling mortal forms smoke too much blood too much iron then something else comes to her and on the thoughtquick and bright as a firefly over waterbetween her shoulders where they all had wings once she feels a spasm a trembling of excitement like desire she shivers again but differently she spies out more closely the living and the dead in the chaos of that farmyard below and yes yes she knows who died first she can tell he is face down on the churned trampled earth first dead of a moonless night could be theirs if she moves quickly enough has to be fast though his soul fading already very nearly gone even as she watches and such a long time since a mortal in his prime has come to them to the queen her own place in the ride forever changed if she can do this it means going down into that farmyard iron all around horses thundering sensing her afraid their hooves no moons the only time this can be done nothing of her to be seen tells herself that one more time none of them has wings any more or she could fly she lets go of the tree finger by finger and goes forward and down she sees someone on the way he is hurrying up the slope breathing hard he never knows that she is there a faerie passing by he had to get to his sword dai screamed a warning and then he did it again men sprang from pallets roaring seizing weapons the double doors were thrust open the first of their people hurtling into the night alun heard the cries of the erlings brynns warband shouting in reply saw their own men from cadyr rushing out but his own room and his sword were back along the corridor the other way terribly the other way alun ran for all he was worth heart pounding his brothers voice in his ears a fist of fear squeezing his heart when he got to the room gryffethwho knew battle sounds as well as any of themhad already claimed his own blade and leather helm he came forward handed alun his wordlessly alun dropped the harp where they were he unsheathed the sword dropped the scabbard too pushed the helmet down on his head the woman with gryffeth was not wordless and was terrified dear jad there are no guards where we are come hurry alun and gryffeth looked at each other nothing to be said the heart could crack they ran the other way farther down the same dark hallway the brownhaired girl beside them her hand somehow in aluns candle fallen away then north skidding at the halls turning up the far wing to the womens rooms away from the double doors from the fighting in the farmyard from dai the girl pointed breathing in gasps they burst in a woman screamed then saw it was them covered her mouth with the back of a hand backing up against a table alun took a fast look sword out three women here one of them brynns daughter two rooms a connecting door he went straight across to the eastern window which was inexplicably open moved to close the shutters slide down the wooden bar the erling hammer descending splintered wood shattered the sill barely missed breaking aluns extended arm like so much kindling a woman screamed alun stabbed through the wreckage of the window blindly into the dark heard a grunt of pain someone shouted a high warning he twisted hard a wracking movement back and away horse hooves loomed thrust for the splintered window frame smashed it inand then a man hurtled through and into the room gryffeth went for him swearing had his thrust taken by a round shield barely dodged the axe blow that followed the women pressed back screaming alun stepped up beside his cousinthen had to wheel back the other way as a second man came roaring through the window hammer in hand theyd figured it out where the women were erlings here nightmare on a moonless night a night made for an attack but what were they doing so far inland why here it made no sense this was not where the raids came alun swung at the second man had his sword blocked wrenchingly he was bleeding from the splintered wood so was the erling he stepped back shielding the women heard a clattering noise boots behind him and then longedfor words drop weapons there are two of you five of us more coming alun threw a glance back saw one of brynns captains a man almost as big as the erlings jad be thanked for mercy he thought the captain had spoken anglcyn but slowly it was close to the erling tongue hed be understood you may be ransomed brynns man went on if someone cares enough for you touch the women and you die badly and will wish you were dead before you are a mistake those words alun later thought because hearing them the first man moved catquick in a crowded room and he seized rhiannon mer brynnwhose warning had been the one that had drawn alun back from the windowand wrenched her away from the others the erling gripped her in front of him as a shield her arm behind her back twisted high his axe gripped short held to her throat alun caught his breath on a curse one of the other women dropped to her knees the room was crowded with men now smell of sweat and blood mud and muck from the yard they could hear the fighting outside dogs barking frantically the cattle lowing and shifting in their pen someone cried out and then stopped ransom you say the erling grunted he was yellowbearded wearing armour eyes beneath a metal helmet the long nosepiece no not so you drop weapons now or this ones breast is cut off you want to see i dont know who she is but clothing is fine shall i cut brynns captain stepped forward i said drop weapons a silence taut straining aluns mouth was dry as if full of ashes dai was outside dai was outside had been there alone let him do it said rhiannon the daughter of brynn ap hywll let him do it then kill him for me no hear me alun said quickly there are better than fifty fighting men here you will not have so many for a raid your leader made a mistake you are losing out there listen there is nowhere for you to go choose your fate here chose it when we took ship the man rasped ingavin claims his warriors and his warriors kill women cyngael whores they do one of the men behind alun made a strangled sound rhiannon stood the one arm twisted behind her back the axe fretting at her throat fear in her eyes alun saw none in her words then die for this cyngael whore kill him siawn do it the axe gripped close to the blade moved a tear in the highnecked green gown blood at her collarbone dearest jad said the woman on her knees a heartbeat without movement without breath and then the other erling the second man in through the window dropped his shield with a clatter leave her svein ive been taken by them before be a woman for the cyngael if you want the man named svein snarled ingavin waits for me drop weapons or i cut her apart alun looking at pale wild eyes hearing battle madness in the voice laid down his sword slowly there was blood on the girl he saw her staring back at him he was thinking of dai outside that shouted warning before the hooves and fire no weapon at all his heart was crying and there was a need to kill and he was trying to find a space within himself to pray do the same he said to gryffeth without turning his head do not rhiannon said whispering it but very clear gryffeth looked at her and then at alun and then he dropped his blade he will kill her said alun to the men behind him not looking back his eyes were on the girls let his fellows be defeated outside and then we will settle with these two they have nowhere on jads earth to go from here then he will kill her said the man named siawn and he stepped forward still with his sword death in his voice and an old rage the axe moved again another rip in the green a second ribbon of blood against white skin one of the women whimpered not the one being held though she was biting her lip now they stayed like that a moment as long as the one before jad made the world then a hammer was thrown the yellowbearded erling was wearing his iron helmet or his head would have been pulped like a fruit by that blow even so the sound of the impact was sickening at close range in a crowded room the man crumpled like a childs doll stuffed with straw dead before his body disjointed and splayed hit the floor the axe fell harmlessly it seemed to alun that no one in the room breathed for several moments extreme violence could do that he thought this wasnt a battlefield they were too close together such things should happen outdoors not in womens chambers the woman in whose chambers they were standing remained where shed been held motionless the flying hammer had passed near enough to brush her hair both arms were at her sides now and no one was holding an axe to het alun could see two streams of blood on her gown the cuts at throat and collarbone he watched her draw one slow breath her hands were shaking no other sign death had touched her and turned away one might tremble a little he turned away to the erling who had thrown that hammer reddish beard streaked with grey long hair spilling from the helmet bowl not a young man his throw the slightest bit awry would have killed brynns daughter crushing her skull the man looked around at all of them then held out empty hands all men are fools he said in anglcyn they could make it out the gods gave us little wisdom some less than others that man svein angered me i confess we all go to our gods one way or another little profit in hurrying there hed have killed the girl and both of us foolish i will not bring a great deal in ransom but i do yield me to you both and to the lady he looked from alun to siawn behind him and then to rhiannon mer brynn shall i kill him my lady said siawn grimly you could hear the wish in him yes said the brownhaired woman still on her knees the third woman alun saw had just been sick on the far side of the room no said rhiannon her face was bonewhite she still hadnt moved hes yielded saved my life and what do you think he would have done if thered been more of them here the man named siawn asked harshly or fewer of us in the house tonight by jads mercy do you think youd still be clothed and standing alun had had the same thought they were speaking cyngael the erling looked from one of them to the other then he chuckled and answered in their own language heavily accented he had been raiding here before hed said as much she would have been claimed by mikkel who is the only reason we are so far from the ships or by his brother which would have been worse theyd have stripped her and taken her in front of all of us i imagine he looked at alun then theyd have found a bad way to kill her why why that shes just a woman alun needed to leave but also needed to understand and another part of him was afraid to go the world his life might change forever when he went outside as long as he was here in this room this is the house of brynn ap hywll said the erling our guide told us that and so alun asked theyd had a guide he registered that knew the arberthi would as well rhiannon was breathing carefully he saw not looking at anyone had never once screamed he thought only that one warning to him when the horse smashed the window the erling took off his iron helmet his red hair was plastered to his skull hung limply to his shoulders he had a battered brokennosed face mikkel ragnarson leads this raid with his brother one purpose only though i did try to change his mind for those of us who came for our own sakes not his he is the son of ragnar siggurson and grandson of siggur the one we named the volgan this is vengeance oh jad cried the man named siawn oh jad and all the blessed victims brynn was outside when they came lets go alun had already picked up his sword had turned twisted through the others was flying as fast as he could down the corridor for the double doors siawns desperate cry came from behind him brynn ap hywll hadnt been the only one outside he hadnt killed anyone yet the thought came a need was rising with his terror terror went away like smoke on a wind as soon as he was out through the doors and saw what there was to see its passing left behind a kind of hollowness a space not yet filled by anything he had been quite certain in fact from the moment hed heard dais first cry but there was knowing and knowing the attack was over there hadnt been enough of the erlings to cope with brynns warband here and their own cadyri even with the element of surprise it was obviously to have been a raid on an isolated farmhousea large specifically chosen farmhouse but even so this had been meant to kill brynn ap hywll not meet his gathered force someone had erred or had very bad luck hed said that himself inside before hed come running out into the yard to see the body lying here not far from the open doors not far at all he stopped running others were moving all around him they seemed oddly distant vague blurred somehow he stood very still and then with an effort that took a great deal out of him as though his body had become extremely heavy alun went forward again dai hadnt had anything but the knife in his belt when hed gone out but there was an erling sword in his hand now he was face down in the grass and mud a dead raider beside him alun went over to that place where he lay and he knelt in the mud and put down his own blade and took off his helmet and set it down and then after another moment he turned his brother over and looked at him not cheap the selling of his life the lament for seisyth went the one the bards sang at one point or another in the halls of all three provinces during those winter nights when men longed for springs quickening and the blood and souls of the younger ones quickened at the thought of bright known deeds the axe blow that killed dai had fallen from behind and above from horseback alun saw that by the light of the torches moving through the yard now his blood and soul did not quicken he held a maimed body terribly loved the soul was elsewhere he ought to pray now alun thought offer the known proper words he couldnt even remember them he felt old weighted by grief the need to weep but not yet it was not over yet he heard shouting still there was an armed erling in the yard some distance away his back to the door of one of the outbuildings holding a sword to a nearly naked figure in a halfring made by the arberthi warband and aluns own companions still on his knees his brothers head in his lap now blood soaking into his leggings and tunic alun saw that the captive figure was brynn ap hywll being heldin the most savage irony he could imagineexactly as his daughter had been moments before the clerics taught in chapel and text for those who could read that jad of the sun did battle in the night under the world for his children that he was not cruel or capricious as the gods of the pagans were making sport of mortal men you would not have known it tonight riderless horses moving in the yard among the dead servants running after them taking their reins wounded men crying the flames seemed to have been put out except for one shed burning down at the other end of the farmyard nothing near it to be claimed by fire there had been more than fifty fighting men sleeping here tonight with weapons and armour the northmen could not have known or expected that not in a farmhouse bad luck for them the erlings had fled or were taken or were dead except one of them held brynn now with nowhere to go alun wasnt sure what he wanted to do but he was about to do something you go i dont think i am equal to this not the voice the brother hed known all his life and for a very last word a command torn from him go sending alun away at the end and how could that be their last shared moment in the gods world in a life alun had lived with his brother from the time he was born he set dais head gently down and rose from the mud and started over towards that torchlit halfcircle of men someone was speaking he was too far away yet to hear he saw that siawn and gryffeth and the others had come out now the big redbearded erling gripped between two of them he looked over at his cousin and then away gryffeth had seen him kneeling beside dai so he knew he was using his sword for support point down in the earth looked as if he wanted to sink into the dark trampled grass they had grown up together the three of them from childhood not so long ago rhiannon mer brynn was in the yard as well now beside her mother who was standing straight as a rhodian marble column not far from the arc of men gazing at her captive husband through the smoke and flames he saw owyns younger sonowyns only son now a sorrow under jadmoving too quickly towards the other men sword in hand and he understood what was working in him it could be like a poison grief ceinion went forward swiftly at an angle to intercept him a necessary life was still in the balance it was too dark to read faces but you could sometimes tell a mans intention from the way he moved there was death around them in the farmyard and death in the way the young cadyri prince was going forward ceinion spoke almost running calling his name alun kept going ceinion had to catch him lay a hand on the young mans armand received a look that chilled him for his pains remember who you are the cleric snapped deliberately cold and what is happening here i know what happened here said the boyhe was still something of that though his fathers heir as of tonight and there were ripples that might flow from that for all of them princes mattered under jad it is still happening wait and pray that man with the sword is the volgans grandson i thought as much said alun ab owyn a bleakness in his voice that was a sorrow of its own to the cleric hearing it we learned he was leading them inside he drew a breath i need to kill him my lord there were things you were supposed to say to that in the teachings and he knew what they were he had even written some of them what ceinion of llywerth high cleric of the cyngael anchor and emblem of his peoples faith in jad murmured amid the orange flickering of torches and the black smoke was not yet my dear you cant kill him yet soon i hope alun looked at him and after a stiff moment nodded his head once they went forward together into that halfcircle of men and were in time to see what happened there the takenaway sword had struck the tumbled raider first but a second erlings axe from behind and above had killed the cyngael sooner she crouches by the fence until those first two bodies are left alone againthe one who knelt beside one of them standing and walking awayand then not allowing any time for fear to take hold of her she goes straight in at speed and claims a soul for the queen a moonless night only on a moonless night once it was otherwise and easier but once also they were able to fly she lays hands on the body and speaks the words they are all taught says them for the first time andyes there she sees his soul rise from blood and earth to her summoning it hovers turning drifting in a stray breath of wind she exults fiercely aroused her hair changing colour again and then again body tingling with excitement even amid the fear of shod hooves and the presence of iron which is weakening and can kill her she watches the soul shes claimed for the ride float above the sprawled slain mortal body and she sees it turn to go uncertain insubstantial not entirely present yet in her world though that will come it will come she didnt expect to feel so much desire this isnt hers though this is for the queen he turns completely around in the air moves upwards then comes slowly back down touches ground already gathering form again he looks towards her sees doesnt seenot quite yetand then to the south he turns and begins to go pulled towards the wood as if to a halfremembered home he will reach them in the forest soon taking surer stronger form as he goes a shape in their world now and the queen will see him when he arrives and will love him as a precious gift shining by water and wood and in the mound and she herself when she rejoins the others will be touched by the glory of doing this as silver moonlight touches and lights pools in the night no moons tonight a gift she has been given this mortal death in the dark and so beautiful she looks around sees no one near goes out then from that farmyard from iron and mortals living and dead springing over the fence up the slope stronger as she leaves blades and armour behind she pauses at the crest of the ridge to look back down she always looks when near to them drawn to this other mortal half of the world it happens among the ride she isnt the only one there are stories told the auras below are brighter than torches for her anger grief fear she finds all of these takes them in tries to distill them and comprehend she looks down from the same beech tree as before fingers upon it as before two very big men in the midst of a ring one holding iron to the other who came bursting out of the small structure roaring for a weapon it frightened her the red heat in that voice but he was seen by the raider before his own men could reach him and pinned by a sword to the wall not killed she was not sure why at first but now she sees or thinks she does other men arrive freeze like carvings then more come gather and are there now like stone torchlight around two men one of the two is afraid but not the one she would have thought she doesnt understand mortals well at all another world they live in it is quiet now the battle over except for this and one other thing they will not know down below she listens has always liked to listen and watch trying to understand understand me the erling said again in his own tongue i kill him if anyone moves then do it snapped brynn ap hywll he was barefoot in the grass only a grey undertunic covering his belly and heavy thighs another man would have looked ridiculous ceinion thought not brynn even with a sword to him and the erlings left hand bunching his tunic tightly from behind i want a horse and an oath to your god that i will be allowed passage to our ships swear it or he dies the voice was high almost shrill one horse pahl a dozen men you led are standing here you stain the earth with your breathing brynn was quivering with rage twelve horses i want twelve horses or he dies brynn roared again no one swear that oath no one dare i will kill him the erling screamed his hands were shaking ceinion saw i am the grandson of siggur volganson then do it brynn howled back you castrate coward do it no said ceinion he stepped forward into the ring of light no my friend be silent in jads name you do not have permission to leave us ceinion dont swear that oath do not i will swear it you are needed he wont do it hes a coward kill me and die with me erling go to your gods your grandfather would have gutted me like a fish by now hed have ripped me open there was a whitehot spitting fury in his voice near to madness you killed him the erling snarled i did i did i chopped off his arms and cut his chest open and ate his bloody heart and laughed so carve me now and let them do the same to you ceinion closed his eyes opened them this must not be erling hear me i am high cleric of the cyngael hear me i swear by holiest jad of the sun no roared brynn ceinion i forbid that no harm will come to you when you release no this man and that you will be allowed the small door to the outbuildingit was the brewhouse banged open right behind the two men the erling startled like a nervous horse looked frantically back over his shoulder swore died brynn ap hywll in the moment his captor half turned hammered an elbow viciously backwards and up into the other mans unprotected face beneath the nosepiece smashing his mouth open he twisted hard away from the sword thrust that followed it raked blood from his side no more than that he stepped back quickly turned here ceinion saw a sword arcing through the torchlight something beautiful in that flight something terrible alun ab owyns blade was caught by brynn at the hilt ceinion saw his old friend smile then a grey wolf in winter at the cadyri prince who had thrown it i ate his heart he hadnt might have done though the way hed been that day ceinion remembered that fightagainst this ones grandfather a meeting of giants crashing together on a bloodslick morning battlefield by the sea in battle this fury happened to brynn the way it did to the erlings of ingavins bear cult a madness of war claiming a soul if you became what you fought what were you not the night for that thought not here good men dead in the dark farmyard he swore an oath the erling bubbled spitting teeth blood in the broken mouth jad curse you said brynn my people died here and my guests rot your ugly soul he moved barefoot halfnaked the cadyri blade in his hand flicked right the erling moved to block it the younger man wore armour was big rangy in his prime had been the annihilating backhand blow swept down like a falling of rocks from a mountain height crashing through his late parry biting so deeply into his neck between helmet and breastplate that brynn had to plant a foot on the fallen man after to lever and jerk it out he stood back looked around slowly flexing his neck and shoulder muscles a bear in a circle of fire no one moved or said a word brynn shook his head as if to clear it to release fury come back to himself he turned to the door of the brewhouse a girl stood there in an unbelted tunic flushing in the torchlight her dark hair loose for bed for being bedded brynn looked at her that was bravely done he said quietly let all men know it she bit at her lower lip was trembling ceinion was careful not to look to where enid stood beside her daughter brynn turned around took a step towards him then another stopped squarely in front of the cleric feet planted wide on his own soil id never have forgiven you he said after a moment ceinion met that gaze youd have been alive to not forgive me i spoke truth you do not have leave to go from us you are needed still brynn was breathing hard the coursing rage not yet gone from him the big chest heaving not from exertion but from the force of his anger he looked at the young cadyri behind ceinion gestured with the blade i thank you for this he said you were quicker than my own men owyns son said no thanks need be at least my sword is blooded though by another i did nothing at all tonight but play a harp brynn looked down at him a moment from his great height he was bleeding from the right side ceinion saw the tunic ripped open there he didnt seem aware of it brynn glanced away into the shadows of the farmyard west of them the cattle were still lowing on the other side in their pen your brothers dead alun nodded his head stiffly shame upon my life said brynn ap hywll this was a guest in my house alun made no reply his own breathing was shallow by contrast constricted ceinion thought that he needed to be given wine urgently oblivion for a night prayer could come after in the morning with the gods light brynn bent down wiped both sides of the blade on the black grass handed it back to alun he turned towards the brewhouse i need clothing he said all of you we will deal with he stopped seeing his wife in front of him we will deal with the dead and do what we can for the wounded enid said crisply there will be ale for the living who were so valiant here she looked over her shoulder rhiannon have the kitchen heat water and prepare cloths for wounds fetch all my herbs and medications you know where they are all of the women are to come to the hall she turned back to her husband and you my lord will apologize tonight and tomorrow and the next day to kara here you likely gave her the fright of a young life more than any erling would have when she came to fetch ale for those still dicing and found you sleeping in the brewhouse if you want a nights sleep outside the doors my lord choose another place next time if we have guests ceinion loved her even more then than he had before not the only one he saw brynn bent down and kissed his wife on the cheek we hear and obey you my lady he said you are bleeding like a fat speared boar she said have yourself attended to am i permitted the slight dignity of trousers and boots first he asked please someone laughed a release of strain someone else moved very fast siawn a little tardy cried out following but the redbearded erling had torn free of those holding him and seizing a shield from one of themnot a swordcrashed through the ring around brynn and his wife he turned away from them looking up and south raised the shield siawn hesitated confused ceinion wheeled towards the slope and the trees saw nothing at all in the black night then he heard an arrow strike the lifted shield there he goes said the erling speaking cyngael very clearly he was pointing ceinion whose eyes were good saw nothing but alun ab owyn shouted i see him same ridge we were on today heading down the other way dont touch the arrow ceinion heard he spun back the big erling not a young man grey in his hair and beard set down the shield carefully not even the shaft mind poison it was brynn always you know who it was then ivarr this ones brother he jerked his head towards the one on the ground blacksouled from birth and a coward this one was brave brynn snarled it he was here with a sword said the erling the other one uses arrows and poison and erlings should be much too brave to do that brynn said icily cant rape a woman with a bow and arrow yes you can said the erling quietly meeting his gaze brynn took a step towards him he saved your life ceinion said quickly or enids buying his own brynn snapped the erling actually laughed theres that he said trying to at any rate ask someone what happened inside but before that could be done they heard another sound drumming hooves an erling horse thundered through the yard leaped the fence ceinion seeing the rider cried out after him hopelessly alun ab owyn pursuing a foe he was unlikely ever to see or find disappeared almost immediately on the dark path that curved around the ridge siawn said brynn six men follow him a horse for me cried ceinion that is the heir of cadyr brynn i know it is he wants to kill someone or be killed said the redbearded erling watching with interest the archer had a considerable start and poison on his arrows it was pitch black on the path among the trees alun had no knowledge of the erling horse hed seized and mounted and the horse wouldnt know the woods at all he cleared the fence landed kicked the animal ahead they pounded up the path he had a sword no helmet on the ground in mud beside dai no torch felt a degree of unconcern he couldnt ever remember in himself before a branch over the path struck his left shoulder rocked him in the saddle he grunted with pain he was doing something entirely mad knew it he was also thinking as fast as he could the archer would come out and down from the slopealmost certainlyat the place they had reached earlier today with ceinion the erling was fleeing would have a horse waiting for him would anticipate pursuit and head back into the trees not straight along the path to the main trail west alan lashed the horse around a curve he was going too fast it was entirely possible that a stump or boulder would break the animals leg send alun flying crack his neck he flattened himself over the mane and felt the wind of another branch pass over his head there was a body behind him on the churnedup earth of a farmyard far from home he thought of his mother and father another blackness there darker than this night he rode the only good thing about the moonless sky was that the archer would have trouble finding his way tooand seeing alun clearly if he came close enough for a bowshot alun reached the forking trail where the slope came out on the path southwest remembered only this afternoon climbing up with dai and then both of them coming down with the high cleric he drew a breath and left the path right there not hesitating plunging into the woods it was impossible almost immediately swearing he pulled the horse to a stop and listened in blackness heardblessed be jada sound through leaves not far ahead it could be an animal he didnt think it was he twitched the reins moved the horse forward carefully now picking his way sword out a semblance of a trail no more than that his eyes were adjusting but there was no light at all an arrow would kill him easily he dismounted on that thought looped the reins around a tree trunk his hair was slick with sweat he heard sounds againsomething ahead of him it wasnt an animal someone unused to being silent in a forest an unknown wood far from the sea amid the terror of pursuit a raid having gone entirely wrong alun gripped his sword and followed he came upon the four erlings too quickly before he was ready for them stumbling through beech trees into a sudden small space seeing them there shadowstwo kneeling to catch their breath one slumped against a tree the fourth directly in front of him facing the other way alun killed that one from behind kept moving slashed away the sword of the one leaning by the tree gripped him and turned him with an arm twisted behind his back snarled drop blades both of you to the kneeling pair a triad he thought suddenly remembering rhiannon held then brynn third time tonight the thought was urgent swordswift he remembered what had happened to the other two men who had held their captives this way and even as the thought came he broke the pattern he killed the man he was using as a shield pushing him hard away to fall on the earth and he stood alone to face two erlings in a clearing in a wood he had never actually killed before two now in moments come on he screamed at the pair before him both bigger than him hardened searaiders he saw the nearer ones head jerk suddenly looking past alun and without any actual thought alun dove to his right the arrow from behind flew past him and hit the erling in the sword arm ivarr no the man screamed alun rolled scrambled up turned his back on the two of them sprinting immediately east into the thicket where the bowman would be he heard him running through to the other side then mounting up the horse was there he wheeled back running hard swearing savagely the fourth of those hed surprised here was running the other way towards the path the wounded man was on his knees clutching the arrow in his arm making small queer sounds he was as good as dead they both knew it poison on the arrowhead the shaft alun ignored him pushed through to his horse clawed free the reins mounted forced his way back through the trees and then the clearing again to the other side he could still hear the archers horse ahead of them that rider swearing too fighting to find a path through in thick treed blackness he felt a surging in his blood fury and hardness and pain his sword was red his own doing this time it didnt help it didnt help he broke through the horse thrashing into open space saw water a pool in the wood the other rider going around it to the south alun roared wordlessly galloped the erling horse into the shallow water splashing through at an angle to shorten the way cut off the other man he was almost thrown over the animals head as it halted stifflegged it reared straight back up neighing clawing at the air in terror and then it came down and did not move at all as if anchored so firmly it might never stir again the entirely unexpected will elicit very different responses in people and the sudden intrusion of the numinousthe vision utterly outside ones range of experiencewill exaggerate this of course one person will be terrified into denial another will shiver in delight at a making manifest of dreams held close for a lifetime a third might assume himself intoxicated or bewitched those who ground their lives in a firm set of beliefs about the nature of the world are particularly vulnerable to such moments though not without exception someone wholike owyns younger son that nighthad already had his life broken into shards who was exposed and raw as a wound might be said to have been ready for confirmation that hed never properly understood the world we are not constant in our lives or our responses to our lives there are moments when this becomes clear aluns foot came out of one stirrup when the horse reared he clutched at the animals neck fought to stay in the saddle barely did so as the hooves splashed down hard his sword fell into the shallow water he swore again tried to make the horse move could not he heard music turned his head saw a growing inexplicable presence of light pale as moonrise but there were no moons tonight then as the music grew louder approaching alun ab owyn saw what was passing by him walking and riding on the surface of that water in bright procession the light a shimmering around them and in them and everything about the night and the world changed then was silvered because they were faeries and he could see them he closed his eyes opened them again they were still there his heart was pounding as if trying to break free of his breast he was trammelled entangled as in nets between the desperate need to flee from the unholy jadcursed demons these must beby all the teachings of his faithand the impulse to dismount and kneel in the water of this starlit pool before the very tall slender figure he saw on an open litter borne in the midst of the dancing of them all with her pale garments and nearly white skin and her hair that kept changing its colour in the silvered light that grew brighter as they passed the music louder now wild as his hearts beating there was a constriction in his chest he had to remind himself to breathe if these were evil spirits iron would keep them at bay so the old tales promised hed dropped his sword in the water it occurred to him that he ought to make the sign of the sun disk and with that thought he realized that he couldnt he couldnt move his hands on the horses reins the horse rooted in the shallows of the pool the two of them breathing statues watching what was passing by and in that growing spiritshaped brightness in the depths of a moonless wood at night alun saw for the first timethat the saddle cloth of the erling horse he rode bore the pagan hammer symbol of ingavin and then looking at that queen againfor who else could this possibly be borne across still waters shining beautiful as hope or memory alun saw someone next to her riding a small highstepping mare with bells and bright ribbons in its mane and there came a harder pounding like a killing hammer against his wounded heart he opened his mouthhe could do thatand he began to shout against the music struggling more and more wildly to move arms or legs to dismount to go there he was unable to do anything at all couldnt stir from where he and the horse were rooted as his brother rode past him changed utterly and not changed at all dead in the farmyard below them and riding across night waters here not seeing alun or hearing him one hand extended and claimed laced in the long white fingers of the faerie queen siawn and his men knew exactly where they were going heading up the slope they also had torches ceinion though he preferred to walk had been riding all his life they came to the place where the trail from the ridge met the path stopped there the horses stamping the cleric though much the oldest was the first to hear sounds pointed into the woods siawn led them there cutting a little north of where alun had tried to force his way through there were nine of them the other young cadyri gryffeth ap ludh had joined them fighting sorrow they found the two dead erlings and a dying one almost immediately siawn leaned over in his saddle and killed the wounded man with his sword hed needed to do that ceinion thought brynns captain had come into the yard too late after the fighting was done the cleric said nothing there were teachings against this but this wood tonight was not the place for them by the light of their smoking torches they saw signs of passage through the far side of that small glade they went straight through and out the other side and so came to the wider clearing the pool of water under stars stopped then all of them without words it became very quiet even the horses the man next to ceinion made the sign of the sun disk the cleric a little belatedly did the same pools in the wood wells oak groves mounds the halfworld the pagan places that had once been holy before the cyngael had come to jad or the god had come to them in their valleys and hills these forest pools were his enemies and ceinion knew it the first clerics arriving from batiara and ferrieres had chanted stern invocations reading from the liturgy beside such waters as this casting out all presence of false spirits and old magics or trying to people might kneel today in stone chapels of the god and go straight from them to seek their future from a wise woman using mouse bones or drop an offering in a well or into a pool by moonlight or under stars lets go ceinion said this is just water just a wood no it isnt my lord said the man beside him respectfully but firmly the one who had made the sign hes here look and only then did ceinion see the boy on his horse motionless in the water and understand dear jad said one of the others he went into the pool no moons said another a moonless nightlook at him do you hear music said siawn abruptly listen we do not said ceinion of llywerth fiercely his heart beating fast now look at him siawn repeated hes trapped cant even move the horses were restive now agitated by their riders or by something else tossing their heads of course he can move said the cleric and swung down from his mount and went forward striding hard a man used to woods and nights and swift decisive movement no cried a voice from behind him my lord do not that he ignored there were souls here to save and defend his entrusted task for so long he heard an owl cry hunting a normal sound proper in a night wood part of the order of things men feared the unknown and so the dark jad was light in his being an answer to demons and spirits shelter for his children he spoke a swift prayer and went straight into the pool splashing through the shallows calling the young princes name the boy didnt even turn his head ceinion came up beside him and in the darkness he saw that alun ab owyns mouth was wide open as though he was trying to speakor shout he caught his breath and then terribly there was the sound of music very faint it seemed to ceinion ahead of them and to the right horns and flutes stringed instruments bells moving across the unrippled stillness of the water he looked saw nothing there ceinion spoke jads holy name he signed the disk and seized the reins of the erling horse it wouldnt move he didnt want the others to see him struggling with the animal their souls their belief were in danger here he reached up with both arms and pulled owyns son unresisting from the saddle he threw the young man over one shoulder and carried him splashing and staggering almost falling out of the pool and he laid him down on the dark grass at the waters edge then he knelt beside him touched the disk about his throat and prayed after a moment alun ab owyn blinked he shook his head drew a breath and then closed his eyes which was a curious relief because what ceinion saw in his face even in the darkness was harrowing eyes still closed voice low utterly uninflected the young cadyri said i saw him my brother there were faeries and he was there you did not ceinion said firmly clearly you are grieving my child and in a strange place and you have just killed someone i believe your mind was overswayed it happens son of owyn i know it happens we long for those we have lost we see them everywhere believe me sunrise and the god will set you right on this i saw him alun repeated no emphasis the quiet more unsettling than fervour or insistence would have been he opened his eyes looking up at ceinion you know that is heresy lad i do not want i saw him ceinion looked over his shoulder the others had remained where they were watching too far away to hear the pool was still as glass no wind in the glade nothing that could be taken for music now he must have imagined it himself would never claim to be immune to the strangeness of a place like this and he had a memory of his own pushed hard away always of another place like this he was aware of the shapes of power the weight of the past he was a fallible man always had been struggling to be virtuous in times that made it hard he heard the owl again far side of the water now ceinion looked up stars overhead in the bowl of sky between trees the erling horse shook its head snorted loudly and walked placidly out of the pond by itself it lowered its head to crop the black grass beside them ceinion watched it for a moment the utter ordinariness he looked back at the boy took a deep breath come lad he said will you pray with me at brynns chapel of course said alun ab owyn almost too calmly he sat up and then stood without aid then he walked straight back into the pool ceinion half lifted a hand in protest then saw the boy bend down and pick up a sword from the shallows alun walked back out theyve gone you see he said they returned to the others leading the erling horse two of brynns men made the sign of the disk as they came up eyeing the cadyri prince warily gryffeth ap ludh dismounted and embraced his cousin alun returned the gesture briefly ceinion watched him his brow knit the two cadyri and i will go back to brynnfell he said two of them escaped from me alun said looking up at siawn the one with the bow ivarr well catch him said siawn quietly he went south around the water owyns son said pointing probably double back west he seemed composed grave even too much so in fact the cousin was weeping ceinion felt a needle of fear well catch him siawn repeated and cantered off giving the pool a wide berth his men following certainty can be misplaced even when there is fair cause for it they didnt in fact catch him a man on a goodenough horse in darkness which made tracking hard some days later word would come to brynnfell of two people killed by arrowsa farm labourer and a young girlin the thinly populated valley between them and the sea both the man and the girl had been bloodeagled which was an abomination nor would anyone ever find the erling ships moored jad alone knew where along the wild and rocky coastline to the west the god might indeed know but he didnt always confide such things to his mortal children doing what they could to serve him in a dark and savage world four rhiannon had known since childhood not yet so far behind her that her fathers importance did not emerge from court manners and courtly wit brynn ap hywll had achieved power and renown by killing men anglcyn and erling and on more than one occasion those from the provinces of cadyr and llywerth in the lengthy intervals between brief truces among the cyngael jads a warrior was his blunt response to a sequence of clerics whod joined his household and then attempted to instill a gentler piety in the battlescarred leader of the hywll line nonetheless whatever she might have known from harp song and meadhall tale his daughter had never seen her father kill until tonight until the moment when he had slashed a thrown and caught sword deep into the erling whod been trying to bargain his way to freedom it hadnt disturbed her watching the man die that was a surprise she had discovered it about herself seeing the sword of alun ab owyn in her fathers thick hands come down on the erling she wondered if it was a bad even an impious thing that she didnt recoil from what she saw and heard strangled bubbling cry blood bursting a man falling like a sack it gave her in truth a measure of satisfaction she knew that she ought properly to atone for that in chapel she had no intention of doing so there were two gashes on her throat and neck from an erling axe there was blood on her body and on her green gown she had been expecting to die in her own chambers tonight had told siawn and his men to let the erling kill her she could still hear herself speaking those words resolute then shed had to conceal shaking hands after had accordingly little sympathy to spare for erling raiders when they were slain and that applied to the five her father ordered executed when it became evident they were not going to bring any ransom they were dispatched where they stood in the torchlit yard no words spoken no ceremony pause for prayer five living men five dead men in the time one might lift and drink a cup of wine brynns men began walking around the yard with torches killing those erlings who lay on the ground wounded not yet dead they had come to raid take slaves rape and kill the way they always came a message needed to be sent endlessly the cyngael might not worship gods of storm and sword or believe in an afterworld of endless battle but they could besome of them could beas bloody and as ruthless as an erling when need was she was still outside when her father spoke to the older redbearded raider brynn walked up to the man held again between two of their people more tightly than before he had broken free onceand saved brynn from an arrow her father rhiannon realized was dealing with a great anger because of that how many of you were here brynn bit off the words speaking quietly he was never quiet she thought thirty a few more no hesitation the man was almost as big as her father rhiannon saw and of an age as many left behind forty to guard the ships take them off the coast if necessary two ships three we had some horses to come inland brynn had dressed by now was holding his own sword though there was no need for it he began to pace as they spoke the redbearded erling watched his movements standing between two men they were gripping his arms tightly rhiannon saw she was certain her father was going to kill him you rode straight for this farmhouse yes that was the idea if we could find it how did you find it captured a shepherd and he is dead said the erling i can take you to him if you want you expected this house to be undefended the man smiled a little then and shook his head not defended by your warband certainly young leaders they made a mistake you werent one of them the other man shook his head the one who held me brought you here of the line of the volgan the erling nodded elder grandson brynn had stopped in front of him again younger ivarrs the elder but he didnt lead the man shook his head yes and no it was his idea but ivarrs different brynn was stabbing his blade into the earth now you came to burn this farm and kill you and any of your family here yes he was so calm rhiannon thought had he made his peace with dying she didnt think that was it hed surrendered said he didnt want to be killed back in her chamber because of the grandfather the man nodded your killing him taking the sword these two decided they were of an age to avenge it since their father had not they were wrong and why are you here youre as old as i am first hesitation in the silence rhiannon could hear the horses and the crackle of torches nothing to keep me in vinmark i made a mistake too part of an answer rhiannon thought listening closely brynn was staring at him coming or before you came another pause both theres no ransom for you is there no the man said frankly once there might have been brynns gaze was steady maybe were you ransomed last time you were taken here or did you escape again a silence escaped the erling admitted he had decided rhiannon realized that there was no hope in anything but honesty brynn was nodding i thought so i believe i remember you the red hair you did raid with volganson didnt you you escaped east twentyfive years ago after he died through the hills all the way to the erling settlements on the east coast they chased you didnt they you used a cleric as hostage if i remember a murmur from those listening i did i released him he was a decent enough man brynns voice altered slightly that was a long way to go by ingavins blind eye i wouldnt want to do it again the erling said dryly another silence brynn resumed his pacing theres no ransom for you what can you offer me a hammer sworn loyalty until you escape again i said i wouldnt do it again that journey i was young then he looked down and away for the first time then back up i have nothing to go home to and this place is as good as any for me to end my days you can make me a slave to dig ditches or carry water or use me more wisely but i will not escape again you will take the oath and come to the faith of jad another slight smile torchlight upon him i did that last time brynn didnt return the smile and recanted last time i was young im not any more neither ingavin nor your sun god are worth dying for in my judgement i suppose i am a heretic to two faiths kill me brynn was standing still again in front of him where are the ships you will guide us to them the erling shook his head not that rhiannon saw her fathers expression he wasnt normally someone she feared yes that erling this is the price of being allowed to live it is you spoke of loyalty prove it the erling was still a moment considering torches moved in the yard around them men were being carried inside or helped if they could walk best kill me then the redbearded man said if i must said brynn no said someone else stepping forward i will take him as a man of mine my own guard rhiannon turned her mouth falling open let me be clear on this her mother went on coming to stand beside her husband looking at the erling rhiannon hadnt realized she was even with them i believe i understand you would fight an erling band that came upon us now but will not reveal where your fellows are the erling looked at her thank you my lady he said certain things done for life make the life unworthy you become sick with them they poison you your thoughts he turned back to brynn they were shipmates he said brynns gaze held that of the erling another moment then he looked to his wife you trust him enid nodded her head he was still frowning he can easily be killed i will do it myself i know you will you want to leave him to me let us get to our work there are wounded men here erling what is your name whatever name you give me the man said the lady enid swore it was startling what is your name she repeated a last hesitation then that wry expression again forgive me my mother named me thorkell i answer to it rhiannon watched the erling go with her mother hed said before in her rooms that he could be ransomed a lie it now emerged from the look of himan old man still raidinghelda had said she doubted it helda was older knew more about these things she was the calmest of them too had helped rhiannon simply by being that way they had almost died they could have died tonight the one named thorkell had saved her father and herself both rhiannon hands steady as she gathered linens and carried heated water with helda for the wounded in the hall remembered the wind of that hammer flying past her face realizedalreadythat she would likely do so all her life carrying the memory like the two scars on her throat tonight the world had altered very greatly because there was also the other thing which ought to have been pushed away or buried deep or lost in all the bloodshed but wasnt alun ab owyn had ridden an erling horse out of the yard pursuing the archer whod shot at her father he hadnt yet come back brynn ordered a pit to be dug in the morning beyond the cattle pen and the bodies of the slain raiders shovelled in their own deadnine so far including dai ab owynhad been taken into the room attached to the chapel to be cleansed and clothed laid out for the rituals of burial womans work after battle when it could be done rhiannon had never performed these rites before they had never been attacked at home before not in her lifetime they didnt live near the sea they tended the wounded in the banquet hall the dead in the room by the chapel lights burning through brynnfell her mother stopped by her once long enough to look at her neck and then lay a salvebriskly expressionlesslyand wrap the two wounds with a linen cloth you wont die she said and moved on rhiannon knew that she would never now be sung for a pure white swanlike neck either no matter no matter at all she carried on following her mother enid knew what to do here as in so many things rhiannon helped as best she could bathing and wrapping wounds speaking comfort and praise fetching ale with the servant girls for the thirsty one man died on a table in their hall as they watched a sword had taken off most of one leg at the thigh they couldnt stop the bleeding his name was bregon hed liked fishing teasing the girls had freckles on his nose and cheeks in summer rhiannon found herself weeping which she didnt want but couldnt seem to do much about not very long ago when tonight had begun there had been a feast and music if jad had shaped the world differently time could run backwards and make it so the erlings had never come she kept moving a hand touching the cloth around her neck she wanted to stop doing that too but couldnt four men carried bregon ap moran from the hall on a table board out the doors and across the yard to the room by the chapel where the dead men were she looked at helda and they followed he used to make jokes about her hair rhiannon remembered called her crow when she was younger brynns men had not been shy with his children though that had changed when she came into womanhood as did much else she would lay him out for burialwith heldas help for she didnt know what to do there were half a dozen women in the room working among the dead by lantern light the cleric cefan was kneeling with a sun disk between his hands unsteadily intoning the ritual words of the night passage he was young visibly shaken how could he not be rhiannon thought they set bregons board down on the floor the tables were covered with other bodies already there was water and linen clothing they had to wash the dead first everywhere comb out their hair and beards clean their fingernails that they might go to jad fit to enter his halls if the god in mercy allowed she knew every man lying here helda began removing bregons tunic it was stiff with blood rhiannon went to get a knife to help her cut it away but then she saw that there was no one by dai ab owyn and she went and stood over the cadyri prince where he lay time didnt run backwards in the world they had rhiannon looked down at him and she knew it would be a lie to pretend she hadnt seen him staring at her when shed walked into the hall and another lie to say it was the first time something of that sort had happened and a third one a failing of the cyngael threes all the time to deny that shed enjoyed having that effect on men the passage from girl to woman being negotiated in pleasure an awareness of growing power no pleasure now no power that meant anything at all she knelt beside him on the stone floor and reached out and brushed his brown hair back a handsome clever man needful as nights end he had said no ending to night now unless the god allowed it for his soul she looked at the wound in him the dark blood clotted there it occurred to her that it was proper that brynns daughter be the one to attend to a prince of cadyr their guest cefan not far away was still chanting his eyes closed his voice wavering away from him like the smoke from the candles rising up the women whispered or were silent moving back and forth doing their tasks rhiannon swallowed hard and began to undress the dead man what are you doing shed thought actually that she would know if he came into a room that already she would know when that happened she turned and looked up my lord prince she said rose and stood before him saw the cousin gryffeth and the high priest behind his face grave uneasy what are you doing alun ab owyn repeated his expression was rigid walled off i am attending to his body my lord for laying out she heard herself stammering she never did that not you he said flatly someone else she swallowed had never lacked courage even as a child why so she said you dare ask behind ceinion made a small sound and a gesture then stood still i must ask rhiannon said i know of nothing i might ever have done to owyns house to cause this to be said i grieve for our people and for your sorrow he stared at her it was difficult in this light to see his eyes but she had seen them in the hall before do you he said finally blunt as a hammer she couldnt stop thinking of hammers do you even begin to grieve my brother went outside alone and unarmed because of you he died hating me because of you i will live with that the rest of my days do you realize this at all there was something hot like a fever coming off him now she said desperately i believe i understand what you are saying it is unjust i didnt make him feel a lie you wanted to make every man love you to play at it a game her heart was pounding now you are unjust my lord repeating herself unjust you tested that power every time you entered a room how do you know any such thing how did he know will you deny it she was grieving her heart twisting because of who it was saying these words to her but she was also brynns daughter and enids and not raised to yield or to cry and you she asked lifting her head her bandage chafed you my lord never tested yourself never went on cattle raids son of owyn into arberth perhaps never had someone hurt or die when you did that you and your brother she saw him check breathing hard she was aware that he was amazingly near to striking her how had the world come to this the cousin stepped forward as if to stop him it is wrong was all alun could manage to say fighting for selfcontrol no more than the things a boy does becoming a man i cannot steal cattle or swing a sword ab owyn then go east to sarantium he rasped his voice altered if you want to deal in power like that learn learn how to poison like their empresses youll kill so many more men she felt the colour leave her face the others in the room had stopped moving were looking at them do you hate me so much my lord he didnt reply she had thought truly he would say yes had no idea what shed have done if he did so she swallowed hard needed her mother suddenly enid was with the living in the other room she said would you wish the erling hadnt thrown his hammer to save my life her voice was level hands steady at her sides small blessings he wouldnt know how much this cost her others died here my lord prince nine of us now likely more before sunrise men we knew and loved are you thinking only of your brother tonight like the erling my father killed who demanded one horse when he had men taken with him his head snapped back as from a blow he opened his mouth closed it without speaking their eyes locked then turning blundering past the cleric and his cousin he rushed from the room ceinion called his name alun never broke stride rhiannon put a hand to her mouth there was a need to weep and a greater need not to do so she saw the cousin gryffeth take two steps towards the door then stop and turn back after a moment he went and knelt beside the dead man she saw him extend a hand and touch the place where the blade had gone in child whispered the high cleric her fathers friend her mothers she didnt look at him she was staring instead at the open doorway the emptiness of it where someone had gone out had walked into the night hating herthe way hed said his brother had left him a pattern set and sealed with iron and blood you cant have what you want helda had said even before everything else how did this happen she asked of the cleric of the world holy men usually spoke of the mysterious ways of the god i do not know ceinion of llywerth murmured instead youre supposed to know she said turning to look at him heard her voice break hated that he stepped forward drew her into his arms she let him lowered her head didnt weep at first and then she did heard the cousin praying over the body on the floor beside them three things not well or wisely done the triad went approaching a forest pool by night making wrathful a woman of spirit drinking unwatered wine alone they did things by threes in this land alun thought savagely obviously it was time for him to claim one of the wine jars and carry it off drain it by himself until oblivion came down he wished in that moment striding through the empty farmyard without the least idea where he meant to go that the erling arrow had killed him in the wood the world was unassuageably awry his heart had a hollow inside it where dai had been it was not going to fill there was nothing to fill it with he saw a glimmering of light on the treed slope beyond the yard not a torch it was pale motionless no flickering he found himself breathing shallowly as if he were hiding from searchers he squeezed shut his eyes the glow was still there when he opened them there was no one else in the farmyard now a spring night the breeze mild dawn a long way off still the stars brilliant overhead in patterns that told their stories of ancient glory and pain figures from before the faith of jad came north mortals and animals gods and demigods the night seemed heavy and endless like something into which one fell a shining on the slope alun undid his belt let fall his sword walked through the gate of the yard and up the hill she sees him drop the iron knows what that means he can see her now he has been in the pool with them for some of them after that the faeries can be seen her impulse very strong is to flee it is one thing to hover near to watch them unseen this is something else she makes herself stay where she is waiting has a sudden fearful thought scans with her minds eye the spruaugh who might tell of this is curled asleep in the hollow of a tree the man comes through the gate closes it behind him begins to climb the slope he can see her she almost does fly away then though they cant really fly not any more she is trembling her hair shivers through its colours again and again she was smaller than the queen half a head smaller than he was alun stopped just below where she stood they were beside the thicket on the mostly open slope shed been half hidden behind a sapling came out when he stopped but touching it utterly still poised for flight a faerie standing before him in the world hed thought hed known she was slender very long fingers pale skin wideset eyes a small face though not a childs she was clad in something green that left her arms free and showed her legs to the knee a belt made of flowers he saw flowers in her hairwhich kept changing colour as he looked dizzyingly the wonder of that even under stars he could only see clearly by the light she cast that as much as anything telling him how far hed come walking up from the farmyard the halfworld they named it in the tales where he was now men were lost here in the stories never came back or returned a hundred years after theyd walked or ridden away everyone they knew long dead he could see her small breasts through the thinness of what she wore did they feel the cold faeries there was an ache in his throat how how am i seeing you he had no idea if she could even speak use words his words her hair went pale nearly white came back towards gold but not all the way she said you were in the pool i saved you there her voice simply speaking words made him realize he had never really made music with his harp or sung a song the way it should be sung he felt that he would weep if he were not careful how why he sounded harsh to his own ears after her a bruising of the starlit air i stopped your horse in the shallows they would have killed you had you come nearer the queen shed answered one question not the other my brother was there it was difficult to speak your brother is dead his soul is with the ride why reddened hair now crimson in summer dark her shining let him see i took it for the queen first dead of the battle tonight dai no weapon when he had gone out first dead whatever that meant but she was telling him alun knelt on the damp cool grass his legs were weak i should hate you he whispered i do not know what that means she said music he thought about that and then of the girl brynns daughter in that room by the chapel where his brothers body lay he wondered if he would ever play the harp again what why does the queen saw her smile first time a flashing of small white teeth she loves them they excite her those who have been mortals from your world forever the hair to violet the slim small body so white beneath the pale green garment what could be forever that hollow in his heart but after what happens to him grave as a cleric as a wise child as something so much older than he was they go from the ride when she tires of them go where so sweet a music in this voice i am not wise i do not know i have never asked hell be a ghost alun said then with certainty on his knees under stars a spirit wandering alone a soul lost i do not know would not your sun god take him he placed his hands on the night grass beside him the coolness the needed ordinariness of it jad was beneath the world now they were taught doing battle with demons for his childrens sake he echoed her without her music i do not know tonight i dont know anything why did you save me in the pool the question she hadnt answered she moved her hands apart a rippling like water why should you die but i am going to die would you rush to the dark she asked he said nothing after a moment she took a step nearer to him he remained motionless kneeling saw her hand reach out he closed his eyes just before she touched his face he felt almost overwhelmingly the presence of desire a need to be taken from himself from the world to never come back she had the scent of flowers all about her in the night eyes still closed alun said they tell us they tell us there will be light then there will be for your brother she said if that is so her fingers moved touched his hair he could feel them trembling and understood only then that she was as afraid and as aroused as he was worlds that moved beside each other never touched almost never he opened his mouth but before he could speak again he felt a shockingly swift movement an absence never said what he would have said never knew what he would have said he looked up quickly she was already ten paces away in no time at all standing against a sapling again half turned to fly farther her hair was dark raven black he looked back over his shoulder someone was coming up the slope he didnt feel surprise at all it was as if the capacity to feel that had been drained from him like blood he was still very young that night alun ab owyn the thought that actually came to him as he recognized who was climbingand was gazing past him at the faeriewas that nothing would ever surprise him again brynn ap hywll crested the ridge and crouched grunting with the effort beside alun on the grass the big man plucked some blades of grass keeping silent looking at the shimmering figure by the tree not far away how do you see her alun asked softly brynn rubbed the grass between his huge palms i was in that pool most of a lifetime ago lad a night when a girl refused me and i went walking my sorrow into the wood did an unwise thing girls can make you do that actually how did you know i one of the men siawn sent to report said you killed two erlings and were mazed in the pond till ceinion took you out does he did siawn no my man just told me that much didnt understand any of it but you did i did youve seen them all these years ive been able to hasnt happened often they avoid us this one is different is often here i think its the same one i see her up here sometimes when were at brynnfell never came up brynn looked over at him for the first time afraid to he said simply i dont think shell hurt us the faerie was silent still by the slender tree still poised between lingering and flight listening to them she can hurt you by drawing you here brynn said it gets hard to come back you know the tales as well as i do i had tasks in the world lad so do you now ceinion down below before you do not have leave to go from us alun looked at the other man in the darkness thought about the burden in those words a lifetimes worth you dropped your sword to climb up here he saw brynn smile then a little ruefully the big man said how could i let you be braver than me lad he grunted again and rose im too old and fat to crouch all night in the dark he stood there bulky against the sky the shimmering figure by the tree moved back another half a dozen paces iron she said softly still it is pain brynn was motionless hed never have heard her alun realized not ever have known the music of this voice through all the years most of a lifetime ago he wondered at someone with the will to know of this and not speak of it and stay away but i left my brynn stopped swore though quietly reached down into his boot and pulled free the knife that was hidden there my sorrow he said it was not intended spirit he turned away and stepping forward strongly hurled the blade arcing it through the night air all the way down the hill and over the fence into the empty yard a very long throw i couldnt have done that alun thought he stared at the figure beside him the man whod killed the volgan long ago in the days when the erlings were here every spring or summer year after year a harder darker time before alun had been born or dai but if you were slain in a small failed raid today you were just as dead as if it had been back then at the hands of the volgans own host werent you and your soul brynn turned to him we should go he said we must go alun didnt move from where he knelt on the cool grass and your soul he said she isnt supposed to exist is she what man would say that brynn said were they fools our ancestors who told of the faerie host the glory and peril of them her kind have been here longer than we have what the holy men teach is that they endanger our hope of light is that what they teach alun said heard his own bitterness dark here in the starry night except for the light where she was he turned his head again almost against his will looked at her still backed away from the tree her hair was pale again since the knife had gone he thought she hadnt come nearer however he thought of her fingers touching him the scent of flowers he swallowed he wanted to ask her again about dai but he did not kept silent you know it is true what they teach us said brynn ap hywll he was looking at alun not over at the figure that stood beyond the tree shimmering her hair the colour now of the eastern sky before the morning sun you can feel it can you not even here come down lad well pray together for your brother and my men and for ourselves you can just walk away from this alun said he was looking at the faerie who was looking back at him not moving not saying a word now i have to said the other man i have been doing it all my life you will begin doing it now for your souls sake and all the things to be done alun heard something in the voice turned his head looked up again brynn gazed back at him steadily a looming figure in the dark of the night thirty years with a sword fighting the things to be done had either of the moons been shining tonightif the old tales told truenone of this would have happened dai would still be dead though among all the other dead brynns daughter had challenged him with that driven him out of doors because there was no answer for her and no release from this hollowness within alun turned back to the faerie her wideset eyes held his maybe he thought there was a release he drew a slow breath and let it out he stood up watch over him he said not more than that she would know she came forward a few steps to the tree again one hand on it as if embracing merging into it brynn turned his back and started resolutely down and alun followed him not looking back knowing she was there was watching him from the slope from the other world when he reached the farmyard brynn had already reclaimed their swords he handed alun his and his belt ill get my knife in the morning ap hywll said alun shook his head i saw where it fell i think he walked across the yard the lanterns inside did not cast their glow this far only lit the windows showing where people were the presence of life among the dying and the dead he found the knife almost immediately though carried it back to brynn who stood for a moment holding it looking at alun your brother was our guest he said at length my sorrow is great and for your mother and father alun nodded his head my father is a hard man i believe you know it our mother their mother let the light of the god be yours my child let it guide you through the world and home to me my mother will want to die he said we live in a hard world brynn said after a moment reaching for words they will surely find comfort in having a strong son yet to take up the burdens that will fall to you now alun looked up at him in the darkness the bulky presence sometimes people dont take up their burdens you know brynn shrugged sometimes yes no more than that alun sighed felt a great weariness he was the heir to cadyr with all that meant he shook his head brynn bent down and slipped the dagger into the sheath in his boot he straightened they stood there the two of them in the yard as in a halfway place between the treed slope and the lights brynn coughed up there you said you asked her to take care of him um what did alun shook his head again didnt answer would never answer that question he decided brynn cleared his throat again from inside the house beyond the double doors they heard someone cry in pain neither of them alun realized was standing in such a way that they could see if there was still a shimmering above them on the hill if he turned his head the big man abruptly slapped his hand against his thigh as if to break a mood or a spell i have a gift for you he said brusquely and whistled nothing for a moment then out of the blackness a shape appeared and came to them the doghe was a wolfhound and hugerubbed its head against ap hywlls thigh brynn reached down a hand in the dogs fur at its neck cafall he said calmly hear me you have a new master here he is go to him he let go and stepped away nothing again at first then the dog tilted its heada grey alun thought though it was hard to be sure in the darknesslooked at brynn a moment then at alun and then he came quietly across the space between alun looked down at him held out one hand the dog sniffed it for a moment then padded with grace to aluns side you gave him that name alun asked this was unexpected but ought to have been trivial it didnt feel that way cafall yes when he was a year old in the usual way then hes your best dog he saw brynn nod best ive ever had too great a gift my lord i cannot yes you can said brynn for many reasons take a companion from me lad that was what the name meant of course companion alun swallowed there was a constriction in his throat was this what would make him weep tonight after everything he reached down and his hand rested on the warmth of the dogs head he rubbed back and forth ruffling the fur cafall pushed against his thigh the ancient name oldest stories a very big dog graceful and strong no ordinary wolfhound to so calmly accept this change with a spoken word in the night it wasnt he knew a trivial gift at all not to be refused my thanks he said my sorrow said brynn again let him help keep you among us lad so that was it alun found himself blinking the lights in the farmhouse windows blurring for a moment shall we go in he asked brynn nodded they went in to where lanterns were burning among the dead in the room beside the chapel and among all the wounded children of jadwounded in so many different wayswithin the house the dog followed then lay down by the chapel door at aluns murmured command outside on the slope to the south something lingered for a time in the dark and then went away light as mist before the morning came five it had not been a good spring or summer for the traders of rabady isle and there were those quite certain they knew why the list of grievances was long sturla ulfarson who had succeeded halldr thinshank as governor of the islands merchants and farmers and fisherfolk might have only one hand but he possessed two eyes and two ears and a nose for the mood of people and he was aware that men were comparing the exaggerated glories of thinshanks days with the troubles and ill omens that had marked the beginning of his own unfair perhaps but no one had made him manoeuvre for this position and ulfarson wasnt the selfpitying sort had he been so hed have been inclined to point out that the notorious theft of thinshanks grey horse and the marring of his funeral rites last springthe start of all their troubleshad happened before the new governor had been acclaimed hed have noted that no man whatever kind of leader he might be could have prevented the thunderstorm that had killed two young people in the night fields shortly after that and he might also have bemoaned the fact that it was hardly within the power of a local administrator to control events in the wider world warfare among karch and moskav and the sarantines couldnt help but impact upon trade in the north sturla onehand did make these points decisively he was a decisive man for the most part when someone dared challenge him directly but he also set about doing what he could do on the isle and as a result he discovered something it began with the families of the young man and woman killed in the storm everyone knew ingavin sent the thunder and all manner of storms that there was nothing accidental if people were killed or homes ruined by such things a world where the weather was utterly random was a world not to be endured the girl had been doing her year of service to the volur at the compound by the edge of the forest the young women of rabady isle took this duty in turn before they wed it was a ritual an honourable one fulla the corn goddess ingavins bride needed attention and worship too if children were to be born healthy and the fields kept fertile iord the seer was an important figure here on the isle in her own way as powerful as the governor was sturla onehand had paid a formal visit to the compound bringing gifts shortly after his election by the thring he hadnt liked the volur but that wasnt the point if there was magic being used you wanted it used for you not against you women could be dangerous and that in fact is what he discovered the families of the young man and the girl were elbowing each other towards a feud over their deaths each blaming the others offspring for the two of them being out by the memorial cairn lying together when the lightning broke sturla had his own thoughts as to who had inveigled whom but it was important to be seen to be conducting an inquiry first his principal desire was to keep a blood feud from rabady or at the least to limit the casualties he set about speaking with as many of the young ones as he could and in this way came to have a conversation with a yellowhaired girl from the mainland the newest member of the circle of women in the compound she had come properly in response to his summons and had knelt before him shy eyes suitably downcast she had little assistance however to offer concerning the two lightningcharred young ones claiming to have seen halli with the lad only once the evening before bern thorkellson came to the seer with thinshanks horse the new governor of rabady isle who had been leaning back in his seat an ale flask in his one good hand had leaned forward the lightning storm the two dead youngsters and a possible feud became less compelling before he what said sturla onehand he put the flask down reached out with his hand and grabbed the girl by her yellow hair forcing her to look up at him she paled closed her eyes as if overwhelmed by his powerful nearness she was pretty i i should not have said that she stammered and why not growled ulfarson still gripping her by the hair she will kill me and why the governor demanded she said nothing obviously terrified he tugged hard she whimpered he did it again she she did a magicworking on him she what said sturla struggling aware he was not sounding particularly astute the girlhe didnt know her namesuddenly rocked forward and threw her arms around his legs pressing her face to his thighs it was not actually unpleasant she said weeping she hated thinshank she will kill me but she uses her power for for her own purposes it is wrong she spoke with her mouth against him arms clutching his legs sturla onehand let go of her hair and leaned back again she remained where she was he said i will not hurt you girl tell me what she did in this way the governorand later the people of rabadylearned of how iord the seer had made a black seithr spell rendering young thorkellson her helpless servant forcing him to steal the horse then making him invisible enabling him to board the southern ship that had been in the harbourboard it with the grey horseand sail away unseen it was done by the volur to spite halldr thinshank of course which was not an unreasonable desire by any means but it was a treachery that had unleashedobviouslymalevolent auras upon the isle halidrs one had to assume causing the calamities of the season including the lightning storm that killed two innocent youths erling warriors were not by collective disposition inclined to nuanced debate when resolving matters of this sort sturla onehand might have been more thoughtful than most but hed lost his hand and achieved some wealth raiding overseas you didnt ponder when attacking a village or sanctuary you drank a lot beforehand prayed to ingavin and thünir and then fought and killedand took home what you found in the fury and ruin you shaped an axe and sword were perfectly good responses to treachery in his view and they would serve the useful additional purpose of displaying sturlas resolution early in what he hoped would be a prosperous tenure as governor of the isle iord the seer and her five most senior companions were taken from the compound early the next morning stripped naked bony and slackbreasted all of them hags fit for no man bound to hastily erected posts in the field near the cairn stone where the two youngsters had died when they came for her the seer triedbabbling in terrorto say that shed deceived young thorkellson that shed only pretended to cast a spell for him had sent him back into town to be found sturla onehand had not lived so many years by being a fool he pointed out that the lad had not been found so either the seer was lying or the boy had seen through her deception and though young thorkellson had been known to be good with blade and hammer red thorkells son would be wouldnt he he was barely grown and where was he and the horse she had her magic what answer would she give she never did answer the six women were stoned to death the members of the two feuding families invited to throwstanding togetherthe first volleys of stone and rock as the most immediately aggrieved the wives and maidens joined the men one of the times they were permitted to do that it took some time to kill six women stoning always did the ale was good that night and the next and a second ship from alrasan in the southwhere they worshipped the starsappeared in the harbour two days later come to trade a clear blessing of ingavin the yellowhaired girl from the mainland had stood at the edges of the stoning ground theyd made the younger ones from the compound come watch shed had a fearsome serpent coiled about her body darting a venomous tongue she was the only one not terrified of it no one stood near her as they watched the old women die the governor couldnt remember hed drunk a good deal that day and night just how hed learned about her having been bitten back in the spring perhaps she had told him herself the snake was noticed in the field not surprisingly serpents held the power of the halfworld within the skin they sloughed rebuilding it anew a snake would devour the world at the end of days it was much talked about that night a sign it was agreed to be a harbinger of power the girl was named by sturla ulfarson as the new volur of rabady isle a few days later after the southern ship had done its trading and gone normally the men of rabady didnt make this choice but these werent normal times you didnt stone a seer every year did you maybe this change would prove to be useful bring the power of women seithr and night magic the compound itself more under control sturla onehand wasnt sure about that and he couldnt actually have traced with precision the thoughts or conversations that had led to any of these decisions events had moved quickly he had been riding them the way longships rode a wave or a leader on a battlefield rode the sweep of the fight or a man rode his woman after dark she was young what of it all the old ones were dead they could have sent for a woman across the water to vinmark even to hlegest itself but who knew what that might have brought them or when better not draw the attention of increasingly ambitious men there in any case the girl had saved them from the effects of an angry spirit and seemed to have been already chosen by the snake men had been saying that in the taverns sturla could read a runemessage if it was spelled out for him he did know her name by then anrid they called her the serpent though by summers end she hadnt come to him in the town again nor in fact did it occur to him to ask her to do so there were enough girls about for a governor no need to get entangled in that way with seers who kept snakes by their beds in the dark or wrapped them around their bodies to watch stones split flesh and crack bone in the morning light jormsvik was more a fortress than a city for one thing only the mercenaries themselves and their servants or slaves lived within the walls the ropemakers sailmakers armourers tavernkeepers carpenters metalsmiths fishermen bakers fortunetellers all lived in the unruly town outside the walls there were no women allowed inside jormsvik though prostitutes were scattered through the twisting streets and alleys just outside there was money for a woman to make here beside a large garrison you had to fight someone to become one of the men of jormsvik and fight steadily to stay in until you became a leader when your battles might reasonably be expected to be all for hire and profitif you stayed out of the tavern brawls for three generations the mercenaries of this fortress by the sea had been known and fearedand employedthrough the world they had fought at the triple walls of sarantium on both sides at different times and in ferrieres and moskav they had been hired and hired away by feuding lords vying for eminence here in the erling lands as far north as the places where the sky flashed colours in the cold nights and the reindeer herds ran in the tens of thousands one celebrated company had been in batiara joining a karchite incursion towards fabled rhodias forty years ago only six of them had returnedwealthy you received your fee in advance and shared it out beforehand but then you divided the spoils of war among the survivors survivors could do well first you had to survive getting in there were young men desperate or reckless enough to try each year usually after the winter ended winter defined the northlands its imminent arrival the white fierce hardness of the season then the stirring of blood and rivers when it melted away spring was busiest at the gates of jormsvik the procedure was known everywhere goatherds and slaves knew it you rode up or walked up to the walls shouted a namesometimes even your real oneto the watch issued a challenge to let you in that same day or the next morning a man drawn by lot would come out to fight you the winner went to bed inside the walls the loser was usually dead he didnt have to be you could yield and be spared but it wasnt anything to count on the core of jormsviks reputation lay in being feared and if you let farmboys challenge you and walk away to tell of it by a winters turf fire in some bogbeset place you werent as fearsome as all that were you besides which it made sense for those inside to deter challengers any way they could sometimes the sword rune could be drawn from the barrel on a morning by a fighter whod been too enthusiastically engaged in the taverns all night or with the women or both and sometimes it wasnt just a farmboy at the gates sometimes someone came who knew what he was doing theyd all gotten in that same way hadnt they sometimes you could die outside and then the gate swung open and a new mercenary was welcomed under whatever name he gavethey didnt care in jormsvik everyone had a story in his past hed be told where his pallet was and his mess hall and captain same as the man hed replaced which could be unpleasant if the dead man had friends which was usually the case but this was a fortress for the hardest men in the world not a warm meadhall among family you got to the meadhalls of ingavin by dying with a weapon to hand time then for easiness among ripe sweet willing maidens and the gods on this earth you fought bern was aware that hed made a mistake almost immediately after stooping through the low door of the alehouse outside the walls it wasnt a question of thievesthe fighting men of jormsvik were their own brutal deterrent to bandits near their gates it was the mercenaries themselves and the way of things here a stranger he thought a young man arriving alone in summer with a sword at his side could only be here for one reason and if he was going to issue a challenge in the morning it made nothing but sense for any man in this illlit room which was nonetheless bright enough to expose him for what he was to protect himself and his fellows in obvious ways against what might happen on the morrow they could kill him tonight he realized rather too late though it didnt even have to come to that those on the benches closest to where hed sat down too far from the doorway another mistake smiled at him asked after his health and the weather and crops in the north he answered as briefly as he could they smiled again bought him drinks many drinks one leaned over and offered him the dice cup bern said he had no money to gamble which was true they saidlaughinghe could wager his horse and sword he declined at the table they laughed again big men almost all of them one or two smaller than himself but muscled and hard bern coughed in the dense smoke of the room they were cooking meat over two open fires he was sweating it was hot in here he wasnt used to this hed been sleeping outdoors for a fortnight now riding south into vinmarks summer trees green and the young grass salmon leaping in the stillcold rivers hed been riding quickly since hed surprised and robbed a man for his sword and dagger and the few coins in his purse no point coming to jormsvik without a weapon he hadnt killed the man which might have been a mistake but hed never yet killed any man would have to tomorrow or hed very likely die here someone banged down another tin cup of ale on the board in front of him sloshing some of it out long life the man said and moved on didnt even bother to stay to share the toast they wanted him rendered senseless tonight he realized slacklimbed and slow in the morning then he thought about it again he had no need to challenge tomorrow could wake with a pounding head and spend the day clearing it challenge the day after or the morning after that and theyd know it he realized every man in this room theyd all done this before no his first thought had been the wiser one they wanted him drunk enough to make a mistake tonight get into a brawl be crippled or killed when there was nothing at stakefor them should he be flattered they thought he was worth it he wasnt fooled these were the most experienced soldiersforhire in the north they didnt take chances when they didnt need to there was no glory in winning a wallchallenge when the sword rune was drawn only risk why take it if you didnt have to if the foolish traveller came into an ale room the night before showing his sword at least hed hidden the horse among the trees north of town gyllir was accustomed to being tied in the woods now he wondered if the stallion still remembered thinshanks barn how long did horses remember things he was afraid trying not to let them see it he thought of the water then that deadblack night guiding the grey horse into the sea from the stony beach expecting to die icecold end of winter whatever lay waiting in the straits under the water what hed survived was there a reason hed lived did ingavin or thünir have a purpose in this probably not actually he wasnt important enough but there was still no need to walk openeyed into a different death tonight not after coming out of the sea alive on a vinmark strand as a grey day dawned he lifted the new cup and drank just a little a bad mistake coming in here you died of mistakes like that but hed been tired of solitude nights alone had thought to at least have a night among other men hear human voices laughter before he died in the morning fighting a mercenary he hadnt thought it through a woman stood up came over towards him hips swaying men made way in the narrow space between tables for her though not without squeezing where she could be reached she smiled ignored them watched bern watching her he felt dizzy already ale after not drinking for so long the smoke smells the crowd it was so hot the woman had been sitting with a burly darkbearded man clad in animal skins a bearwarrior they had them here in jormsvik it seemed he remembered his father some say the berserkirs use magic they dont but you never want to fight one if you can help it bern saw through fire smoke and lantern light that the man was watching him as the woman approached he knew this game too suddenly stood up just as she stopped in front of him her heavy breasts swinging free beneath a loose tunic youre a pretty man she said thank you bern muttered thank you need to piss right back he twisted past her she grabbed deftly for his private parts with an effort bern refrained from glancing guiltily at the very big man shed just left hurry back and make me happy she called after him someone laughed someonebig blond hardeyedlooked up then from the dicing bern slapped a coin on the counter and ducked outside he took a deep breath salt in the night air here sound of sea stars overhead the white moon high the nearer ones in the room would have seen him pay would know he wasnt coming back he moved then quickly he could die here it was very dark no lights to speak of outside the inns and the low jumbled wooden dwellings and the rooms where the whores took their men a mixed blessing the darkness hed be harder to find but might easily run headlong into a group of people trying to make his way north and out from this warren of buildings a fleeing stranger bern was certain would be happily seized to be questioned at leisure he ran up the first black alley he came to smelled urine and offal stumbled through a pile of garbage choking could he just walk he wondered avoid being seen to be running from something he heard noises behind him from the alehouse door no he couldnt just walk needed to move it would be a sport for them something to enliven a night outside the fortress walls waiting for a new contract and a journey somewhere a way to keep in fighting trim in the blackness he bumped into a barrel lying on its side stooped groped righted it no top grunting he turned it over sweating now and clambered up praying the bottom was solid enough he stood gauged distance as best he could in the dark and jumped for the slanting roof of the house above caught a purchase levered a knee up awkward with the sword at his hip and pulled himself onto the roof if there was someone inside theyd hear him he knew could raise an alarm when you had no obvious choices you acted as if what you needed to do could be done why was he remembering so many of his fathers words tonight prone on the roof above the alley he heard three or four men go by in the street he was being hunted he was a fool the son of a fool deserved whatever fate he met tonight he didnt think theyd kill him a broken leg or arm would spare someone the need to fight him tomorrow with a risk involved on the other hand they were drunk and enjoying themselves wiser to surrender more sounds a second group prettyfaced little shiteater he heard someone say at the entrance to the alley i didnt like him someone laughed you dont like anyone gurd do yourself with a hammer gurd said or do it to that little goatherd who thinks he can join us there came the unmistakable sound of a blade being drawn from a scabbard bern decided that surrender was not a promising option carefully holding his own sword out of the way he backed along the roof he needed to go north get beyond these houses and into the fields he didnt think theyd care enough to leave drinking and go looking for him out there in the night and come morning once he rode up to the gates and issued a challenge hed be safe although that probably wasnt the best way to describe what would follow then he could have stayed at home a servant for two more years he could have hired himself out on a farm somewhere on the mainland invented a name for himself been a servant or a labourer there that wasnt what hed ridden the grey horse into the sea to become everyone died if you died before the walls of jormsvik perhaps the sword in your hand would get you to ingavins halls he didnt actually believe that truth be told if it were so any farmhand could get himself run through by a mercenary and drink mead forever with smoothskinned maidens among the gods or until the serpent devoured the worldtree and time came to a stop it couldnt be that easy neither was moving on this roof which slanted too much they all slanted to let the snow slide in winter bern skidded sideways dug in fingers and boots to stop himself heard the sword scrape had to hope could only hope no one else heard it he lay still again sweat trickling down his sides no sounds below except for running feet he slowly manoeuvred himself around to look the other way there was a ramshackle twostorey wooden house on the other side of another narrow alley just the one the others were all onelevel like the house he was on one of the newstyle stone chimneys ran up an outside wall set back from the street he saw they didnt have these on the isle it was meant to allow a hearth warmth and food on a second floor it looked as if it was going to fall over there was a window in that second storey overlooking his rooftop the wooden shutters were open one hung crookedly needing repair he saw a candle burning on the ledge illuminating a roomand the face of the girl watching him berns heart lurched then he saw her put a finger to her lips gurd she called down you coming up a laugh below they had gone right around were in the street on the other side now not to you you hurt me last time youre wild when i do you someone else laughed the girl across the way swore tiredly how bout you holla i go with katrin you know that she hurts me when i dont do her gurd laughed this time you see a stranger he was right below if bern moved to the roofs edge he could look down on them he heard the question and closed his eyes everyone died didnt said the girl why pretty farmboy thinks hes going to be a mercenary her voice was bored you find him send him up i need the money we find him hes no good to you trust me the girl laughed the footsteps moved on bern opened his eyes saw her turn her head to watch the men below go down the lane she turned back and looked at him didnt smile now nothing like that she moved back however and gestured for him to come across the way bern looked a small window in a flat wall above his level a slanting roof where he was no purchase to run and jump he bit his lip the heroes of the days of giants would have made this jump he wasnt one of them hed end up clattering down the face of the wall to the street below slowly he shook his head shrugged cant he mouthed looking across at her she came back into the window frame looked left and right down the lane leaned out theyre around the alley ill get you at the door wait till i open she hadnt given him up she could have he couldnt stay on this roof all night he had two choices as he saw it jump down keep to shadows and alleys try to get north and out of town with a number of fighting menhe didnt know how manyprowling the streets for him or let her get him at the door he pulled himself nearer the edge the sword scraped again he swore under his breath looked over and down saw where the door was the girl was still at the window waiting he looked back at her and he nodded his head a decision you came over into the worldcrossed from an island on a stolen horseyou had decisions to make in the dark sometimes and living until morning could turn on them she disappeared from the window leaving the candle there so small and simple a light he stayed where he was watching it this glimmer in darkness there was a breeze up here on the roof he could smell the sea again hear the distant surge of water beneath the voices and laughter of men always and ever beneath those things an idea came to him the beginnings of an idea he heard a sound looked down she carried no light was a shadow against the shadows of opened door and house wall no one in the laneway at least not now he seemed to have decided to do this bern slid himself to the lowest point on the pitched roof held his scabbard with one hand and dropped he stumbled to his knees got up went quickly to her and in she closed the door behind him it creaked no bolt or bar he saw two other doors inside off the narrow corridor one beside them one at the back she followed his glance whispered theyre in the taverns upstairs is mine step over the fourth stair its missing in the dark bern counted stepped over the fourth stair the stairs creaked as well each sound made him wince her door was ajar he went in she was right behind him this one she closed slid down a bar to lock it bern looked at it a kick would splinter lock and door he turned saw the candle in the window a strangeness to be looking at it now from this side not a feeling he could explain he crossed and looked out at the roof across the lane where hed been moments before the white moon above it and stars he turned back into the room and looked at her she wore an undyed tunic belted at the waist no jewellery paint on her lips and cheeks she was thin legs and bones brown hair very large eyes her face thin too not really what a man would want in a woman for the night though some of the soldiers might like them young an illusion of innocence or like a boy an illusion of something else she wasnt innocent not living here there was no furniture to speak of her bed where she worked was a pallet on the floor in a corner the coverings spread over it neatly enough a bundle against the wall beside it would be her clothing another pile of cooking things and food that shouldnt be on the floor he thought thered be rats a basin a chamber pot both on the floor as well two wooden stools a black pot hooked on an iron bar stretched across the fireplace hed seen from outside firewood by that wall the candle on the window ledge she went to the window took the candle put it on one of the stools she sank down on the bedding crossed her legs looked up at him said nothing waiting bern said after a moment why hasnt anyone fixed that stair she shrugged we dont pay enough i like it if someone wants to come up they need to know the holes there no surprises he nodded cleared his throat no one else in here they will be later in and out told you both of em at the taverns why arent you the same shrug im new we go later after the others start their night they dont like it if we get there too soon beat us up make scars you know he didnt not really so youll go out soon she raised her eyebrows why got a man here dont i he swallowed i cant be found you know that course i know gurdll kill you for fun of it do any of them just come up sometimes she said failing to reassure why did you help me he wasnt used to talking not since leaving the isle she shrugged again dont know you want me what can you pay what could he pay bern reached into his trousers and took the purse looped inside them around his waist he tossed it to her all i have he said hed had it off the careless merchant north of here perhaps the gods would look kindly on his giving it to her that vague newformed idea that had come to him on the roof was still teasing at the edges of his mind no use or meaning to it unless he survived tonight she was opening the purse emptied it on the bedding looked up at him first glimmering of youth of surprise in her this is too much she said all i have he repeated hide me till morning doing it anyhow she said whyd i bring you bern grinned suddenly a kind of lightheadedness i dont know you havent told me she was looking at the coins on her bed too much she said again maybe youre the best whore in jormsvik he said she looked up quickly im not she said defensively a jest im too afraid right now to take a woman anyhow he doubted she was used to hearing that from the fighters in jormsvik she looked at him you going to challenge in the morning he nodded thats why i came made a mistake going to an inn tonight she stared at him didnt smile thats ingavins truest truth it is whyd you he tilted the sword back sat carefully on the stool it held his weight wasnt thinking wanted a drink a last drink she appeared to be thinking about that they dont always kill in the challenges me they will he said glumly she nodded thats a truth i guess after tonight you mean he nodded so you might as well have the purse oh thats why he shrugged i should at least do you then shouldnt i hide me bern said its enough she looked at him its a long night you hungry he shook his head she laughed for the first time a girl somewhere in there with the jormsvik whore you want to sit and talk all night she grinned and began untying the knotted belt that held her tunic come here she said youre pretty enough for me i can earn some of this bern had thought actually that fear would strip away desire watching her begin to undress seeing that unexpected amused expression he discovered that this was wrong it had been he thought a long time since hed had a woman and the last one had been lord the volur in her cabin on the isle the serpent coiling somewhere in the room not a good memory its a long night after a moment he started to remove his swordbelt he was later to considersometimes soberly sometimes not sohow a mans life could turn on extremely small things had he turned up another alley when hed left that tavern found a different roof to climb had they begun to disrobe even a little sooner thira they heard from downstairs you still up there he knew that voice now gurdll kill you for fun of it she had said in the fireplace she whispered urgently now push up a ways hurry you can turn me in he said surprising himself no to that she said retying her belt quickly get in there turning to the door she shouted gurd watch fourth step i know bern heard he hurried to the chimney space bending down and stepping over the rod that held the black pot awkward especially with the stolen sword he scraped his shoulder on the rough stone swore he straightened up inside cautiously it was pitch black and very tight he was sweating again heart hammering should he have stayed in the room fought the man when he came up gurd would kill him or simply step back and call for friends bern would have nowhere to go and the girl would die as well if he was found here a bad death with these men should he care about that if he wanted to be a jormsvik mercenary no matter too late now the chimney widened a little higher up more than hed thought he reached overhead with both hands scrabbling at stone pebbles fell rattling he found places to grip levered himself got his boots on either side of the bar that stretched across pushed the sword to hang straight down he needed to get higher but couldnt see a thing in the blackness of the chimney no way to check for footholds he put his boots right to the edges pressing against the stone the bar held for how long he didnt know or want to think imagined himself crashing down unable to move in the chimney spitted like a squealing pig by the man in the room a glorious death gurd banged on the door the girl crossed and opened it he hopedabruptlythat shed thought to hide the purse he heard her voice gurd i didnt think youd out of the way i want your window not your skinny bones what no ones seen him in the streets theres ten of us looking shitsmeared goatboy may be on a roof id have seen him gurd bern heard her footsteps cross behind the mercenarys to the window come to bed youd see nothing but one of us to screw ingavins blood it pisses me to have a farmhand escape us let me make you feel better then the girl named thira said in a wheedling voice long as youre here gurd slipped coins all you want whore not all i want slipped gurd she said bern heard her laugh softly and knew it wasnt real not now i might come back later if youre dying for it no money though id be doing you a favour no to that said thira sharply ill be down in hratis getting a man who takes care of a girl bern heard a blow a gasp decent tongue in your head whore remember it there was a silence then why would you cheat me gurd a man oughtnt do that what i do bad to you do me and pay me for it bern felt a cramping in his arms held almost straight over his head clutching the stone wall if the man in the room turned to the fire and looked hed see two boots one on either side of the cooking pot the man in the room said to the woman get your tunic up dont take it off turn over on your knees thira made a small sound two coins gurd you know it why cheat me for two coins i need to eat the mercenary swore bern heard money land on the floor and roll thira said i knowed you was a good man gurd i knowed it who you want me be a princess from ferrieres you captured me now you got me cyngael the man grunted bern heard a sword drop cyngael bitch proud as a goddess but not any more not now put your face down youre in the mud in the field i got you like this he grunted so did the girl bern heard shifting sounds where the pallet was ah thira cried someone save me she screamed but kept it soft all dead bitch gurd growled bern heard the sounds of their movements a hard slap on skin the man grunting again he stayed where he was eyes closed though it didnt matter in this blackness heard the mercenary again breath rasping now all carved up your men now you find what an erlings like cow then you die another slap no cried thira save me gurd grunted again then groaned loudly then the sounds ceased after a moment bern heard him stand up again worth a coin not moren that ingavin knows gurd of jormsvik a captain there said ill take the other back whore he laughed thira said nothing bern heard the sword being picked up boots crossing the floor again to the door you see anyone on a roof you shout hear thira made a muffled sound the door opened closed bern heard boots on the stairs then a clatter and swearing gurd had forgotten the fourth stair a brief necessary flicker of pleasure at that then gone he waited a few more moments then stepped carefully down from the bar stooped almost double and squeezed out from the chimney he scraped his back this time the girl was on the pallet face down hidden by her hair the candle burned on the stool he hurt you bern asked she didnt move or turn he took a coin back he oughtnt cheat me bern shrugged though she couldnt see him you have a full purse from me whats a coin matter she still didnt turn i earned it you cant understand that can you she said it into the rough blanket of the pallet no said bern i guess i cant it was true he didnt understand but why should he she turned then sat up and quickly put a hand to her moutha girls gesture again began to laugh ingavins eye look at you youre black as a southern desert man bern looked down at his tunic ash and soot from the fireplace were all over him he turned up his hands his palms were coal black from the fireplace walls he shook his head ruefully maybe ill scare them in the morning she was still laughing not them but sit down ill wash you she got up arranged her tunic and went to a basin by the other wall it was a long time since a woman had tended him not since theyd had servants before his father had killed his second man in an inn fight and been exiled ruining the world bern sat on the stool as she bade him and a whore by the walls of jormsvik cleaned and groomed him the way the virgins in ingavins halls were said to minister to the warriors there later without speaking she lay down on the pallet again and took off her tunic and he made love to her distracted a little now by the noisy sounds of other lovemaking in the two rooms below with a memory of what hed heard from within the fireplace he actually tried to be gentle with her but afterwards he didnt think it had mattered hed given her a purse and she was earning it in the way she did that she fell asleep after the candle on the stool burned down bern lay in the darkness of that small high room looking out the unshuttered window at the summer night waiting for first light before that came he heard voices and drunken laughter in the street below the mercenaries going back to their barracks they slept there always whatever they did out here in the nights her window faced east away from the fortress and the sea watching listening to the girl breathe beside him he caught the first hint of dawn he rose and dressed thira didnt move he unbarred the door and went softly down the stairs stepping over the fourth one from the bottom and came out into the empty street he walked northnot running on this morning that might be the last of his unimportant lifeand passed the final straggling wooden structures out into fields beyond a chill grey hour before sunrise he came to the wood gyllir was where hed left him the horse would be as hungry as he was but there was nothing to be done about that if they killed bern theyd take the stallion treat him well he was a magnificent creature he rubbed the animals muzzle whispered a greeting more light now sunrise a bright day it would be warm later bern mounted left the wood he rode slowly through the fields towards the main gates of jormsvik no reason to hurry now he saw a hare at the edge of the trees alert watching him it crossed his mind to curse his father again for what thorkell had done to bring him here to this but in the end he didnt do that though he wasnt sure why it also occurred to him to pray and that he did do there were guards on the ramparts above the gates bern saw he reined the horse to a halt sat silently a moment the sun was up to his left the sea on the other side beyond a stony strand there were boatsthe dragonheaded shipspulled up on the shore a long long row of them he looked at those the brightly painted prows and at the grey surging sea then he turned back to the walls and issued a challenge to be admitted to the company of jormsvik offering to prove his worth against any man sent out to him a challenge could be entertaining though usually only briefly so the mercenaries prided themselves on dealing briskly with country lads and their delusions of being warriors a trivial routine aspect of their life draw the rune with a sword on it ride out cut someone up come back for food and ale if a man took too long to handle his lotdrawn task he could expect to be a source of amusement to his fellows for a time indeed the likeliest way to ensure being killedfor a challengerwas to put up too much of a fight but why come all the way to jormsvikonthesea at the bottom of vinmark just to surrender easily in the probably vain hope of having your life spared there might be some small measure of accomplishment back home for a farmer in having fought before these walls and come away alive but not that much in truth only a few of the mercenaries would bother to climb the ramparts to watch mostly companions of the one whod drawn the swordlot on the other hand for the artisans and fishermen and merchants of the town sprawling outside the walls daily life offered little enough in the way of recreation so it was generally the case that theyd suspend activity and come watch when a challenger was reported they wagered of courseerlings always wageredusually on how long it would take for the newest victim to be unhorsed or disarmed and whether hed be killed or allowed to limp away if the challenge came early in the morningas todaythe whores were usually asleep but with word shouted through the lanes and streets many of them would drag themselves out to see a fight you could always go back to bed after watching a fool killed maybe even win a coin or two you might even take a carpenter or sailmaker back with you before he returned to his shop make another coin that way fighting excited the men sometimes the girl called thira at least partly waleskan by her colouring was among those who came down towards the gates and the strand when word ran round that a challenge had been issued she was one of the newer whores having arrived from the east with a trading party in spring she had taken one of the rickety fireprone upperlevel rooms in the town she was too bony and too sharptongued and inclined to use it to have any real reason to expect a rise in her fortunes or enough money to lower her bed to a groundfloor room these girls came and went or died in winter it was a waste of time feeling sorry for them life was hard for everyone if the girl was fool enough to put a silver coin on the latest farmer whod shown up to challenge all you wanted to do was bite the coin ensure it was real and be quick as you could to cover part of the wagereven at the odds proposed how she got the coin was not at issueall the girls stole a silver piece was a weeks work on back or belly for a girl like thira and not much less than that at harder labour for the craftsmen of the town it took several of them mingling coins to match the wager the money was placed as usual with the blacksmith who had a reputation for honesty and a good memory and who was also a very large man why you doing this one of the other girls asked thira it had created a stir you didnt bet on challengers to win they spent half last night trying to find him gurd and the others he was in hratis and they went for him i figure if he can dodge a dozen of them for a night he might handle one in a fight not the same thing said one of the older women you cant hide out here thira shrugged if he loses take my money well arent you the easy one with silver the other woman sniffed what happens if gurd come out his self to finish what he couldnt wont gurds a captain i ought to know he comes to me now hah he come up those broken stairs to you only when someone he wants is busy dont get ideas girl he was with me last night thira said defensively i know him he wont fight its beneath him as a captain and all someone laughed is it someone else said the gates had opened a man was riding out there were murmurs and then more laughter at the girls expense people were fools sometimes you couldnt pity them you tried to gain from it those who hadnt been quick enough to be part of the wager were cursing themselves give over the money now a pockmarked sailmaker named stermi said to the blacksmith elbowing him this farmers a dead man seabirds wheeled dove into the waves rose again crying ingavins eye exclaimed the girl named thira shaken the crowd eyed her with raucous pleasure whyd he do this oh thought you said you knew him the other whore said cackling they watched a largish buzzing group of people as gurd thollsona captain for two years now excused from having to do this any more unless he chose torode out in glorious chain mail from the open gates of jormsvik and moved past them unsmiling eyes hidden under helm and above bright yellow beard towards the farmboy waiting on the stony strand astride a grey horse he had prayed had no farewells to make there was no one who would lose anything at all if he died this was a choice you made choices in the sea and on land or somewhere between the two on the margins bern backed gyllir up a little as the mercenary who had drawn the battle lot approached he knew what he wanted to do here had no idea if he could this was a trained warrior he wore an iron helm chainmail armour a round shield hooked on the saddle of his horse why would he take any kind of chance though this was where bern saw his own chance lying small as it might be the jormsvik fighter came nearer bern retreated a little more along the stony beach as if flinching backwards edge of the surf now shallow water whered you hide last night goatboy this time the retreat back into the water was genuine instinctive he knew the voice hadnt known which man in the alehouse last night was gurd now he did the big yellowhaired dice player at the next table over who had seen him pay and hurry out answer me cowshit youre dying here anyhow gurd drew his sword there came a sound from those watching outside the walls something rare came into bern thorkellson in that moment with the deriding confident voice and a memory of this man the night before it actually took bern a moment to identify the feeling normally he was controlled careful only son of a man too well known for his temper but a shield wall broke inside him on that strand before jormsvik with the sea lapping at the fetters of his horse he danced gyllir a little farther backwards into the waterdeliberately this timeand he felt within the heat of an unexpected fury youre a sorry excuse for an erling you know that he snapped if im supposed to be a shitsmeared farmhand why couldnt you find me last night gurd i didnt go far you know whys it take a captain to kill a goatboy today or be killed by one i beat you last night ill beat you now in fact i like that sword of yours ill enjoy using it a silence a man stunned then a stream of obscenity you beat no one you lump of dung the big man snarled edging his horse forward in the water you just hid and wet yourself not hiding now am i bern raised his voice to be heard come on little gurd everyones watching again he backed up his boots in the stirrups were in the water now he could feel the horse reach for footing the shelf sloped here gyllir was calm gyllir was a glory bern drew his stolen sword gurd followed farther into the sea his horse danced and shifted most erling warriors fought on foot riding to battle if they had a horse and dismounting there bern was counting on that for one thing gurd couldnt use the shield and sword and control his mount get down and fight the captain rasped im here little gurd not hiding or is this erling afraid of the sea is that why youre not raiding will they even let you back in when they see it come get me mighty captain again he shouted it to let those watching on the grass hear him some of them had begun drifting nearer the strand he was surprised at how little fear he felt now that it had come to this and the anger in him was fierce and warming a blaze he thought of the girl last night this massive bearded captain stealing a coin from her out of sheer malice it shouldnt matterhed told her thatbut it did he couldnt say why didnt have time to decide why gurd pointed with his blade im going to hurt you before i let you die he said no you arent said bern quietly this time for no one elses ears but their ownand the gods if they were listening ingavin and thunir led me through the sea on this horse in the dark of a night they are watching over me you die here little gurd youre in the way of my destiny he surprised himself againhadnt any idea he would say that or what it meant gurd rapped his helm down hard roared something wordless and charged more or less it is difficult to charge in surf at the best of times things are not as one expects or as ones horse expects movements slow there is resistance footing shiftsand then where sand and stones slide away it disappears entirely and one is swimming or the horse is wildeyed one cannot charge at all swimming wearing armour heavy and unbalanced but this on the other hand was a jormsvik fighter a captain and he was nottaunting asideafraid of the sea after all he was quick and his horse was good the first angled blow was heavy as a battlehammer and bern barely got his own blade across his body and in front of it his entire right side was jarred by the impact gyllir rocked with it bern gasped with the force pulled the horse back to his right in the sea by reflex more than anything gurd pushed farther forward still roaring took another huge downward swing this one missed badly they were deeper now both of them gurd nearly unhorsed himself in the waves rocking wildly as his mount legs thrashing struggled beneath him bern felt an improbable mixture of ice and fire within him fury and a cold precision he thought of his father ten years of lessons with all the weapons thorkell knew how to block a downward forearm slash his inheritance he said watching the other man struggle and then right himself if it makes you feel better dying here im not a farmboy little gurd my father rowed with the volgan for years thorkell einarson siggurs companion know it wont get you to ingavins halls this morning though he paused locked eyes with the other man the gods will have seen you steal that coin last night if he died now the girl did too because hed said that he wasnt going to die he waited saw awarenessof many thingsflicker and ripple in the other mans blue eyes then he steered gyllir forward at an angle with his knees and he stabbed gurds horse with a leaning upward thrust just above the waterline gurd cried out pulled at reins uselessly waved his swordfor balance more than anythingslipped from the tilting saddle bern saw him weighted with chain mail up to his chest in water fighting to stand his dying horse thrashed again kicked him bern actually had a moment to think about pitying the man he waited until gurd fighting the weight of his armour was almost upright in the waves then he angled gyllir again smoothly in the sea and he drove his sword straight into the captains handsome bearded face just below the nosepiece the blade went through mouth and skull bone banged hard against the metal of the helm at the back bern jerked it out saw blood sudden and vivid in the water he watched the other man topple into white foaming surf dead already another angry ghost he dismounted grabbed for the drifting sword better by far than his own he took hold of gurd by the ringed neckpiece of his armour and pulled him from the sea blood trailing from the smashedin face he threw the two swords ahead of him used both hands to drag the heavy body up on the strand he stood above it dripping breathing hard gyllir followed the other horse did not a carcass now in the shallow water bern looked at it a moment then walked back into the sea he bent and claimed the dead mans shield from the saddle walked back out onto the stones again he looked over at the crowd gathered between sea and walls and then up at the soldiers on the ramparts above the open gates many of them up there this sunlit summer morning a captain riding out claiming the fight worth watching to see what he did to the challenger whod offended him theyd seen two men were walking out through the gates one lifted a hand in greeting bern felt the anger still within him making a home not ready to leave this mans armour he called lifting his voice over the deeper voice of the tumbling sea behind him is mine in ingavins name it wouldnt fit him but could be altered or sold thats what mercenaries did thats what he was now at the margins of any tale there are lives that come into it only for a moment or put another way there are those who run quickly through a story and then out along their paths for these figures living their own sagas the tale they intersect is the peripheral thing a moment in the drama of their own living and dying the metalsmith ralf erlickson elected to return to his birthplace on rabady isle at the end of that same summer after ten years on the vinmark mainland the last four of which had been spent in the town outside the walls of jormsvik hed made and saved a decent sum because the mercenaries had needed his services regularly hed finally decided it was time to go home buy some land choose a wife beget sons for his old age his parents were dead his brothers gone elsewherehe wasnt certain where any more after ten years there were other changes on the isle of course but not so many really some taverns had closed some opened people dead people born the harbour was bigger room for more ships two governors had succeeded each other since hed left the new onesturla onehand of all peoplehad just begun serving ralf had a drink or three with onehand just after arriving they traded stories of a shared childhood and divergent lives after ralf had never gone raiding sturla had lost a hand overseas and made a small fortune a hand was a fair trade for a fortune in ralfs estimation sturla had a big house a wife land access to other women and power it was unexpected he kept quiet about that thought though even after several cups he was coming home to live and sturla was the governor you wanted to be careful he asked about unmarried women smiled at the predictable jests made a mental note of the two names sturla did mention next morning he went out from the walls walking through remembered fields to the womens compound there was an errand hed promised to do no need to ask directions the place wouldnt have moved it was in better repair than he recalled sturla had told him a bit about that the stoning of the old volur emergence of a new one relations the governor had allowed were good the witchwomen had even taken to bringing food and ale for the harvesters at end of day they never spoke sturla had told him shaking his head not a word just walked out in procession a line of them carrying cheese or meat and drink then walked back in procession ralf erlickson had spat into the rushes on the governors floor women hed said just their games onehand had shrugged less than before maybe ralf got the feeling he was taking credit for it the details of the towns reciprocation were evident as he approached the compound the fence was in good condition the buildings looked sturdy doors hanging properly wood was stacked high already well before winter there were signs of construction a new outbuilding of some kind going up a woman in a grey calflength tunic watched him approach standing by the gate ingavins peace on all here ralf said routinely i have a message for one of you all peace upon you she replied and waited didnt open the gate ralf shifted his feet he didnt like these women he vaguely regretted accepting the errand but hed been paid and it wasnt a difficult task i am to speak with someone whose name i dont know he said she laughed surprisingly well you dont know mine he wasnt used to laughter in the seers compound hed come twice in his youth both times to offer support to friends seeking a seithr spell from the volur thered been no amusement on either occasion were you ever bit by a snake he asked and was pleased to see her startle is that the one you need to see he nodded after a moment she opened the gate wait here she said and left him in the yard as she went into one of the buildings he looked around a warm day end of summer he saw beehives an herb garden the locked brewhouse heard birdsong from the trees no sign of any other women he wondered idly where they were a door opened and someone else came out alone wearing blue he knew what that meant under his breath he cursed he hadnt expected to deal with the volur herself she was young he saw onehand had told him that but it was disconcerting you have a message for me she murmured she was hooded but he saw wideset blue eyes and pulledback yellow hair you might even have called her pretty though that was a dangerous thought with respect to a volur ingavins peace he said and fullas upon you she waited you the snake i was bitten yes in the spring she put a hand inside her robe and withdrew it gripping something erlickson stepped back quickly she wrapped the creature around her neck it coiled there head up looking at him from above her shoulder then flicked an evil tongue we have made our peace the serpent and i ralf erlickson cleared his throat time he thought to be gone from here your kinsman sends greetings from jormsvik hed surprised her greatly he realized had no idea why she clasped her hands at her waist that is all the message he nodded cleared his throat again he is well i can say that and working for the mercenaries ralf shook his head pleased they didnt know everything these women he killed a captain in a challenge midsummer hes inside jormsvik one of them now well in truth he isnt inside at the moment why she was holding herself very still off raiding anglcyn coast five ships near two hundred men a big party that left just before i did hed seen them go it was late in the season but they could winter over if they needed to he had made and mended weapons and armour for many of them anglcyn coast she repeated yes he said there was a silence he heard the bees thank you for your tidings ingavin and the goddesses shield you she said turning away the serpent still about her neck and shoulders wait here sigla will bring you something sigla did generous enough he spent some of it at an inn that night on ale and a girl went looking for property the next morning not that there was so much of it on the isle rabady was small everyone knew everyone it might have helped if his parents had still been living instead of buried here but that was a waste of a wish one of the names sturla had given him was that of a widow no children young enough to still bear hed been told some land in her own name west end of the isle he brushed his clothes and boots before going to call his son was born the next summer his wife died in the birthing he buried her back of the house hired a wet nurse went looking for another wife found one and younger this time he was a man with a bit of land now he felt fortunate as if hed made good choices in life there was an oak tree standing by itself near the south end of his land he left it untouched consecrated it to ingavin made offerings there lit fires midsummer midwinter his son fourteen years later cut it down one night after a bad drunken fight the two of them had ralf erlickson still drunk in the morning killed the boy in his bed with a hammer when he found out smashed in his skull a father could deal with his family as he chose that was the way of it or it had been once sturla onehand still governor convened the islands thring they exiled ralf erlickson from rabady for murder because the lad had been asleep when killed or so the stepmother said and since when had the word of a woman been accepted by erlings in a thring no matter it was a done thing he left or theyd have killed him well on in years by then ralf erlickson found himself on a small boat heading back to the mainland landless onehand had claimed the exiles property for the town of course eventually he made his way back down to jormsvik for want of a better thought worked at his old trade but his hand and eye werent what they had been not surprising really it had been a long time he died there a little while after was laid in the earth outside the walls in the usual fashion he wasnt a warrior no pyre one friend and two of the whores saw him buried life for all men under the gods was uncertain as weather or winter seas the only truth worth calling true as the ending of one of the sagas had it six when the kings fever took him in the night there was not enough loveor mercyin the world to keep him from the fens and swamps again drenched with sweat upon the royal bed or pallet if they were travelling aeldred of the anglcyn would cry out in the dark not even aware he was doing it so piteously it hurt the hearts of those who loved him to know where he was going they all thought they knew where and when by now he was seeing his brother and his father die long years ago on camburn field by raedhill he was riding in icy rain a winter campaign the erlings had surprised them wounded and shivering with the first of these fevers at the end of a brutal days fighting and he was king as of twilights coming down upon that headlong feverravaged flight from the northmen who had broken them at last king of the anglcyn fleeing like an outlaw to hide in the marshes the fyrd broken lands overrun his royal father hideously bloodeagled on the wet ground at camburn in blood and rain his brother cut in pieces there he didnt know about them until later he did know it now a latesummer night in esferth so many years after tossing in feverdream reliving the winter twilight when jad had abandoned them for their sins the blades and axes of the erlings pursuing them in the wild dark the northmen triumphantly crying the accursed names of ingavin and thünir like ravens on the rain wind it is difficult to see with the rain lashing their faces a heavy blanket of cloud night coming swiftly now both good and bad they will be harder to hunt down but can easily miss their own way not able to use torches there are no roads here across moor and tor there are eight of them with aeldred riding west it is osbert who is nearest the king for he is the king now last of his line as he always is and osbert who shouts them to a jostling halt by the pitiful shelter of a handful of elms they are soaked to the bone chilled most wounded all exhausted the wind lashing but aeldred is shivering with fever slumped forward on his horse and he cannot speak in answer to his name osbert moves his mount nearer reaches out touches the kings brow and recoils for aeldred is burning hot he cannot ride he says leader of the household troop he must burgred snaps shouting it over the wind they will not be far behind us and aeldred lifts his head with a great effort mumbles something they cannot hear he points west with one hand twitches his reins to move forward he slips in the saddle as he does so osbert is near enough to hold him their horses side by side the two thegns look at each other over the wracked body of the man who is now their king he will die osbert says aeldred son of gademar is twenty years old just the wind howls rain slashes them like needles it is very dark they can hardly see each other after a long moment burgred of denferth wipes water from his face and nods very well the seven of us carry on with the royal banner we will try to be seen draw them west you find a farmhouse somewhere and pray osbert nods his head meet in beortferth on the island itself among the salt fens when we can the marshes are dangerous you can find your way through maybe not have someone watch for us burgred nods again looks over at their boyhood friend this other young man slumped on his horse aeldred in battle was deadly commanding the left flank of the fyrd with his household guard it was not the left flank that crumbled not that it mattered now jad curse this day burgred says then he turns and six men follow him across an open field in the dark one carrying their banner moving west again but deliberately not as quickly as before osbert son of cuthwulf left alone with his king leans over and whispers tenderly dear heart have you even a little left we ride for shelter now and should not have far to go he has no idea if this is true in fact no clear sense of where they are but if there are farms or houses they should be north of here and when aeldred with another appalling effort pushes himself upright and looks vaguely towards him and nodsshivering still unable to speakit is northward that osbert turns leaving the elms heading into the wind he will remember the next hours all his life though aeldred lost in that firstever fever never will it grows colder begins to snow they are both wounded sweatdrenched inadequately clothed and aeldred is using the last reserves of an iron will just to stay on his horse osbert hears wolves on the wind listens constantly for horses knowing if he hears them that the erlings have come and it is over there are no lights to be seen no charcoal burner by the woods no farmers burning candles or a fire so late on a night like this he strains his eyes into the dark and prays as burgred had said he should the kings breathing is ragged he can hear it the rasp and draw there is nothing to see but falling snow and black woods to the west and the bare wintry fields through which they ride a night fit for the worlds end wolves around and the erling wolves hunting them in the dark and then still shivering uncontrollably aeldred lifts his head a moment he stays thus looking at nothing and then speaks his first clear words of the nights flight to the left he says west of us jad help me his head drops forward again snow falls the wind blows more a hammer than a knife aeldred will claim ever after to have no recollection of saying those words osbert will say that when the king spoke he heard and felt the presence of the god unquestioningly he turns west guiding aeldreds horse with one hand now to stay beside his own wind on their right pushing them south osberts hands are frozen he can scarcely feel the reins he holds his own or the kings he sees blackness ahead a forest they cannot ride into that and then there is the hut directly in front of them close to the trees in their very path he would have ridden north right past it it takes him a moment to understand what he is seeing for his weariness is great and then osbert begins to weep helplessly and his hands tremble holy jad has not after all abandoned them to the dark they dare not light a fire the horses have been hidden out of sight in the woods tied to the same tree to keep each other warm the snow is shifting and blowing there will be no tracks there can be no signs of their passage near the house the erlings are no strangers to snow and icy winds their berserkirs and wolfraiders flourish in this weather wrapped in their animal skins eyes not human until the fury leaves them they will be out there in the wind hunting for the northmen know by now that one of the line of athelbert left camburn field alive in some ways it ought not to matter with a land taken and overrun an army shattered what can a king matter alone but in other ways it means the world it could mean the world and they will want aeldred killed in a manner as vicious as they can devise so there is no fire in the swineherds house where a terrified man and his wife awakened by a pounding on their door in the wild night have abandoned a narrow bed to pile threadbare blankets and rags and straw upon the shivering burning man whothey have been toldis their king under holy jad whether it is the relative stillness within these thin walls out of the howling wind or some portentladen deepening of his sickness osbert is no leech he does not know the king begins to cry out on the swineherds bed shouting names at first then a hoarse rallying cry some words in ancient trakesian and then in the rhodian tongue of the holy booksfor aeldred is a learned man and has been to rhodias itself but his shouting might kill them tonight so in the darkness and the cold osbert son of cuthwulf lies down beside his friend and begins whispering to him as one might murmur to a lover or a child and each time the king draws a wracked breath to cry out in oblivious agony his friend clamps a bloodstained hand over his mouth and stifles the sound again and again weeping as he does so for the pity of it then they do hear cries from outside in the white night and it seems to osbert lying beside his king in that frigid hut so cold the lice are probably dead that their ending has come indeed the doom no man can escape forever and he reaches for the sword beside him on the earthen floor and vows to his fathers spirit and the sun god that he will not let aeldred be taken alive from here to be ripped apart by erlings he moves to rise and there is a hand on his arm there are going by the swineherd whispers toothless hold my lord aeldreds head shifts he drags for breath again osbert turns quickly grips the other mans head with one hand hot as a forge it is and covers the kings mouth with his other and he murmurs a prayer for forgiveness as aeldred thrashes beside him trying to give utterance to whatever pain and fever are demanding that he cry and whether because of prayer or a moonshrouded night or the northmens haste or nothing more than chance the erlings do pass by how many of them osbert never knew and after that the night too passes longer than any night of his life had ever been eventually osbert sees through unstopped chinks in wall and door wind slashing through that the flurries of snow have stopped looking out for a moment he sees the blue moon shining before clouds slide to cover it again an owl cries hunting over the woods behind them the wind has died down enough for that towards dawn the kings terrible shivering stops he grows cooler to the touch the shallow breathing steadies and then he sleeps osbert slips into the woods feeds and waters the horses precious little in truth for the familys only nurture in winter is carefully rationed salted pork from their swine and unflavoured mealy oatcakes food for animals is an impossible luxury the pigs are in the forest left to forage for themselves amazed he hears laughter from inside as he returns ducking through the doorway aeldred is taking a badly blackened cake for himself leaving the others less charred the swineherds wife is blushing the king smiling nothing at all like the man whod shivered and moaned in the dark or the one whod screamed like an erling berserkir on the battlefield he looks over at his friend and smiles i have just been told gently enough that i make a deficient servant osbert did you know that the woman wails in denial covers her crimson face with both hands her husband is looking back and forth his face a blank uncertain what to think it is the only reason we let you claim rank osbert murmurs closing the door the fact that you cant even clean boots properly aeldred laughs then sobers looking up at his friend you saved my life he says and then these people saved ours osbert hesitates you remember anything of the night the king shakes his head just as well his friend says eventually we should pray aeldred says they do giving thanks on their knees facing east to the sun for all known blessings they wait until sunset and then they leave to hide among the marshes besieged in their own land beortferth is a lowlying wet islet lost amid dank spreading salt fens only the smaller rodents live there and marsh birds water snakes biting insects in summer it was the birdcatchers who first found the place long ago making their precarious way through the fens on foot or poling flatbottomed skiffs it is almost always foggy here tendrils of mist the gods sun a distant wan thing even on the clear days you can see strange visions here get hopelessly lost horses and men have been sucked down in the stagnant bogs which are deep in places some say there are nameless creatures down there alive since the days of darkness the safe paths are narrow not remotely predictable you must know them exactly ride or walk in single file easy to ambush groves of gnarled trees rise up in places startling and strange in the greyness roots in water leading the wanderer to stray and fall in winter it is always damp unhealthy there is desperately little in the way of food and that winterwhen the erlings won the battle of camburn fieldwas a cruelly harsh one endless freezing rain and snow thin greyyellow ice forming in the marsh the wet wind slashing almost every one of them has a cough rheumy eyes loose bowels all of them are hungry and cold it is aeldreds finest hour it is this winter that will create and define him as what he will become and some will claim to have sensed this as it was happening osbert is not one of them nor burgred concealing their own coughs and fluxes as best they can flatly denying exhaustion refusing to acknowledge hunger aeldreds two commanders as young as he was that winter will each say long afterwards that they survived by not thinking ahead addressing only the demands of each day each hour eyes lowered like a man pushing a plough through a punishing stony field in the first month they arrange and supervise the building of a primitive fort on the isle more a windbreak with a roof than anything else when it is complete before he ever steps inside aeldred stands in a slanting rain before the fortyseven men who are with him by then a number never forgotten all of them named in the chronicle and formally declares the isle to be the seat of his realm heart of the anglcyn in their land in the name of jad his realm fortyseven men ingemar svidrirson and his erlings are inside raedhills walls foraging unopposed through a beaten countryside not a swift sea raid for slaves and glory and gold here to settle and rule osbert looks across sparse patchy grass in rain towards burgred of denferth and then back at the man who leads them in this hunted misty refuge with salt in the biting air and for the first time since camburn field he allows himself the idea of hope looking up from the plough aeldred kneels in prayer they all do that same afternoon having given thanks in piety their first raiding party rides out from the swamps fifteen of them burgred leading they are gone two days to make a wide loop away from here they surprise and kill eight erlings foraging for winter provisions in a depleted countryside and bring their weapons and horses and the provisions back a triumph a victory while they are out four men have come wandering in through the fens to join the king hope a licence to dream the beginnings of these things men gather close around a night fire in beortferth hall walls and a roof between them and the rain at last there is one bard among them his instrument damply out of tune it doesnt matter he sings the old songs and aeldred joins in the singing and then all of them do they take turns on watch outside on the higher ground and farther out at the entrances to the marshes east and north sound carries here those on watch can hear the singing sometimes it is a warming for them amazingly so that same night aeldreds fever comes again they have their one singer and a single aged cleric with bad knees some artisans masons birdcatchers fletchers farmers fighting men from the fyrd with and without weapons no leech no one with knives and cups to bleed him or any sure knowledge of herbs the cleric prays kneeling painfully sun disk in his hands where the king lies by the fire and osbertfor it is seen as his tasktries in anguish to decide whether aeldred thrashing and crying out oblivious lost to them and to jads created world needs to be warmed or cooled at any given moment and his heart breaks again and again all the long night by springtime there are almost two hundred of them on the isle the season has brought other life herons otters the loud croaking of frogs in the marsh there are more wooden structures now even a small chapel and they have organized of necessity a network of food suppliers hunting parties the hunters become more than that if erlings are seen the northmen have had a difficult winter of their own it appears short of food not enough of them to safely extend their reach beyond the fastness of raedhill until others comeif they comewhen the weather turns and their own foraging parties have been encountering with disturbing frequency horsed anglcyn fighters with murderous vengeance in their eyes and hands emerging from some base the erlings cannot find in this toowide forested hostile countryside it is one thing to beat a royal army in a field another to hold what you claim the mood on the isle is changing spring can do that quickening season they have a routine now shelter birdsong greater numbers each day amid all this those of the beortferth leaders not taking parties out from the fens are learning how to read it is a direct order of the kings an obsession an idea he has about the kingdom he would make aeldred himself stealing time labours at a roughhewn wooden table at a translation into anglcyn of the single charred rhodian text someone found amid the ruins of a chapel west and south of them burgred has not been shy about teasing the king about this task it is entirely uncertain he maintains what ultimate good it will be to have a copy in their own tongue of a classical text on the treatment of cataracts the consolations of learning the king replies airily enough are profound in and of themselves he swears a good deal however as he works not seeming especially consoled it is a source of amusement to many of them though not necessarily to those engaged at a given moment in sounding out their letters like children under the clerics irritable instruction among the new recruits making their way late in winter through the fens to beortferth was a lean grey man claiming training in leechcraft he has bled the king by cup and blade achieving little if anything there is also a woman with them now old stooped like a hoopand so safe among so many restless men she has wandered the marshes gathered herbs spikemarrow wortfen and spoken a charm into themwhen the pinchmouthed cleric was not nearby to mutter of heathenish magicsand has applied these pounded into a green paste to the kings forehead and chest when his fever takes him this too as best osbert can judge does nothing beyond causing angrylooking reddish weals when aeldred burns and shivers osbert will take him in his arms and whisper endlessly of summer sunlight and tended fields of rye of wellbuilt town walls and even of learned men discoursing upon eye diseases and philosophy and the erling wolves beaten back and back and away oversea in the mornings white and weak but lucid aeldred remembers none of this the nights are harder he says more than once for his friend osbert denies that of course he denies it he leads raiding parties in search of game and northmen he practises his letters with the cleric and then one day the ice gone birds around and above them aeldred son of gademar who was the son of athelbert sends twenty men out in pairs riding in different directions each pair with the image of a sword carved upon a block of wood change is upon them with the change of season the gamblers throw of a kingdoms dice if something is to happen it must be before the dragonships set sail from the east to cross the sea for these shores the king on his isle in the marsh summons all that is left of the fyrd and all other men the host of the anglcyn to meet him on the next night of the blue full moon spirits moon when the dead wake at ecberts stone not far from camburn field not far at all from raedhill osbert and burgred comparing in whispers have judged their number at a little under eight hundred souls the summoned men of the west they have reported as much to the king there are more in honesty than any of them expected fewer than they need when has any anglcyn army had the men it needed against an erling force they are aware by starlight of risk and limitation not indifferent to these things but hardly affected by them the sun has not yet risen it is dark and still here at the woods edge a clear night little wind this is a forest once said to be haunted by spirits faeries the presence of the dead not an inappropriate place to gather aeldred steps forward a shadow against the last stars we will do the invocation now he says then move before light to come upon them the sooner we will pass in darkness to end the darkness that phrase among many will be remembered recorded there is an element of transgression in doing the gods rites before his sun rises but no man there demurs aeldred his clerics beside him three of them now leads that host in morning prayer before the morning comes may we always be found in the light he rises they move out before ever the sun strikes the stone some horsed mostly on foot a wide array of weapons and experience you could call them a rabble if you wanted but it is a rabble with a king in front of it and a knowledge that their world may turn on todays unfolding there is an erling force southeast of them having come out from raedhill at the deliberately offered rumour of a band of anglcyn nearby possibly led by gademars last son the one who could still dare call himself king of these fields and forests this land the northmen have claimed ingemar could not but respond to this bait aeldred rides at the front his two friends and thegns on either side the king turns to look back on his people who have gathered here during the dark of a blue moon night he smiles though only those nearest can see this easy in the saddle unhelmed long brown hair blue eyes his slain fathers eyes the light clear voice carrying when he speaks it begins now in jads holy name he says every man here whatever his birth will be known for the whole of his life as having been at ecberts stone come with me my darlings to be wrapped in glory it is glorious in the event as told by a myriad of chroniclers sung so often and variously woven into legend or into tapestries hung on stone walls warming winter rooms osbert will live to hear his exploits of the day celebratedand unrecognizable he is at the kings side when they leave the wood and move south towards camburn where their outliers have reported the erlings camped by a field they know burgred at aeldreds command takes one hundred and fifty men east along the black line of the trees to angle south as well between camburn and the walls of raedhill the erlings are not yet awakened under the raven banners are not yet ready for a days promised hunting of an anglcyn band when that bandand rather more than thatappear from the north moving at speed the northmen have their watchmen of course and some brief warning they are not by any measure cowards and the numbers are near to even amid screamed orders they scramble into armour seizing hammers and spears and axes their leaders have swords there is however much to the elements of surprise and speed in any fight and disarray can turn a battle before it starts unless leaders can master it they have not expected even numbers today or the ferocity of the charge that roars into their camp as the first hues of sunlight appear in the east the northmen form urgent ranks stand buckle hold again for a time but only for a time there is sometimes knowledge that can subvert mens ardour on a battlefield the erlings here in esferth know that they have walls not far away at raedhill behind which they can shelter deal with these anglcyn at leisure without the chaos caused by this heavy venomous predawn assault responding to the unspoken their leaders order a pullback not an entirely wrong course there is some distance to cover to ingemar and the others back in raedhill but in the past the anglcyn have been content to force the northmen to retreat after which they would regroup to consider a next step there is reason therefore to believe it will be so again as the sun comes up this bright spring morning lighting meadow flowers and young grass then there is reason to understand that they are wrong the men of the anglcyn are not stopping to debate among themselves to consider options and alternatives they are following hard some of them on horse some with bows the withdrawal becomes in the way of these things all too often a flatout retreat and as the erling escape from their abandoned camp and position becomes a clamorous rout a flight east towards distant raedhill just about at the moment when fear will invest the body and soul of even a brave man the northmen discover another host of the anglcyn between them and the walls of safetyand the world or that small corner of it changes amid cries of aeldred and jad withdrawal retreat rout turn into slaughter very near the same wet wintry plain that saw king gademar bloodeagled as a winters wet grey twilight came down less than half a year ago the time it took aeldred of esferth to evolve from a fleeing refugee hiding in a swineherds bed shivering with fever to a king in the field avenging his father and brother cutting the northmen to pieces by the bloodsoaked field that saw their own defeat they even take the raven banner which has never happened in these lands before they kill erlings all the way to the walls of raedhill and make camp there at sunset and there they pray with lifted voices at the long days end in the morning the northmen send out emissaries to offer hostages and sue for peace in the midst of the last of the seven days and nights of feasting in raedhill that accompany king aeldreds conversion of the erling leader ingemar svidrirson into the most holy faith of jad of the sun burgred of denferth the kings lifelong companion finds that the black bile rising in his gorge is simply too strong he leaves the banquet hall walks alone into the beclouded night past the spearmen on guard away from the spill of torchlight in the hall and the sounds of revelry seeking a darkness to equal the one he finds within he hawks and spits into the street trying to dispel the clawing sickness he feels which has nothing to do with too much ale or food and is instead about the desire to commit murder and the need to refrain the noise is behind him now and he wants it there he walks towards the town gates away from the feasting hall finds himself in a muddy laneway leans against a wooden wall therea stable from the sounds withinand draws a deep breath of the night air looks up at the stars showing through rents in the swift clouds aeldred told him once that there are those in distant lands who worship them so many ways for men to fall into error he thinks he hears a cough turns his head quickly there is no danger here now except perhaps to their souls because of what is happening in the banquet hall he expects it to be a woman there are many of them about with all the soldiers in raedhill theres money to be made by night in rooms with a pallet or even in the lanes it isnt a woman following windy out here i brought us a flask osbert says mildly leaning back against the stable wall beside him the raedhill brewhouse is run by a widow it seems learned all her husband had to teach kings asked her to join his court brew for us i approve burgred doesnt want another drink but takes the flask he has known osbert as long as hes known aeldred which is to say most of his life the ales strong and clean best ale i ever had was made by women he murmurs religious house in the north by blencairn never been there osbert says hold the flask a bit he turns around burgred hears his friend urinating against the wall absently he drinks looking up at the sky again blue moon over west waning towards a crescent above the gates it was full the night they won the second battle of camburn field and camped before these walls not even a fourteennight ago they had ingemar and his remnant penned in here like sheep and a dead unspeakably mutilated king to avenge burgred still wants to kill an urge deeper than desire instead they are feasting that same erling remnant offering them gifts and safe passage east across the rivers to that part of these anglcyn lands that has long been given over to the northmen he doesnt think like we do osbert murmurs as if reading his mind he takes back the flask aeldred no the miller upstream of course aeldred you understand that ingemar knelt before him kissed his foot in homage swore fealty accepted jad burgred swears viciously carved his father open from the back cracked his ribs apart and draped his lungs out on his shoulders yes i know all these things his hands are fists just saying it the other man is silent for a time the wind carries the sounds of the banquet to them someone is singing osbert sighs we were less than seven hundred men at the gates they had two hundred left inside and the season turning which could mean dragonships soon we had no easy way of smashing into a walled defended town one day we might but not now my friend you know all these things too so instead of starving them out we feast and honour them we feast and honour the god and their coming to his light burgred swears again you speak that way but in your heart you feel as i do i know it you want the dead avenged sounds carry to them from the distant hall i believe says the other man that it is tearing him apart to do this and he is doing it nonetheless be glad you are not a king burgred looks over at him the face hard to see in darkness he sighs and these foul erlings will stay with jad you really think so i have no idea some of them have before heres what i do think the world will know that ingemar svidrirson who wanted to be a king here has knelt and sworn loyalty to aeldred of esferth and accepted a sun disk and royal gifts from him and will leave him eight hostages including two sonsand we gave them nothing in exchange nothing and i know that has never happened since first the erlings came to these shores you call the gifts nothing did you see the horses i saw them they are the gifts of a great lord to a lesser they will be seen as such jad did defeat ingavin here and took the raven banners too my friend come back and drink with me we have won something important here and it is just a beginning burgred shakes his head there is still pain a congestion in his chest i would follow him under the world to battle demons he knows that but but not if he makes peace with the demons burgred feels the heaviness a weight like stones it was easier on the isle in beortferth we knew what we had to do aeldred still knows sometimes with power you do things that fall against your heart i may not be suited for power then you have it my dear you will have to learn unless you leave us will you leave us the wind dies down faint music fades they hear horses through the stable wall you know i wont burgred says finally he knows i wont we must trust him osbert says softly if we can keep him healthy and alive for long enough they will not take us again we will leave a kingdom to our children one they can defend burgred looks at him osbert is a shadow in the blackness of the laneway and a voice forever known burgred sighs again from the heart and they will learn how to read merovius on cataracts in trakesian or hell slaughter them all there is a pause and then osberts laughter in the darkness rich as southern wine fevers were tertian quartan daily or hectic they stemmedalmost alwaysfrom imbalances in the four humours the alignment of coldness heat moisture dryness in all men there were other concerns peculiar to women each month or when they gave birth the fevered could be bled with knife and cup with leeches in locations and in degrees according to the teachings followed by the physician sometimes the patient died of this death walked near to the living at all times it was known it was generally considered that a good physician was one who didnt kill you sooner than whatever afflicted you would have those suffering from acute fever might be comforted or not by prayer eased by poultices wet sheets warm bodies next to them music or silence they were treated with hydromel and oxymel and physicians had divergent views as to which sort of honey was best in the mixing or with aconite and wild celery when it was thought that witchery lay at the root of their burning lemon balm and vervain and willow would be compounded or buckthorn to purge them inside sometimes violently coltsfoot and fenugreek sage and wormwood betony fennel hock and melilot were all said to be efficacious at times valerian might help a sufferer sleep easing pain fingernails could be clipped and buried under an ash tree by blue moons light though not of course if any cleric were about to know of it and that same caution applied to remedies involving gemstones and invocations in the night wood though it would be foolish to deny that these took place all over the kingdom of the anglcyn at one time or another all of these remedies and more had been brought to bear in the matter of king aeldreds fevers whether they were countenanced by the king and his clergy or not none of them were able to reorder the marred world in such a way as to end the fires that still seized him some nights so many long years after that first one had why is it dark it was always predictable how the king would emerge but more recently not how long it would take what was certain was that he would be pale weakvoiced lucid precise and angry osbert had been dozing on the pallet they always made for him he woke to the voice it is the middle of the night my lord welcome back i lost a whole day this time dear jad i havent got days to lose aeldred was never profane but the fury was manifest i dealt with the reports as they came both new burhs on the coast are on time nearly complete fully manned the shipyard is at work be easy what else aeldred was not being easy the taxation officers went out this morning the tribute from erlondsvidrirsons what word not yet but promised it was never wise to be less than direct with the king when he returned from wherever the fever took him promised how a messenger rode in after midday the young one ingemars son aeldred scowled he only sends the boy when the tributes late where is he housed properly asleep id imagine it is late be at ease my lord athelbert received him formally in your stead with his brother on what excuse for my not being there osbert hesitated your fevers are known my lord the king scowled again and where was burgred come to think of it osbert cleared his throat we had rumour of a ship sighted he went with some of the fyrd to find out more a ship erling osbert nodded or ships aeldred closed his eyes that makes little sense there was a silence you have been beside me all the time of course and others your daughters were here tonight your lady wife sat with you before going to chapel to pray for your health she will be relieved to hear you are well again of course she will that had nuances most of what aeldred said had layers and osbert knew a great deal about the royal marriage the king lay still on his pillow eyes shut after a moment he said but you never left did you i went to the audience chamber to take the reports aeldred opened his eyes turned his head slightly to look at the other man after a silence he said would you have had a better life had i driven you away do you think i find that hard to imagine my lord the better life and being driven away aeldred shook his head a little you might walk properly at least osbert brought a hand down to his marred leg a small price we live a life of battles aeldred was looking at him i shall answer for you before the god one day he said and i shall speak in your defence you were right my lord burgred and i were wrong today is proof the boy coming the tribute promised again ingemar has kept his oath it let us do what needed to be done and here you are unmarried without kin or heir on one leg awake all night by the side of the man who who is king of the anglcyn under jad and has kept us alive and together as a people we make our choices my lord and marriage is not for every man i have not lacked for companionship and heirs osbert shrugged ill leave my own name linkedif the god allowswith yours in the shaping of this land i have nephews for my own properties they had had this conversation before aeldred shook his head again there was more grey in his beard of late osbert saw it showed in the lamplight as did the circles under his eyes which were always there after fever and i am as ever when this passes speaking to you as a servant i am a servant my lord aeldred smiled wanly shall i say something profane to that i would be greatly alarmed osbert returned the smile the king stretched rubbed at his face sat up in the bed i surrender and i believe i will eat would you also send for would you ask my lady wife to come to me it is the middle of the night my lord you said that already aeldreds gaze was mild but could not be misconstrued osbert cleared his throat i will have someone send ask ask for her would you be so good as to do it yourself it is the middle of the night a small ironic movement of the mouth the king was back among them there was no doubting it osbert bowed took his cane and went out he looked at his hands in the lamplight after osbert left steady enough he flexed his fingers could smell his own sweat in the bedsheets a night and a day and this much of another night more time than he had to yield the grave closer every day these fevers were a kind of dying he felt lightheaded now as always that was understandable also physically aroused as always though there was no easy way to explain that the bodys return to itself the body was a gift of jad a housing in this world for the mind and immortal soul therefore to be honoured and attended tothough not on the other hand overloved because that was also a transgression men were shaped according to the liturgy in a distant image of the gods own mostchosen form of all those infinite ones he could assume jad was rendered by artists in his mortal guisewhether golden and glorious as the sun or darkbearded and carewornin wood carving fresco ivory marble bronze on parchment in gold in mosaic on domes or chapel walls this truth livrenne of mesangues had argued in his commentaries only added to the deference properly due to the physical form of manopening the door to a clerical debate acrid at times as to the implications for the form and status of woman there had been a period several hundred years ago when such visual renderings of the god had been interdicted by the high patriarch in rhodias under pressure from sarantium that particular heresy was now a thing of the past aeldred thought often about the works eradicated during that time hed been very young when hed made the journey over sea and land and mountain pass to rhodias with his father he remembered some of the holy art theyd seen but also having been a particular sort of child those places in sanctuary and palace where the evidence of smashed or paintedover works could be observed waiting now in the lamplit dark of a latesummer night for his wife to come that he might undress her and make love the king found himself musingnot for the first timeon the people of the south people so ancient so long established that they had works of art that had been destroyed hundreds of years before these northlands even had towns or walls worthy of the name let alone a sanctuary of the god that deserved to be called as much and then tracking that thought you could walk even further back to the rhodians of the era before jad came who had walked in these lands too building their walls and cities and arches and temples to pagan gods mostly rubble now since the long retreat but still reminders of unattainable glory all around them here in this harsh nearwilderness that he was pleased to call a kingdom under jad you could be a proper child of the god virtuous and devout even in a wilderness this was taught and he knew it in his heart indeed many of the most pious clerics had deliberately withdrawn from those same jaded southern civilizations in batiara in sarantium to seek the essence of jad in passionate solitude aeldred wasnt a man like one of those he knew what hed found in rhodias however ruined it was and in the lesser batiaran cities all the way down through the peninsula padrino varena baianamusic in the names the king of the anglcyn would not have denied that his soul housed in a body that wracked and betrayed him so often had been marked from childhood during that longago journey through the intricate seductions of the south he was king of a precarious dispersed unlettered people in a wintershaped beleaguered land and he wanted to be more he wanted them to be more his anglcyn of this island and given three generations of peace he thought it possible he had made decisions for more than twentyfive years denying his heart and soul sometimes with that in mind he would answer to jad for all of it not far in the future now and he didnt think three generations would be allowed them not in these northern lands this boneyard of war he lived his life fighting through impediments including these fevers in defiance of that bitter thought as if to will it not to be so envisaging the god in his chariot under the world battling through evils every single night to bring back the sun to the world he had made elswith came before his meal arrived which was unexpected she entered without knocking closed the door behind her moved forward into lamplight you are recovered by the gods grace he nodded looking at her his wife was a large woman bigboned as her warrior father had been heavier now than when shed come to marry himbut age and eight confinements could do that to a woman her hair was as fair as it had been though and unbound nowshe had been asleep after all she wore a dark green night robe fastened all the way up the front a sun disk always about her neck pillowed upon the robe between heavy breasts no rings no other adornment adornments were a vanity to be shunned she had been asking for years now to be released from their marriage and this worldly life to withdraw to a religious house become one of the daughters of jad live out her days in holiness praying for her soul and his he didnt want her to go thank you for coming he said you sent she said i told osbert to say he did her expression was austere but not unfriendly they werent unfriendly with each other though both knew that was the talk she had not moved from where shed stopped to look down at him in the bed he remembered his first sight of her all those years ago tall fairhaired wellmade woman not yet eighteen when theyd brought her south he hadnt been much older than that a year from the battles of camburn swift to wed because he needed heirs there had been a time when they were both young it seemed occasionally a disconcerting recollection they are bringing a meal he said i heard outside i told them to wait until i left from any other woman that might have been innuendo invitation elswith didnt smile he was aroused even so even after all these years will you come to me he asked made it a request i have she murmured dryly but stepped forward nonetheless a virtuous honourable woman keeping a compactbut wanting with all her heart to leave him leave all of them behind had her reasons she stood by the bed the light behind her now aeldred sat up his pulse racing all these years she wore no perfume of course but he knew the scent of her body and that excited him you are all right she asked you know i am he said and began unfastening the front of her robe her full heavy breasts swung free the disk between them he looked and then he touched her are my hands cold she shook her head her eyes were closed he saw the king watched her draw a slow breath as his hands moved it was not lack of pleasure in this he knew with a measure of satisfaction it was piety conviction fear for their souls a yearning towards the god he didnt want her to leave his own piety he had married this woman sired children with her lived through the tentative reshaping of a realm wartime peacetime winter drought could not have claimed there was a fire that burned between them but there was life a history he didnt want another woman in his bed he slipped the robe past her ample hips drew his wife down beside him and then beneath they made love whenever he recovered from his sicknessand only on those days or nights a private arrangement balancing needs the body and the soul after unclothed beside each other he looked at the marks of red flushing her very white skin and knew that she wouldagainbe feeling guilt for her own pleasure the body housed the soul for some imprisoned it for others the teachings varied always had he drew a breath when judit is married he said very softly a hand on her thigh what i will release you he felt her involuntary movement she looked quickly at him then closed her eyes tightly had not expected this neither had he in truth a moment later he saw the tears on her cheeks thank you my lord she said a catch in her throat aeldred i pray for you always to holy jad for mercy and forgiveness i know said the king she was weeping silently beside him tears spilling hands gripping her golden disk always for you your soul and the children i know he said again had a sudden oddly vivid image of visiting one day at her retreat elswith garbed in yellow a holy woman among others the two of them old walking slowly in a quiet place perhaps he thought she was to be his example and a withdrawal to the god was his own proper course before the end came and brought him either light or dark through the spaces of forever perhaps before the end not yet he knew his sins they burned in him but he was in this offered world and of it and still carried a dream in time the king and queen of the anglcyn rose from the royal bed and dressed themselves food was sent for and brought in she kept him company at table while he ate and drank ravenous as always after recovery the bodys appetites in and of the world they slept later in their separate bedchambers parting with the formal kiss of the god on cheeks and brow dawn came not long after arriving in summer mildness ushering a bright day enormous with implication seven hakon ingemarson by ten years his fathers youngest son enjoyed being called upon to ride west across three rivers and the vague border as an emissary to king aeldreds court at esferth or wherever else it might be from their own settlements in the southern part of erlond aside from the pleasure he took in this very adult responsibility he found the anglcyn royal children exhilarating and was infatuated with the younger daughter he was aware that his father was only disposed to send him west when their pledged payments were late or about to be taking shrewd advantage of evidence of friendship among the younger generation he also knew that those at the anglcyn court were conscious of this and amused by it an ongoing joke started by gareth the younger son was that if hakon ever did arrive with the annual tribute theyd have kendra sleep with him hakon always struggled not to flush hearing this kendra predictably ignored it each time not even bothering with the withering glance her older sister had perfected hakon did ask his father to allow him to lead the actual tribute west when it eventually went but ingemar reserved that journey for others the money well guarded saving hakon for explainingas best he couldtheir toofrequent delays they were sprawled in the summer grass south of esferth town near the river out of sight of the wooden walls had eaten here out of doors four of them and were idling in latemorning sunshine before returning to town to watch the preparations for the fair continue no one spoke birdsong from the beech and oak woods to the west across the stream and the rising and falling drone of bees among the meadow flowers were the only sounds it was warm in the sun sleepinducing but hakon reclining on one elbow was too aware of kendra beside him her golden hair kept coming free of her hat as she concentrated on interweaving grasses into something or other athelbert kings heir of the anglcyn lay beyond his sister on his back his own soft cap covering his face gareth was reading of course he wasnt supposed to take parchments out of the city but he did hakon lazily drifting in the light became belatedly aware that he could be accused of staring at kendra and probably would be with athelbert around he turned away abruptly selfconscious and sat up quickly jad of the thunder he exclaimed his fathers oath not an invocation anyone but erlings new to the sun god were likely to use gareth snorted but didnt look up from his manuscript kendra did at least glance at where hakon was looking briefly raised both eyebrows and turned calmly back to her whateveritwasgoingtobe what athelbert said evidently awake but not moving or shifting the hat that covered his eyes judit said kendra shes angry athelbert chuckled aha i know she is youre in trouble kendra murmured placidly plaiting oh probably said her older brother comfortably sprawled in deep grass hakon wideeyed cleared his throat the approaching figure moving with grim purpose through the summer meadow was quite close now in fact she ah has a sword he ventured since no one else seemed to be saying it gareth did glance up at that and then grinned with anticipation as his older sister came towards them kendra merely shrugged on the other hand prince athelbert son of aeldred heir to the throne heard hakons words and moved extremely swiftly in point of fact as a consequence the point of the equally swift sword which would probably have plunged into the earth between his spread legs a little below his groin stabbed into grass and soil just behind his desperately rolling form hakon closed his eyes for an excruciating moment an involuntary protective hand went below his own waist couldnt help it he looked again saw that gareth had done the very same thing and was wincing now biting his lip no longer amused it wasnt entirely certain the blade thrust by someone moving fast on uneven ground would have missed impaling the older prince in an appalling location athelbert rolled two or three more times and scrambled to his feet white as a spirit cap gone eyes agape are you crazed he screamed his sister regarded him breathing hard her auburn hair seeming afire in the sunlight entirely free of any decent restraint restraint was not the word for her at all she looked murderous judit jerked the sword free of the earth levelled it stepped forward hakon thought it wisest to scramble aside athelbert withdrew rather farther than that judit he began she stopped held up an imperious hand a silence in the meadow gareth had set down his reading kendra her grassplaiting their redheaded sister said controlling her breathing with an effort i sat up with father beside osbert for part of last night i know said athelbert quickly it was a devout devoted he is well now he wishes to see hakon ingemarson today the god be thanked for mercy athelbert said piously still very white hakon saw judit glance at him ducked his head in an awkward halfbow said nothing he didnt trust his voice i went said the older daughter of aeldred the king and his royal wife elswith back to my own chambers in the middle of the night she paused hakon heard the birds over by the woods it was dark judit added her selfcontrol hakon judged was precarious among other things the sword was quivering in her hand athelbert backed up another small step had probably seen the same thing my women were asleep his sister said i did not wake them she glanced to one side regarded athelberts bright red cap lying in the grass went over to it pierced it with the sword used her free hand to tear the cap raggedly in two along the blade dropped it back into the grass a butterfly flitted down alighted on one fragment flew away i undressed and went to bed judit went on she paused levelled the blade at her brother again jad rot your eyes and heart athelbert there was a dead mans skull in my bed with the mud still on it and a rose her brother added hastily backing up again he had a rose in his mouth i did not judit snarled through gritted teeth observe that detail until after i had screamed and awakened all three of my women and a guard outside most skulls said gareth thoughtfully from where he sat belong to dead people you didnt actually have to say that it was a he stopped swallowed as his sisters lethal greeneyed gaze fell upon him do not even think of being amusing were you she asked in a voice suddenly so quiet it was frightening in any possible way little brother a part of this he wasnt said athelbert quickly before gareth could reply and then made the mistake of essaying a placating smile and gesture good said judit i need only kill you kendra held up her grass plaiting tie him up with this first she murmured be careful sister judit said why did you not awaken when i screamed im used to it kendra said mildly gareth snorted unwisely tried urgently to turn it into a cough judit took a step towards both of them im a deep sleeper kendra amended hastily and perhaps your courage is such that what seemed a piercing scream to you was really only i tore my throat raw her sister said flatly it was the middle of the jadcursed night i was exhausted i lay down upon a cold hard muddy skull in my bed i believe she added the teeth bit me hearing that last ruminative observation hakon suddenly found himself in extreme difficulty he looked over at gareth and took comfort in what he saw the thrashing desperation of the younger princes suppressed hilarity gareth was weeping with the effort of trying not to howl hakon found that he was no longer able to stay upright he sank to his knees his shoulders were shaking he felt his nose beginning to run whimpering sounds came from his mouth oh my look at those two said kendra in a pitying voice all right this is what we will do judit put down the sword she was displaying hakon thought what was under the circumstances an otherworldy composure athelbert stay exactly where you are close your eyes hands at your sides that was a craven despicable unworthy extremely amusing thing to do and you must pay a price or judit will make life intolerable for all of us and i dont feel like suffering for you judit go and hit him as hard as you can but not with the sword you are judge here little sister judit said icily someone has to be gareth and hakon are peeing in their hose kendra said father would be displeased if you killed his heir and youd probably regret it afterwards a little hakon wiped at his nose these things did not happen back home gareth was flat on his back making strangled noises teeth hakon thought he heard him moan judit looked at him then at kendra and finally over at athelbert after a long moment she nodded her head once do it fool kendra said promptly to her older brother athelbert swallowed again she needs to drop the sword first he said cautiously he still looked ready to flee she will judit judit dropped the sword there remained an entirely forbidding bleakness to her narrowed gaze she pushed windblown hair back from her face her tunic was green belted with leather above the riding trousers she liked to wear she looked hakon thought suddenly like nikar the huntress swordbride of thunir whom of course his family no longer worshipped at all having come from bloody sacrifices to the less violent faith of jad athelbert took a breath managed an almost indifferent shrug he closed his eyes and spread his legs braced to absorb a blow gareth managed to lever himself into a sitting position to watch he wiped at his eyes with the back of one hand kendra had an odd look to her ordinarily calm fair features judit who would one day be saluted the length of the isle and across the seas as the lady of rheden be honoured through generations for courage and mourned in poets laments long after the alignments and borders of the world had changed and changed again walked across the sunlit morning grass not breaking stride and kicked her brother with a booted foot hard very hard up between the legs where the sword had almost gone athelbert made a clogged whistling sound and crumpled to the ground clutching at himself judit gazed down at him for only a brief moment then she turned her eyes met hakons she smiled at him regal gracious and at ease in a summerbright meadow did you four drink all the wine she asked sweetly i have a sudden thirst for some reason it was while hakon was kneeling hastily filling a cup for her splashing the wine that they saw the cyngael come walking up from the south on the other side of the stream four men and a dog they stopped looking towards the royal party on the grass athelbert was lying very still eyes squeezed shut breathing thinly both hands between his legs looking across the river at the dog hakon suddenly shivered as if chilled he set down judits cup without handing it to her and stood up when your hair rose like this the old tale was that a goose was walking over the ground where your bones would lie he looked over at kendra he was always doing that and saw that she was standing very still gazing across the river a curious expression on her face hakon wondered if she too was sensing a strangeness about the animal if this awareness might even be something the two of them shared you might have called the wolfhound beside the youngest of the four men a dark grey if youd wanted to or you could have said it was black trees behind it sun briefly in cloud the birds momentarily silenced by that ceinion of llywerth squinted looking east into sunlight then a cloud passed before the sun and he saw aeldreds older daughter recognize him first and smiling with swift vivid pleasure come quickly towards them across the grass he made his way through the stream which was cool waistdeep here that she might not have to enter the water herself he knew judit she would have waded in on the riverbank she came up to him and knelt with genuine happiness he made the sign of the disk over her red hair and offered no comment at all on its unbound disarray judit he had told her father the last time hed been here ought to have been a cyngael woman so fiercely did she shine she doesnt shine aeldred had murmured wryly she burns looking beyond her he saw the younger sister and brother and what appeared to be an erling and belatedly noted the crumpled figure of aeldreds heir in the grass he blinked child what happened here he asked athelbert his companions had crossed the stream now behind him judit looked up still kneeling her face all calm serenity we were at play he took a fall i am certain he will be all right my lord eventually she smiled even as she was speaking alun ab owyn the dog at his heels walked over towards aeldreds other children before ceinion had had a chance to introduce them formally the high cleric knew a brief but unmistakable moment of apprehension owyns son brought east on impulse and instinct had not been an easy companion on the journey to the anglcyn lands there was no reason to believe he would become one now that theyd arrived a blow had fallen on him earlier this year almost as brutal as the one that had killed his brother he had been direly wounded within riding home to tell his father and mother that their firstborn son and heir had been slain and was buried in arberthi soil then drifting through a summer of blank aimless days there had been no healing for owyns son not yet he had agreed reluctantly and under pressure from his father to be an escort to the anglcyn court for the high cleric on the path between the sea and the dense forest that lay between the cyngael and the anglcyn lands ceinion watching him surreptitiously as they went grieved for the living son almost as much as for the dead surviving could be a weight that crushed the soul he knew something about that thought about it every time he visited a grave overlooking the sea at home kendra watched the young cyngael come over to them the grey hound beside him she knew she ought to go to the cleric as judit had receive his blessing extend her own glad greetings she found that she could not move didnt understand at all a sense of very great strangeness the cyngael reached them she caught her breath jad give you greeting she said he went right past her not even glancing her way straight brown hair to his shoulders brown eyes her own age she guessed not a tall man trimly made a sword at his side he knelt beside athelbert who lay motionless curled up like a child hands still clutching between his legs she was near enough just to hear her older brother murmur eyes closed help me cyngael a small jest tell judit im dead hakon will help you the cyngael was still for a moment then he stood looking down at the heir to the anglcyn throne he said contemptuously you have the wrong playmate i find nothing amusing about telling someone their brother is dead and would lie in torment eternally before i let an erling help me with anything you may choose to eat and drink with them anglcyn but some of us remember bloodeaglings tell me wheres your grandfather buried son of aeldred kendra put a hand to her mouth her heart thudding across the meadow in morning light judit was standing with ceinion of llywerth out of earshot they might have been figures in a holy book illuminated by clerics with loving care and piety part of a different picture a different text not this one this one where they were was not holy the lash of the cyngael words was somehow the worse for the music in his voice athelbert who was in fact considerably more than simply a jester opened his eyes and looked up hakon had gone red as he was inclined to do when distressed i think you insult both prince athelbert and myself and in great ignorance he said impressively enough will you retract or need i chastise you in jads holy name he laid a hand on his sword hilt aeldreds younger daughter was considerably milder of manner than her sister and was thought therefore though not by her siblings to be softer something peculiar seemed to be happening to her now however a feeling a sensation within a presence she didnt understand it felt edgy angry threatened a darkness in the sunlight here beside it fists clenched at her sides she walked towards her brother and their longtime friend and this arrogant cyngael whoever he was and as the stranger turned at her approach she swung up her own booted foot to kick him in the selfsame way judit had kicked athelbert without the same result this man did not have his eyes closed and was in the state of heightened awareness that cold fury and a journey into unknown country can both instill cafall hold he rasped and in the same moment as the dog subsided the cyngael twisted deftly to one side and caught canards foot as she kicked at him he gripped it waist high then he pushed it higher she was falling he wanted her to fall she would have had the other older man not arrived moving quickly to support her she hadnt heard the cleric coming over she stayed that way her boot gripped by one cyngael body held from behind by another outraged hakon leaped forward you pigs he snarled let her go the younger one did so with pleasing alacrity then less pleasingly he said forgive me the proper behaviour here would be what to let an erling tutor me in courtesy i was disinclined to cut her lungs out what does one do when a woman betrays her lineage in this fashion accept the offered blow this was difficult as hakon had no good answer and even less of a notion why kendra had done what shed done i am entirely happy the cyngael went on in the absurdly beautiful voice they all seemed to have as a gift to kill you if you think theres honour to defend here no kendra said quickly in the same moment ceinion of llywerth released her elbows and turned to his companion prince alun he said in a voice like metal you are here as my companion and guard i am your charge remember that and i will defend you with my life from pagan offal the younger cyngael said the words were ugly the tone eerily mild flat he doesnt care kendra thought suddenly he wants to be dead she had no least idea how she knew that hakon drew his sword and stepped back for room i am weary of these words he said with dignity do what you can in jads name no forgive me both of you but i forbid this it was athelbert on his feet clearly in pain but doing what needed to be done he stumbled between hakon and the cyngael who had not yet drawn his own blade ah wonderful you are not dead after all the one who appeared to be named alun said mockingly lets bloodeagle someone in celebration at which point in what might have been the most surprising moment of a profoundly unsettling encounter ceinion of llywerth stepped forward and hammered a short hard punishing fist into the chest of his young companion the high cleric of the cyngael was not of the soft insular variety of holy men the punch knocked the younger man staggering he almost fell enough said ceinion in your fathers name and mine do not make me regret my love for you kendra registered that last and the fact that the dog did not even move despite this attack on his master and the pain in ceinions voice her senses seemed unnaturally heightened on alert apprehending some threat she watched the young cyngael straighten bring a hand slowly to his chest then take it away he shook his head as if to clear it he was looking at ceinion she saw ignoring hakons blade and athelberts intervention judit uncharacteristically had kept silent beside gareth whose watchful manner was normal not unusual the two cyngael servants had remained by the stream it was still morning kendra thought latesummer a bright day just south and west of esferth no time had passed in the world really you will note that my sword is still sheathed alun said at last softly to ceinion it will remain so he turned to kendra surprising her are you injured my lady she managed to shake her head my apologies she said i attacked you you insulted a friend the ghost of a smile so i gather evidently not wise in your presence judits worse kendra said i am not so only when judit began jads blood and grief gareth snarled hakon sheathe your blade hakon immediately did so then turned with the others and saw why father cried judit in a voice that might actually have made one believe she was purely delighted feeling nothing but pleasure as she stepped forward and made a showy elaborate attentionclaiming curtsy in the meadow grass sorry sorry sorry gareth muttered to the high cleric language profane i know the least of all transgressions here id say murmured ceinion of llywerth before going forward as well smiling to kneel before and rise to be embraced by the king of the anglcyn and then to offer the same hug and his sun disk blessing to scarred limping largesouled osbert a little behind aeldred and to one side where he always was ceinion dear friend this said the king is unlooked for so soon and a source of much joy you do me as before too much honour my lord said the cleric kendra watching closely saw him glance back over his shoulder i would present a companion this is prince alun ab owyn of cadyr who has been good enough to journey with me bearing greetings from his royal father the younger cyngael stepped forward and performed a flawless court bow from where she stood kendra couldnt see his expression hakon on her right side was still flushed from the confrontation his swordthanks be to gareth and the godwas sheathed kendra saw her father smiling he seemed well alert very happy he was often this way after his fever passed returning to life as from the grey gates to the land of the dead where judgement was made and she knew how highly he thought of the cyngael cleric owyns son aeldred murmured we are greatly pleased to welcome you to esferth your father and lady mother are well i trust and hope and your older brother dai i believe her father found it useful to let people realize very early how much he knew he also enjoyed it kendra had watched him for a long time now and could see that part too alun ab owyn straightened my brother is dead he said flatly my lord he was killed by an erling raiding party in arberth at the end of spring the same party bloodeagled two innocent people one of them a girl as they fled to their ships after being defeated if you have assigned any of your royal fyrd to engage the erlings anywhere in your lands this season i should be honoured to be made one of them the music still there in his voice clashed hard with the words kendra saw her father absorbing all of this he glanced at ceinion i didnt know he said he hated not knowing things saw it as a kind of assault an insult when events took place anywhere on their islandin the far north in erlond to the east even west across the rheden wall among the black hills of the cyngaelwithout his own swift and sure awareness a strength a flaw what he was aeldred looked at the young man before him this is a grief he said my sorrow will you allow us to pray with you for his soul which is surely with jad from where she stood kendra saw the cadyri stiffen as if to offer a quick retort he didnt though only bowed his head in what could have been taken for acquiescence if you didnt know better that eerie inexplicable sensation she did know better but not how she knew it kendra felt an uneasy prickling a tremor within she became aware that gareth was looking at her and managed an almost indifferent shrug he was shrewd her younger brother and she had no way of explaining what it was she was responding to here she turned back and saw that her father was now gazing at her as well she smiled uncertainly aeldred turned to study judit and then his sons she saw him register athelberts awkward stance and the sword on the grass she knewthey all knewthe expression he now assumed detached amused ironic he was a muchloved man aeldred of the anglcyn he had been from childhood but he dealt out his own affection thoughtfully and given what he was how could he not their mother was an exception but that all four children knew was also complex waiting anticipating kendra heard her father murmur judit dear heart dont forget to bring my longsword back of course father said judit eyes downcast her manner entirely subdued if not her hair aeldred smiled at her added gently and when you chastise your older brother and there is no doubt in me he will have deserved it try to ensure it doesnt affect the likelihood of heirs for the kingdom id be grateful ah so would i actually athelbert said in something approaching his customary voice he was not standing normally yet there was a cramped tilt to his posture but he was getting closer to upright kendra was still in awe often at how precisely her father could draw conclusions from limited information it was something that frightened athelbert she knew a son entirely aware he was expected to be able to follow this man to the throne the burden of that you could understand much of what athelbert did if you thought of it in this way please come her father was saying to the two cyngael i walked out to greet hakon ingemarson our young eastern friend rather than wait for my errant children to bring him back so that he might offer his fathers latest explanation for an unsent tribute aeldred turned and smiled at hakon to take some of the sting from that the young erling managed a proper bow the king turned back to ceinion this is a gift your early arrival we will offer thanks in chapel for a safe journey and our prayers for the soul of dai ab owyn and thenif you willwe shall feast and talk and there will be music in esferth while you tell me you have answered my prayers and are come here to stay the cleric made no reply to that last kendra saw she didnt think her father had expected one hakon of course was redfaced again she felt sorry for him a likable wellmeaning boy she ought to think of him as a man but that was difficult it was curious athelbert was far more childish but you always knew there was a man there playing at boygames because he chose to and she had seen her brother riding with the fyrd aeldred gestured ceinion and the younger cyngael fell into stride with him walking towards the walls of the town out of sight north of them kendra saw judit step quietly over and reclaim the sword she hadnt recognized it as their fathers athelberts mutilated cap was left where it had fallen a redness in the grass their own servants who had hovered cautiously at a distance all this time now came to gather the remains of their meal kendra looked west saw the two cyngael servants moving forward from the stream leading a laden donkey it was only then that she saw that one of them was an erling ebor the son of bordis never minded being posted to night duty on the walls wherever the court happened to be hed even made some friends by taking watches assigned to others leaving them free for the taverns a solitary sort of man much the same when a boy he took a deep hardtoexplain comfort from being awake and alone while others feasted or drank or slept or did the other things one did in the night sometimes a woman walking near the walls offering her song to the dark would call up to him from the bottom of the steps ebor would decline while on duty though not always afterwards a man had his needs and hed never married youngest son of a farmer no land no prospect of it hed joined the standing army of the king younger sons did that everywhere the way the world was made no point brooding on it the army gave you companions shelter enough money usually not always for ale and a girl and your weapon sometimes you fought and some of you died though less often of late as the erling raiders slowly took the measure of aeldred of the anglcyn and the forts and fortified burhs hed been building some of the erlings were allies now actually paying tribute to the king something deep passing strange in that if one thought on it ebor wasnt a thinker exactly but long nights on watch did give you time for reflection not tonight however tonight under drifting clouds and the waning blue moon had been raddled with interruptions and not from nightwalkers offering interludes of lovethough one was a woman if you forced a man to make two decisions in haste ebor would later tell the kings chamberlain humble and contrite chances were hed make a bad one or two that osbert son of cuthwulf would say quietly is why we have standing orders about the gates at night to remove the need to make a decision and ebor would bow his head knowing this was so and that this was not the time to point out that every guard on the wall disobeyed those orders in peacetime he would not be punished the one death in the night was not initially thought to be connected in any way with events at the gate this was as it happened another error though not his the women were beginning to leave the hall led by elswith the queen ceinion of llywerth placed at the kings right hand had the distinct impression that the older princess the redhaired one was disinclined to surrender the evening but judit was going with her lady mother nonetheless the younger daughter kendra seemed to have already left he hadnt seen her go the quiet one she was less vivid more watchful he liked them both his new erling manservant or guard he still hadnt decided how to think of him had also gone out hed come and asked permission to do so earlier not a thing hed really needed to do under the circumstances and ceinion wasnt sure what to make of it a request for dispensation in some way it had felt like that hed wanted to ask more about it but there were others listening thorkell einarson was a complex man hed decided most men past a certain age could be said to be the young ones usually werent in his experience the youths in this hall would want nothing more than glory any way they could find it there were exceptions the king expansive and genial of mood had already announced that they would essay the cyngaels wellknown triad game later in honour of their visitors ceinion had glanced along the table at alun then wincing and had known immediately that he would not linger for that alun ab owyn had made his excuses prettily to the queen asking leave to go to evening prayer just before she walked out herself elswith clearly impressed by the young princes piety had offered to bring him to the royal sanctuary but alun had demurred no music from him tonight either then he hadnt brought his harp east on the journey hadnt touched it since his brother had died it appeared time needed to run further ceinion decided a memory tugging at him from that wood by brynns farm he pushed that one away with the food now being cleared and the restraining presence of the ladies gone serious drinking could be expected at the long table running down the room there were dice cups out he saw the older prince athelbert had left his seat at the high table and moved farther down to join some of the others ceinion watched him set a purse in front of himself smiling beside ceinion king aeldred leaned back in his cushioned chair a pleased anticipatory expression on his face ceinion looked past the king and the queens nowempty seat to where a portly cleric from ferrieres was brushing at food on his yellow robe visibly content with the meal and wine hed been offered in this remote northern place ferrieres prided itself lately on being next only to batiara itself and sarantium in cultivating the elements of civilization they could afford to do so ceinion thought without rancour things were different here in the northlands harsher colder more marginal the edge of the world aeldred turned to him and ceinion smiled back at the king his hands clasped loosely on the tabletop alun ab owyn was ravaged by his brothers death aeldred at the same age had seen his own brother and father killed on a battlefield and learned of unspeakable things done to them and he had accepted homage not long after from the man who had slain and butchered them and let the man live that same erlings son was at this table now in an honoured place ceinion wondered if he could talk to alun about that if it would mean anything and then he thought again of the forest pool north of brynnfell and wished hed never been there or the boy he drank from his wine cup this was the hour when at a cyngael feast the musicians would be summoned to claim and shape a mood among the erlings in vinmark too for that matter though the songs were not the same or the mood there might be wrestlers now among the anglcyn jugglers knifethrowing contests drinking bouts or all of these at once in a loud chaos to hold back the night outside not at this court i now wish said aeldred of the anglcyn turning to one and then to the other of the clerics flanking him to discuss a translation thought i have to render into our own tongue the writings of kallimarchos his meditations on the proper conduct of a good life and then i would hear your reasoned opinions on the question of images of jad and suitable decoration for a sanctuary i hope you are not fatigued do you have a sufficiency of wine each of you a different sort of king this one a different way of pushing back the dark thorkell hadnt wanted to go south from brynnfell with the cleric and the younger son of owyn ap glynn and the dog and he most emphatically hadnt wanted to continue east with them later in the summer to the anglcyn lands but when you cast the gambling bones as he had in the midst of a battle and changed sides as he had you lost a large measure of control over your own life he could have fled once the eastern journey started hed done that once before after surrendering to the cyngael and converting to the sun gods faith that had been a young mans wild flight on foot with a hostage to finally arrive wounded boneweary among fellow erlings in the northeast of this wide island a long time ago a different man really and without the history hed accrued since thorkell einarson would be known now to the survivors of that raiding party as having turned on his companions to save a cyngael womanand her father the man whod slain the volgan the man who was the reason theyd come inland so dangerously far he was to put it delicately unsure of a welcome among his people in the east nor did he feel like cutting alone across this country to find out he had no hearth to row towardseven if a ship would take him at an oarhaving been exiled from his own isle for a bad nights fit of temper after dice the young man whod made that escape alone hadnt had a hip that ached when it rained or a left shoulder that didnt work well first thing of a morning the cleric had noticed the second of these on their way here an observant man too much so for thorkells ease of mind one morning ceinion had disappeared into the edge of the oak and alderwood forest that marched along north of them and returned with leaves hed steeped with herbs in the iron pot the donkey carried without saying much hed told thorkell to put the hot leaves on his shoulder wrap them with a cloth and leave them there when they set off he did it the next day too even though the wood was known to be accursed haunted with spirits he didnt go in far but he did go far enough to get his leaves the poultice helped which was irritating in a perverse way the cleric was older than thorkell showed no signs of any stiffness of his own at dawn kneeling during prayers or rising from them on the other hand this man wouldnt have had years of fighting behind him or manning a longship oar in storms it seemed to thorkell that jad or ingavin or thünirwhatever god or gods you cared to namehad caused him to save that girl ap hywlls daughter and then cast his lot with these cyngael of the west an oathsworn servant to them there were better fates but it could also be said there were worse hed had a better one as a free man and a landowner on rabady a farm of his own within sound of the sea hed ripped the skein of that destiny himself killed a man over dice in the tavern by the harbour his second man unfortunately taken with rage like a berserkir using his fists it had taken four men to pull him off they told him after when you did things like that thorkell had lived long enough to know you surrendered your life into the hands of others even if the dead man had been cheating you he shouldnt have had so much to drink that night old story hed left the isle taken work here and there survived a winter then found a raiding ship down south when springtime came he ought to have considered more carefully perhaps or else a god had been steering his path towards those western valleys the lady brynns wife had claimed him as her own servant then assigned him as a guard to a reluctant cleric when shed learned that ceinion had changed his plans was journeying south to cadyr to see owyn and from there to aeldreds court there was something between the two of them thorkell had decided but he wasnt sure what didnt think the cleric was bedding brynns wife amusing as that would have been he did know the lady had almost certainly saved his own life after the botched raid and the ensuing discovery that ivarr ragnarson had bloodeagled two people during his own flight to the ships hed had no business doing that you used the bloodeagle only for a reason to make a point you cheapened it otherwise there was no point to be made when you were beaten and running home and when you did it to a farmhand and a girl ivarr marked from birth was strange and dangerous cold as the black snake that would crush the worldtree at the end of days and destroy its roots with venom a coward too poison arrows and a bow which didnt make him less threatening not with his grandfathers name to wield all of which knowledge did leave open the question of why thorkell had signed on to that ship joined a volgan family raid in the first place a blood feud two generations down ancient history for him long put behind or it should have been siggur volgansons grandsons were very clearly not what siggur had been and thorkell was no longer what he had been either was it sentiment longing for youth or just the lack of a better thought in his head no good answer a cyngael farmhouse inland was a long way to go and had been unlikely to offer much in the way of plunder the familys sworn vengeance wasnt his own blood feud though hed been there all those years ago when siggur was killed and his sword taken you could say he hadnt seen anything else to do since leaving home or you could say that in some fashion the darkhilled mistshrouded land of the cyngael was still entangled with his own destiny you could say hed missed the sea mankiller fortunemaker a parttruth but only that thünir and ingavin might know how it was or the golden sun god but thorkell wouldnt claim to have an answer himself men did what they did right now in the close rank darkness of a foetid alley outside a tavern in esferth what he was doing was waiting for a man hed recognized earlier in the day to come out and piss against the wall hed been in the huge sloperoofed great hall at the kings feast this evening without formal duties since aeldreds servants were attending to their guests hed made his way to the high table during an interlude in the serving of courses to ask permission of the cleric to go outside why so ceinion of llywerth had asked him softly though the man was no fool and thorkell who wasnt either hadnt lied murmured saw someone i dont think should be here want to check what hes about true as far as it went ceinion thick grey eyebrows very slightly arched had hesitated and then nodded his head people were looking at them not a time or place to talk thorkell hadnt been sure what hed have done if the cleric hadnt given his consent had acted otherwise he could have slipped out without asking permission in that crowded noisy hall probably should have wasnt certain why hed gone up to ask his hip was paining him it sometimes did at night even though it hadnt been raining of late theyd covered a deal of rough ground the past few days to come out in a meadow this morning where the anglcyn royal children were having an outing on the grass thorkell had actually felt a change in the way of the world seeing that it was not the sort of thing the anglcyn would have even considered barely a days ride from the sea in the years when thorkell himself was young and he and siggur and other raiders were beaching longships wherever they pleased along this coast or on the other side of the channel in ferrieres ingemar svidrirson had even ruled these lands for a brief time but hed failed to capture the youngest son of the king hed bloodeagled a mistake hed paid for it though not with his life surprisingly his own youngest son was here now it turned out an envoy from a tributepaying erling the world had altered greatly in twentyfive years all old men thought that way he supposed came with the bad hip and the shoulder you could let yourself be bitter he looked towards the mouth of the alley again couldnt see much hed seen enough when theyd come through the gate today a welllaidout builtup town esferth the court more often here now than in raedhill aeldred was building everywhere word was walled burhs within a days ride of each other garrisons within them a standing army the borders expanding tribute from erlond a marriage planned in rheden no easy raiding here not any more which was why he was in this ratskitter alley instead of in the bright hall for those truths raised an important question about the man hed recognized when they had passed into town this afternoon with the king the two men hedrecognized actually the questions that came to you were sometimes not always answered if you waited patiently enough thorkell heard a noise from the street saw a shadow someone entered the alley he remained motionless his eyes had adjusted by now and he saw that this time the figure stumbling out of the tavern to unbutton himself and piss into darkness among the strewn garbage was the man hed rowed and raided with twentyfive years before the one whod gone off to join the mercenaries at jormsvik around the same time thorkell had escaped home and bought his land on rabady word had come with summer traders and gossip that stefa had killed his man in the challenge before the gates which hadnt surprised thorkell stefa had known how to fight it was all he knew how to do if you didnt count drinking this particular erling in esferth tonight was no peaceful trader from the settled eastern end of this island not if he was still a jormsvik mercenary stefa was alone in the alley now he might not have beenit was a blessing perhaps thorkell coughed stepped forward and spoke the mans name calmly enough then he twisted violently to his right banging hard against the rough wall as stefa wheeled piss spraying and thrust for his gut with a swiftly drawn knife a man who knew how to fight and drink a long afternoon and evenings worth of ale most likely thorkell was entirely sober and seeing better than stefa in the dark it allowed him to avoid the knife pull his own blade in the same motion and sheathe it between two ribs of the other man up towards the heart he too knew how to fight as it happened it didnt leave you that knowing your body might slow down but you knew what you needed to do hed no idea by now how many souls hed sent to whatever their afterworld might be he cursed afterwards because he was in some pain having banged his hip against the wall dodging and because he hadnt meant to kill the other man until hed learned a few things principally what stefa was doing here a mistake to have used the name the man had reacted like a frightened sentry to a footfall in the dark hed probably changed his name when he got into jormsvik thorkell decided rather too late he swore again at himself he dragged the dead man farther back into the alley hearing the rats scuttle and scurry and the sound of some larger animal moving hed just finished doing thatand taking stefas purse from his beltwhen he heard another man at the mouth of the laneway he stood still in the blackness and saw him enter also to relieve himself there was enough light at the entrance from the torch outside the tavern for him to see that this was the other man he knew he said nothing this time a lesson learned waited until this one was busy with what hed come out to do and then moved silently forward he clubbed the second erling hard on the back of the head with the bone haft of his knife caught him as he slumped then thorkell einarson stood for some moments thinking hard though not especially clearly supporting the unconscious body of the son hed left behind when they exiled him eventually he made a decision because he had to perhaps not the best one but he wasnt sure what the best one would be given that hed already killed stefa he propped bern against the wall for a moment braced him with his good shoulder and tied his trouser drawstrings to let him be decent at least it was too dark to see his sons face clearly bern had grown a beard seemed bigger across the chest ought to have been more careful his father thought should have known his companion had come out before him have been looking for stefa on the alert when he didnt see him thorkell shook his head in some endeavours the lessons you needed to learn might come over time and with no greater risk than a masters reprimand if you were going to raid on the longships you could die if you learned too slowly on the other hand if he was understanding this rightly bern had managed to get himself into jormsvik which said something for a lad who had been condemned to a servants life by what his father had done hed taken himself off the isle and more than that you had to kill a fighter to join the mercenaries he didnt imagine bern would feel kindly towards him now or ever he thought of his wife then wondering about her though not for long there wasnt much point a shared life gone that one like the wake of a longship when it moved on through the sea you needed to steer clear of thoughts like that they were dangerous as the rocks of a lee shore heimthra longing for home could kill a man from within hed seen it happen thorkell hoisted his sons body over his shoulder and headed for the mouth of the alley and the street men passed out all the time near drinking places everywhere in the world woke in grey dawn with rat bites and purses clipped he had reason to hope the two of them would be seen as a taverngoer carrying a drunken friend he was limping with the weight and the pain in his hip that might help the deception he thought ruefully it didnt in the event happen that way someone spoke to him as soon as they reached the street are you going to bring the other one too or is he dead he stopped where he was a womans voice across the way from the shadows there thorkell stood still cursing fate and himself in equal measure as always he looked left and right no one nearby no one to have heard her a small blessing that might save him and bern the taverns wall torch guttered and smoked in its iron bracket he heard the steady noise from within the same sounds from any tavern everywhere a man might go but shouldering the body of his son hearing a woman address him from the dark thorkell einarson felt a strangeness take hold as if hed entered a part of the world that wasnt quite the royal city of esferth in the anglcyn lands of king aeldreda place for which he could not properly have prepared himself however experienced he might be given that unsettling thought and being an erling and direct by nature he drew a breath and crossed the roadway straight towards the sound of the voice when he drew nearshe didnt back away from himhe saw who this was and that stopped him again he was silent looking down at her trying to make some sense of this you shouldnt be here alone he finally said i have no one to fear in esferth said the woman she was young she was in fact the younger daughter of king aeldred in a thin cloak the hood thrown back to reveal her face to him you could fear me he said slowly she shook her head you wouldnt murder me it would make no sense men dont always do sensible things thorkell said she lifted her chin so you did kill the other one the first man not at all sure why he nodded his head yes so you see i might do the same again she ignored that staring at him who was he he was in such a strange world right now this entire conversation aeldreds daughter bern on his shoulder stefa dead in the alley a shipmate once but for the moment he told himself he had one goal and the rest had to follow if he could make it do so he was an erling mercenary he said from jormsvik i am almost certain not a trader pretending to be jormsvik surely not would they be so foolish to try raiding here she knew of them he hadnt expected that either in a girl he shook his head id not have thought so depends who hired them her composure was extraordinary and this one she asked gesturing towards the body he carried the one you didnt kill she was keeping her voice low not alerting anyone yet he held to that as to a spar he was going to need her if only to have her not call the watch and have him seized he wasnt a man to kill her where she stood it was true and shed guessed it too sure of herself but not wrong thorkell hesitated then rolled the dice again with an inward shrug my son he said though i have no idea why why hes your son he heard amusement laughed himself briefly every man wonders that but no why hes here he was with the other i believe so he hesitated threw dice again there wasnt much time my lady will you help me get him outside the walls hes a raider she said hes here to report on what he finds which was almost certainly true she was quick among everything else and he will tell his fellows that he was detected and his companion captured or killed and that you will be ready for them coming to find them even his message will be that they must sail you think he nodded it was plausible might be true the part he didnt tell her wouldnt affect esferth only berns own life and not for the better but there was only so much a father could do once a boy was grown fledged out in the world the woman looked at him he heard the tavern behind him again a rising and subsiding noise someone shouted an oath someone cursed back amid spilling laughter i will have to tell my father tomorrow she said finally he drew a breath hadnt realized hed been holding it but you will do that tomorrow she nodded you would really do this thorkell asked shifting his stance under the weight he carried because you are going to do something for me she said and so with a sense that he was still treading some blurred border between known things and mystery thorkell drew another breath this time to ask her the question he probably ought to have asked as soon as hed seen her out here alone he never did ask it his answer came in another way she laid a sudden hand on his arm holding him to silence then pointed across the street not to the tavern door or the alley but towards a small unlit chapel two doors farther up someone had stepped outside letting the chapel door swing shut behind him he stood a moment looking up at the sky the blue moon overhead and then began to walk away from them as he did a shape detached itself from blackness and padded over to him and with that thorkell knew who this was he was praying aeldreds daughter murmured im not sure why but hell be going outside now beyond the walls what thorkell said a little too loudly why would he do that hes going to his rooms had enough of the celebration his brother died i know she said eyes still on the man and dog moving down the empty street but your rooms are the other direction he is going outside thorkell cleared his throat she was right about the rooms how do you know what hes doing she looked at him im not certain how and i dont like it but i do know so i need someone with me and jad seems to being saying it will be you thorkell stared at her with you what is it you want to do i want to pray actually but there isnt time im going to follow him she said and dont ask me why why he asked involuntarily she shook her head thats moonmad alone no with you remember itll get your son out of esferth her voice changed you swear you think it will deter them the raiders whoever they are swear it thorkell paused id say yes in any case you know but i do think so i swear it by jad and ingavin both and you wont run away to them with your son that would be a thought shed have he realized he snorted my son will want nothing to do with me and id be killed by the raiders for certain if these are who i think they are she glanced down the street again the man and dog were almost out of sight who are they the leaders name wont mean anything to you its someone who will want areport that esferth and the burhs are unassailable we are but same question back how are you so sure he was used to this kind of talk though not with a woman different answer im not certain this is a raiders guess my lady wed best move if you want to follow that cyngael he saw her take a breath this time and then nod she stepped into the street lifting her hood as she did so he went with her along an empty moonlit lane that seemed of the world and not entirely so the tavern noises receded became sea murmur and then silence as they went the man below was an honoured guest a prince companion of the cyngael cleric the king had been watching for all summer ebor son of bordis up on the wallwalk by the western gate answered a quiet summons and came down the steps to that lilting voice the gates loomed in the dark seeming higher from down on the ground newly reinforced this past year king aeldred was a builder ebor saw a man with a dog greeted him heard a courteously phrased request to be allowed outside for a time to walk under moonlight and stars feel wind away from the smoke and noise of the great hall and the town he was countryborn ebor could understand such a need it was why he was up here so much of the time himself it occurred to him suddenly to invite the cyngael up to the wallwalk with him but that would be a great presumption and it wasnt what the man had asked of him it isnt quiet out there tonight all the tents my lord he said im certain of that but i wasnt intending to go that way some of the others in the fyrd didnt like the cyngael small dark devious cattle thieves and murderers they named them mostly that came from those anglcyn north of here near the valleys or the hills where the ghost wood ended along which the rheden wall had been built to keep the cyngael out years of skirmishing and larger battles could shape such a feeling but ebor was from the good farmland east of here not north or west and his own dark childhood stories and memories were about erlings coming up from the dangerous sea the people of the west were no real enemy compared to longship berserkirs drunk on blood ebor had nothing himself against the cyngael he liked the way they talked the night was quiet enough little wind now if he listened he could hear the sounds from outside though there were a great many men sleeping in tents around to the north with the fyrd here and esferth full to bursting in the runup to the fair no danger presented itself to this royal guest out there unless he found a drunken dice game or took a woman with toosharp fingernails into a field or hollow and it wasnt ebors task in life to save a man from either of those the cyngael had spoken with dignity no arrogance hed offered ebor a coin not too much not too littlea sum fitting the request a quiet man something on his mind far from home just now ebor looked at him and nodded his head he took the iron key from his belt and unlocked the small door beside the wide gate and he let them out the man and the dark grey hound at his side a minor encounter in the scheme of things far from the first time someone had had reason to go out after dark in peaceful times ebor turned to go back up to his place on the wall the other two called to him before he reached the top when he came back down the steps and saw who it was this time ebor understoodrather too latethat there was nothing minor unfolding here after all the man this time was an erling carrying someone over his shoulder passed out in drunkenness that happened every night the woman however was the kings younger daughter the princess kendra and it never even entered ebors head to deny her anything she might ask of him she asked for the door to be unlocked again ebor swallowed hard may may i summon an escort for you my lady i have one she said thank you open it please tell no one of this on pain of my displeasure and watch for us to let us back in when we come she had an escort an erling carrying a drunken man it didnt feel right with a sick feeling roiling his guts ebor opened the small door for the second time they went out she turned back thanked him gravely walked on he closed the door behind them locked it hurried up the stairs two at a time to the wallwalk he leaned out watching them for as long as he could as they went into the night he couldnt see very far he didnt see when the erling turned south alone limping carrying his burden and the princess went northwest also alone in the direction the cyngael and his dog had gone it occurred to ebor staring into night that this might have been a tryst of some kind a lovers meeting the cyngael prince and his own princess then he decided that made no sense at all they wouldnt have to go outside the walls to bed each other and the erling what was that about and rather belatedly the thought came to ebor that he hadnt seen any weaponno sword or even a knifecarried by the young cyngael who had spoken to him so softly with music in his voice it was desperately unwise to go outside without iron to defend yourself why would anyone do that he was sweating he realized could smell himself he stayed where he was watching staring out as was his duty here as the princess had told him to do and in the meantime he began to pray which was a duty all men had in the night while jad did battle beneath the world on their behalf against powers of malign intent he laid his son down by the bank of the stream not far from where theyd come walking this morning and found the royal children idling on the grass with time now a little and a bit more light with the blue moon reflecting off the river thorkell looked down at the unconscious figure reading what changes he could and what seemed to be unchanged he stayed like that for some moments he was not a soft man in any possible way but this had to be a strange moment in a mans life no one could deny it he hadnt thought to ever see his son again his face was unrevealing in the muted moonlight he was thinking that there was danger for the boy not a boy any more if he was left here in the dark helpless beasts or mortal predators might come on the other hand there was only so much a father could do and hed made a promise that mattered to the girl he probably wouldnt have made it out without her would have tried of course but it was unlikely he looked at bern by moonlight and spent a moment working out how old his son was the beard aged him but he remembered the day bern was born and it didnt seem so long ago really and now the boy was off rabady somehow and raiding with the jormsvikings though it made so little sense for them to be here thorkell had his thoughts on that on what was really happening his sons breathing was even and steady if nothing came here before he woke hed be all right thorkell knew he ought to leave before bern opened his eyes but it was oddly difficult to move away the strangeness of this encounter a sense of a god or gods or blind chance working in this it didnt even occur to him to run away with bern where would he go for one thing he was almost certain who had paid for the jormsvik ships however many there turned out to be he shouldnt have been quite so sure really but he did know a few things and they fit ivarr ragnarson had not been caught fleeing from brynnfell two bloodeagled bodies to the west had been the marks of his passage the cyngael had never found the ships ivarr had made it home stood to reason something else did too no thinking man bought mercenaries to raid the anglcyn coast any more a waste of money of time of lives not with what aeldred had been doingand was still doingwith his standing army and his burhs and even a fleet of his own being built along this coastline now mercenaries might risk it if you paid them enough but it didnt make sense you sailed from vinmark and raided east and south through karch now even down to the trading stations of overstretched sarantium or along the ferrieres coast or possibly you went past here west to the cyngael lands not much to be gleaned there these days for the exposed treasurehouses of the sanctuaries had long since been removed inland and inside walls and the three cyngael provinces had never had overmuch in the way of gold in any case but a man a particular man might have his reasons for taking dragonships and fighting men back there the same reasons hed had at the beginning of summer and one more now a brother newly dead to join a blood feud that had begun long ago and if this was so if it was ivarr thorkell einarson had good reason to expect nothing but a bad death were he to run away now with his son towards the coast looking for the ships that would be lying offshore or beached in a cove ivarr repellent and deadly as anyone hed ever known would remember the man who had blocked the arrow hed loosed at brynn ap hywll from the wooded slope he really oughtnt to have been so sure of all this but he was something to do with the night the mood and strangeness of it ghost moon overhead nearness to the spirit wood beyond the margins of which men never went that girl going out for no reason that made sense just following the cyngael prince there was something at work tonight you raided and fought long enough survived so many different ways of dying you learned to trust your senses and this feeling bern hadnt learned enough yet else hed not have been so easily taken in an alley thorkell grimaced an expression creasing his features for the first time fool of a lad it was a hard world they lived in you couldnt afford to be a fool the boy was making a start though had to acknowledge that everyone knew how you joined the mercenaries in jormsvik the only way you could join them thorkell looked down at the brownhaired brownbearded figure on the grass a different man might have acknowledged pride thorkell didnt have time to linger to ask how bern had done any of this nor did he presume that his only son awakening would smile in delight and cry his fathers name aloud and ingavins in thankfulness bern shouldnt be long from waking he would have to hope that was so that this isolated place wouldnt draw wolves or thieves in the next while the boy had filled out across the chest he saw you could almost call him a big man he still remembered carrying him years ago shook his head at that weak thoughts too soft men woke each morning lay down each night in a bloodsoaked world you needed to remember that and he needed to walk back to the girl jaddite now or not he murmured an ancient prayer fathers blessing habit nothing else ingavins hammer between you and all harm he turned to go paused andberating himself even as he didtook from his beltpurse something hed removed when he surrendered to the cyngael for the second time in twentyfive years he carried it now instead of wearing it the hammer on a chain you didnt wear the symbols of the thunder god when you took the faith of jad it was an entirely ordinary unremarkable hammer thousands like it bern wouldnt know it as anything unique but hed realize it was an erling who had carried him here and hed go back to the ships with the warning that implied hed have some talking to do to explain his survival when stefa never came back but thorkell couldnt help him with that a boy became a man had his own stony way to make on land and sea like everyone elsethen you died where you died and found out what happened then thorkell had killed an oarcompanion tonight hadnt meant to do that not truly a friend stefa but theyd shared things covered each others back in battle slept on cold ground close for warmth in wind you did that raiding then you died where you died an alley in esferth for stefa pissing in the dark he wondered if the dead mans spirit was out here probably was blue moon shining he bent and looped the chain into his sons fingers and closed them over the hammer and then he went away along the stream not looking back covering ground towards where hed seen the princess walking in her own folly there was a snatch of verse in his head as he went one his wife used to sing to all three children when they were young he put it out of his mind too soft for tonight for any night he is coming she knows it is waiting within the trees across the stream he is mortal and can see her they have spoken under stars no moons on the night she took a soul for the queen he has watched the ride go through their pool in the wood then dropped his iron blade and very nearly touched her by the trees on the slope above the farm it has not left her that moment from then until now no quietude in wood in mound crossing water under stars with the music of the ride all around she trembles an aspen leaf her hair violet then a paler hue she is far from home one moon in the sky a glowing at the woods edge waiting eight ingavin and thünir were many things but they were soulreapers before all else and the ravens that followed them the birds of the battlefield and the banners were emblems of that so was the bloodeagle a sacrifice and a message a vanquished king or warleader stripped naked under the holy sky thrown on the ground his face to the churned earth if he wasnt dead he would be restrained by strong warriors or with ropes tied to pegs hammered into the earth or both his back would be carved vertically with a long knife or an axe the bloody opening pulled wide his ribs cracked back on each side and his lungs drawn out through the opening thus made they would be draped upon the exposed cage of his ribs the folded wings of an eagle bloodcrimson god offering it was said that siggur volganson the volgan had been so precise and swift in performing the ritual that some of his victims remained alive for a time with their lungs exposed to the watching gods ivarr had not yet been able to achieve this in fairness hed had less opportunity than his grandfather had enjoyed during the years and seasons of the great raids times changed times changed burgred of denferth viciously cursing himself for carelessness nonetheless knew that none of the other leaders at court or of the fyrd would have taken more than seven or eight riders to investigate the rumour of a ship or ships seen along the coast hed had five men two of them newusing the ride south to assess them three of those men were dead now assessment rendered meaningless but no one was raiding the anglcyn coast these days how could he have expected what hed foundor what had found his small party tonight aeldred had burhs all along the coast watchtowers between them a standing army andas of this summerthe beginnings of a proper fleet for the first time the erlings themselves were different in this generation settlers in the eastern lands half of them or something like that were jaddite now trimming their sails to the winds of faith times changed men changed those still roaming the seas in dragonships pursuing sanctuary treasures and ransom and slaves went to ferrieres now or east where burgred had no idea and didnt care what they found the lands of king aeldred were defended that was what mattered and if some erlings remembered this king as a hunted fugitive in wintry swamplands well those same erlings were humbly sending their household warriors or their sons with tribute to esferth these days and fearing aeldreds reprisals if they were late none of which unassailable truths was of any help to burgred now it was night summer stars ocean breeze a waning blue moon they had camped on open ground less than a days ride from esferth between the burh of drengest where the new shipyard was and the watchtower west of it he could have reached either place but he was training men testing them it was a mild sweet night had been the two on guard had shouted their warnings properly thinking back burgred decided that he and his men had surprised the erling party as much as theyd been surprised themselves unfortunately there were at least twenty erlingsalmost half a longships worthand they were skilled fighters disturbingly so in fact commands had been barked registered implemented in a night skirmish it hadnt taken him long to realize where these men were from and to accept what life and ill fortune had doled out tonight hed ordered his men to drop their weapons though not before the two guards and one other of his companyotho who was a good manlay dead no great shame surrendering to a score of jormsvik mercenaries mad enough to be ashore this near to esferth he had no idea why they were here the mercenaries were far too pragmatic to offer themselves for raids as foolhardy as this one would be who would pay them enough to even consider it and why it made too little sense and it was not a puzzle worth having more men die while he tried to solve it best surrender much as it burned to do that let them sell him back to aeldred for silver and safe passage to wherever they were really going we yield ourselves he cried loudly and dropped his sword on the moonlit grass they would understand him the two languages borrowed from each other and the older jormsvik raiders would have been here many times in their youth you have been foolish beyond all credit to come here but sometimes folly is rewarded for jad works in ways we do not understand the largest of the erlingseyes behind a helmgrinned and spat jad you say i think not your name he rasped he already knew what this was about no reason to hide it indeed the whole point was his name and what it was worth it would save his life and the lives of his three surviving men these were mercenaries i am burgred earl of denferth he said captain of king aeldreds fyrd and his household guard hah roared the big man in front of him laughter and shouts from the others raucous and triumphant unable to believe their good fortune they knew him of course they knew him and experienced men would also know that aeldred would pay to have him back burgred cursed again under his breath what are you doing here he asked angrily do you not know how little you can win along this coast now when did the men of jormsvik begin selling themselves for small coin and certain battle he had spent his entire life it seemed fighting them and studying them he was aware of a hesitation we were told drengest could be taken the man in front of him said finally burgred blinked drengest you are mocking me there was a silence they werent mocking him burgred laughed what fool told you that what fools listened to him have you seen drengest yet you must have the erling planted his sword in the earth removed his helm his long yellow hair was plastered to his head weve seen it he said you understand there are nearly one hundred men of the fyrd in there over and above the rest of the people inside the walls youve seen the walls youve seen the fleet being built you were going to attack drengest you know how close you are to esferth here what do you have thirty longships forty fifty is jormsvik emptied for this folly are you all summermad five ships the erling said at length shifting his feet a professional not a madman aware of everything burgred was saying which made this even harder to understand five longships meant two hundred men fewer if they had horses a large raid an expensive one but not nearly enough to come here you were led to believe you could take that burh where our fleets being built and guarded with five ships someone lied to you burgred of denferth said flatly last words spoken in a worthy life he had time to recall bewildered again that the erlings had always seen bows as the weapon of a coward before the moonlight left his eyes and he went to seek the god with an arrow in his chest guthrum skallson blinked in the moonlight not quite believing what hed just seen then he did believe it and turned he wasnt a berserkir had never been that wild on a battlefield was happy to wear armour thank you but the rage that filled him in that moment was very great and he moved swiftly with it crossed to the man with the bow and swung his arm in a full backhanded sweep smashing it into the archers face sending him sprawling in the bluetinted grass he followed still in a fury swearing bent over the crumpled form seized the fallen bow cracked it over his knee then grabbed the beltquiver and scattered the arrows with one furious wide wheeling motion in an arc across the summer field he was breathing hard at the edge of murder youll die for doing that the man on the ground said through a smashed mouth in his eerie voice guthrum blinked again he shook his head as if stunned it was not to be borne he lifted the man with one hand he weighed less than any of them by a good deal holding him in the air by the bunchedup tunic so his feet swung free guthrum pulled the knife from his belt no shouted atli behind him guthrum ignored that say it to me again he grunted to the little man dangling in front of him i will kill you for that blow said the man he held at his mercy the words came out half a whistle through bleeding lips right then said guthrum he moved the knife in a short practised motion and was brought up hard by a heavy hand seizing his wrist gripping fiercely pulling it back we wont get final payment if he dies atli grunted hold guthrum swore at him do you know how much silver he just cost us of course i know you heard the whitefaced coward threaten my life mine you struck him a blow ingavins blood he killed our ransom you thickheaded fool atli nodded right hes also paying us and hes a volganson the last one you want to go home with that blood on your blade well settle this on the ships best get out of here now and off this coast aeldredll be coming soon as they find these bodies of course he will then lets go we kill the last two atli awaited orders of course we kill them gasped the little man guthrum was still holding in the air guthrum threw him away into the grass he lay there crumpled and small not moving guthrum swore what he wanted to do was send the last two anglcyn back to esferth to explain to say the killing was unintended that they were leaving these shores there were a great many erlings hereabouts or living not far east of here the last thing jormsvik needed was their own people enraged because the anglcyn had cut off trading rights or raised the tribute tax or decided to kill a score of them and display the heads on pikes for the death of aeldreds earl and friend it could happen it had happened but he couldnt let them go back there was no explanation that would achieve anything useful living men would name the jormsvik raiders as the men whod killed an earl of the anglcyn with a cowards bow after hed surrendered it wouldnt do at all he sighed glared at the figure in the grass again kill them he said reluctantly then we move it is a truth hardly to be challenged that most men prefer not to have others decree the manner and time of their dying jormsvik mercenaries responsible on an individual and collective basis for so many deaths were not unaware of this at the same time the engrossing and unsettling events in that moonlit meadow from the time the anglcyn was shot to the moment guthrum issued that last order had compelled attentionand diverted it one of the captive anglcyn twisted in the moment guthrum spoke grabbed a boottop knife stabbed the nearest of the men guarding him ripped free of the belated clutch of another and tore off into the night not normally a problem there were twenty of them here they were swift and experienced fighters they did not however have horses and a moment later the fleeing anglcyn did six mounts had been tethered nearby they ought to have been claimed already they hadnt been the arrow the loss of an earls ransom guthrums assault on the man paying them there were reasons obviously but it was a mistake running hard they reached the other horses five of them mounted up without an order spoken no need for orders here they gave chase they were not horsemen however these erlings these dragonship raiders scourges of the white wave sea foam they could ride but not as an anglcyn did and he had chosen the best horsethe earls almost certainly the dead earls their lost ransom it was all bad then it got worse they heard his horn sound shattering the night the riders reined up hard the others on foot behind them in the meadow looked at each other and then at guthrum who was leading this party every man there knew they were in enormous peril suddenly inland on foot all but five of them a full day from the ships at least with a fortified burh and a guard tower nearby and esferth itself just to the north it would be day bright and deadly long before they got back to the shore guthrum swore again viciously he killed the last anglcyn himself almost absently a sword in the chest ripped out as soon as it went in wiped dry on the grass sheathed again the riders came back the accursed horn was still sounding shredding the dark you five ride back he rasped tell brand to land a ships worth of men start this way you guide them look for us well be coming fast as we can the way we came but if were chased we might be caught and well need more men in a fight forty enough atli asked no idea but i cant risk more lets go i want a horse said the small vicious man whod caused all this sitting up now on the grass ill lead them back fuck that forever said guthrum savagely you wanted to come ashore with us youll run back with us and if you cant keep up well leave you for aeldred theyd like a volganson i imagine get on your feet steady run all of you riders go the horn was still blowing fading east as they started back west themselves ivarr got up promptly enough guthrum saw ragnarson wiped at his mouth spat blood then started running with them he was lightboned quickfooted kept spitting blood for a time but said nothing more in the moonlight his features were stranger than ever the whiteness not entirely human ought to have been exposed at birth guthrum thought grimly looking like that as he came into the middleworld would have been in any other family hed been threatened with death by this one siggur volgansons heir it didnt occur to him to be afraid but he did regret not killing him an earl he kept thinking as they went an earl aeldreds friend from childhood they could have taken the prodigious ransom for burgred of denferth turned straight around and rowed home for a rich and easy winter in the jormsvik taverns instead they had a hard dangerous run ahead the horn would bring riders in the darkriders who would learn what had happened and who knew the terrain far better than they did they could die here he might have been a farmer by now guthrum thought repairing fences eyeing rainclouds before harvest time he actually amused himself briefly with the thought running through night in anglcyn lands it had never been likely farmers didnt go to ingavins halls or drink from thünirs horn when they were called from the middleworld hed chosen his life a long time ago no regrets under the blue moon and the stars the moon was over the woods bern saw awakening then he grasped that he was lying on grass looking up at trees beside a river in the dark hed been pissing in the alley and he sat up too quickly the moon lurched stars described arcs as if falling he gasped touched his head a lump the stickiness of blood he cursed confused his heart hammering looked around too quickly again the dizziness assaulted him blood loud in his ears he seemed to be holding something looked down at the object in his hand knew his fathers neck chain and hammer immediately no doubt no hesitation even here so far away from home from childhood small sons could be like that memorizing each and every thing about the father a figure larger than anything in the world filling the house then emptying it when he left on the dragonships again there were thousands of necklaces like this one and there was not one like it in the world the gods had made he was very still listening to the river running over stones the crickets and frogs there were fireflies above the water and the reeds the forest was black beyond the stream something had just happened that he could never even have imagined he tried to think clearly but his head was hurting his father was here had been in esferth had knocked him outor rescued him and taken him outside the walls and left this as a sign of what bern swore again his father had never been a man to make anything clear or easy but if he could take any idea from being here and holding thorkells necklace it was that his father wanted him out of esferth suddenly belatedly he thought about ecca who wassignificantlynot here outside the walls bern stood up then wincing unsteady he couldnt stay where he was there were always people outside a city especially now with the king present and all his household and a latesummer fair beginning soon there was a second citys worth of tents around to the north theyd seen them earlier when theyd come up finding so many people here had been a large issue ecca had wrestled with considerable anger as theyd come to understand what was happening in esferth and near it that supposedly unfinished burh on the coast drengest was entirely complete walls secure defended a number of ships already built in the harbour not even remotely a place where five ships worth of men could raid and run which is what theyd been told they could do and esferth itself which was supposed to be half empty exposed to an attack that would shape a legend was thronged with merchants and the anglcyn fyrd and aeldred himself was here with his household guard it was not a mistake not a misreading of signs ecca had snarled it appeared they had been lied to by the man whod paid them to come ivarr ragnarson the volgans heir the one everyone whispered ought surely to have been killed when he came out of his mothers womb white as a spirit hairless a malformed freak of nature unworthy of life and his lineage it was that lineage that had saved him everyone knew the tale how a volur in her trance had spoken to his father and forbidden him to expose the child ragnar siggurson hesitant by nature too careful never the strongest man following a father who had been the strongest of men had let the child live to grow up strange and estranged and vicious bern had his own thoughts about volurs and their trances not that it mattered he was desperately unsure what to do ecca was a shipmate his companion on this scouting mission a jormsvik raider didnt leave companions behind unless he had no choice at all they were bound to each other by oath and history but this was berns first raid he didnt know enough yet didnt know if this was a time when you did leave to carry an urgent message back should he return to esferth when the gates opened at sunrise and look for ecca or find gyllir in the wood where theyd left the horses and hurry to the ships with a warning was that the meaning in thorkells necklace in his being out here alone was ecca taken dead and if not what would happen if he returned to the ships after bern did and asked why his companion had left without him and just how in fact bern had gotten outside the walls how hed explain that bern had no idea and what if ecca rode back and the ships were gone because bern had told them it was wiser to cast off too many conflicting needs conjured thoughts hesitations of his own devising another son of a strong father he didnt know standing unsteadily alone by the water if he was direct enough for this raiding life hed be dealing more easily with all of this he thought if his head didnt hurt so much something caught his eye south and east a bonfire burning on a hill he watched that light in the darkness saw it occluded reappear vanish again return he realized after a moment that this was a message knew it could not possibly be good for him or for those waiting by the ships or for guthrums party ashore to the south the bonfire made his decision for him he placed his fathers necklace over his head and slipped it inside his tunic the necklace was meant to tell him that it was a friend his father a friend the irony in that whod taken him out of esferth if he was supposed to be out of esferth that meant trouble inside and he knew there was trouble theyd seen it this morning passing through the gates amid the crowds for the fair they had planned to stay only tonight learn what they could in the taverns ride back to the coast in the morning carrying their messageand warning and now a message in fire was lighting the night this was in no possible way a safe place to be coming ashore to raid the burh was walled and garrisoned they already knew that and esferth was thronged to bursting he had that message to deliver above anything else he took a breath put aside as best he could the fierce hard awareness that his father was out here somewhere in the night not far away and had evidently carried him to this place like a child bern turned his back on torchlit esferth and entered the stream to cross it he was midway into the river which wasnt cold when he heard voices he dropped down instantly silent amid reeds and lilies only his head above water in the dark and listened to the voices and the pounding of his heart alun had seen the glimmering twice on the journey east travelling here with ceinion once in the branches of a tree when theyd camped by a stream running out of the wood and he awoke in the night and once on a hillside behind them when he looked back after dark a shining at twilight though the sun had set hed known it was her wasnt sure if hed been meant to see or if shed come closer than shed intended cafall had been restless all through that coastal journey the erling had thought it was the nearness of the spirit wood she was following him he ought perhaps to have been afraid but that wasnt what he felt alun had thought about dai the night he died that pool in the wood souls lost and taken and it had occurred to him that he might never make music again his mother had taken to her chambers when he and gryffeth and the cleric had brought the tidings home she had stayed there a fourteennight opening only to her women when shed come out her hair had changed colour not as a faeries did shimmering through hues but as a mortal womans did when grief has come too suddenly owyn had covered his face with a hand alun remembered and turned and walked away at first word of dais death he had drunk a great deal for two days and nights then stopped had spoken after privately with ceinion of llywerth there was a history there not entirely a benign one but whatever lay behind the two men seemed altered by this owyn ap glynn was a hard man everyone knew that and he was a prince with tasks in the world brynn had said that same thing to alun too he had a new role himself he was heir to cadyr his brother was dead more than that those who told him that time and faith would assuage meaning well drawing on experience and wisdomeven his father even king aeldred herewere unaware had to be unaware of what alun knew about dai armoured in faith as ceinion and the anglcyn king were you could anneal the burning of loss with a belief that the souls of those who had gone were with jad and would be until all the worlds ended and the gods purposes were revealed and fulfilled faith was no help at all when you knew your brothers soul had been stolen by faeries on a moonless night alun prayed as required morning and evening with urgency it seemed to him sometimes that he heard his own voice echoing oddly as he chanted the responses of the liturgy he knew things had seen what he had seen and heard the music in that forest clearing as the fairies passed him by moving across the water there was a blue moon tonight spirit moon high above the woods hanging over them like some dark blue candle in a doorway these were part of the same forest they had skirted to the south a valley sliced westward pushing the trees back halfway down to the sea and the old tale was that the colder danger lay in the south but this was still named a ghost wood whatever the clerics might say he stood a moment looking at the trees he needed to walk through this doorway had known he would from first sighting of her that night when hed woken and again on the hill two days later at twilight forbidden heresy words that meant much but so little to him now he had seen her and his brother dais hand in the faerie queens walking on water after he died alun was unmoored and knew it a ship without rudder or sails no charts by which to navigate he had left the kings feast made his excuses as courteously as he could aware that the anglcyn courtalerted by ceinionwould feel genuine compassion for what they thought was his pain they had no idea hed bowed to the kinga compact man trimmed grey beard bright blue eyesand to the queen made his way from that crowded loud smoky room dense with the living and their concerns and gone alone to the chapel hed seen earlier in the day not the royal one this one was small dimly lit almost an afterthought on a street of taverns and inns and empty this late at night what he needed silence shadow the sun disk above the altar barely visible in this still space he had knelt and prayed for the god to lend him the power to resist what was pulling him but in the end rising he gave himself dispensation for being mortal and frail and so not strong enough there was a need in him and there was also fear he had a thought a memory and paused by the door of the chapel in that gloom lit only by a handful of guttering lamps too far apart on the walls alun ab owyn unbuckled his dagger and belt and set them down on a stone ledge in the halfdarkness hed worn no sword tonight not to a royal feast as an honoured guest he turned in the chapel doorway looked back in the gloom a last time to where the sun disk hung then he went out into the night streets of esferth cafall fell in beside him as always now he spoke to a guard at the gates and was allowed to pass hed knownwith certaintythat it would be so there were forces at work tonight beyond any adequate understanding alun went into the meadow beyond the esferth gates and walked steadily west the direction of home but not really home was too far away he came to the stream crossed through water to his waist cafall splashing beside him and on the other side he stopped and looked at the woods and turned to brynns doghis dogand said quietly no farther now wait here cafall pushed his head against aluns wet hip and thigh but when he said it again no farther the dog obeyed staying there beside the rushing water a grey shape almost invisible as alun went alone into the trees she knows the instant he enters among the first oaks and alders apprehending his aura before she sees him she stands in a glade by a beech tree as she did the first time a hand laid on it for sustenance sapstrength she is afraid but not only that he appears at the edge of the glade and stops her hair goes to silver purest hue essence of what she is what they all are silver around them in the first mound gleaming now lost undersea they sing to greet the white moon when it rises only the blue one tonight hidden from where they stand within the wood she knows exactly where it is however they always know where both moons are the blue is different more inward hues one does not always share with others just as she has not shared her coming east this journey she took a soul for the queen at the beginning of summer will not suffer for this following or not at the hands of the ride there are others in the wood though nearby and south to be feared she sees him step forward approaching over grass amid trees a dark wood far from home for both of them there is a spruaugh somewhere about which had angered and surprised her for she dislikes them all their green hovering shed shown her hair violet to him earlier and seethed and hed retreated chattering agitated she scans with the eye of her mind doesnt find his aura now didnt think he would be anywhere near after seeing her she makes herself let go of the tree takes a step forward he is near enough to touch to be touched her hair is shining she is all the light in this glade the trees in summer leaf occluding stars and moon shielding the two of them a shelter between worlds though there are dangers all around she remembers touching his face on the slope above the farm and the bloodsoaked yard as he knelt before her the memory changes the colour of her hair again it is not only fear she feels he does not kneel this time no iron about him he has left it behind coming to her knowing they are silent leaves and branches a canopy above the grass of the glade shimmering a breeze slight sound it dies away he says i saw you twice coming here was i meant to she can feel herself tremble wonders if he sees it they are speaking to each other it is not to happen it is a crossingover a transgressing she doesnt entirely understand his words meant to mortals the world they live within time different for them the speed of their dying she says you can see me since the pool isnt sure if that is what he meant they are speaking and alone here she reaches a hand backwards after all touches the tree again i should hate you he says said that also the other time she answers as before i dont know what that means hate a word they use fire in how they live a flame and then gone that fire a reason she has always been drawn but unseen until now he closes his eyes why are you here i followed you she lets go of the tree he looks at her again i know i know that why they think in this way it has to do with time one thing then another thing from it and then a next the way the world takes shape for them she has a thought alun felt as if his mouth were dry as earth her voice a handful of words made him despair again of the idea of making music of ever hearing anything to match there was a woodland scent to her night flowers and the lightchanging alwaysabout her in her hair the only illumination here where they were she was shining for him in a forest and he knew all the tales mortals entangled and ensnared within the halfworld who never made their way back or were found all changed when they did companions and lovers dead or aged bent into hoops dai was with the faerie queen walking upon water amid music coupling in the forested night dai was dead his soul stolen away why are you here he managed i followed you not his answer he looked at her i know i know that why she said because you put away your iron when you came up the slope to me before a question in it she was asking him if this was good enough as an answer she spoke cyngael in the old fashion the way his grandfather had talked it frightened him to think how old she might be he didnt want to think of that or ask how long did faeries live he felt lightheaded it was difficult to breathe he said a little desperately will you do me harm her laughter then first time rippling what harm could i do she lifted her arms as if to show him how delicate she was slender her fingers very long he could not have named the colour of the tunic she wore could see the pale sleek curve of her below it she extended a hand towards him he closed his eyes just before she touched his face with her fingers for the second time he was lost knew he was whatever the tales might say in warning he had been lost when he left the chapel to come out from behind mortal walls and enter this wood where men did not go he took her fingers in his hand and brought them to his mouth and kissed them then turned her palm to his lips felt her trembling as leaves did in wind heard her say very faintly music will you do me harm alun opened his eyes she was a silver shining in the wood beyond imagining he saw the trees around them and the summer grass not for all the light in all the worlds he said and took her in his arms there was very little light in the great hall now amber pools spilling from the two fires or where a cluster of men continued to throw dice at one end of the room and another pair of lamps at the head table where two men remained awake and talking and a third listened quietly a fourth figure slept there snoring softly his head on the board among the last uncleared platters aeldred of the anglcyn looked at the sleeping cleric from ferrieres and then turned the other way smiling a little we have exhausted him he said the cleric on his other side set down his cup it is late is it sometimes sleep feels wrong a surrendering of opportunity the king sipped his own wine he quoted cingalus at you you were very kind then no need to embarrass him aeldred snorted while he was citing you to yourself ceinion of llywerth shrugged i was flattered he didnt know you wrote it he was patronizing you that wouldnt have mattered if hed been right in what he argued a small sound at that from the third man both turned to him both smiling not weary of us yet my heart aeldred asked his younger son shook his head weary but not of this gareth cleared his throat fathers right he didnt even have the quotation properly true enough my lord prince ceinion was still smiling still cradling his wine im honoured that you knew it he was doing it from memory in fairness but he turned the meaning he argued against you with your own thought turned backwards you wrote the patriarch that there was no error in images unless they were made to be worshipped and he he cited me as saying images would be worshipped so he was wrong i suppose if you agree with what i wrote ceinions expression was wry it could have been worse he might have cited me as saying clerics should live chaste and unmarried the king laughed aloud young gareths brow remained furrowed why didnt he know it was you who wrote it the subject of their conversation remained where hed slumped asleep with most of the men in the darkened hall ceinion glanced from the son to the father he shrugged again ferrieres tends to look down on the cyngael much of the world does my lord even here if we are being honest you call us horse thieves and eaters of oats dont you his tone was mild unoffended he would find it alarming that a scholar cited and endorsed by the patriarch was from a place so marginal they used a rhodian name for me after all when they put my phrases in the pronouncement an easy error for him to make not knowing you didnt sign it as cingalus i sign everything i write said the other man gravely as ceinion of llywerth cleric of the cyngael there was a little silence he wouldnt even have expected you to be able to write in trakesian i imagine aeldred murmured or you to read it for that matter gareth the prince reads trakesian wonderful ceinion said im beginning only gareth remonstrated theres no only in that the cleric said perhaps we shall read together while i am here id be honoured gareth said his mouth quirked itll keep you from our horses a startled silence then ceinion burst out laughing and so did the king the cleric mimed a blow at the prince my children are a great trial aeldred said shaking his head all four of them but gareth reminds me i have new texts to show you ceinion turned to him indeed aeldred allowed himself a satisfied smile indeed in the morning after prayers we shall go see what is being copied and it is ceinion was unable to mask eagerness nothing so very much said the king with a show of indifference only a physicians tract one rustem of esperaña on the eye collating galinus and adding his own remedies oh glorious my lord how in the gods name did you a ship from alrassan stopped at drengest earlier this summer on its way back from trading with the erlings at rabady they know i am buying manuscripts rustem thats three hundred years old a treasure ceinion exclaimed though softly among the sleepers in trakesian aeldred smiled again in two languages friend trakesian and his original bassanid holy jad but who reads bassanid the language is gone since the asharites no one yet but with both texts now we will soon be able to i have someone working on that the trakesian text unlocks the other one this is a glory and a wonder ceinion said he made the sign of the disk i know it is youll see it in the morning it will give me great joy there was another silence that opens a doorway for me actually the king said his tone remained light the question ive been waiting to ask the cleric looked at him an exchange of glances in the island of light far down the room someone laughed as dice rolled and stopped and fortune smiled however briefly my lord i cannot stay ceinion said quietly ah and thus the door closes aeldred murmured ceinion held his gaze in the lamplight you know i cannot my lord there are people who need me we were speaking of them remember the oateaters no one respects at the edge of the world were as much at the edge ourselves aeldred said no you arent not at this court my lord all praise to you for that but you wont help me take it further i am here now ceinion said simply and you will come back as often as i may another small rueful smile for the nourishing of my own spirit unworthy as that might be you know what i think of this court you are a light to us all my lord the king did not move you would make us brighter ceinion the cleric sipped from his cup before answering it would nourish my own desires to do so to sit here and share learning as old age comes do not think i am not tempted but i have tasks in the west we cyngael live where the farthest light of jad falls the last light of the sun it needs attending to my lord lest it fail the king shook his head it is all marginal here in the northlands aeldred said how do we build anything to last when it might come down at any time that is true of all men my lord of everything we do anywhere and not more so here truly ceinion inclined his head you know i agree with you i merely cite text and doctrine yes but if you refrain from doing that if you answer honestly what happens here if the harvest fails in a year the erlings decide to come back in numbers not just raiding do you think i have forgotten the marshes do you think any of us who were there lie down at night any night without remembering ceinion said nothing aeldred went on what happens to us if carloman or his sons in ferrieres quell the karchites as they likely will and decide they want more land for themselves he looked at the sleeping man on his other side youll beat them back ceinion said or your sons will i do believe there is that here which will endure i am less certain of my people still fighting each other still seduced by pagan heresies he paused looked away again and then back he shrugged you spoke of the marsh tell me of your fevers my lord aeldred made an impatient gesture one that served as a reminderif one were neededthat this was a king i have physicians ceinion who have done little enough to ease them osbert tells me osbert tells you too much and that you know well is untrue i brought something with me do i give it to you or to him or whichever physician you trust i trust none of them this time it was the king who shrugged give it to osbert if you must jad will ease my affliction when it pleases him to do so i am reconciled to that does that mean we who love you must be ceinions voice carried just enough amusement to make aeldred look closely at him and then shake his head i am made to feel like a child sometimes by these fevers and why not we are all still children in some fashion i can remember skipping stones into the sea as a boy then learning my letters my wedding day there is no shame in that my lord there is in helplessness that stopped him in the silence young gareth rose took the flaskthere were no servants near them nowand poured for the cleric and his father ceinion sipped at the wine changed the subject again tell me of the wedding my lord judits unless there is another in the offing the cleric smiled the ceremonies will be there during the midwinter rites she goes north to rheden to make babies and bind two peoples again the way her mother did marrying me what do we know of the prince calum hes young younger than she is ceinion looked down the hall back to the king it is a good union an obvious one aeldred hesitated his turn to look away her mother has asked me to let her go after the wedding it was news a confiding to jads house aeldred nodded took up his wine cup again he was looking at his younger son and ceinion realized this would be news for the prince as well a time chosen for the telling late night by lamplight she has wanted this for a long time ceinion said and you have agreed now or you wouldnt be telling me aeldred nodded again it was not uncommon for men or women nearing their mortal ending to seek out the god pulling back and away from the tumult of the world it was rare for royalty the world not so easily left behind for many reasons where will she go the cleric asked retherly in the valley where our infants are buried shes been endowing the daughters of jad there for years a wellknown house will be better known with a queen i imagine ceinion listened for but did not hear bitterness he was thinking about the prince on his other side didnt look that way giving gareth time after the wedding he said so she intends carefully ceinion said we are not supposed to grieve if someone finds her way or his to the god i know that gareth suddenly cleared his throat do the others know of this his voice was rough his father who had chosen his moment said athelbert no your sisters might im not certain you may tell them if you like ceinion looked from one to the other aeldred it occurred to him would not necessarily be an easy man to have for a father not for a son at any rate hed had a good deal of wine but his thinking was still clear and the name had now been spoken a doorway of his own perhaps they were as much alone as they were likely to be and the younger son listening had a thoughtful nature he drew breath and spoke i have he said another wedding thought if you might entertain it you want a wife again the kings smile was gentle so was the clerics responding not this woman i am too old and unworthy he paused again then said it i have in mind someone for prince athelbert aeldred grew still the smile faded this is the heir of the anglcyn friend i know it my lord believe me you want peace west of the wall and i want my people drawn into the world from their feuds and solitude it cant be done aeldred shook his greying head decisively if i choose a princess from any of your provinces i declare war on the other two destroy the purpose of a union the other man smiled you have been thinking about this of course i have it is what i do but what answer is there then and so ceinion of llywerth said softly with the voicemusic the cyngael carried with them through the world there is this one answer lord brynn ap hywll who slew the volgan by the sea and might have been our king had he wanted it has a daughter of an age to be wed her name is rhiannon and she is the jewel of all women i know unless that be her mother the father is known to you i dare say aeldred stared at him without speaking for a long time the ferrieres cleric snored cheek to the wooden board they heard laughter again and a muffled curse from down the room a sleepy servant prodded the nearer fire with an iron rod a door opened before the king spoke doors opened and closed all the time without consequence or weight this one was behind them not the double doors at the far end of the hall a small door an exit for the king and his family should they wish one a tall man had to stoop to go through a passage to inner quarters privacy the sleep one would have assumed to be coming soon tonight not so in the event for it is not given to men and women to know with any surety what is to come the doorways of our lives take many shapes and the arrivals that change us are not always announced by thunderous pounding or horns at the gates we may be walking a known laneway at prayer in a familiar chapel entering a new one and simply looking up or we may be deep in quiet talk late of a summers night and a door will open behind us ceinion turned saw osbert son of cuthwulf aeldreds lifelong companion and his chamberlain cuthwulf as it happened had been a name cursed in the cyngael lands a cattleraider and worse than that in more violent days another reason if more were needed the anglcyn were hated and feared west of the wall the erlings had killed cuthwulf by raedhill with his king the son osbert was a man ceinion had come to admire without stint or reservation after two sojourns here fidelity and courage judicious counsel quiet faith and manifest love these held their message for those who could see osbert moved forward with the limp he had carried away from a battlefield twenty years ago he came into the lamplight ceinion saw his face and even by that muted illumination he knew that something had come upon them through that door he set down his wine carefully peace ease leisure to build and teach to plant and harvest time to read ancient texts and consider them these were not the coinage of the north in other lands they might be to the south east in sarantium or perhaps in the gods other worlds not here what is it aeldred said his voice had altered he stood his chair scraping back osbert tell me ceinion would remember that voice and the fact that the king had been on his feet before hed heard anything knowing already and so osbert told them of signal flares lit on hills towards the south by the sea running in their chain of telling fire along the ridges with a message not a new tale ceinion thought hearing it nothing new here at all only the old dark legacy of these northlands which was blood nine will my own world be there when i leave you i dont know what you mean this is the world we have she was beside him very near the glade would have been dark were it not for the light she cast her hair was all around him coppercoloured now thick and warm he could touch it had been doing so in a wood on a summer night they lay in deep grass edge of a clearing sounds of the forest around them murmurous these woods had been shunned for generations by his people and the anglcyn both his fear was beside him however not among the trees we have stories those who went with faeries and came home a hundred years later spirit wood they named this forest one of the names was this what it meant her voice was lazy a slow music she said i might enjoy lying here that long he laughed softly startled felt himself suspended precariously between too many feelings almost afraid to move as if that might break something she turned onto an elbow in the grass looked at him a moment you fear us even more than we fear you he thought about that i think we fear what you might mean what can i mean i am just here he shook his head reached for clarity but here for so much longer than we are her turn to be silent he stared at her drinking slender grace with his eyes the otherness of her her breasts were small perfect she had arched her body back above him before in the light she made he wondered suddenly how he would pray from now on what words he could use did he ask forgiveness of his god for this for something the clerics taught did not even exist she said finally i think the speed of things for you makes the world more dear more painful her hair had slipped by invisible degrees towards silver again more dear you love more because you lose so quickly we dont know that feeling she gestured one hand as if reaching you live in in the singleness of things because they go from you well they do dont they but you come into the world knowing that it cannot be unexpected we die as well it just takes longer longer she agreed unless there is iron his belt and dagger were in the chapel in esferth he felt a renewed grief one of the suspended feelings here what she had just said loving more because losing he said is my brother still with the queen she raised an eyebrow of course but he wont be always nothing is always born into the world knowing that she saw he was distressed it takes a long time she said before she tires he is honoured much loved and he will be lost forever after that is always why lost why see it so because we are taught that that there is a harbour for our souls and his was taken and will not find the god now maybe that is what we fear in you that you can do this to us perhaps long ago we knew it about the faeries it was different once she agreed and then shyly after a moment we could fly then what how she turned still shy to show him her back and so he saw the ridges clearly hard smaller than breasts inside her shoulder blades and he understood that these were all that now remained of what had been faerie wings he imagined it creatures like her flying under blue moon or silver or at sunset an ache in his throat the envisaged beauty of it in the world once im sorry he said he reached out brushed one with a hand she shivered turned back to him there it is again the way you think sorrow it is so much in you i we do not live with that it comes with the speed doesnt it he thought about this didnt want to even guess how old she was she spoke cyngael the way his grandfather had he said it you speak my language so beautifully what does your own sound like she looked surprised a moment then amused the hair flashing it but this is my own tongue how do you think your people learned it he gaped closed his mouth our home is in those woods and pools she said west towards where the sun lies along the sea at days end there was not always so much distance between us he was thinking as hard as he could men spoke of the music in the voices of the cyngael now he knew a knowing like this night that shifted the world how was he going to pray she was looking at him still amused he said is this is tonight forbidden to you she took a moment to answer said the queen is pleased with me he understood both answer and hesitation she was protecting him in her way a kindness they could be kind it seemed the queen was pleased because of dai the taken soul he said looking at her but it is still seen as wrong isnt it you have some licence because of what you did but it is still there is to be distance yes just as for you he laughed this time distance you dont exist to say you are even here is heresy our clerics would punish me some would cast me out from chapel and rites if i even spoke of it the one from the pool wouldnt she said quietly he hadnt realized shed seen the cleric that night ceinion he might alun said he likes me because of my father i think but he wouldnt allow talk of faeries or the halfworld she smiled again halfworld i havent heard that in so long he didnt want to know how far back in the past something would have to be for her to think that way the slow uncoiling of time for them she stretched feral and sleek as a cat but you are wrong about that one he knows he came to the queen when his woman was dying what she laughed aloud quicksilver sound flutter and ripple in the glade softly i can hear you she murmured she touched him idly a hand on his leg he felt desire again was very nearly defined by it she said he came to the mound and asked if one of us might come with him to help her live she was coughing blood he brought silver for the queen and he wept among the trees outside he couldnt see us of course but he came to ask she pitied him alun said nothing couldnt speak he knew everyone knew about ceinions young wife and her death so do not say to me the faerie added stretching again that that one of all of you would deny us she didnt send anything did she he asked whispering both eyebrows arched she regarded him why think that she sent eldritch water from the pool and a charm she is gracious the queen honours those who honour her it didnt help she shook her head we are only what we are death comes i did what i could he almost missed it she sent you her eyes on his no distance between them in one way he needed only move a hand to touch her breast again i have always been most curious he sighed so great a strangeness the world altering moment by moment as the stars turned above them was it slow or fast that movement overhead did it depend on who was asking he said and tonight is being curious and for you is it not what else is there for it to be a different note in her voice now under the music he was gazing at her helpless to look away small even teeth in the wide thin mouth pale skin achingly smooth the changing hair dark eyes and vestiges of wings once they could fly i dont know he said swallowing im not wise enough i feel as if i could weep sorrow again she said why does it always come to that for you sometimes we can weep for joy do you can you understand that a longer silence then she shook her head slowly no i would like to but this is your cup not ours the otherness again this sense that he was both in and entirely outside the world he knew he said tell me esferth and the others will be there when i go from here she nodded calmly though some of them wont be he stared a hard thumping of the heart what do you mean they are starting to ride out there is anger men taking horse bearing iron he sat up holy jad how do you know she shrugged the question he realized was foolish how could he understand how she knew things how could she answer him even in the tongue they shared the language her people had taught his he stood up began putting on his clothes she watched him he was aware might always be aware now of the haste of his doing this seen through her eyes the way he and the others lived i must go he said if something has happened someone died she said gravely there is sorrow the aura of it the speed of their dying he looked at her holding his tunic in both hands he cleared his throat dont envy us that he said but i do she said simply small sleek shining otherness in the grass will you come back into the wood he hesitated and then a thought came that could not have come a night before when he was younger will you sorrow if i do not her eyebrows lifted again but in surprise this time she moved a hand same gesture as before as if reaching for something then slowly she smiled looking up at him he pulled on his tunic no belt because of the iron he turned to leave he hadnt answered her question either he had no answer to give he looked back from the glades dark edge she was still sitting there on the grass unclothed in her element sorrowless the voices in the darkness began moving away to the north bern remained where he was in the stream he had a thought broke off a reed might need to submerge himself he heard shouting men running someone rasped a curse an obscenity directed at erlings everywhere and the scabrous pustulent whores who gave them birth not a good time for this erling to be discovered hed been right then the signal fire had meant nothing good at all it was still burning more shouting now farther away towards esferth where the tents were the tents outside an overflowing city on the eve of a fair a city theyd been told would be almost empty one that they might even loot in a raid that would give rise to songs for generations to their glory and jormsviks glory bern decided was going to be hard to come by now he thought quickly keeping his breathing shallow and slow skallsons party had gone east from the ships a waste of time some had thoughtand the same had been said about bern and ecca going into esferth once they had learned about the fair but if they were to leave hereand it seemed evident they werewithout anything taken at all at least learn something before they went it had been decided salvage pride a flagons worth by carrying home report of aeldreds lands they might be mocked a little less by their fellows for returning emptyhanded swords unreddened no tales to tell a wasted journey at raiding seasons end his own first raid right now bern thought mockery might be the best they could hope for not the worst there were worse things than fireside jibes in winter if that bonfire was an alert it most likely meant guthrum skallsons party had been found and from the fury in the anglcyn voices still heading away from him ingavin be thanked something had happened and then he remembered that ivarr had been with skallsons party bern shivered in the water couldnt help it you shivered like that when a spirit passed someone newly dead and angry in that same instant he heard a soft splashing as someone entered the stream bern drew his dagger and prepared himself to die in water again third time now third time was said to mark power sacred to nikar the huntress wife to thünir three times was a gateway he had expected death in the night waters off rabady and again in the dawn surf outside jormsvik he tried to accept it once more now an ending waited for all men no one knew his fate everything lay in how you went to your dying he gripped his blade stay where you are he heard the voice low terse barely audible utterly and entirely known all the days of his life spare me the knife it went on softly ive been stabbed at already tonight and keep silent or they will find and kill you here his father added moving unerringly towards where bern was hidden submerged to his shoulders invisible in darkness unless you knew he was here not a mystery then this part at least hed gone straight into the stream from the place on the bank where his father had left him not magic not some impossible night vision brilliant raiders instinct i didnt think theyd offer me wine he murmured no greeting offered thorkell hadnt greeted him his father grunted coming up hows your head hurts want your neck chain back id have kept it if i wanted it you made a mistake in that alley you know the saga have thine eyes about you in hall or darkness be wary ever be watching always bern said nothing felt his face redden two horses thorkell asked calmly his fathers dark bulk was beside him thorkells voice close to his ear the two of them together in a stream at night in anglcyn lands how was this so what had the gods decided and how did men take hold of their own lives when this could happen he realized his heart was thumping hated that two horses he replied keeping his voice steady wheres ecca small hesitation that what he was calling himself was calling right bern said bitterly of course hes dead you know the same poet says no good ever whatever be thought was mead or ale to any man are you drunk the backhanded blow caught him on the side of the head by ingavins blind eye show respect i got you out of a walled city think on it i went to warn him he drew a blade to kill when i used his real name i made a mistake is your horse a good one a mistake one could weep or laugh killing the second man on the isle had been the mistake bern wanted to say he was still trying to wrap his mind around what was happening here my horse is gyllir he said struggled to keep anything out of his voice his father might read as youthful pride thorkell grunted again halldrs he didnt come after you halldrs dead the horse was for his burning that silenced his father for a moment at least bern wondered if he was thinking of his wife who had become halldrs and was widowed now alone and unprotected on rabady theres a tale to that i imagine was all thorkell said his voice had not changed at all why should it change though all the world bern knew had been altered entirely leave stefas mount his father said theyll need a horse to find after they get his body stefa with an effort bern kept his hand from going to his head the stars had swung again with the blow his father was a strong man theyll see the signs of two horses where we hid them bern said wont work it will ill find his horse and bring it out go now though and quicklysome fool killed burgred of denferth tonight aeldreds riding out himself i think what said bern his jaw dropping the earl why didnt they take him for ransom you tell me youre the mercenary hed have been worth your raid and more but that answer in fact he knew ivarr he said ragnarsons paying us ingavins blind eye i knew it his father rasped his old oath remembered from childhood familiar as smells and the shape of hands thorkell swore again spat into the stream he stood waistdeep in the water thinking then listen that ones going to want you to go west dont go it isnt a raid for jormsvik west whats west of here just and then as his father said nothing bern finally thought it through he swallowed cleared his throat blood he whispered vengeance for his grandfather and thats why he thats why he bought your ships and men whatever else he told you and thats why he wouldnt want a hostage he wants to go after the cyngael but with ransom paid for an earl youd turn and go home he was with the shore party wasnt he bern nodded it was sliding into place ill wager you land we dont own any more theyll find burgred with an arrow in him he said the burh was still unwalled that esferth would be almost empty thorkell grunted spat downstream again empty during a fair serpentsly that one poisons his arrows how do you know that no answer it occurred to bern that hed never spoken in this way with his father in his life nothing remotely resembling this terse conversation he didnt have time no time at all to unwind his own heldin rage the bitterness for lives marred thorkell still hadnt asked about his wife or gyllir or how bern had come to be in jormsvik fireflies darting around them bern heard bullfrogs and crickets no human voices though theyd gone north towards the walls and tents and would be coming out back this way heading for the coast king aeldred leading them his father had said guthrums party was on foot would be running for the ships right now if they werent dead he had no idea where theyd been when they where are your horses just west in the woods in those woods thorkells voice rose for the first time are there others ill hit you again show respect thats a spirit wood no anglcyn or cyngael will enter it stefa ought to have known if you didnt well said bern attempting defiance maybe he did know if they dont go in its a good place for our mounts isnt it his father said nothing bern swallowed he cleared his throat he only went in a few steps tethered them got out right away he did know thorkell sounded tired suddenly youd best move his father said think the rest of it out while you ride bern moved climbing up the western bank he said nothing but as he looked around crouching thorkell added dont let ivarr ragnarson know youre my son hell kill you for it bern stopped looking down at the dark figure of his father in the stream a tale there too obviously he wasnt going to ask he wanted to say something harsh about how late it was for thorkell to be showing signs of looking after his family he turned heard his father come out of the water behind him he walked south quickly bent low went in among the trees to get gyllir he shivered doing so spirit wood he knew thorkell was watching him to mark the place he didnt look back offered no farewell and ingavin knew no thanks hed die before he did that gyllir whickered at his approach the horse seemed agitated tossing his head bern rubbed his muzzle whispering untied the reins he left eccas horse tethered as instructed it wouldnt be for long emerged from the woods mounted rode south under stars and the blue moon pushing gyllir there would be mounted men following soon the land stretched level forest to the west open to the east across the stream mostly empty at first uninhabited then some dark farms over that way planted barley rye the harvest coming soon a line of low trees cluster of houses the ground beginning to slope towards the sea and their ships a long way to go men following the bonfire still burning after a time he saw another one far off and then later a third sending its signals which he couldnt read the moon was gone by then behind the woods he leaned forward over gyllirs neck to make his weight easier to bear theres a tale i imagine his father had said learning of the horse he hadnt asked though hadnt asked heimthra was the word used for longing for home for the past for things to be as they once had been even the gods were said to know that yearning from when the worlds were broken bern was grateful as he rode that no one on the wide dark earth could see his face and he had to trust that ingavin and thünir would not think the worse of him if they were watching in the night it was hakon ingemarson who had recognized kendra by the stream hed called out to her immediately as he passed with a torch amid a crowd of others heading for the tents she hadnt wanted to ask how hed known her so quickly in the dark was afraid of his answer knew his answer really shed cursed silently the sheer bad luck that had led him past this point even as shed turned and achieved a tone of pleased welcome when he came hurrying over my lady how come you here unattended im not unattended hakon ceinion of llywerth kindly sent his own guard with me she had gestured and thorkell had stepped forward into the light the dog thankfully was across the stream out of sight shed had no least idea how shed have adequately explained it but theres nothing here at all hakon had exclaimed shed realized that he was drunk they all were that might make things easier in fact the gathering is over by the tents your royal sister and brother are there already may we escort you kendra had searched for and failed to find any way to decline cursing again inside with a ferocity that would have surprised all three of her siblings and utterly disconcerted the young man in front of her shed smiled and said of course thorkell wait here for me ill likely just stay a short while and i wouldnt want these men to forgo their entertainment to take me back inside yes my lady the older erling had said in the uninflected voice of a servant hakon had looked as if he might protest but evidently decided to be pleased with what hed gained so unexpectedly shed fallen in with him and the others and theyd made their way to the colourful village of tents that had sprung up northwest of the walls when they arrived they found a boisterous crowd gathered in a wide circle hakon pushed through to the front inside were two people it came as no great surprise to kendra to discover that these were her older brother and sister she looked around to one side of the ring she saw a skull resting on the grass a torch set beside it kendra winced she had a fairly good idea suddenly what had happened here athelbert simply did not know when to leave well enough alone judit had a long staff held crosswise with both hands she knew how to use it athelbert carried a significantly smaller one a thin switch nearly useless good for swatting at leaves or apples not much more judit was attempting with grim purpose and no little skill to club her brother senseless finish the task shed begun that morning athelbertwho had had a great deal to drink it was clearwas laughing far too much to be at all safe from his sisters assault kendra eyeing them listening to the hilarity around her was thinking about the cyngael in the woods and about his dogthe way it had stood on the far side of the stream rigid and attentive listening she didnt know for what she didnt really want to know there was nothing to be done now in any case no way to turn around and walk away just yet she had sighed again fixed a smile on her face and accepted a cup of watered wine from hakon busy on her behalf she watched her siblings amid a rapturous howling crowd and smoking torches a latesummer night the harvest looking to be good the fair soon to begin a time of laughter and celebration the entertainment in the ring continued marked by two pauses for wine on the part of the combatants judits hair was entirely and immodestly unconfined now not that she would care kendra thought athelbert was dodging and ducking without pause hed taken two or three blows including one to the shin that had knocked him sprawling barely able to roll away from judits urgent followup kendra thought about intervening she was certainly the only person who could she wasnt actually sure how much selfcontrol judit had left it was sometimes hard to tell then someone shouted loudly in a different tone and people were pointing to the south beyond the city kendra turned a bonfire they watched the signals begin and repeat and then repeat again it was athelbert who decoded the message aloud for all of them judit listening dropped her staff went over to stand next to her brother she began to cry athelbert put his arm around her amid the chaos that ensued kendra shifted from where hakon had been hovering at her elbow then she slipped away into the dark torches were everywhere shaping patterns in the night she made her way back to the river the dog was still there it didnt seem to have moved in fact thorkell was nowhere to be seen nor was alun ab owyn he ought not to matter now she was thinking her mind was in a whirl one of their own had been slain tonight if athelbert had the message right she was certain that he had burgred he had been in the marshes with her father had fought at camburn both times when they lost and when they won and he had gone chasing a rumour of erling ships while the king lay wrapped in fever her father she thought would be tortured by that knowledge there was a movement across the stream the man shed followed came out from the trees he stopped at the woods edge looking lost kendra heart pounding saw the dog pad over to him push his muzzle against the cyngaels hip alun ab owyn reached down and touched the dog it was too dark to see his face but there was something in the way he stood that frightened her she had been frightened she realized all night all day long really from the time the cyngael party had come into the meadow there were noises men shouting behind her running towards the city gates which were open now kendra heard a different sound a footfall nearer she looked over saw thorkell his clothes were wet where were you she whispered hes come out the erling replied not answering kendra turned back to the woods alun still hadnt moved except to touch the dog uncertainly she walked towards the river stood on the bank amid reeds and dragonflies she saw him look up and see her too dark too dark to know his eyes she took a breath she had no business being here no understanding of how she knew what she knew come back to us she said fighting fear the dog turned to her voice blue moon and stars overhead she heard thorkell come up behind her was grateful for that she was watching the other man by the trees and at length she heard alun ab owyn say in a voice you had to strain to hear my lady i have a long way to go to do that kendra shivered was close to tears and afraid she made herself take another deep breath and said with courage that perhaps only her father was aware that she had i am only this fan thorkell behind her made an odd sound by the trees alun ab owyn lifted his head a little and then after a moment moved forward walking as if through water even before he reached it he crossed the stream with the dog his hair was disordered he had no belt on his tunic carried no weapon what are you doing here he asked her head high feeling the breeze in her hair she said i am truly not certain i felt afraid from when i saw you this morning something you were afraid of me his voice was drained of emotion again she hesitated afraid for you she said a silence then he nodded as if unsurprised i am only this far shed said where had that come from but hed crossed hed come across the water from the trees to them a little behind her the erling kept silent did someone die tonight alun ab owyn asked we think so she said my brother believes it was earl burgred leading a party south of here erlings he asked raiders he was looking past her now at thorkell the dog was beside him wet from the river standing very still it appears so my lord said the big man behind her and then carefully i believe we both know the one who leads them and that made a change kendra saw it happen the cyngael seemed to be pulled back to them snapped like a leash or a whip away from whatever had happened in the trees the thing she didnt want to think about ragnarson he asked not a name kendra knew it meant nothing to her the erling nodded i believe so how do you know this ab owyn asked my lord prince if it is ragnarson he will want to take their ships west from here king aeldred is riding out now after them he was very good kendra was realizing at not replying to questions he didnt want to answer in the darkness she looked at the cyngael prince alun was rigid so taut he was almost quivering hell go for brynnfell again they wont be ready not so soon i need a horse ill get you one said thorkell calmly what i think not came a slurred angry voice kendra wheeled whitefaced saw athelbert coming across the grass a mount so he can ride my sister and then ride home to boast of it kendra felt her heart pound with fury this time not fear her fists were clenched at her sides athelbert you are drunk and entirely he went right past her he might jest and tumble with judit letting her buffet him about for the amusement of others but her older brother was a hard trained fighting man kingtobe in these lands and enraged right now for more than one reason entirely what dear sister he didnt look back at her he had stopped in front of alun ab owyn he was half a head taller than the cyngael look at his hair his tunic left his belt in the grass i see at least you made yourself presentable before getting off your backside thorkell einarson took a step forward my lord prince he began i can tell you you can shut your loathsome erling mouth before i kill you here athelbert snapped ab owyn draw your blade have none said alun mildly and launched himself in a lithe efficient movement at athelbert he feinted left and then his right fist hammered hard at her brothers heart kendras hands flew to her mouth athelbert went backwards in a heap sprawled on the grass he grunted shifted to get up and froze the dog cafall was directly above him a large grey menace growling in his throat he didnt touch me you jadcursed clod kendra screamed at her brother she was close to tears in her fury i was over watching you and judit make fools of yourselves you were you er saw that athelbert said he had a hand to his chest was careful to make no sudden movements i saw that she echoed must you take such pains to be an idiot there was a silence they heard the noises from behind them towards the gates less difficult than you think her brother murmured finally wry already laughing at himself a gift he had in fact where he said looking up at alun ab owyn did you learn to do that my brother taught me said the cyngael shortly cafall hold the dog had growled again as athelbert shifted to a sitting position hold is a good idea agreed athelbert you might want to tell him again make sure he heard you he looked over at his sister i appear to have erred said kendra bluntly how unusual they heard horns from the city thats father said athelbert a different tone alun looked over well need to hurry thorkell wheres that horse the big man turned to him downstream i killed an erling raider in town tonight tracked his horse to the wood just now if you need a mount quickly you can i need a mount quickly and a sword killed an erling raider athelbert snapped in the same breath man i used to know with jormsvik now i saw him in the later come on said alun look he pointed kendra and the two men turned she gripped her hands together tightly the fyrd of king aeldred was streaming out of the gates amid torches and banners she heard the sound of horses harness and drumming hooves men shouting horns blowing the glorious and terrible panoply of war my lady it was thorkell asking leave of her go she said he wasnt her servant the two men began running along the riverbank the dog growled a last time at athelbert then went after them kendra looked down at her brother still sitting on the grass she watched him stand somewhat carefully hed had a painful day tall fairhaired as an erling graceful handsome reasonably near to sober in fact he stood before her his mouth quirked im an idiot he said i know i know adore you though remember it then he went quickly away as well towards the gates to join the company riding out leaving her unexpectedly alone in darkness by the stream that didnt happen often being left alone it was not in fact unwelcome she needed some moments to compose herself or try what are you doing here hed asked the tooobvious question and how was she to answer speak of an aura almost seen a sound beyond hearing something never before known but vivid as faith or desire the sense that he was marked apart and that shed somehow known it from his first appearance in the meadow that morning i have a long way to go hed said across the stream and shed known somehow what he really meant and it was a thing she didnt want to know jad shield me kendra thought and him she looked towards the trees unwillingly spirit wood saw nothing there nothing at all she lingered reluctant to surrender this quiet then like a blade sliding into flesh it came back to her that the tumult she was hearing was a response to the death of someone shed known from childhood burgred of denferth lifting her onto his horse so far above the ground for a canter around the walls of raedhill shed been three perhaps four terror then pride and a hiccoughing laughter giddy breathlessness her fathers softened amused face when burgred brought her back and leaning in the saddle set her down redfaced on chubby legs did you remember things because theyd happened often or because they were so rare that one had been rare a stern man earl burgred more so than osbert a figure of action not thought carried the marks of the past in a different way her fathers fevers osberts leg burgreds anger hed been with aeldred and had been loved when theyd all been very young even before beortferth an erling had killed him tonight how did one deal with that if one was king of the anglcyn her father was riding out could die tonight they had no idea how many erlings were south of them how many ships jormsvik thorkell einarson had said she knew who they were mercenaries from the tip of vinmark hard men the hardest of all it was said kendra turned then away from woods and stream and solitude to go back she saw her younger brother standing patiently waiting for her she opened her mouth closed it athelbert would have sent him she realized in the midst of chasing down his horse and armour and joining the fyrd amid chaos hed have done that it was too easy to underestimate athelbert father wouldnt let you both go she asked quietly knew the answer before she asked gareth shook his head in the darkness no what happened here are you all right she nodded i suppose you he hesitated i wouldnt mind killing someone kendra sighed others had sorrows too you needed to remember that she came forward took her brothers arm didnt squeeze it or anything like that hed bridle at obvious sympathy gareth knew the rhodian and trakesian philosophers had read them aloud to her modelled himself or tried on their teachings conduct yourself in the sure knowledge that death comes to all men born be composed accordingly in the face of adversity he was seventeen years old they walked back together she saw the guard at the gate whitefaced the one who had let her out she nodded reassuringly at him managed a smile she and gareth went to the hall osbert was there amid a blaze of lanterns giving instructions men coming and going in front of him something hed done all kendras life his face looked seamed and gaunt none of them was young any more she thought her father osbert burgred burgred was dead were the dead old or young there was nothing for her to do but it was too late to go to bed they went to morning prayers when sunrise came her mother joined them large calm a ship with the wind behind her sure in her faith kendra didnt see judit in the chapel but her sister found them later back in the hall soberly garbed hair properly pinned but with a wild fury in her eyes judit did not subscribe to the doctrines of composure advocated by rhodian philosophers she wanted a sword right now kendra knew wanted to be on a horse riding south would never ever be reconciled to the fact that she couldnt do that by then someone had found the dead erling in the alley and had reported it to osbert kendra had expected that had been thinking about it when she was supposed to be praying waiting for a pause in the flow of messages to and from she went over and told osbert quietly what she knew he listened considered said nothing by way of reproach that was not his way he sent a messenger running for the guard who had been on the wall who came and another one for the erling servant of ceinion of llywerth who did not thorkell einarson they discovered had gone south with the fyrd so had the cyngael cleric though that had been known a night ride beside aeldred on a horse theyd given him a different sort of holy man this one and kendra knew alun ab owyn was also with them and why someone named ragnarson she remembered the way hed looked coming out of the wood she still didnt want to acknowledge what it was she seemed to know about this about himwithout any idea how she knew the world kendra suddenly thought heretically was not as wellmade as it might have been she pictured him riding and the grey dog running beside the horses towards the sea earlier that same night a woman was making her way carefully across the fields of rabady isle not precisely sure of her direction in the dark and more than a little afraid to be abroad after moonrise alone she could hear the sea and the waving grain at the same time harvest was coming the grain fields were high making it harder to see her way a little before under the same waning blue moon her exiled husband and only son had spoken together in a stream near esferth a comingtogether that could only having been shapedshe would have saidby the gods for their own purposes which were not to be understood the woman would have been grateful for tidings of the son would have denied interest in the father her daughters were also away across the strait on the vinmark mainland neither had sent word for some time she understood a family disgrace could make ambitious husbands cautious about such things there was a king in hlegest now with increasingly clear ambitions of his own to rule all the erlings not just some of them in the north times were changing it meant among other things that young men had reason to think carefully mind their tongues be discreet with family connections shame could come to a man through his wife frigga daughter of skadi once wife to red thorkell then to halldr thinshank now bound to no man and therefore without protection was not bitter about her daughters women had only so much control over their lives she didnt know how it was elsewhere much the same she imagined bern her son ought to have stayed by her when halldr died instead of disappearing but bern had been turned from a landowners heir into a servant by his fathers exile and who could truly blame a young man for rejecting that shed assumed he was dead after theyd gone looking for him and the horse in the morning and found neither had spent nights mourning not able to let anyone see how much she grieved because of what hed obviously done taking the dead mans funeral horse then a short while ago at summers end had come tidings that he hadnt died theyd stoned the volur for helping bern thorkellson get off the isle frigga didnt believe it it made no sense at all that tale but she wasnt about to say that to anyone there was no one to whom she could talk she was alone here and still had no true idea if her son was alive and then a few days ago they had named the new volur onehanded ulfarson now governor did the naming which was a new thing there were always new things werent there but the young volur was kin to her nearly and frigga had offered some small kindnesses when the girl had first arrived to serve in the womens compound it seemed now to have been a wise thing to have done though that wasnt why shed done it a womans road was hard always stony and bleak you helped each other if and when you could her mother had taught her that she needed help herself now it had brought her into the night windy not yet cold and these whispering fields she was afraid of animals and spirits and of living men doing what they were likely to do if they had been drinking and came upon a woman alone she feared the moment and what the future held for her in the world frigga stopped took a deep breath looked around her by moonlight and saw the boulder they had done the stoning here she knew where she was another breath and a murmured thankyou to the gods she had been to the womens compound four times in her life but the last visit had been twenty years ago and she had come by daylight each time with an offering when she was carrying a child and three of her children had lived who understood these things who dared say they did it was fulla corn goddess who decreed what happened to a woman when her birth pangs came it made sense to seek intercession frigga moved to the stone touched it murmured the proper words she didnt know if what she was doing now could be said to be sensible but she was it seemed no more willing to be a servant than her son had beento be ordered to bed any manguest at the behest of thinshanks first wife the widow whod inherited with her sons second wives had little in the way of rights unless theyd had time to establish their ground in the house frigga hadnt she wasnt far in fact from being cast out with winter coming she had no property thanks to thorkells second murder nor was she young enough to readily persuade any proper man to take her to wife her breasts were fallen her hair grey there were no children left waiting in her womb she had lingered through a spring and summer endured what shed known would come from the day halldr died followed by that disastrous funeral burning him without the horse the omen of it the unquiet spirit she had hoped troubles would pass her by seen they would not and finally decided to come out tonight much the same paththough she did not know thisher son had taken with a dead mans horse in the spring a roll of the gambling dice women were not actually allowed to touch the dice of course for fear of putting a curse on them she saw the first trees and the light at the same time anrid wasnt asleep she hadnt been sleeping since the stoning the images that came when she closed her eyes it was wearing her away her elevation to volur hadnt changed this it hadnt even been a surprise shed seen the unfolding of events in her mind as if played out on some raised platform from the time shed gone to the governor in truth from the time shed devised her course of action after hed summoned her to come to him it had happened as shed seen it including the stoning when shed worn the serpent about her body for all of them to see she hadnt known this about herself that anger could make her cause people to die but the volur had had the snake bite her before knowing if its poison was gone anrid had been the newest girl and alone here her dying wouldnt have mattered to anyone in the world they had made her stand still eyes closed in sick terror and had goaded the released serpent with sticks and it had bitten her then theyd sent her back out on watch duty waiting curiously to see if she died anrid had been sick to her stomach in the yard and then limped out through the gate to where she was supposed to watch what else had there been for her to do and that night bern had come shed seen him tie the horse and walk into the compound and the volur had arranged to send him to a savage death no uncertainty about that one no testing of poison hed enter the town at sunrise thinking he was safe and would be taken and killed a man whod come to the seer for help she had sheathed him in her wrinkled driedout flesh deceiving him entirely laughed about it after the crude jibes of the other old ones peering through cracks in the wall complaining they hadnt had their turn anrid turning away in disgust to the darkness again limping had taken her own first steps towards the stonings savage death later that same night when she spoke to the man warning him bern thorkellson was kin to her almost she told herself that now over and again you stood by kin in this world because there was no one else to stand by or who might ever stand by you a rule of the northlands you died if you were too much alone but she saw stones striking flesh whenever she closed her eyes now when they knocked at her door and she rose and opened it and they told her a woman had come she knewthey would think it was her powerwho this had to be even before her brothers wifes mother was led to her chamber it wasnt power it was a quick mind a different sort of mystery women werent ever credited with that while she waited anrid let the snake coil around her she did that all the time now the serpent had been her doorway to this it was important that the others see her handling it confront their own fear of doing the same she was still the newest still the youngest and now volur she needed to find a way to survive volurs could be killed she knew it a knock the door opened she gestured for frigga to enter closed the door herself letting no one else in she had already blocked up the holes through which she and the others used to peek she put the serpent in the basket theyd made for it she hated the snake anrid turned to the older woman looked at her a moment opened her mouth to speak and began to cry the tears stunned her with how desperately they fell her hands were shaking oh child said frigga anrid couldnt stop weeping youd have had to kill her to make her stop will you she began choked on her words tears in her throat hands in trembling fists to her mouth a shuddering of breath tried again will you stay with me please stay oh child have you a place for me anrid could only nod again and again a spasm of the head the older woman nearly kin closest thing she had came forward and they wrapped each other in arms that had not known or given comfort for so long only the younger one wept however then later that night she slept ten brogan the miller awake as usual before dawn was thinking as he pissed into the stream before beginning the day about some of the things he disliked it was a long list he was a sour solitary man had been drawn to the mill because it gave him a house at the edge of the village a place removed from and a stature above the others hed murdered someone to get this mill but that was an old story and he didnt think or even dream about it often any more brogan didnt really like people they talked too much most of them his servant was usefully a mute hed been very happy briefly when hed learned that ord a farmer with fields east of the village was looking for work for his youngest son who didnt talk brogan had made arrangements to bring the boy to the mill he was old enough a broadshouldered lad a straw pallet food a day a week to help his father milk and cheese for brogan in exchange for that last and a decent worker who didnt prattle on when feeding the animals or standing waistdeep in the stream mending the wheel brogan who had come to the mill as a worker himself thirty years agoand taken certain measures a little later to ensure hed staycouldnt understand why people would mar an easy silence with wasted words there were still stars in the west first hint of greyness east dawn wind ruffling the reeds in the river brogan scratched himself and went to unbolt the mill a warm day coming still summertime though late in the season with what that meant brogan didnt like the new endofsummer fair third year now the road west of their hamlet towards the river of which the millstream was a tributary became too busy steady traffic from coast to esferth and then back afterwards people on roads signified trouble for brogan the miller nothing good about them at all strangers stole things came looking for women or drink or just mischief to make or find brogan had coins buried in three places around the mill would have spent some of them by now but hed never wanted anything enough to spend good money on it a woman now and again but you could buy one of those for grain and many of the farmers paid him with flour and wheels of bread more than he needed he left his money buried but worried about it long ago hed lain awake wondering if someone would find the old miller in his grave dig him up see the crushed skull now it was the coins that woke him sometimes in the dark all over the world men knew that millers made money he had three dogs didnt like them their barking but they offered protection and modig the mute was a goodsized lad handy with a cudgel brogan himself wasnt a big man but hed survived a fight or two in his day hed considered taking a wife some time ago children to do the work as he grew older the idea had come lingered a while and passed women changed things and brogan the miller didnt like change that was the principal reason he didnt like the king even after all these years aeldred was always changing things you had to make bows and arrows for yourself now or buy them and you were supposed to practise every week and be tested by someone from the fyrd each spring didnt they have other things to do the fyrd farmers with bows that was a stupid dangerous thought theyd kill each other before the erlings had a chance it was dark in the mill but after so many years he knew his way blind he opened the shutters over the stream to let in some light and air went down the steps heard the mice skitter from his footfall he lifted the lock to the sluice gripped with both hands put his back to it and pulled back the chute gate the water started pouring in soon the familiar sounds of the turning wheel and millstones grinding above began he went back up took the first sack opened it dumped it into the hopper above the turning stones through the open window the eastern sky showed brighter the first women and children would be coming for their flour after sunrise most of them straight from the dawn prayers in the small chapel brogan was still thinking about changes as he checked the millstones which were turning easily a new cleric in the village now this one could read and write was supposed to be teaching people there were new rules for military service new taxes for the building of the burhs yes the burhs were supposed to protect them but brogan doubted a walled fort at drengest south and east on the coast or the other one inland two days east would do much good for their hamlet or his mill if trouble came and reading reading what in the name of jads toes and fingers did that have to do with anything might be well enough for a soft man at court where they ate with alesoddened musicians piping and warbling to spoil good meat but here in a farming village modig would do so much better mending the fence or the waterwheel once he could spell his name brogan turned his head to spit expertly out the window into the stream the new cleric had called shortly after arriving fair enough the mill was owned by the chapel and the miller together that was why brogan was miller really when the old one had come to his unexpected end a sudden fever in midsummer taken in the one night buried sadly by his servant at dawn it had made sense for the cleric to strike a bargain with the dour young man after the funeral rites the millers assistant brogan by name had seemed to know what he was doing and the village couldnt afford to have the mill idle while they considered who should have the position it was a stroke of good fortune for the young fellow obviously but jad could sometimes bestow generously where you might not have expected it thirty years later this newest cleric fifth one brogan had worked with had looked around the mill in a cursory sort of way clearly uninterested in what he saw and then growing enthusiastic had asked brogan about installing one of the newerstyled vertical wheels hed read a letter from a fellow cleric in ferrieres about them he said more power a better use of the river changes again ferrieres brogan wasting more words than hed wanted to had explained about the flow of their small stream the limited needs of the hamlet and the cost of having a vertical wheel built and attached it was that last he was sure that had induced the cleric to nod sagely stroke a weak beardless chin and agree that the simpler ways were often best fulfilling the gods purposes entirely well they left the horizontal wheel alone brogan took the chapels share of the mills earnings in coin or kind to them every second week he was prompt about that sort of thing it kept people from coming round and talking he did hold back a slightly higher portion for himself if you set that up from the outset they were unlikely to have questions hed been through this before the cleric had asked about written records on that first visit brogan had explained he didnt know how to write hed declined an offer of reading lessons leave it to the young ones hed said people were always wanting to change things brogan couldnt understand it change was going to come why hurry it along the king had even sent around new instructions for farmers at the end of this past winter with the archers from the fyrd on how to properly handle their fields alternating crops what to grow as if anyone at court knew anything about farming brogan had never been near the kings court only twice up to esferth town which was twice more than enough but he knew what he thought of it you didnt need to eat dung to know you wouldnt like the taste he leaned out the window and looked upstream to his right modig had fed the chickens was at work in the herb and vegetable garden a virtue to having a farmers son here the garden was looking better than it had in years brogan wasnt fussy about what he ate but he liked turnips and parsnips with his bread and broth and fish and a decent seasoning as much as the next man and modig had a way with the garden of course thought the miller sourly if hed had counsel from the courtiers on what seedlings and how much dung to use it would doubtless be far better he spat again into the stream below saw the pale harbinger of sunrise in the east and muttered his customary twosentence version of the rites his own idea of jad was not of a god who needed a lot of words you acknowledged him gave thanks and got on with what you had to do and it didnt need to be done in a chapel you could pray in a mill over water gazing out at the fields gazing out at the fields brogan the miller sawin the last neardarkness of a summer nighttwenty men or more downstream from him kneeling beside the water or kneedeep in it drinking and filling flasks he drew his head back quickly because he saw that they carried weapons weapons meantsince they were being quiet and were nowhere near the northsouth roadthat these were outlaws or even erlings and not simply passing by on their way to trade peacefully at the esferth fair brogan swallowed his palms suddenly sweaty scalp prickling he thought of his coins buried in the yard and just outside it he thought of death armed men across the stream a large number of men not in the event large enough from the north brogan suddenly heard a dog his heart lurched it was a deep fierce triumphant howl not one of his own dogs though they immediately started their own wild barking in the fenced yard he looked out carefully the men in the stream had begun scrambling from the water splashing stumbling unsheathing swords they formed at a shouted string of commands a tight disciplined order and began running south they were erlings then the language gave it away and no outlaws would be nearly so precise in their formation and movements brogan leaned out looking past where modig had now stopped working in the garden and was standing rigid also watching that howling came again a sound he would remember wouldnt ever want to be hunted by that brogan heard hoofbeats and shouting over the barking of his own dogs and into his field of vision streaming down from the north came a galloping company swords drawn spears out hurtling through the stream in the predawn light he saw a banner and brogan the miller understood that this was the kings fyrd and that they had seen the erlings and were going to catch up to them just across the water from his mill his heart was pounding as if he too were running or riding he had been expecting moments ago to be killed here fingers broken one by oneor worse thingsuntil he told where his money was the nightmare that came in his sleep leaning out he saw the erlings turn to face the horsemen bearing swiftly down upon them he didnt like king aeldred all his changes the new taxes levied to support fyrd and forts but at this particular moment watching those horsemen surround the erlings such feelings were suspended brogan left the mill went out the door walked down to the stream modig holding a spade opened the garden gate and came over stood beside him the dogs were still barking brogan snapped a command over his shoulder and they stopped there was a grey mist on the millstream rising through it as the pale sun came up they watched what happened in the meadow on the other side the millwheel turned it occurred to alun at some point during the night ride south that he was surrounded now by anglcyn warriors who had traditionally been his enemies racing to intercept erlings who were enemies as well one of athelberts archers had given him a sword and belt at the princes command you could name it a friends gesture you had to really for the cyngael he thought friends were hard to come by in the world and that if you stopped to think about it really did make the feuds between arberth and cadyr and llywerth harder to justify that wasnt something people did think about though west of the rheden wall their endless internal warring was the way things were the three provinces raided and goaded each other fought for primacy always had his father alun knew would have preferred stealing a herd of cattle from an arrogant arberthi and hearing his bard sing about it after to any foray across the wall into rheden or even mauling erling raiders though that last might not be true any more not since dai was killed he couldnt be sure but he thought his father had changed through the spring and summer alun was aware of changes within himself shaped around loss and what hed seen in that pool by brynnfell he didnt know where the changes had taken him but he knew they were there he wasnt sure exactly where he was right now galloping southeast between copses of trees but he did knowor believethat the man whod led the raid that killed his brother was somewhere ahead of them ivarr ragnarson had eluded pursuit near brynnfell fled to his ships and awayand had now killed a good man here he needed to die it was important he be killed if you stopped to think about it there was no time to stop tonighttwo short rests allowed by the king no more than a pause to drink at streams fill flasks then riding againbut he had plenty of time to think under the summer stars as the blue moon westered through clouds and went down behind the woods there were riders all around him but their facesand hiswere shielded from scrutiny the shelter of darkness the need for it and with that the memory came back to him inescapable who had said exactly that and when needful as night rhiannon mer brynn clad in green at her fathers table the night his brother had died and had his soul stolen away he realized he hadnt let himself think about her those words his own song since then as if flinching from too fiercely bright a fire do you hate me so much my lord alun looked over towards the woods more darkness blurred in distance the river somewhere between he thought of the faerie her hair changing colour the light shed made and he began to wonder riding exactly what the world was how it was crafted how hed make his own peace with jad and the high cleric on the horse ahead of him beside king aeldred he didnt know if he felt older now or younger because less sure of things but he did understand that everything had altered and could not be remade as it had been before the speed of things for you the faerie had said he didnt even have a name for her did they have names he hadnt thought to ask before stumbling out of the wood he had been afraid as hed left the trees wondering if he would come out into different moonlight and find his world gone instead hed found an anglcyn princess inexplicably waiting there for him i am only this far as if shed known of his fear what he was feeling no distance at all just across a quiet stream the world still his not altered yet changed in every way her being there another thing to think about try to understand he shook his head there were only so many images memories you could deal with at once alun decided before you had to look away and then as the night ended all changed again thinking back afterwards he realized he oughtnt to have been so surprised that they found the erlings for one thing the fyrd knew this land as well as he and his brother had known the valleys and fells of cadyr every tuck and fold of their province recorded on a mental map down to the shepherds huts and the farms where daughters might be willing to rise from their beds wrapped in a shawl and come out into the dark soft and warm to a known whisper at a night window they had been riding along the route that made sense for intercepting a party on foot the erlings would be running towards where their ships would have anchored between the burh at drengest and the steep coastline farther west where they couldnt come ashore you could figure these things out if you knew where you were and the land around you copses and rivers slopes and hamlets aeldred and his fyrd would know them all the places where the erlings whod killed burgred of denforth would be unable to pass and the ones theyd try to avoid they might miss the erlings in darkness or mist but theyd find their path and they had cafall with them the dog was the part of this night that neither alun nor ceinion and certainly none of the anglcyns had thought about but it was cafallhunting dog brynns giftwho howled a wild sound that could terrify and appall as they approached a stream in the grey before sunrise aluns heart began pounding someone near the front raised an arm and pointed shouting it was athelbert he saw they had been intending to pray here dismount long enough to perform the dawn rites on the riverbank instead they thundered across west of a village mill splashing through water weapons out and they came up to the erlings who were on foot and surrounded them in a green meadow as the sun came up there were too many people living here now too many towns too many burhs with fighting men inside them guthrum skallson running with fewer than twenty men five had taken the horses to the ships with a warning to bring forty of them back had seen a hill fire burning and then another to the north a little later and had realized that they were in even more danger than hed thought theyd run all through the night he couldnt say he was surprised when they were found theyd have taken a different route if the woods and treed slopes had allowed but they didnt know these lands and the best he could do was go back west along the same path theyd taken and hope they met their reinforcements before they were intercepted it hadnt happened he hadnt expected those hilltop flares in the dark the speed of the anglcyn response hed thought they had a decent chance that hed been in worse trouble over the years then a dog howled as dawn broke and the fyrd was there he had the men circle in the meadow as the anglcyn riders thundered across the stream no point running these were mounted men he saw the banners in the pale light and understood that king aeldred hadnt just sent his warriors he had come himself they were taken it had happened before there were resources in jormsvik ingavin knew they could be bought back for a price and promises likely some of them would be hostages for a time likely guthrum would be one of those he cursed under his breath he had eighteen men there appeared to be close to two hundred surrounding them mounted he wasnt a berserkir he was a mercenary hired this wasnt war he let fall his sword held up open hands stepped forward that the anglcyn king might know who led this party how many men did burgred take south with him a man with a grey beard spoke in anglcyn but not to guthrum he understood the words though the languages were near enough six including himself said a younger man on a brown horse beside the speaker shoot six said the bearded man who would be aeldred of the anglcyn not that one he pointed to guthrum the younger one spoke six arrows flew six of guthrums menwho had lain down their weapons when he hadfell into the grass guthrum did not fear death no mercenary could fight as many battles as he had over so many years and live with fear he didnt want to die however he liked ale and women battle and comrades peril and hardship and ease after the trappings of a warrior in this middleworld he said none of them killed your earl none of them would have indeed said the king on the horse in front of him so burgred lives is coming home even now guthrum met that gaze no erling ought to cower before these people we do not use arrows in jormsvik ah so no arrow killed him our tidings are false good none will have killed your fellows if so thought he was clever this king guthrum had heard that of him problem was he was clever in too many ways raiding had become impossible here this journey had been a mistake from the moment they took ivarrs money and set sail ivarr guthrum looked around someonea younger man smaller sitting an erling horsehad come forward beside the king he looked down at guthrum ragnarson was with you spoke anglcyn but you could tell a cyngael the moment he opened his mouth how could he know about ivarr though guthrum considered for a moment thinking fast keeping silent shoot another athelbert said the king they shot another atli this time guthrum had come to jormsviks walls with atli bjarkson fifteen years ago walking to the fortress together from homes in the north meeting on the road winning their fights on the same morning joining the same company a neverforgotten day the day that split your life into before and after guthrum looked down into the grass now in a mornings first light far from vinmark and he spoke the farewell aloud invoking ingavins welcome for a friend in the warriors halls then he turned back to the mounted men surrounding them you were asked a question said king aeldred his voice was calm flat but there was no way to mistake the rage in him this might not be a hostage and ransom circumstance after all and guthrum had men here for whom he was responsible we have surrendered our arms he said and will you tell me burgred did not when you found them when you put an arrow in him how do you know about that athelbert one more please wait guthrum lifted an urgent hand the prince named athelbert more slowly did the same no arrow was loosed guthrum swallowed looking up at the anglcyn a black rage in his own heart he could crush any of these in battle any two of them he and atli could have handled half a dozen however you know this he said you are right ivarr ragnarson paid for this raid and killed the earl against my orders and wishes do you think we are fools he heard the passion in his own voice moved to master it i think you are yes but would not have thought so in that way mercenaries killing a nobleman taken where is he then this ragnarson there was contempt in the voice guthrum could hear it he would have said he despised ivarr ragnarson at least as much as those surrounding them did he felt no loyalty to him at all had been on the edge of killing the man himself and had that last anglcyn bowshot taken any man there but atli he would likely have pointed back to the stream where ivarr had obviously remained hidden when they fled one life surrendered to save those in his charge a fair and proper deed the flow of time and events is a large river men and women are usually no more than pebbles in that carried along but sometimes at some moments they are more sometimes the course of the stream is changed not just for a few people but for many they shouldnt have killed atli guthrum skallson thought standing in a meadow surrounded by his enemies our weapons were in the grass we had yielded ourselves we took five horses he said i sent riders back to the ships aeldred stared down at him for a long time the arrogance of it was as wormwood gall bitterest taste he knew as if a woman were looking at him this way scarcely to be borne yes the king said finally you will have done that and asked for reinforcements to meet you a ships worth very well they will be dealt with next you have all made a terrible mistake jad knows i have no need or desire of ransom for any of you at all my need just now is otherwise athelbert my lord began another older man another cyngael they have laid down no words ceinion said the king of the anglcyn he had spared the life of the man whod bloodeagled his father everyone in the northlands knew the tale he wasnt doing so now aeldred turned away indifferently as arrows were notched guthrum nearly got to him you didnt let yourself die helplessly in a morning field like a target set up for womanish anglcyn who dared not fight you properly not if you were an erling and a warrior he was actually at the kings reins reaching up when the sword took him in the throat it was the young cyngael who had moved fastest guthrum saw with his last sight he was dying on his feet though in battle as was proper the gods loved their warriors their blood the dragonships red blades ravens and eagles called you home to halls where mead flowed freely and forever the sun was up but he couldnt see it suddenly there was a long white wave he named ingavin and thünir and went to them expressionless though with his heart beating fast brogan the miller stood by the stream and watched his king and warriors kill the erlings in the meadow fifteen or twenty of them no hostages none spared there was no ferocity or passion in the dispatch of the raiders they were just dealt with for more than a hundred years the anglcyn had lived in terror of these raiders from the sea in their dragonships now the erlings were being killed like so many ragged outlaws he decided just then that he liked king aeldred after all and watching the arrows fly he came also to a reconsideration of his views on the subject of archery beside him modig stood gripping his spade his mouth hanging open the fyrd turned to ride south as they did one rider peeled off from the others and came over towards the mill and stream where the two men were brogan felt a flicker of apprehension made himself be calm these were his defenders his king you live here the mounted man snapped reining his mount on the other side of the river you are the miller brogan touched a hand to his forehead and nodded yes my lord find villagers farmers whatever you can have these bodies burned before sundown you yourself are in charge of collecting weapons and armour keep them in the mill there are eighteen erlings all were armed in the usual ways we have a good idea of what should be here when we come back if anyone steals there will be executions we wont stop to ask questions understood brogan nodded again and swallowed hard make certain the others here do the rider wheeled and set off galloping now to catch up with the fyrd brogan watched him go a graceful figure in morning light in the meadow not far away lay a number of dead men eighteen the rider had said his burden now he cursed himself for coming out to watch spat into the stream it was going to be very hard to stop poor men from stealing knives or rings surely the fyrd wouldnt begrudgeor be able to tracka stray torc or necklace would they it occurred to him that he and modig might be able to gather most of the arms and store them before anyone else no that wouldnt work the women would be here soon for their flour they would see what had happened it was impossible to miss brogan saw birds already gathering where the bodies lay he grimaced this was going to be difficult he suffered a reversion of his thoughts about king and fyrd the lords were trouble whenever they came whenever they noticed you he ought to have stayed inside he was turning to modig to tell him to make a start at least but found his right arm gripped fiercely by his servant modig pointed brogan saw a man emerge from the stream to their lefta pale small figure for an erling he would say laterand begin to run south he was well behind the fyrd which was almost out of sight certainly they were too far away for any call or cry to summon them back to take this last erling whod kept himself hidden apart from the rest theyd have to let him go brogan thought not that hed get far alone modig made a sound deep in his chest he plunged into the stream splashing through it then began running spade in hand stop cried brogan dont be a fool the erling was moving fast but so was young modig chasing him far away the dust of the kings men could be seen brogan watched the two running men till they were out of sight later that morning he assembled the villagers to gather the weapons and armourand the rings and arm torcs and belts and boots and brooches and necklacesof the erlings the children ran about chasing away the birds brogan made it very clear talking more than anyone could remember that the fyrd was coming back and that death had been promised to anyone known to have taken anything the presence of eighteen dead raiders the shock of them meant that no one did try to palm or pocket a thing so far as brogan could tell they carried the gear in relays across the water to the mill piled it in his smaller storeroom brogan locked the door hung the key on his belt he picked out only two rings for himself and a golden torc in the shape of a dragon devouring its own tail added three other pieces of jewellery after when most of the others had gone to bring wood and the two who had stayed behind with him as guards were drowsing under the willow by the stream it was a warm day across the water boys were throwing stones at birds and wild dogs near the eighteen dead men it was two of the boys who found the body of modig the son of ord shortly after midday a little distance to the south his ears and nose had been hacked off and his tongue that last brogan the miller thought was a sad and vicious thing he was angry hed found a perfect servant finally and the young fool had gone and gotten himself killed life was an ambush brogan thought bitterly a series of them over and over till you died later in the day the villagers began streaming back with armloads and carts of wood and the cleric their women came too and all but the youngest children this was a great event something unimaginable never to be forgotten the king had been here himself had saved them from erling raiders slain them all right beside the millstream their millstream a tale for the colder nights to come and the long years babies not yet born would hear this story be led to the place where it had happened the new cleric spoke under the open sky invoking jads power and mercy then they lit the pyre using wood that had been gathered for winter hearths and they burned the erlings in the field where theyd died after they dug a grave and buried modig by the stream and prayed that he might go home to the god in light in a mist before dawn some distance west bern thorkellson dismounted to relieve himself in a gully his first halt since leaving his father outside esferth he had spent what remained of the night riding very fast trying to take his mind from that impossible encounter what was it the gods were doing with their mortal children you took a horse across black frozen waters and lived fought your way into jormsvik went on a raid in anglcyn lands and were rescued by your father twice your accursed father whose murders were the reason for all of this for everything that had happened and he simply showed up where you wereon the other side of the seaand knocked you out in an alley and somehow carried you outside the walls and then came back to warn you and order you on your way it was all hugely difficult bern could not have said that much about the world seemed clear to him that night he had just finished retying his trousers when a man and woman sat up from a hollow in the ground and stared at him a handful of paces away this at least was clear enough they stood it was still quite dark mist around them rising off the fields their clothing and hair were disordered it was evident what theyd been doing the same thing young men and women did in meadows all over the world on a summer night bern had done it on the isle in better days he drew his sword lie down again he said quietly his own language but theyd understand him and no one is hurt youre an erling the young man said too loudly what are you doing here with a blade my own business attend to yours lie down again with her rot that said the man who was broadshouldered longlimbed my fathers the reeve here strangers declare themselves when they come by are you a fool bern asked calmly enough hed have thought it was because he was with his girl bern later decided that the anglcyn did what he did he reached down grabbed a thick staff hed have carried out with him for protection from animals and stepped forward swinging it at berns head the woman cried out bern dropped to a knee heard the whistle of the staff he rose and levelled a short backhand slash with his sword to the mans right arm at the elbow he felt it hit hard but not bite hed used the flat of his blade couldnt have said why a memory of summer fields with a girl stupidity such as this mans didnt deserve to be indulged or rewarded the anglcyn ought to have lost an arm his life didnt the fool know how the world worked you met a mounted man with a sword you did what he instructed you and prayed urgently that youd live to tell about it the staff had fallen to the grass the anglcyns good hand clutched at his elbow bern couldnt see his eyes in the darkness dont kill us the girl said her first words bern looked at her i hadnt intended to he said she had fair hair was tall it was hard to make out more i told you to lie down do it now though if you let this idiot between your legs again youre as much a fool as he is the girls mouth opened she stared at him for longer than hed have expected then she reached out and pulled the man down beside her into the hollow again where theyd been warm together moments ago young and in summertime honour your god in the morning bern said looking down at them he wasnt sure why hed said that either he went back to gyllir and rode away in the hollow behind him druce the son of finan who was indeed kings reeve of the lands thereabouts began swearing viciously though under his breath in case cwene the bakers daughter put a hand to his mouth hush does it hurt she whispered of course it hurts he snarled he broke my arm she was clever understood that his pride was wounded as well after being so easily subdued in front of her he had a sword she said there was naught you could do i thought you were very brave she thought hed been a reckless imbecile she was aware that they ought to have died here druces arm should have been severed not bruised or broken by that sword the erling could have done anything he wanted to her after anything at all then left them dead in the tall grass with no one ever to know exactly what had happened she said nothing more lay there beside druce looking up at the last stars as blackness became grey feeling the breeze that blew eventually they made their way back towards the village separated in the usual way went to their homes cwene slipped into the house the way shed come out through the door that connected to the animal shed familiar smells sounds everything changed forever she should have died in the field each breath she took now for the rest of her days she got into bed beside her sister who stirred but did not wake cwene didnt sleep it was too near to morning she lay there thinking revisiting what had happened her heart was pounding though she was in bed at home now she began to weep silently three months later in autumn the baker beat her until she named the reeves son as the father of the child she was carrying at that point her father became mightily pleased it was a very good match and carried his anger across the village to the reeves door the baker was a large man himself and not inconsequential she and druce were wed before winter they had two more children before he was killed by someone who didnt want to pay his taxes or lose his farm cwene married twice more outlived them both five children survived childhood including the daughter conceived in the meadow that summer night cwene had dreams all her life of the moment in darkness when an erling had come upon them a creature out of nightmare and had gone away leaving them their lives as a gift to use or throw away we like to believe we can know the moments well remember of our own days and nights but it isnt really so the future is an uncertain shape in the dark and men and women know that what is less surely understood is that this is true of the past as well what lingers or comes back unsummoned is not always what we would expect or desire to keep with us it was late in a long life and three husbands had been laid in the earth before cwene realizedand acknowledged to herselfthat what she had wanted to do more than anything before or since was ride away from her home and everyone she knew in the world with that erling on his grey horse that night long ago the clever girl had become a wise woman through the turning years she forgave herself for that longing before she died riding south bern was increasingly aware of hungerhe hadnt eaten since late the day beforebut he was also conscious of a cold steady fear in his gut and he didnt let gyllir slow as the sun rose climbing the summer sky he felt appallingly exposed here in these flat lands running to the sea knowing the fyrd was abroad and looking for erlings with vengeance in mind the anglcyn worshipped a god of the sun would that make a difference would it help them under so much summer light he had never thought such a thing before and he didnt much like thinking about it now but hed never been among jaddites either rabady isle seemed very far away their farm at the village edge even the straw in the barn behind arni kjellsons house he kept glancing around as he rode an unceasing sweep of the wide lands to his left the signal flares had been farther east and aeldreds course had lain on the far side of the riverto begin with there was nothing to say the king hadnt split his riders in the night sending some of them this way bern feeling more alone than he had since the night hed left the isle with halldrs horse had a painful sense that the kings men would be very good at knowing where the jormsvik ships might be gyllir was tired but there was no help for that he leaned forward slapped the horses neck spoke to it as a friend they had to keep moving for one thing his might be the only alert the others could get they had to have five ships offshore before two hundred men came sweeping down upon them the gods knew the men of jormsvik could fight it might be a close battle if the fyrd came they could easily win it but if enough of them died or if the ships were damaged there was no meaning to such a victory glorious or not theyd die in these anglcyn lands when esferth and the accursed burhs aeldred had built sent out the next waves of men he wasnt quite ready bern realized to go to ingavins halls he looked east again no longer into the toobright sun past midday now the mist had long since burnt away no hilltop signal fires in this bright daylight a beautiful afternoon birdsong from the forest west a hawk overhead circling he had no idea what was happening elsewhere could only hasten to the sea his father had done this too bern thought suddenly had done more in fact that journey alone across the wall and the breadth of the anglcyn lands when hed escaped from the cyngael after the volgan died and now thorkell was back here had even been among the cyngael again taken by them a second time bern wanted to think of something derisive but couldnt i got you out of a walled city think on it the quiet assured voice and a blow to the head when hed spoken too fast as if bern were still a boy on rabady but his father had known about ivarr had guessed what ragnarson would say how did he always know he cursed thorkell as he had so many times since his fathers exile but without fever or fire now he was too tired had too many things to think about he was hungry and afraid he looked left again and behind him nothing there a shimmer of heat coming off the ripening fields gyllir would have to drink soon he needed water himself not quite yet he decided it was too exposed where they were right now he didnt recognize the landscape nearly well enough couldnt tell how far he had yet to ride though theyd come this way going north to esferth he and ecca on the other side of the river there had been a number of people on that road heading for a royal fair the erlings hadnt known about third year of the fair someone told them they hadnt been hiding on the way north had pretended to be traders theyd carried sacks on the horses purporting to hold the goods theyd trade eccas anger had begun on the road with what theyd heard if this was the third year of a summer fair then any tale theyd been told about esferth being empty was hollow as an emptied ale cask ivarr ragnarson hed said to bern was either a fool or a serpent and he suspected the latter bern hadnt paid enough attention on that ride and was suffering for it now all the endless shallow dips and folds up and down up and down looked exactly the same the farmland across the river seemed an unimaginable expanse of fertile soil to someone raised on rabady isles stony ground he turned in the saddle to look back again a constant fear of pursuers behind him the farms began just across the river anyone in the near fields could see him a single horseman passing between river and wood not alarming in itself unless they were close enough to see what he was the trees on his right were dark no tracks or paths into them sunlight would fail here there were woods like this in vinmark untamed unbroken stretching forever gods and beasts within them this forest would be pretty much impenetrable he guessed wild and dangerous an unbroken density of oak and ash alder and thorn marching west to the cyngael lands ecca had said that on the way a better wall than the wall was the saying and the woods went right down to cliffs above the strait theyd seen those cliffs from the ships the anglcyn would know all this far better than he did theyd know the erling ships had to be east of those sheer bluffs in one shallow bay or another they were there werent so many choices and they hadnt been overly subtle about choosing one too many mistakes on this endofsummer raid ivarr ragnarsons raid theyd anchored taken hasty counsel sent bern and ecca north to look at esferth ecca had done this many times knew what he was about and bern had a young reassuring countenance brand leofson had also agreed to let guthrum and atli lead a small sweep east to see what they could find or take while they waited for the report from esferth and ivarr had gone with them bern was the report from esferth now ivarr ragnarson would kill him thorkell had said if he learned who berns father was suddenly and much too late bern understood think the rest of it out while you ride hed been told and he wants to go back west back west ivarr had just been there then in the cyngael lands and thorkell had been with him that was how his father knew what had happened and about poisoned arrows something had happened there thorkell had been taken again or else there was never enough time to think things through the world didnt seem to work that way maybe for women weaving and spinning maybe for jaddite clerics in their isolated retreats waking in the night to pray for the sun but not for a bound servant on rabady isle or a jormsvik mercenary either riding towards another gentle grassy rise almost identical to the one before and the one before that bern heard the sounds of battle ahead of him across the river the riders guthrum skallson had sent made it back to the ships early in the morning the help guthrum requested was dispatched without hesitation by brand who was commanding the raid you didnt leave men behind it was one of the things that marked jormsvik the riders had spoken feverishly interrupting each other more unsettled than raiders ought to be they told of a clash between guthrum and ivarr ragnarson over the death of an anglcyn earl brand shrugged hearing of it these things happened hed have sided with guthrumearls were worth a great deal unless out of favourbut sometimes he had to admit you just needed to kill someone especially if it hadnt happened in a long time that came with the way they lived with the dragonships with the eagles of ingavin and he knew for a fact that guthrum skallson had done his share of killing prisoners over the years theyd sort this when everyone got back forty mercenaries ought to have been more than enough to meet and protect guthrum and atlis small party from any likely anglcyn response fight their way back to the ships if they did encounter anyone brand ordered three ships offshore to be safe left two anchored in the shallows lightly manned for the returning parties to board and row he was being prudent but was not alarmed shore parties met people incidents happened sometimes deaths this was a raid wasnt it what did people expect jormsvik had been doing this over the known world for a long time erlings had been coming in longships to these shores for more than a hundred years yes the anglcyn lands had become harder to raid over the last while but that had happened at times too there were always other places three ships had gone last spring out through the straits and down the sea lanes to alrassan to raid and run before the khalifs men could be there with their curved swords and bows that would have been a fight to be part of brand had thought hearing the tale he wanted to go there see for himself there was word had it wealth beyond description among those desertborn starworshippers he wanted to see their women behind the veils they wore it was the life he knew raiding the northlands offered no refuge for anyone vinmark was a hard place sent forth hard men and how else could a man of spirit make his fortune claim a place by winter hearths and in the skalds songs and then the gods meadhalls it wasnt as if every man could fish or find land to farm or make ale or barrels for ale it wasnt as if every man wanted to you hoped that if you killed someone on a raid you gained something from it and if some of your own died that youd taken even more to compensate then you sacrificed to ingavin and thünir and rowed back out to sea if you had to or pushed forward inland depending on where you were and what you were facing brand had lost count of the number of times hed had decisions like this to make they had five fully manned ships here allowing room for horses five ships was a large group this incident might even be useful before it ended brand thought forty jormsvik fighters could overwhelm any hasty anglcyn pursuit of guthrum from a burh take the leaders hostagefor security first then gold safety and a reward the oldest tactics of all just about some things never changed he thought he kept his own ship as one of the two on shore he was wrong in fact about a number of things but had no real way of knowing it from the bay where the ships were hidden they hadnt seen the signal fires a great deal had changed in these lands in the twentyfive years since aeldred son of gademar had come out from beortferth and reclaimed his fathers throne the party dispatched from the ships guided by two of the by now exhausted riders guthrum had sent back did find a group of men not their returning companions by then guthrum and his men were lying dead beside the pyre that would burn them across a stream from a village mill nor did brands relief contingent meet some overextended tooquick pursuit from drengest on the coast instead forty erlings from the ships most of them on foot encountered the mounted fyrd of king aeldred in a field east of the river thorne a little past midday from the moment hed heard the name againivarr ragnarsonspoken by the jormsvik leader just before he was killed at the kings saddle ceinion of llywerth had felt a terrifying surmise taking shape within him he was not a man inclined to flinch from thoughts or truths whether of spirit and faith or having to do with the earthly world in which men lived and died but this growing awareness as the sun rose and the day wore on caused him an almost physical pain a constriction of the heart the last of the volgans had hired this company hired them it seemed for a raid near esferth at the very end of the season but that made no sense aeldred had these lands far too well defended especially with the fair about to begin but what if you hadnt really meant to stay here if youd lied to the mercenaries about your purpose what if youd killed a lucrative hostage to stop them from claiming a vast ransom and happily turning home there were compelling reasons why ivarr ragnarson might want to lead mercenaries to cyngael shores and to a particular farmhouse the jormsvik leaders would regard it as a waste of time too far to go this time of year theyd have to be tricked persuaded this was a man ceinion remembered who had bloodeagled a girl and a farmhand during his flight last spring he was said to be deformed in body and spirit for the two went together always ceinion had led the dawn prayers south of the meadow where theyd killed the erlings had kept them brisk for there was need for haste hed mounted with the others and rode again beside the king with the gods sun rising behind them aeldred said nothing as they went only rasped quick orders to some riders who peeled away from the company and headed east it was difficult to see this grimfaced deathdealing figure as the man whod talked about translated manuscripts and ancient learning in the night just past ceinion kept his distance from alun ab owyn as they went he didnt even want to exchange a glance with the prince fearful that he might give his thoughts away if owyns son learned what the cleric was thinking he might go wild with helpless panic which was not in truth far from a good description of what ceinion was feeling himself as the morning passed and the countryside rolled beneath horses hooves the sun was overhead now if the dragonships of jormsvik were not found if they had already cast off with ragnarson aboard and gone west there would be nothing he or anyone else could do but pray ceinion of llywerth high cleric of the cyngael believed in his god of light and in the power of holy prayer for almost everything that could be except the most potent matter of all the life and death of those he loved there was a woman lying in a sanctuary graveyard by the sea within sound of the surf beneath a pale grey stone with a simple sun disk carved upon it and her dying had taken that belief from him a wound a rip in the fabric of the world he had gone a little mad as she died had done things that still kept him awake some nights this was not a matter of which hed written in his long correspondence with rhodias and the patriarch he was also thinking in this bright sunlight of another woman loved and her husband loved and their daughter coming into her glory all of whom might or might not be at brynnfell now and he had no way of knowing and no way of helping them unless they got to the ships in time can we not go faster he asked the king of the anglcyn no need he said he sent for help remember they will be coming this way aeldred said looking briefly at him i am sure of it well stop soon to rest and eat the rivers ahead i want the fyrd fresh for a fight some of them will be coming said ceinion but we must reach the longships before they get them off from shore theyve done that already jormsvik knows how to do these things well try to block their way home with the fleet in drengest i have six ships i sent riders to themtheyll be in the water before sundown fishing boats out too to watch for them if we find this rescue party the erlings will be undermanned at sea they have horses which means the wide slow boats not the fighting ones i mean to take them all ceinion if they go home my lord ceinion said quietly aeldred threw him a glance what is it i dont know the king asked the cleric was about to tell him when the horns blew then the great grey dog aluns dog sounded his own warning and ahead of them ceinion saw the erlings with the river just beyond one of the outriders was galloping back he reined hard beside them forty or fifty my lord mostly on foot we have them then get the mounted ones first the king ordered no messages back athelbert going my lord his son shouted over his shoulder already moving calling for archers as he went ceinion watched the prince ride readying his bow easy in the saddle his archers swift and smooth to respond to commands precisely trained his own contingent here a very different man than his brother the sons of aeldred he thought might have divided their fathers nature between themselves that could happen he had seen it before he also had a thought as battle began about the way aeldreds men were fighting today from the saddle with arrows as well as spears which was new and immensely difficult and even more difficult to counter if they had mastered it it looked very much as though athelbert and his archers had done that his own people ceinion thought had even more reason to tryto at least tryto come together now and find some way to join the world beyond their hidden valleys there might be a certain pride in being the last light of the gods sun where it set in the west but there were dangers as well such thoughts were for later right now he watched a goodsized party of jormsvik mercenaries form another desperate circle as athelberts archers and the others came up to them the raiders had already crossed the river bad for them they couldnt have retreated in any case outnumbered and facing horsemen in hostile country they were brave men no one on earth could deny or refute that no swords or axes were thrown down not even when the command to surrender was given by one of athelberts thegns ceinion saw two erling riders racing back west for the river not cowards messengers athelbert and five of his archers were pursuing them arrows flew from moving horsesand missed the jormsvik raiders splashed into the river which was deeper and wider here than by esferth they began fording it athelbert came up to the bank of the thorne ceinion watched as the prince took steadier aim and fired twice he was too far to see what happened in the water but a moment later athelbert and his riders turned back the prince lifted an arm to signal his father then he rode calmly to rejoin the fyrd surrounding the erling force men had just died here ceinion knew as they had this morning and in the night what did you make of that what words and reflections it was the fate of men and women to die often before what should have been their time should have been too much presumption in the thought all rested with jad but survivors carried memories he moved forward when the king did have care my lord cried a redhaired thegn they havent yielded shoot ten said aeldred my lord ceinion protested ten men were shot where they stood even as he spoke athelberts archers were really very good you watched them and you learned something important about the prince frivolous as he might seem when at play in a meadow you said you want us to get to the ships the king said tersely watching the deaths not looking at him if they can send forty in a rescue party theyll have five maybe six ships might even be seven depending on how many horses ill need my whole company and good men will die in that fight if we get to them in time dont ask me to linger here or be merciful not this day cleric cleric no more than that a king celebrated for courtesy suing eloquently for ceinions presence at his court but there was a rage in aeldred now ceinion saw and the king was hardpressed to contain it in fact he couldnt it was spilling over burgred of denferth had been a friend from childhood and beyond that truth this was a large raid on the eve of the fair in esferththreatening to undermine the very idea of the fair what merchants would come to these shores from abroad or even overland from north or east if they had cause to fear attacks from vinmark hear me i am aeldred of the anglcyn the king said moving his bay horse forward two of the fyrd shifted to stay between him and the erlings axes could be thrown whichever man leads here order your men to lay down their arms aeldred waited athelbert ceinion saw was looking at his father bow still to hand no one moved in the erling circle or spoke swords and short axes remained levelled outwards about thirty of them now if they charged theyd die so would some of the anglcyn the king is too close he thought aeldred shifted his horse sideways and even nearer do it now erlings unless you wish ten more of you executed the men you were sent to meet are dead behind us all of them if you fight you will be killed here without mercy there are two hundred of us better die sword in hand than cut down as cowards a very big man yellowbearded to the chest stepped forward you give sworn oath to ransom if we yield ourselves aeldred opened his mouth he was rigid again the idea of a demand he looked at his son no my lord ceinion cried no they will yield aeldreds mouth snapped shut his jaw was clenched his gloved hands fists on his reins ceinion saw him close his eyes after a long moment the king loosened the fingers of one hand and made the sign of the sun disk ceinion drew a ragged breath his palms were sweating drop all weapons and tell us where the ships are you will not be killed the yellowbearded erling stared at him it was remarkable ceinion thought the absence of fear in his eyes no we yield ourselves to you but cannot betray shipmates aeldred shrugged athelbert he said before ceinion could speak the erling leader died falling backwards three arrows in his chest through the leather armour a fourth went into his cheekbone below the helmet quivered there where he lay in the grass who is it aeldred said after a moment who will now speak for you you have no more time weapons down guides to the longships my lord ceinion said again desperately in the holy name of jad and by all the blessed aeldred wheeled on him heed your own words do you want these ships stopped before they go west and not east do you in jads name we do came a third urgent voice ceinion looked over quickly alun ab owyn was moving his horse towards them we do my lord king kill them and ride surely you know where they might be high cleric you heard ivarr ragnarson bought these men they will be going for brynnfell not home we cant get back in time hed figured it out after all it seemed he wasnt too young and he was right of course about the timing ships from drengest out to sea by sundown ordered to block sea lanes east would not catch up to trained erling seamen by the time new orders reached them even if they followed them westand aeldred had no reason to give such a commandtheyd be more than half a day behind and they wouldnt be as skilled on the water athelbert please proceed if you will be so good said the king of the anglcyn he might have been asking his elder son to comment in his turn on a liturgical passage being considered ceinion in great pain watched ten more erlings die theyd refused to surrender he told himself aeldred had given them that chance the pain did not lessen even after the arrows flew no one came forward from the nowshrunken circle to yield instead the last twenty of them screamed together terrifyingly distilling childhood nightmares for ceinion in that sound as they cried the names of their gods to the blue sky and the white clouds they charged straight into the arrows and blades of two hundred mounted men could childhood fears be expunged in this way ceinion wondered remembering how many chapels and sanctuaries and good holy men had burned amid those same cries to ingavin and thünir he watched the first erlings fall and then the last swords and axes gripped never betraying their fellows they died in battle weapons to hand and so promised a place among eagles in halls of undying glory it appalled him and he never forgot the unspeakable courage of it hating every one of those men and what they made him think there was a silence after in the field it all took remarkably little time very well let us go said the king after a long moment we will leave instructions farther south for men to come gather their weapons and burn them here he twitched his reins turned his horse alun ab owyn ceinion saw was already ahead of them all desperately impatient the grey dog was beside him my lord said the redhaired thegn look there he was pointing back south and east to where oaks between them and the sea were broken by a valley ceinion turned with aeldred oh my said prince athelbert a group of men eight or ten of them some mounted some on foot with other horses pulling a cart were coming towards them waving and calling voices carrying faintly in the summer air and then more clearly as they neared no one moved the small party approached it took some time their leader was riding in the cart he appeared to have a wound was holding his side he was also the one most vigorously shouting gesticulating with his free hand visibly agitated visibly from the south as well ceinion saw and speaking a foreign tongue jads holy light said king aeldred softly they are asharite from alrassan what is he saying someone ceinion knew fragments of esperañan not asharite he tried it called a greeting without missing a beat in his tirade the merchant in the cart switched languages the king turned to ceinion expectantly forty dead men lay on the grass around them two of athelberts men had dismounted were efficiently collecting arrows he is outraged my lord and unhappy they declare themselves to have been assaulted injured and robbed on their way to esferth fair by one man if i understand properly an erling he took a horse a good horse i gather meant for you in esferth they are they are displeased with the protection being offered to visitors aeldred looked from the cleric to the man in the cart his eyes had widened ibn bakir he said looking at the merchant my stud horse my manuscripts ceinion translated as best he could then somewhat belatedly told the visitors who the man on the bay horse was the asharite merchant straightened too quickly the cart was a precarious place to stand he bowed almost fell one of his fellows steadied him the merchant had a wound in his right side blood welled through what appeared to be green silk he had a dark bruise on the side of his head he nodded energetically however turned reached down still being steadied and pulled some parchment scrolls from a trunk behind him he waved them in the air the way hed waved his hand before calling for aid someone laughed then controlled himself ask him said alun ab owyn his voice strained if the erling was unusual in his appearance they hadnt heard him come back the king glanced over at alun ceinion asked the question he didnt know the word for unusual but managed strange the merchants effusive manner grew calmer with the overexcited manner fading he seemed more impressive notwithstanding the fluttering green garment this was a man who had after all travelled a long way he answered gravely standing on his cart ceinion heard him felt a wind in his soul he says the erling was white as a dead spirit his face his hair not natural he surprised them rushing out from the trees took only the horse ragnarson said alun unnecessarily he was looking at aeldred my lord king we must ride we can beat him therethey lied to you this morning back in the meadow he wasnt with their messengers to the ships hes just ahead of us i believe said the king of the anglcyn that this is so i agree with you we should ride five men were detailed to escort the merchants to esferth and lodge them with honour the rest of the fyrd turned west and south they paused only to fill their flasks and let the horses drink it was alun ab owyn who led them splashing into the river thorne and across and it was alun who set the pace after alongside the woods until some of those who actually knew where they were going caught up with him the king his bay horse galloping beside ceinions asked only one question on the long ride that followed ragnarson is the man who led the raid last spring brynnfell when the cadyri prince was killed ceinion nodded there was nothing more to say and a great need for speed they never caught up with him never saw more than the sign of tracks ahead alone at first then merging with those of another horsefollowing it not side by side the tracks ran back southeast a little as the river curved between ridges of hills both sets cutting at precisely the place where the anglcyn outsiders had thought they might they followed galloping between stream and forest and they came at length to a sheltered strand of stones and the sea westering sun on the water by then white clouds on the breeze tang of salt clear evidence of ships having been beached here and a large company of men very recently nothing more than those signs empty the wide sea in all directions no way to know none at all which way the ships had gone but ceinion knew he knew the king ordered the fyrd to dismount to let tired horses graze along the beach up a little way where there was grass he gave time for riders to rest as well eat and drink after which he called his thegns to council invited ceinion to come and alun ab owyn a generous gesture at which time it was discovered that alun and his dog and his erling servant were nowhere to be found no man had seen them leave the strand half a dozen outriders were dispatched it wasnt long before they returned one of them shook his head ceinion standing beside the king took a step towards them and stopped without speaking owyn of cadyr he was thinking had only the one son living now he might lose them both one of the riders dismounted they have gone my lord that much was obvious where said aeldred the rider cleared his throat into the forest i fear a stir then silence among those gathered ceinion saw men making the sign of the sun disk he had just done the same a habit as old as he was what he thought am i going to say to the father a wind was blowing now from the east the sun was going down their horses tracks go in there the outrider added into the woods of course they do ceinion thought it was madness entirely so what alun wanted to do coming here theyd followed the coastal path all the way skirting the wood of course they had that was how you went from the south you travelled along the coast if you were starting north you went through the watchtower gates of the wall but not the forest no one went through the woods but the coastal path would only take you back to cadyr in the south and arberthand brynnfellwould be four days beyond that up the river valleys retracing the coast road would be a wasted meaningless journey it wouldnt do not if you had decided that the erlings were heading for brynn ap hywlls farm again if you had decided that and you knew ivarr ragnarson was aboard then you could do something shaped by madness ceinion felt old again that seemed to be happening to him more and more the mans voice had sounded genuinely regretful just now reporting the tidings the young cyngael prince had saved king aeldreds life this morning they had all seen it they would be sorry to see a young life end in this way someone swore savagely breaking the mood athelbert he strode angrily away up the strand stones there some grass grazing horses light glittering on the water it would be dark in the woods and they stretched all the way to the cyngael lands and no one went through them ceinion closed his eyes it was growing cooler late in the day edge of the sea the sun going down he would die in there owyns younger son i am too old ceinion thought again he was rememberingso vividlythe father as a young man equally reckless even more impulsive and now that man was an aging prince and his son was about to find his own end trying to go through the untracked woods carrying a warning all the long way home a desperate glorious folly the way of the cyngael eleven bern backed down on hands and knees from the ridge when he saw the anglcyn archers begin to shoot there was a disaster happening crisp and bright in the sunlight blue river green grass deeper green of trees beyond the manycoloured horses the arrows caught by light as they flew he felt ill watching you didnt abandon shipmates but he knew what he was seeing his task was to get back to the coast alive with his warning and these tidings of catastrophe the anglcyn were riding for the sea breathing deeply struggling to calm himself he led gyllir away from the battle to the very edge of the forest even in daylight the trees felt oppressive menacing spirits and powers not to mention hunting cats and wolves and wild boars were in such woods the volurs who put themselves into trances to see along the dark pathways of the dead said that there were animals that housed the spirits of the old gods and wanted blood looking at the darkness on his right he could half believe in such creatures but for all that a more certain death lay in the other direction with the fyrd theyd ridden at least as fast as he had to get to this place which was unsettling back home the old women said an erling on a horse of the sea an anglcyn on a horse still hed not have thought gyllir could be matched aeldreds riders were here though he couldnt linger waiting would bring them across the river bern used the trees as a backdrop riding right alongside them so as not to appear clearly against the sky even so in the moments when he passed up and then down along the ridge and had to be in view his heart felt painful and loud as if his chest were a drum he leaned low over gyllirs neck and he whispered a prayer to ingavin who knew the ways of secrecy no cry went up just as bern thorkellson crested that ridge an agitated party of merchants from alrassan was hailing the fyrd coming towards them loud with indignation they saved his life for the outriders turned to see it happens this way small things accidents of timing and congruence and then all that flows in our lives from such moments owes its unfolding course for good or ill to them we walk or stumble along paths laid down by events of which we remain forever ignorant the road someone else never took or travelled too late or soon means an encounter a piece of information a memorable night or death or life bern stayed low in the saddle his neck hairs prickling till he was sure he was out of sight only then did he straighten and give gyllir his head galloping towards the sea he saw gentle rolling country rich land the sort of soil that made a soft easy people not like vinmark where cliffs crashed jaggedly down in places where the sea gouged the land like a blade where rockstrewn slopes and icebound winters made farming a wounding aspiration on farms never large enough where younger sons took to the sea roads with helm and blade or starved the erlings were hard with cause reasons deep and cold as the black still waters knifing between cliffs these people over here with their loamy generous soil and their god of light were well in fact these people were smashing the best raiders vinmark had right now the story didnt seem to hold not any more the shape and balance of the world had changed his father he didnt want to think about his father had said that more than once on the isle after hed decided his raiding days were over thorkell really shouldnt be here bern thought riding south at speed he felt too young to sort it through but not too young to be aware that the changes were happening had already happened there was a distance still to go but not so much now as he finally began to recognize where he was gyllir was labouring but so surely would be the mounts of aeldreds fyrd behind him theyd be coming he knew it andsudden thoughttheyd see his tracks and realize he was ahead of them he had to outrace them to the water with enough time to get the ships offshore he was dripping with sweat in the sunlight could smell his own fear when he saw the valley he remembered it gave thanks for that he followed it southeast and almost as soon as he did smelled salt on the wind the valley opened out he saw their strand only two ships still anchored the other three already out in the straits beyond he began to shout as he galloped up continued shouting as he leaped from gyllirs back stumbling into the midst of the encampment he tried to be coherent wasnt sure if he succeeded these were jormsvik men however they moved with a speed hed not have believed possible before hed joined them the camp was struck and the last two ships undermanned but no help for that had oars in place and were pulling to sea before the sun had swung much farther west this was their life salt and hardship dragonprows an erling on a horse of the sea brands own ship was last they were rowing after the others when someone called out to them from shore another of those moments when so much may turn one way or another for they might have been just a little quicker from shore and so too far out to hear bern did hear it though looked back from where he stood beside the oneeyed leader of their raid who is it brand leofson rasped squinting a rider in the water waving one arm forcing a reluctant horse into the sea after them leave him said bern whose eyes were very good let him be killed by aeldred he lied to us from the start ecca kept saying so he felt fear and a cold anger where is ecca brand asked turning his good eye to bern killed in esferth their king was there hundreds of men theres an accursed fair going on i told youragnarson lied the man beside him captain raid leader veteran of half a hundred battles across the world chewed one side of his moustache thats him in the water brand said bern nodded i want to talk to that misbegotten bastard brand said if hes to die ill do it myself and report it at home back oars he cried ramp out sling for the horse precise movements began this is a mistake bern was thinking couldnt escape the thought as he watched the strange deadly man on a magnificent inexplicable horse come closer through the waves it seemed to him feeling helpless as a child that this was a moment in which his lifeand not only his ownmight be hanging as in a merchants balance in the afternoon light under swift indifferent clouds ivarr ragnarson was taken aboard that said brand oneeye gazing into the sea is an asharite horse bern had no idea if this was true or not couldnt see why it mattered the horse was pulled up a sling drawn under its belly by a man who knew how to swim they all threw their weight to the far side to keep the ship in balance as it happened a difficult exercise done with ease the balance seemed to tilt in berns mind as he turned from watching the horse lifted aboard to regarding the twistmouthed dripping wet whitefaced whitehaired paleeyed grandson of siggur volganson last surviving heir of the greatest of all their warriors ivarr strode to stand directly in front of leofson how dare you leave shore without me you wormeaten lump of dung he said you couldnt get used to his voice no one else talked like that it was icy and it cut brand leofson so addressed looked at ivarr with what seemed genuine perplexity this was his ship he was leader of a jormsvik raid a captain of many years standing surrounded by his fellows he shook his head slowly as if to clear it then he knocked ivarr tothe deck with a backhanded blow to the face pull away he called over his shoulder hard on the benches all of you out of sight of shore sail up whichever way the wind takes us well have a lantern council at darkfall signal the others and you he said turning back to ragnarson will stay where you are on the deck if you stand up i will knock you down again if you do it twice i swear by ingavins eye and my own i will throw you into the sea ivarr ragnarson stared up at him but didnt move the toopale eyes bern decided held more black rage than hed have ever thought to see in a man he looked away his father he didnt want to think about his father had warned him the youngest of the mercenaries turned away ivarr saw fear in his face ivarr was used to both people avoided looking at him all the time after furtive glances of horror and fascination and there was often fear ivarr ragnarson was white as a bone malformed at one shoulder his eyes were strange and not good in bright sunlightand men were riddled with fears of the unknown of spirits of angry unassuaged gods this young onehe couldnt remember names people didnt matter enoughhad a different quality to his apprehension though something more than the obvious ivarr couldnt say what it was but he could sense it he had a skill that way to be considered later as was the fact that he was going to kill brand leofson hed been struck twice today by mongrels from jormsvik one of them skallson had already been slain by the anglcyn denying ivarr the pleasure this one here would have to be allowed to live a little longer leofson was needed if this raid was still going to work sometimes pleasures had to be deferred lying on the deck of a ship saltsoaked bruised and exhausted and bleeding ivarr ragnarson felt sure of his control of events even now it helped that almost everyone you dealt with was a fool weak though they might think themselves hard undermined by needs and desires friendships and ambitions ivarr had no such weaknesses he was cut off by his appearance from any possibility of leadership and acceptance that disposed of ambition friendship as well and his desires were other than those of most men his brother mikkeldead in a cyngael farmyard one of ingavins great hulking fools in lifehad actually thought he could be a leader of the erling people the way their grandfather was that was why mikkel had wanted to go to brynnfell revenge and the sword with the volgans sword in hand hed said ale cup sloshing about he could rally people around him to the familys name he might have if he hadnt been thick in the head like a plough ox and if kjarten vidursona man ivarr had to admit he wondered abouthadnt clearly been readying himself for a claim of kingship in hlegest with infinitely more weight than mikkel would ever have had ivarr hadnt said anything about that hed wanted mikkels raid to happen his own reasons for going were so much simpler than his brothers he was bored and he liked killing people vengeance and a raid made killing all right in the eyes of the world with nothing to aspire to no status to seek or favour to attain ivarrs was an uncomplicated existence in some ways when you looked only to yourself decisions came more easily people who harmed or crossed you were to be dealt with without exception that now included those cyngael at brynnfell who had sent him fleeing through a night wood then desperately back to the ships last spring that also meant this maggot brand oneeye right here but only after hed done what ivarr needed him to do which was get him back west there were deaths to be accomplished there first and he still wanted to see if he could grasp and spread someones lungs out on the red crackedopen cage of their ribs while they remained alive bubbling bloodsoaked it was a hard thing to do you needed opportunities to practise before you could do something so delicate when your needs were uncomplicated it was easy enough to spend a good part of the resources you had last of the volgans heir to all they possessed buying two hundred mercenaries at the end of a summer if people had trouble looking at your face for long it was hardly difficult to lie to them the jormsvikings were smug complacent full of selflove beefy and drunken amusingly easy to deceive for all their celebrated prowess on ship and in battle they were what they were ivarr thought tools he had dropped gold and silver onto a trestle table in a jormsvik barracks hall and told them that aeldreds coastal burh at drengest was unfinished underdefended with ships they might seize for themselves and a newly dedicated sanctuary with too much gold hed seen this he said when he and his brother went west in spring and a watchman theyd taken and killed for information along the coast had told them before he died that the king and fyrd were spending the summer at raedhill hunting north of it leaving esferth exposed another lie but ivarr was good at lying ale went round a smokefilled room then round again and songs were sung about jormsvik glories in days gone by and then came another predictable song ivarr had heard it too many times but made himself smile as if in rue and remembrance about siggur volganson and the great summer of twin assaults on ferrieres and karch and the famous raid on the hidden sanctuary at champieres where hed claimed his sword more drinking during that and after men asleep at the tables heads down among spilled ale and guttered candles in the morning ivarr formally paid the mercenaries to make it worth their while to sail even if they should find little enough for the taking in the anglcyn lands he stung their prideso easilypointing out how long it had been since theyd challenged aeldred on his own soil there was glory to be won swords to be reddened ivarr said before dark winter came to the northlands again and closed the wild sea make it sound like music hed found and listeners would dance to your songwhile not looking at your face simple really men were easy to deceive you needed only to be clear in your mind about what you wanted them to do ivarr always had been was even more so now brynn ap hywll and any of his family found were to be staked out naked alive in the slop and mud of their own farmyard while ivarr carved them one by one ap hywll was fat as a summer hog hed need to cut deep that was all right it was not a difficulty the bloodeagle rite was a final act of vengeance for his slain brother and grandfather he would say sadly a ritual done in honour of ingavins ravens and eagles and in memory of the volgan line of which he was the last after him they would be no more and men would hear it and look sorrowful would even honour him for it around winter fires amusing but to make it happen he had to get these ships to cyngael shores that was the only uncertain part if you excepted the fortune that underlay his finding those merchants with a horse earlier today that he didnt actually want to think about right now hed have missed the ships otherwise been left on a hostile coast alone perhaps he should think about it perhaps ingavin or thünir was showing his lordly countenance to a pale small crooked figure after all and what could that mean after so many years a distraction for later they had to go west first that had always been the delicate task it would have made no sense for brand leofson or any other leader to take five ships so late in the year for the feeble returns a cyngael raid offered these days ivarr had known that so you worked it another way you told them they were going after aeldred where he was rich and vulnerable and when that provedas you knew it would provenot to be so after all you relied on your tongue and their stupid hunger for ingavinglory to lure them a little farther west since theyd already come this far and it would be such a terrible loss of face to go back emptyhanded it was a good plan would have been easy in fact if burgred of denferth hadnt been with the accursed party theyd surprised in the night the earl had been worth a ransom the raiders could grow fat upon and theyd known it thickwitted and alesodden or not theyd understood who this man was aeldred would have paid the taxes from ten cities and a hundred households to have his companion back and then five jormsvik ships would have turned around and rowed happily home into the wind every man singing all the way it would have driven him mad hed had no choice but to shoot the man an unsatisfying killing done in haste no pain involvedexcept his own when skallson came near to killing him for it ivarr hadnt actually been afraidhe couldnt remember ever being afraidbut he hadnt been ready to die either for one thing he didnt expect eagles or ravens to escort his spirit to shining halls when death came for him ingavin and thünir loved their tall warriors with bright axes and swords not twisted wrymouthed misfits with deathwhite skin and eyes that saw better at twilight than in the days bright sun it was less bright now in fact they had been pulling steadily from the coast and now the sail was up the sun was over west ivarr waited as ever for the evening shadows to come changing the colour of the sea and sky he was happier then happier in winter cold and darkness didnt distress him they felt like his proper place men thought he was weak men were wrong almost without exception fools beyond the telling he wondered sometimes if his mighty grandfathernever seen or known killed in llywerth before ivarr was bornmight have thought the same way crashing like a wave again and again upon peoples who could do nothing against him for year upon year until it ended by that western sea the gods knew he had reasons enough to kill brynn ap hywll he would do the women first ivarr thought let the fat man watch bound and helpless naked amidst the shit of his yard it was a pleasing thought you needed to hold it in mind point towards it let nothing distract or divert you will stand up now said brand leofson a bulky shape above him suddenly before the council begins you will explain your lies hed expected that men were easy to anticipate all he ever needed was a chance to speak ivarr rose slowly to his feet rubbed at his jaw where hed been struck though there wasnt any pain to speak of now it was good to look small though frail no danger to anyone i didnt think youd do what i needed done he mumbled kept his eyes down turned his head away submissive as a beaten wolf hed watched wolves in winter snow learned from them what you admit you lied gods what had the oxbrain expected him to do deny it theyd seen the finished walls and readied ships in drengest which hed said was empty and exposed sixty of them in two parties had been slaughtered today by aeldred and the fyrd out from esferthwhere hed told them the king would not be he hadnt expected those deathsthere was nothing good about losing so many menbut you couldnt let such things affect what youd had in mind for so long this entire endofsummer journey with the jormsvikings was after all a second plan he was supposed to have taken brynnfell and the sword in spring not had his sodden stupid brother die with almost every man in that yard ivarr was all alone in the world now shouldnt there be mournful music with that thought all alone hed killed their sister when he was nine now dear mikkel had been cut down in an arberthi farmyard let the skalds make bad songs of it sorrow for siggurs strong scions valour and vaunt among the volgans he didnt feel sorry for himself what he felt was fury endlessly from first awareness of himself a bent child in a warrior world i lied because we have fallen so far in twentyfive years that even with the warriors of jormsvik i was unsure of us we us the erlings of vinmark friend ingavins children of the middleworld what the oneeyed god does that drivel mean you dripnosed gutter spawn he needed to kill this man had to be careful not to let it show no distractions ivarr looked up then ducked his head again as if ashamed wiped at his nose placatingly my father died a coward his own great father unavenged my brother fell as a hero trying to do so i am the only one left the only one and ingavin has seen fit to have me misshapen unworthy in my poor self to take vengeance for our line and our people brand oneeye spat over the railing of his ship i still dont know what ravenshit rubbish you are spewing speak plain and he means he planned to go to arberth all along brand never had any thought of anglcyn lands he means he tricked us with lies about aeldred to get us to sea ivarr was careful to keep his eyes lowered he felt a pulsing in his head however this young one whoever he was had just become an irritant and you needed to avoid showing that that the truth brand turned to him he was a very big man ivarr hadnt wanted things to move this quickly but part of the skill of these moments was adapting jormsvik has its share of wisdom even from the young ones who might not be expected to know so much it is as the boy says boys older than you think maggot and killed a jormsvik captain in single combat said leofson pompously a beefy thickbrained warrior all he was ivarr held back a grimace hed made a mistake these men were famously bound to each other i didnt mean shut up rodent im thinking the very halls of ingavin tremble at such tidings was what ivarr wanted to say he kept silent composed himself with an image of what he wanted what he needed the family of brynn ap hywll in their own yardor maybe on a table in their hall under torches for better light naked all of them the women soiling themselves with terror exposed to his red carving blade wife and daughters and the fat man himself the goal all else could come later why you want to get to arberth so bad they heard sounds across the water the other ships moving nearer for the council they were out of sight of shore darkness falling soon needed to be careful ships could ram and gouge each other in the sea riding so nearly they would rope them together create a platform of ships even in open water in twilight jormsvik seamen they knew how to do such things better than any men alive a thought there ivarr took a breath as if summoning courage why arberth because kjarten vidurson in hlegest seems ready to be a king and he should have the volgans sword again or someone should he let that last phrase linger emphasized it just enough he hadnt planned to mention vidurson but it worked it worked he could feel it there was a rhythm to these things as ideas came a dance as much as any single combat with weapons ever was the sword repeated brand stupidly my grandfathers blade taken when ap hywll killed him the death never avenged to my shameand our peoples that was twentyfive years ago were mercenaries for the great gods sake ivarr lifted his head let his pale eyes seem to blaze in the torchlight how much glory do you think youd gain brand leofson you and every man here all of jormsvik if you were the ones to regain that sword a satisfying silence on the deck and across the water hed spoken loudly ringing it out that the other boats approaching might also hear he pushed on next part of the song and more do you not think it might even give you give all of us some power and protection from vidurson should he prove other than some think he is he hadnt planned this either he was very happy with it what does that mean leofson snarled now pacing like a bear on the deck ivarr allowed himself to straighten an equal speaking to an equal it was necessary to have that status back what does it mean tell me men of jormsvik how joyously will a northern man who sets himself as king over all the erlingsthe first in four generationslook upon a walled fortress of fighting men in the south who answer only to themselves it was like music a poem he was shaping a if this is so interrupted a voice again you might have raised it with us and let us take counsel at home you said no single word about kjarten vidurson or about arberth or the volgans sword instead tricked to sea with outright lies sixty good men are dead it was the boy the scarcely bearded one he snorted didnt that watchman you say you captured in spring tell you about the new fair starting this year ivarrs flaring anger calmed quickly so easy it was they made it so easy he wanted to laugh they were fools even when they werent he did say that he replied keeping his voice mild the second question had so nicely taken him off the harder first one but he said that because the fair was just beginningas you saythe king was leaving it to his stewards thats why i thought thered be merchants to raid with few to guard them rich takings for brave men just beginning as you said ivarr murmured the young one not as big a man as leofson but wellenough made began to laugh laughing at ivarr with others watching and listening this was not permitted hed killed his sister for laughing like that when she was twelve and he was nine i will not be made mock of ivarr snapped a hotness in his brain no said the other man his amusement subsided he had looked away before he wasnt doing so now lights had been hung on the ships railings all five of them and at prow and stern they were aglow these ships on the water marking the presence of mortal men on the wide darkening sea i dont think im mocking you actually or not only that what are you saying bern asked leofson quietly bern the name to be remembered hes still lying even now you know the peasants saying to trap a fox you let him trap himself he just did listen this is the third year of the esferth fair not the first every man we met on the road knew it the city was thronged brand overflowing tents in the fields guards everywhere and the fyrd i said first year to see what this fox would do with it and you heard dont call him a maggot hes too dangerous ivarr cleared his throat so the ignorant peasant we captured was wrong about no said the one called bern i planted that thought in your head ragnarson you captured no watchman you never put ashore here you went straight to brynnfell in arberth and failed so you wanted to go backthere nowhere elsefor your own bloodhunger ingavins blind eye sixty men are dead because you lied to us and he killed an earl we took someone shouted from the ship nearest to them an earl voices echoed that greed thought ivarr they were driven by greed and vanity both could be used always the hotness was making it harder to think clearly though to take back control of this if the one named bern would only shut his mouth if hed been on one of the other ships such a small change in the world ivarr looked at the man more closely a ship on either side of theirs now men lashing them together practised ease it had grown darker his eyes worked better in this twilight with lanterns ingavins blind eye something slid into place with that phrase who is your father he said sharply anger cracking through with awareness i think i know hes a jormsviking snapped brand his voice crashing in heavy as a smiths hammer we are born when we pass through the walls into brotherhood our histories do not matter we shed them even maggots like you know that of us yes yes but i think i know the way he speaks i think his father was with brand struck him a second time harder than before on the mouth ivarr went down on his back spat blood then a tooth someone laughed the hotness went red he reached towards the dagger in his boot then stopped controlling himself to control men he could be killed here going for a weapon sprawled on his back he looked up at the big man over him spat red again to the side spread his hands to show they were empty saw a sword then another one both bright as if flaming torchlight upon them he died thereastonished it could be saidas leofsons heavy blade spitted him biting deep into the deck beneath his body bern reminded himself to breathe his arm holding a sword was at his side brand had knocked it away with his own before killing ivarr with a thrust that had the full force of his body behind it leofson levered his weapon free with difficulty there was a silence amid the lanterns under the first stars brand turned to bern a curious expression on his scarred countenance youre too young he said unexpectedly whatever else he was this was the last of the volgans too heavy a weight to carry all your life better it was me bern found it difficult to speak he managed a nod though he wasnt sure he really understood what the older man was saying there was a stillness a sense of weight all about them though this was not an ordinary death put him overboard at the stern brand said attor do the last song and properly we dont need any god angry tonight men moved to do his bidding you put erlings into the sea if they died on the water last of the volgans bern thought the phrase in his head kept repeating itself he he killed sixty men today as if hed done it himself true enough said brand almost indifferently he was moving on already bern realized leader of a raid other things to consider decisions to be made he heard a splash attors voice rose they would be able to hear it on the other boats bern found that his hands were shaking he looked at his sword which he was still holding and sheathed it he went to the side of the ship by his own oar next to the roped ship beside them and stood there listening as attar sang deepvoiced in the dark hard the journey heavy the waves brief our lingering on land or sea ingavin ever mind his erlingfolk thunir remember who honour you let no angry spirit still be here no soul be lost without a home salt the seafoam by ships prow white the waves before us and behind bern looked down at the water and then away to the emerging stars trying to keep his mind empty to just listen but then it seemed he was thinkingfound himself unable not to thinkof his father again in a stream with him under these same stars last night he had felt such anger moments ago looking down at ivarr ragnarson watchingknowingwhat the man was doing the need to kill had crashed over him like nothing in his life before hed had his sword out and driving before hed realized what he was doing was this the way it had happened for thorkelltwice ten years apart in two taverns was this his fathers fury awakening inside him and bern was sober as death right now lightheaded with fatigue but not so much as a beaker of ale since the tavern in esferth the evening before yet even with that rage had taken him if brand had not been quicker bern would have killed the man on the deck and he knew it his father had done that twice exiled for it the second time ruining their lives was what bern had always thought and his heart had been cold as a winter sea bitter as winter foraging ruining his fathers own life was more true he thought now thorkell had turned himself in a moment from a settled landowner in a place where he had real stature into an exile no longer young without hearth or family how had he felt that day leaving the isle and the next day and in the nights that had followed sleeping among strangers or alone did he lie down and rise up with heimthra the hearts hard longing for home bern had never even put his mind to this are you drunk he had said to thorkell in the river and been struck a blow for that open hand he remembered a fathers admonition the wind had died but now a breeze came again from the east the lashed ships swayed with it lanterns bobbing jormsvik mariners best in all the world he was one of them a new home for him the sky was dark now the song came to an end his hands werent trembling any more thorkell was somewhere north in the night having crossed the sea again long past when hed have thought himself done with raiding it was a time for home and hearth wood chopped and piled up for winter winds and snow land of his own fences and tilled fields tavern fires in town companionship at night gone with one moments alesoaked fury and his youth long gone as well not a time of life to be starting again what was a sona grown sonto think about all of this no soul be lost without a home bern reached into his tunic and touched the hammer on its silver chain he shook his head slowly thorkell had actually saved all of the men here sending bern south at speed with that added warning about ivarr you needed to be strong enough to say these things to yourself acknowledge them even through bitterness and there was more another thing sliding into awareness now the way the fainter stars slipped into sight against the darkened sky dont let ivarr ragnarson know youre my son he hadnt understood that hed asked his father hadnt answered not an answering sort of man but ragnarsons pale eyes had seen something here on the deck in berns face by torchlight or in something hed said some kind of resemblance he had thought throughfoxs mindto a truth about bern and about thorkell hed been about to say it an accusation when swords came out and he died i think his father was with brand weve rowing to do best set a course it was isolf at the helm of the ship tied to their starboard side i say south first head for ferrieres coast or karch coast whoever holds it this year that was carsten from the other side ferrieres said brand absently he walked past bern towards the helm attor followed him aeldredll have ships in the water by now certain as ingavin carries a hammer isolf again someone laughed derisively they dont know what theyre doing anglcyn at sea other voices joining in hell use erlings brand said the amusement subsided believe it ingemar svidrirsons his ally here in erlond remember pays him tribute fuck him then someone shouted a sentiment that found much endorsement even more crude bern stayed where he was listening he was too new had no idea what their best course was theyd lost almost a third of their company could manage five ships but if they ended up in a fight at sea well do that another time called carsten friddson right now lets just get home with all ships and bodies left souths best say i to the other coast then we beat back east along it aeldred wont venture so far from his own shore just on a chance of finding us at sea it did make sense bern thought the new anglcyn ships at drengest might be ready but they wouldnt have had any experience with them yet and those shipsif they were even on the waterwere all that lay between them and home surely they could slip past them he had a sudden unexpectedly vivid image of jormsvik the walls gate barracks the stony wavebattered strand the crooked town beside the fortress where hed almost died the night before he won his way inside he thought of thira his whore now hed killed gurd whod laid claim to her before that was how it worked in jormsvik you bought your warmth in winter one way or another whores not wives was the order of things but there was warmth to be found a fireside companionship he wasnt alone wasnt a servant might have a chance if he was good enough at killing and staying alive to shape a name for himself in the world thorkell had done that and it was on that thought of his father that bern heard brand leofson say with what seemed an unnaturally precise carrying clarity were not going home yet a silence again then what in thünirs name does that mean garr hoddson shouting from the fourth ship brand looked towards him across the other deck they were all shapes in darkness now voices unless standing beside one of the lanterns bern had taken a step away from the rail means the snake said one thing true listen this raids the worst weve had in years any of us its a bad time for that with vidurson making plans up north vidurson what of it garr shouted brand weve lost a full boat of i know what weve lost i want to find now we need to listen to me were going to go west to get the volgans sword back or to kill the man who took it or both were going to that farm whatever its called brynnfell bern heard himself saying his voice sounded hollow thats it brand leofson said nodding his head ap hywlls farm we run enough of us ashore leave some to the ships find the place burn it down there should be hostages how do we get home after carsten asking bern could hear a new note in his voice he was interested engaged this had been a disastrous raid nothing to show for it but their own deaths no man here wanted to spend a winter hearing about that decide that when were done back this way or we go the north route too late in the year garr hoddson said he had stepped across to carstens ship bern saw then back this way aeldredll be ashore by then or we overwinter west if need be weve done that before too but well do something before we show our faces home and if we get that blade back we have something to show kjarten vidurson too if that northerner gets ideas we dont like anyone here actually decided we need a king by the way a shout of anger jormsvik had its views on this kings put limits on you set taxes liked to tear down walls that werent their own carsten brand lifted his voice over the shouting im for it garr do it weve shipmates to avenge but not in the west bern thought not there it didnt matter he felt with genuine surprise a quickening of his own heartbeat his father hadnt wanted them to go west but ivarr was dead they werent listening to his tune they didnt have to listen to thorkells either to get the volgans lost sword back from the cyngael on his first raid that would be remembered it would always be remembered bern touched ingavins hammer his fathers hammer at his throat there was another part of the verse hed spoken to his father in the stream they all knew it throughout the erling lands cattle die kinsmen die every man born will die fierce hearth fires end in ash fame once won endures ever the ships were being unlashed bern moved to help the risen wind was from the east a message in that ingavins wind carrying them in the night dragonprows on a summer sea twelve jadwina was never quite clear looking back whether they received the tidings of the earls death she always got his name wrong but it was difficult to remember things from so long ago and the slaughtered erling raiders before or after the evening her life changedor even that same night though she didnt think so it felt as though it had come afterwards it had been a bad time for her but she was fairly certain shed have remembered if it had been that same night the troubles had begun a fourteennight earlier when eadyn lost his hand an accident an entirely stupid accident clearing trees with his father bending a branch for oscas axe a clean severing at the wrist his life marred all hope of good fortune spurting from him with his blood the hand on the grass fingers still flexed a thing of its own now discarded a young man broadshouldered fairhaired picked to marry her and her own inward choice for that by jads pure grace turned cripple in a moments inattention at the edge of wood and scrubland he lived their cleric summoned knew more than most about leechcraft eadyn lay in fever for days his wrist wrapped in a poultice his mother changed at sunrise and sunset osca wasnt at the bedside or even at home he spent those days drinking swearing weeping cursing the god abusing those who tried to comfort him what comfort was there under the heavens he had only the one living son and a farm that needed eadyns strength as his own began to fail it was a calamity lives turned lives ended with such moments the cleric wisely kept his distance until osca had drunk himself into a vomiting stupor and awoke a day and night later ashen and heartscalded the god had made the world this way in his unknowable wisdom the cleric said to the villagers in their small chapel but it was hard he conceded it could be intolerably hard jadwina thought so too her own father had shaken his head grimly when he heard the tale he had politely waited to see if eadyn would conveniently die before calling off the proposed match what else could he do a cripple was no marriage he could never swing an axe properly handle a plough mend a fence alone kill a wolf or wild dog couldnt even practise with a bow as they were ordered by the king to do now it was a sorrow for eadyn and his family a lesson for everyone else as the cleric said but you didnt have to make it your sorrow too there were healthy lads in the village or near enough you needed to marry daughters usefully it was a matter of survival the world here in the north or anywhere else probably wasnt going to make life easy for you at some point during that timeit blurred for jadwina looking backbevin the smith had appeared at their door and asked to speak with her father gryn had gone walking with him and returned to say that hed accepted an offer for her the younger son of the village smith wasnt the match eadyn son of osca had beenland was land after allbut he was better than a onehanded cripple jadwina received the tidings andas best she rememberedshe dropped a pitcher on the floor it might have been on purpose she couldnt recall her father beat her about the back and shoulders with her mother calling approval it had been a newbought pitcher raud the smiths son now plighted to her never even spoke with jadwina not then at any rate some days later however towards twilight as she was bringing the cow back from the northernmost field raud stepped out from a copse by the path he stood before her he had come from the forge there was soot in his clothing and on his face be wed come harvest he said grinning he had poxed cheeks and long skinny shanks not by my will jadwina replied tossing her head he laughed wha matters that youll spread legs by will or wiout eadyn is two men to your one she said and you knows it he laughed again hes one hand to my two cant even do this now he grabbed at her before she could twist away he had a hand twisted in her hair spilling her kerchief and another over her mouth too tightly for her to bite or scream he smelled of ash and smoke he pulled the hand away quickly and hit her on the side of the head hard enough for the world to rock and sway then he hit her again the sun was going down end of summer she remembered that no one on the path home a long walk from where they were she couldnt even see the nearest houses of the village take whats mine now raud said get a baby in you theyll just make me wed you won they what matters that she was on the ground by the path beneath him he straddled her a boot on either side started untying the rope around his trousers fumbling in his haste she drew breath to shout he kicked her in the ribs jadwina gasped began to weep it hurt to breathe he dragged his leggings down around his muddy boots lowered himself to his knees then forward onto her began pushing clumsily at her lower clothes she hit him scratching at his face he swore then laughed his hand groped hard at her down there then his whole body lurched crazily to one side his head most of all jadwina had a confused frightening sense of wetness she was in pain dizzy and terrified it took her a moment to understand what had happened rauds blood was all over her hed been hit in the neck from above behind by an axe she looked up an axe swung onehanded rauds body his sex exposed still erect his trousers around his ankles lay sprawled on one side next to her in the shallow ditch where hed thrown her down instinctively she shifted away from him he was jadwina saw already dead she was afraid she was going to be sick she put a hand to her side where the worst pain was then brought it to her face it came away wet with rauds blood eadyn his face ghostpale stood above her she struggled to sit up her side felt as if a blade were in it as if something were broken and sliding within he stepped back a little her cow was behind him in the grass on the other side of the path cropping no sound but that and the birds flying to branches at end of day fields and trees dark green grass the sun almost down was out here trying eadyn said finally gesturing with the axe see if i can chop you know saw you she seemed able to nod her head cant do it rightly he said lifting the axe a little again letting it fall no good jadwina drew a careful breath a hand to her side again she was covered in blood just started though youll get better at it he shook his head useless man she tried not to look at the bandaged stump of his right hand his good hand it had been you you were man enough to save me she said he shrugged from behind him what matters that she said her capacity to speak to think was coming back and she had a thought it frightened her so she spoke quickly before fear could take hold lie with me now she said give me a child no one else will want me then youll have to what she saw in him that moment in the last fading of the summer daylight and remembered ever after was fear and defeat it could be read the way some clerics read words in books he shook his head again na thatll not do im cripple girl theyll not wed you to me and how could i fend for a wife and little ones now well fend the both of us together she said he was silent the axedark with rauds bloodheld in his left hand jad rot it forever he said finally im done he looked at the dead man his brothersll kill me now theyll not that ill tell the cleric and reeve what happened here and thatll matter to them he laughed bitterly no im away this night girl you clean yourself say nothing maybe take a bit of time before they find this give me a chance to be gone her heart was aching by then more than her side a dull hard pain but there waseven in that momenta part of her that had begun despising him it was like a death actually feeling that where where will you go as if i have the least idea he said jad be with you girl he said that over his shoulder had already turned away he left her there walked north back up the grassy path the way that she had come and then on beyond the pasture jadwina watched until she couldnt see him any more in the twilight she got herself up reclaimed her hazel switch and began leading the cow back home moving slowly a hand to her side leaving a dead man in the grass she decided before shed reached the first houses that she wasnt going to listen to eadyn he had left her lying there without a backwards glance they had been pledged to be married she went home exactly as she was rauds blood on her face and hair and hands all over her clothing she saw horrorand curiosityin peoples faces as she took the cow through the village she kept her head high said nothing they followed her of course they followed her at her door she told her father and mother and then the cleric and reeve when they were brought what had happened and where shed thought shed be beaten again but she wasnt too many people about men and boys and dogs went running to look it was well after nightfall that they brought back rauds body it was reported how he had been when theyd found him trousers down exposed two of the older women were instructed by the reeve to examine jadwina behind a door they made her lift her skirts and both of them poked at her and came out cackling to report that she was intact her father owned land the smith was only a smith there was no one to gainsay her tale right there under torches in front of their door the reeve declared the matter closed to the kings justice named the killing a just one two of rauds brothers went north in the morning after eadyn they came back without having found any sign of him raud was buried in the ground behind the chapel and it had been some time during those warm endofsummer days that they had learned of the erling raid and the death of the earl the kings good friend jadwina hadnt been inclined to care or listen very much which is why she was never certain about the course and timing of events she remembered agitation and excitement the cleric talking and talking the reeve riding out and then back and on one of the days there had been a black billowing of smoke west of them it turned out to be they learned a burning of slain erlings the king himself it seemed had been right there just beyond the trees and the ridges a battle almost within sight of where they lived a victory for those whose lives had not been utterly undone as jadwinas had been it counted as entirely memorable later that same year the smiths wife died an autumn fever two others of the village went to the god as well within a fourteennight of burying his wife gryn came to jadwinas father again this time for himself this was the father of the man who had been pledged to her and had assaulted her and been slain for it it didnt seem to matter to anyone certainly not her father there was a kind of cloud a stain over jadwina by then she was sent to him that same week to the smithy and the house behind it the cleric spoke new blessings over them in chapel they had a cleric who liked to keep abreast of new things too much haste some said of the marriage others jested that with jadwinas history her father didnt want to see a third man maimed or killed before getting her off his hands no one ever saw eadyn again or heard tell of him gryn the smith as it turned out was a mildhumoured man she hadnt expected that in someone so redfaced and with the sons he had how could she have expected kindness they had two children who survived jadwinas memories of the year she was wed softened and blurred overlaid with others as the seasons passed in time she buried her husband took no other mate her sons shared the smithy after with their older halfbrothers and she lived with one of them and his wife tolerably well as well as such things can ever be two women in a small house she was buried herself when the god called her home laid in the growing chapel graveyard next to gryn not far from raud under a sun disk and her name three things alun was thinking remembering the wellworn triad will gladden the heart of a man riding to a woman under two moons riding to battle companions at his side riding home after long away he was doing the third possibly the second hadnt thought about the first since his brother died his heart was not glad he saw a sudden branch and ducked the overgrown path theyd chosen could barely be called such these woods had no formal name in either tongue cyngael or anglcyn men did not enter here save for the edgings and only by daylight he heard his unwanted companion following without turning alun said there will be wolves in here or course there will be wolves thorkell einarson said mildly bears still this time of year hunting cats boars with autumn coming boars for certain snakes yes two kinds i believe the green ones are harmless they were a fair distance into the forest already the light entirely gone even if it might still be twilight outside cafall was a shadow ahead of aluns horse the green ones thorkell repeated then he laughedgenuine laughter despite where they were how do we tell in the dark if they bite us and we dont die alun replied i didnt ask you to come i told you you told me to go back i know i cant this time alun stopped his horse the erling horse thorkell had found for him he still hadnt asked about that they had reached a very small clearing a little space to face each other the leaves overhead let a hint of the last evening light come down it was time for the invocation he wondered if it had been done before in these woods if jads word had ever reached so far it seemed to him he felt a humming just below hearing but he was aware that that was almost certainly apprehension and no more there were so many tales why he asked why cant you the other man had also reined his horse there was just enough light to see his face he shrugged i am neither your servant nor the clerics my life was saved by lady enid at brynnfell and she claimed me as hers if you are correct and i believe you are ivarr ragnarson is leading the jormsvik ships there i value my life as much as any man but i gave her my oath i will try to get back before they do for an oath for that oath there was more alun was sure of it you understand this is mad that we have five days maybe six to survive in these woods i understand the folly of it better than you do i suspect im an old man lad trust me im not happy being here then why i answered you will you leave it the first hint of a temper strain aluns turn to shrug im not about to fight you or try to hide well forget rank though i think you know more than i do about surviving here it was easier to say that to this man than to most others he thought perhaps a little more i did bring food alun blinked and realized with the words that his hunger was extreme he tried to work out the timing theyd had bread and ale after killing the first erling party by the stream nothing since then and the fyrd had been in the saddle since the middle of the night before come get down said thorkell einarson as if tracking that thought as good a place as any i need to stretch im old alun dismounted hed been a horseman all his life but his legs were aching the other man was groping in a saddle pack can you see my hand yes wedge of cheese cold meat coming ive ale in a flask jads blood and grace when did you when we got to the water and saw the ships were gone alun considered this a moment chewing you knew id do this the other man hesitated i knew that i would this too needed thought you were going to come in here alone not happily i promise you alun tore at the chunk of meat the other man passed him drank thirstily from the offered flask may i ask a question the erling took the ale back told you not a servant in here we need to survive tell the snakes the ones that arent green whats the question is this the same wood as north by esferth and past it what you think id be here if there was a break in the trees am i a fool in here of course you are a fool but help me with the question nonetheless a moment both men silent then alun heard his own laughter in that black ancient wood where the tales hed known all his life said there were spirits that sought blood and were endlessly angry something small skittered startled by the noise the dog had gone ahead now came back to them alun gave him some of the meat he took the ale flask back it occurred to thorkell einarson squatting on his haunches beside the young cyngael that he hadnt heard the other man laugh before not once in all their time together since the night of a spring raid alun said you arent very good at a servants role are you it is the same forest theres a small valley on this side i think theres a sanctuary there thorkell nodded thats how i remember it yes and then quietly he added so whatever spirit you were with last night might be here as well alun imagined he felt a wind in his face though there was none blowing he was briefly glad of the darkness he cleared his throat i have no idea he said how did you i watched you come out of the trees last night im an erling my grandmother could see spirits on the roofs of half the homes in our village summoned them to blight the fields and wells of those she hated there were enough of those ingavin knows lad we can swear an oath to honour the sun god and wear his disk but what happens after darkfall when the sun is down and jad is under the world battling i dont know alun said he still seemed to feel that wind sense the woods vibration so nearly a sound five days journey maybe more they were going to die here he thought three things a brave man remembers at his end none of us knows thorkell einarson said but we still have to live through the nights it is unwise to be so sure were alone here whatever the clerics teach you believe that spirit is kindly disposed alun took a breath it was difficult to believe they were speaking of this he thought of the faerie shimmering a light where there was none i believe so the other mans turn to hesitate you realize that where there is one such power there may be others i told you you didnt have to come yes you did pass the flask my throats dry a sorrow to die with ale to hand and undrunk alun reached the flask across his calves were sore the long ride crouching now he sat on the grass wrapped his arms about his knees we cant ride all night no how did you propose to guide yourself alone that one i can answer think on it the other man did ah the dog he came from brynnfell can find his way home how were you going to do it alone thorkell shook his head no idea and you thought i was being a fool you are so am i let us drink to ourselves thorkell lifted the flask again cleared his throat consider sending him ahead the dog ap hywll would know i did think about it it seems to make sense to have him with us and to let him run on alone if we find a notgreen snake or one of the things that are stronger than your spirit and dont like us should we rest here alun asked fatigue was washing over him there was an answer given to that question though not from the man beside him they heard a sound movement in the trees larger than a boar alun thought rising unsheathing his blade thorkell was also on his feet holding his hammer they stood a moment listening then they heard a different kind of sound holy jad said alun a moment later with considerable feeling i think not actually said thorkell einarson he sounded amused not the god i believe this would be be quiet said alun the two of them listened in bemused silence to a voice behind them and a little south moving through the trees where no moonlight could fall someonehowever improbablywas singing in these woods the girl for me at the end of the day is the one whod rather kiss than pray and the girl for me in the morning light is the one who takes and gives delight and the girl for me in the blaze of noon is the one stuff the wailing were over here thorkell called and who knows what elses coming now the noise you make both men put back their weapons crackling sounds came nearer branches and leaves twigs on the forest floor an oath as someone collided with something noise wailing said athelbert son of aeldred heir to the anglcyn throne he edged his horse into their small clearing straining his eyes alun saw that he was rubbing at his forehead i hit a branch really hard i also believe i have been insulted i was singing that what it was alun said athelbert had a sword at his hip a bow across his back he dismounted stood facing the two of them holding the reins of his horse sorry he said ruefully to be frank my sisters and my brother take that same view of my voice ive decided to leave home out of shame this alun said was a bad idea im a bad singer athelbert replied lightly my lord prince this is my lord prince i know what this is both of them stopped a moment later athelbert was the one who went on i know what you are doing two men are unlikely to get through this wood alive and three are likely it was thorkell he still had that amused tone alun realized i didnt actually say that athelbert replied you do realize where we are likelihood well all be killed this is not your concern alun said he forced himself to be gracious generous as the thought might be my lord i daresay your royal father my royal father will have sent outriders after me as soon as they realized i was gone they are almost certainly in the trees already and terrified witless my father thinks i am irresponsible there are reasons why he might hold such a view wed best move on or theyll find us and say they have to bring me back and ill say i wont go and theyll have to draw weapons against their prince on the orders of their king which isnt a proper thing to force any man to do because im not going back a silence followed this why thorkell asked finally the amused tone gone prince alun is right this is no anglcyn quarrel erlings raiding west of the wall alun could see clearly enough to observe athelbert shaking his head that manragnarson killed my fathers lifelong friend one of our leaders a man i knew from childhood they led a raid into our lands during a summer fair word of that will spread if they get away and aluns turn to interrupt they didnt get away you killed fifty or sixty of them a ships worth drove the rest from your shores running from you word of that will spread to the glory of king aeldred and his people why are you here prince athelbert it was almost impenetrably black now even in the clearing the trees in summer leaf blocking the stars cafall had stood up too the dark grey dog virtually invisible a presence at aluns knee after a long time athelbert spoke i heard what you said before by the river what you believe they intend to do the farmhouse women there ap hywll the sword and so it is still not your listen to me cyngael is your father the haven and home of all virtues in the world does he rise from a fevered sickbed to make a slaughter of his enemies does he translate medical texts from jadcursed trakesian by the time he was my age said athelbert of the anglcyn speaking with great clarity my father had survived a winter hiding in a swamp had broken out rallied our scattered people and retaken his own slain fathers realm to the undying glory of king aeldred and our land he stopped breathing hard as if hed been exerting himself they heard wings overhead flapping from one tree to another you are unhappy with him for being a good man thorkell said that is not what i am saying no perhaps not help me then my lord you want some of that same glory said einarson that is it well that is fairly sought what young man with a beating heart does not this one said alun sharply you both listen to me i have no interest in any of that i need to get to brynnfell before the erlings that is all the coastal path goes to arberth and it takes almost four days at speed then four or five more to get north to brynns farm i did that journey this spring with my brother the erlings know exactly where they are going because ragnarsons with them no warning we send along the coast will beat them to brynnfell im here because i have no choice ill say it again i didnt even want you to come he said turning to thorkell and ill say it again though i shouldnt have to i am the servant of lady enid wife to brynn ap hywll the erling replied calmly if ivarr gets to that farm shell die in the muck of her own yard hacked apart and so will any others there including her daughters i have done such raids i know what happens she saved my life i swore an oath ingavin and jad both know i have not kept every promise i made but this time i will try he was silent after a moment alun nodded thats you but this prince is just chasing his father hes this prince said thorkell is entitled to make his own choices in life reckless or otherwise as much as we are a third blade is welcome as a woman in a cold bed but if he is right and outriders are following him we need to move he should go back alun repeated stubbornly this is not his talk to me if you have anything to say youve said that three times athelbert snapped make a triad of it why dont you set it to music i heard you each time i am not turning back will you really refuse aid even if it might save lives is it so certain you arent thinking of glory alun blinked at that i swear by jads name it is certain dont you see i do not believe it is possible to do this i expect to die here we have no idea where water is or food what path we might find or not find or what will find us there are tales of this place going back four hundred years my lord athelbert i have a reason to risk death you do not i know those stories the same tales are told on this side if you go back far enough we used to sacrifice animals in the valley north of here to whatever was in the wood if you go back far enough it wasnt animals alun said athelbert nodded his head unruffled i know that too it is not for you to judge my reasons say that you are here because of your brother and i because of my father leave it and lets go alun still hesitated then he shrugged hed done what he could with a hint of wryness in his tone one that a dead brother would have recognized he said if that is so this one here breaks the pattern he nodded towards thorkell not really said the erling they heard his amusement im of a piece with you in truth tell you about it later lets move before were found and it gets difficult truly some of the outriders sing worse than i do athelbert said jad defend us if so said alun he reached a hand down into the fur of the dogs neck cafall will you lead us home my heart and with those words athelbert realized that they werent as completely without resources as hed thought riding into the spirit wood after the two of them panic and determination warring within him they had the dog amazingly it might matter the three of them remounted and carefully picked their way out of the small glade bent low over the horses necks to stay under branches if they could they heard sounds as they went the noises of a wood at night owls calling wingflap of another bird overhead wood snapping to left and right sometimes loudly a scrabbling along branches scurry wind what else each of them heard or thought he heard he kept to himself men were avoiding the king ceinion saw he could understand that aeldred philosopher seeker after the learning of the old schools shaper of calm devices and stratagems a man controlled enough to have feasted the erling whod bloodeagled his father was in a rage like a forest fire as hed stalked away across the stones of the beach where the boats had been his fury had been so intense it had been as if there were a wave of heat coming off his body if you were a physician you feared for a man in such condition if you were his subject you feared for yourself the king was still down the strand in the gathering dark standing close to the crashing surf in the wind as if together wind and waves might cool him ceinion thought he knew that wasnt going to happen they had heard from the outriders sent out prince athelbert had gone into the woods fear plainly visible in those reporting this four exhausted men astride their horses waiting for the command they would not dare refuse and could hardly bear to imagine it never came instead aeldred had stood fighting for control and then had turned on his heel and gone off to where he was now his back to all of them facing the darkening sea under the first stars in the vault of the sky the blue moon was rising ceinion went after him no one else would do it and the cleric was aware of terrors clinging to what remained of this day building within himself he felt trammelled as in a fishermans net of sorrows deliberately he let his approach be heard scuffling at stones aeldred did not turn stayed as he had been gazing out at the water far off beyond sight but not sailing were the shores of ferrieres carloman had taken the coast back from the karchites in the spring after two years of campaigning a disputed precarious shoreline that one it always had been everything was precarious he thought he was remembering fires in the farmyard at brynnfell did you know said aeldred not turning around that in rhodias in the days of its glory there were baths where three hundred men could be bathing in cool water and as many in the heated pool and as many again lying at their ease with wine and food ceinion blinked the kings voice was conversational informative they might have been themselves reclining at their ease somewhere he said carefully my lord i did hear of such i have never been there of course did you see this yourself when you went with your royal father the ruins of them the antae sacked rhodias four hundred years ago the baths didnt survive but you could see what they had been able to make there are ruins here too of course from when the rhodians came this far perhaps i will show you some day ceinion thought he could discern the shape of what this was about men responded so differently to grief life was otherwise then he agreed being cautious it was difficult he was seeing fires in his mind the breeze was strong here but it was pleasant not cold it was from the east i was eight years old when my father took me on pilgrimage aeldred went on the same even casual tone he still hadnt turned around it occurred to ceinion to wonder how the king had known who it was whod come walking over to him his particular footfall or a simpler awareness that no one else would approach just then i was excited and impatient of course aeldred went on but what you just said that life was otherwise for them that was clear to me even when i was young on the way in one of the cities in the north of batiara where the antae had their own court we saw a chapel complex four or five buildings in one of them there was a mosaic of the court of sarantium the strategosemperor leontes valerius iii they called him the golden aeldred nodded there was a king he said a wave crashed and withdrew grating along stones you could see it on that wall his court around him the clothing they wore the jewellery the room they were in the room they had in their lives to make things ive never forgotten it he was a great leader by all accounts ceinion agreed he was letting this unfold at the back of his mind his pulse rapid with it was the awareness of ships and the east wind ive read one or two chronicles yes pertennius colodias on the other wall i remember another mosaic less good i think an earlier emperor the one before him he rebuilt the sanctuary i think he was there too the opposite wall i remember i wasnt as taken it looked different different artisans very likely the cleric said kings depend on that do you think the quality of their artisans not while they live my lord after perhaps for how they are remembered and what will men remember about aeldred broke off resumed again a different tone we shouldnt be forgetting his name he murmured he built jads sanctuary in sarantium ceinion how are we forgetting forgetting is part of our lives my lord sometimes it is a blessing or we could never move beyond loss this is different yes my lord what i was saying about the baths we have no space no time to make such things he had been saying this ceinion remembered at the high table after the banquet last night only last night he said baths and mosaics are not allowed to all of us my lord i know that of course i know is it unworthy to feel their absence this was not the conversation hed been expecting to have ceinion thought about it i think it is necessary to feel that or we will not desire a world that lets us have them aeldred was silent then do you know i always intended to take athelbert his brother too to rhodias the same journey to see it again myself kiss the ring of the patriarch offer my prayers in the great sanctuary i wanted my sons to see it and remember as i do you were fighting wars my lord my father took me my lord i am of an age with you and have lived through the same times i do not believe you have anything for which to reproach yourself aeldred turned then ceinion saw his face in the twilight alas but you are wrong my lord cleric i have so much in the way of reproach for myself my wife wishes to leave me and my son has gone they had arrived every man had his own path to such places ceinion said the queen is seeking to go home to the god my lord not to leave you aeldreds mouth crooked a little unworthy good cleric clever without being wise cyngael wordplay id call it ceinion flushed which didnt happen often he bowed his head we cannot always be wise my lord i am the first to say that i am not aeldreds back was to the sea now he said i could have let athelbert lead the fyrd last night he could have done it i didnt need to be here did he ask for it that is not his way but he could have dealt with this i had just come back from my fever i had no need to ride i should have left it to him his hands were fists ceinion saw i was so angry burgred my lord do you not understand my son is dead because i did not let it is not for us to say what will be my lord we do not have that wisdom this much i do know in that wood ceinion ceinion you know where he went no man has ever perhaps no man has tried perhaps it was time to lay to rest old fears in jads name perhaps a great good will come of this perhaps he trailed off there was no great good that he could see coming his words were false in his own ears there was that image of burning in him here by the cool sea as the moon rose aeldred was looking closely at him now he said i have been greatly unjust you are my friend and guest these are my own concerns and you have a grief here there is a reason prince owyns son went into the spirit wood my sorrow cleric we were too slow riding we needed to be here before the ships cast off ceinion was silent then he said as he ought to have said at the beginning with the dark coming on pray with me my lord it is time for the rites there is no piety in my heart said aeldred i am not in a state to address the god we are never in a state to do so it is the way of our lives in his world one of the things for which we ask mercy is that inadequacy he was on familiar ground now but it didnt feel that way and our anger that too my lord bitterness that too the king turned back to the sea he was still as a monolith as a standing stone planted on the strand by those who lived here long ago and believed in darker gods and powers than jad or the rhodian pantheon in sea in sky in the black woods behind them ceinion said again we must not presume to know what will come my heart is dark he should not have done what he did athelbert he is not without duties they were back to the son not a child any more my lord the son of a great father might need to shape his own way in the world if he is to follow you and be more than only aeldreds child the king turned again he said dying allows no way in the world they cannot go through that wood the cleric let his own voice gain force a lifetime of experience so many conversations with the bereaved and the afraid my lord i can tell you that alun ab owyn is as capable a man as i know the erling is far more than a servant and i watched prince athelbert this past night and day and marvelled at him now i will honour his courage ah and you will say this to his mother when we come back to esferth how comforting she will find it ceinion winced behind them men were gathering wood lighting night fires on the beach they would stay until morning the fyrd would be exhausted ravenous but they would be feeling pride deep satisfaction at what they had done the erlings were driven off fleeing them and threescore of the raiders were dead on anglcyn soil the tale would run would cross these dark waters to ferrieres karch east to vinmark itself and beyond for aeldred and the anglcyn this could be called a triumphant day worthy of harp song and celebration after the mourning for an earl for the cyngael it might be otherwise pray with me he said again there must have been something in his voice an edge of need aeldred stared at him in the last of the light the wind blew it could carry the erlings tonight ceinion could see them in the eye of his mind dragonprows knifing black water rising and falling vengeful men aboard he had lived through such raids so many times so many years he could see enid fire at the edges of his vision pushing inward as brynnfell burned and she died always since his wife had been laid in the ground behind his own sanctuary in llywerth there had been that one thing for which he never prayed the lives of those he loved he could see her thoughall of them at brynnfelland the ships in the water like blades approaching aeldreds gaze was unsettling as if his thoughts were open to the king he wasnt ready for that his role was to offer comfort here aeldred said i cannot send the drengest ships to catch them friend they will be too far behind by the time word reaches the burh and if we are wrong and the erlings do not go west i know it ceinion said of course he knew we arent even allies lord your soldiers on the rheden wall are there against cyngael raids to keep you out yes but that isnt it i would do this after last night but my ships are too new our seamen learning each other and the boats they might be able to block the lanes if the erlings turn home tonight but but they cannot catch them going west i know it no words for a time ships in his mind out there somewhere the beat and withdraw of surf sound of it sound of men behind them up the strand noises of a camp wind in the gathering night three things the wise man ever fears a womans fury a fools tongue dragonprows brynn ap hywll killed the volgan ceinion he and his band are very great fighters brynn is old ceinion said so are most of his band that battle was twentyfive years ago they will have no warning they may not even be there now your men say there were five ships beached here you know how many men that means even without those you killed what shall i say somehow it had been turned around he had walked over to give comfort perhaps he had perhaps for some men this was the only access they had to being eased nothing he said then well pray aeldred hesitated a thinking pause not an uncertain one ceinion we will do what we can a ship to owyn in cadyr theyll sail to him under a truce flag with a letter from me and one from you tell him what his son is doing he might cut off an erling party on its way back to their ships if they do go to your shores and ill send word north to the rheden wall they can get a message across if someone is there to receive it i have no idea ceinion said he didnt what happened in those lands around the wall was murky and fogshrouded beyond the power and grasp of princes the valleys and the black hills kept their secrets he was thinking about something else on their way back to the ships if they were doing that the erlings it would be over at brynnfell and here he was knowing it seeing it unable to do more than unable to do anything he knew why alun had gone into the forest standing still was very nearly intolerable it could shatter the heart he would pray for athelbert and for owyns son in the wood but not for those he most dearly loved hed done that once prayed for her with all the gathered force of his being holding her in his arms and she had died he was aware of aeldreds gaze told himself to be worthy of his office the king had lost a lifelong friend and his son was gone they may get through in the forest he said again aeldred shook his head but calmly now by the mercy and grace of jad i have another son i was a younger son as well and my brothers died ceinion looked at the other man then beyond him at the sea on that windblown strand he made the sun disk gesture that began the rites the king knelt before him down along the beach where the fires were the men of the fyrd saw this and one by one sank to their knees to share the evening invocation spoken in that hour when jad of the sun began his frozen journey under the world to battle dark powers and malign spirits keeping as many of them as possible away from his mortal children until the light could come to them again at dawn keeping most of them away not all it was not the way of things in the world that men and women could ever be entirely shielded from what might seek and find them in the dark thirteen given what followed it might have been a mistake to stop for what remained of the night but at the time there hadnt seemed to be much choice all three men were hardened and fit and two of them were young but theyd been awake for two days and nights and in the saddle in this forest thorkell had judged it more dangerous to keep moving in exhaustion tired horses stumbling than to stop they could be attacked as easily while moving in any case he made it easier for the others asking a respite for himself though he undermined that somewhat by offering to take the first watch by the pool they found they filled their flasks water was important food would become a problem when his small supply ran out they hadnt decided if they would hunt here probably theyd have to though thorkell knew what his grandmother would have said about killing in a spirit wood all three of them drank deeply the horses did the same the water was cool and sweet there was no thought of making a fire athelbert hadnt eaten at all thorkell gave him bread in the darkness some of the cold meat they tethered the horses then both princes anglcyn and cyngael fell asleep almost immediately thorkell approved you needed to be able to do that it was a skill a task your turn on watch would come soon enough he stretched out his legs leaned back against a tree his hammer across his lap he was weary but not sleepy it was very black sight was next to useless he would have to listen mostly the dog came over sank down beside him head on paws he could see the faint gleam of its eyes he didnt actually like this dog but he had a sense that there would be no hope of achieving this journey without alun ab owyns hound he made his muscles relax shifted his neck from side to side to ease the pain there so many years so many times hed done this night watch in a dangerous place hed thought he was through with it no need to be on guard behind an oak door on rabady isle life twisted on youor you twisted it for yourself no man knew his ending or even the next branching of his path branching paths in the quiet of the wood his mind went back that often happened when you were awake alone at night once in fog on a raid in ferrieres he and siggur and a small band of others had found themselves separated from the main party on a retreat to the coast theyd gone too far inland for safety but siggur had been drinking steadily on that raid so had thorkell truth be told and theyd been reckless with it theyd also been young they literally stumbled upon a sanctuary they hadnt even known about a chapel and outbuildings hidden in a knife of a valley east of champieres they saw the chapel lights through mist a sanctuary of the sleepless ones at their endless vigil thered have been no lights to see them by otherwise they attacked screaming ingavins name in the dense blurred dark foolish beyond any words it was for they were being pursued by the young prince carloman whod already proven himself a warrior and it was not a time to be staying to raid let alone with a dozen men but that branching path that had separated them from the body of their company made thorkell einarsons fortune they killed twenty clerics and their cudgelbearing servants in that isolated valley seeing terror flare whitely in mens eyes before they fled from the northmen laughing bloodsoaked and blooddrunk they set fire to the outbuildings and took away all the sanctuary treasure they could carry those treasures were astonishing that hidden complex turned out to be a burial place of royalty and what they discovered in the recesses of side chapels and surrounding tombs was dazzling siggur had found his sword there being siggur he decreed when they made their way back to the ships and found the others that this portion of the raids plunder belonged only to those who had been there and being siggur he had no trouble enforcing his will every young man in vinmark wanted to be one of the volgans shipmates in those days theyd already begun using that name for him thorkell supposed sitting in darkness entirely sober that it could be fairly said that that friendship had shaped his life siggur had been very young when theyd started raiding and thorkell had been even younger in awe that such a man seemed to consider him a companion want him at his side on a battlefield or tavern bench siggur had never been a thoughtful considering sort hed led by leading by being at the front of every assault faster stronger a little bit wilder than anyone elseexcept perhaps for the occasional berserkir whod join them at times hed drunk more than any of them awake and upright after the rest were snoring at benches or sprawled among the rushes of an aleroom floor thorkell rememberedit was a wellknown talethe morning siggur had come out of an inn with another raider a man named leif after a full night of drinking and challenged the other to a racealong the oars of their ships moored side by each in the harbour nothing like it had ever been done before no one had ever thought of such a thing amid laughter and wagers flying they roused and assembled their blearyeyed men had them take their places on board and level their oars straight out then as the sun came up the two leaders began a race up one side of their ships leaping from oar to oar and back down the other side swinging across by using the dragonprows leif fenrikson didnt even make it to the prow siggur went around his ship twice at speed that was siggur at his best blazoning his own prowess and also showing that of his chosen companions for a wobbling or uneven oar would have made him fall no doubting it twice around he ran that course with thorkell and every other man on board holding steady for him as he raced alone barechested around and around them laughing for the joy of being young and what he was in mornings first light it changed over the years for so much of youth cannot linger and ale can bring rage and bitterness as easily as laughter and fellowship thorkell realized at some point that siggur volganson was never going to stop drinking and raiding that he couldnt that there was nothing in ingavins offered middleworld for him but cresting white foam waves in sunlight or storm appearing out of the sea to beach the ships and ride or run inland to burn and kill it was the doing that mattered gold silver gems women the slaves they tookthese were only the worlds reasons access to glory salt spray and lit fires and testing himself again and again endlessly those were the things that drove him all his tooshort life never saying a word about these thoughts thorkell rowed and fought beside him until the end which came in llywerth as everyone knew siggur had heard that the cyngael were gathering a force to meet his ships and had led them ashore regardless for the joy of battling what might be there they were outnumbered there by the sea a host assembled from each of the cyngaels warring provinces he offered single combat to them a challenge hurled at all three princes of the cyngael but taken up by a young man who was no prince at all and brynn ap hywll big and hard and sober as a jadmad cleric on a fasting retreat had altered the northlands entirely by killing siggur volganson on that strandand taking the sword hed carried since the raid by champieres it was the death siggur had always sought thorkell knew it even then that same day the only ending siggur could have imagined the infirmities of age sober governing kingship could not even be conceived but by then thorkell already knew it was not his own idea of a life and its ironswift ending hed yielded to the cyngael in a sudden stunned emptiness in time he made his escape for servitude wasnt his vision of existence either he crossed the wall and the anglcyn lands and then autumn seas home and then he made a home it was his share of the gems and gold carried away from that chancedupon valley in ferrieres that bought him land and a farm on rabady in the year he decided it was time rabady isle was as good a place as any and better than most to shape a second life he found a wife and no man living or dead ever heard him say a word against her had the two daughters then his boy married the girls off when they were of age and well enough across on the mainland watched the boyclever and with some spiritas he grew he did some more raiding in those years chose ships and companions and landings salt got in the blood the erlings said the sea was hard to leave behind you but no wintering over for him no grand designs of conquest sober captains neatly planned journeys siggur was dead thorkell wasnt going back to that time he crossed the seas for what there was in it for what he could bring home no man would have said he was other than prosperous thorkell einarson of rabady isle once a companion of the volgan himself a goodenough life with a hearth and a bed at the end it seemed not a bladedeath on a distant shore no man living knew his end here he was overseas again in a wood where no man should be and how had that come to pass the oath sworn to ap hywlls wife yes but hed broken oaths over the years hed done so when he first escaped the cyngael hadnt he after surrendering he could have found a way to do the same thing here could do it right now kill these two sleeping princesin a place where theyd be expected to die where no one would ever find themmake his way back out of the wood wait for the fyrd to go north as they surely would start across country to erlond where his own people had settled in a stillforming colony like that one there would be many men with stories they didnt want told that was how a peoples boundaries expanded how they moved on from starting points questions didnt get asked you could make a new life again he shook his head to clear it order his mind he was tired not thinking well he didnt have to kill the other two could just rise up now while they slept start back east he snorted softly amused at himself that still wasnt right he didnt even need to sneak away could wake them bid farewell invoke jads blessing on the two of them and ingavins inwardly alun ab owyn had told him to leave he didnt have to be here at all except for the one thing the awareness that lay under the folly of this night like a seed in hard spring ground his son was on those dragonships and he was there because thorkell had killed a man in a tavern a little more than a year ago if you were a particular kind of man thorkell wasnt you could probably throw away a good deal of time thinking about fathers and sons time better spent with an ale flask and honest dice he couldnt truthfully say hed put his mind very often to the boy over the years on rabady hed taught him something of fighting a father owed that duty if pressed hed have pointed to a house land a position on the isle bern was to have had all those when his father died and wasnt that enough wasnt it more than thorkell had ever had he didnt carry many memories of the two of them together as the boy grew up some men liked to talk spin tales at their own hearth or a tavernsspin them so far from truth you could laugh his first tavern killing had come about because he had laughed at someone doing that thorkell wasnt a talespinner never had been a mans tongue could bring him trouble more quickly than anything else he kept his counsel guarded memories if others in rabady told the boy tales about his fathertruth or lieswell bern would learn to sort those for himself or he wouldnt no one had taken thorkell in hand as a boy and taught him how you handled yourself when you came ashore in a thunderstorm on rocks and found armed men waiting for you sitting in that wood that lay like a locked barrier between cyngael lands and anglcyn awake while two young men slept he did find himself recallingunexpectedlyan evening long ago a summers twilight mild as a maiden the boyeight summers old ten had come out with him while he repaired a door on the barn bern had carried his fathers tools thorkell seemed to remember had been amusingly proud to do so hed fixed the door then theyd walked somewherehe didnt remember where the boundaries of their landand for some reason hed told bern the story of the raid when the anglcyn royal guard had trapped them too far from the sea he really didnt tell many of the old tales maybe thats why the evening was with him the scent of the summer flowers a breeze the rockhe remembered now hed been leaning against the rock at their northern boundary the boy looking up at him as he listened so intent it could make you smile one evening one story theyd walked back to the house after no more to it than that bern wouldnt even recall the evening he knew nothing of any meaning had taken place bern was bearded and grown their land was gone an exiles house always went to someone else you could say the boy had made his own choice but you could also say thorkell had taken choices away from him put him in a circumstance where a poisonous serpent like ivarr ragnarson might think through whose son this was and take vengeance for what had happened at brynnfell you could say his father had put him on that branching path even so you might even find a reason to chuckle about all of this tonight if that was the way your humour worked all you needed to do was think about it consider the three of them in this wood alun ab owyn was really here more than a little maddened because of a dead brother athelbert had come because of his fatherthe need to make proof of himself in aeldreds eyes and his own and thorkell einarson exiled from rabady wastruthfullyin this forest for his son someone should make a song of it he thought shaking his head he spat into the darkness he was too tired to laugh but felt like it a little a small sound the grey dog had lifted his head seemed to be watching him he really was weary but it almost seemed as if the dog were tracking his thoughts an unsettling animal more to it than youd expect he had no idea which way the jormsvik ships were going none of them did this desperate foolish journey might be entirely unnecessary you had to come to terms with that you could be dying for no reason at all well what of that reason or no reason you were just as dead hed already lived longer than hed expected to he heard a different sound the dog again cafall had risen was standing rigidly head lifted thorkell blinked in surprise then the animal whimpered and that sound from that source frightened him beyond words he scrambled to his feet his heart was pounding even before he too caught the smell that smell first then sounds he never saw a thing the other two men rose jerked from sleep at the first loud crashing as if pulled upright like toys on a string athelbert began swearing both unsheathed their swords none of them could see anything at all it was black beyond power of sight to penetrate stars and moon blocked by the encircling trees and their greenblack summer leaves the pool beside them dark utterly still such pools thorkell thought rather too late were where the creatures that ruled the night came to drink or hunt jads holy blood whispered athelbert was is that thorkell had he been less afraid might have made the easy profane jest because it was blood they smelled and flesh pungent rotting like a kill left in the sun a smell of earth too underneath heavy loamy an animal odour with all of these another sound sharp in the black something cracking a small tree a branch athelbert swore again alun had not yet spoken the dog whimpered again and thorkells hand on his hammer began to shake one of the horses tossed its head and whinnied loudly no secret to their presence now if ever there had been stand close he snapped under his breath though there was hardly a reason to be quiet now the other two came over alun still had his sword out athelbert sheathed his now took his bow notched an arrow there was nothing to be seen nowhere to shoot something fell heavily north of them whatever this was it was large enough to knock over trees and it was in that moment that thorkell had an image burst within his mind and lodge there as if rooted his jaw clenched to stop himself from crying out he had been a fighter almost all his life had seen brain matter and entrails spilled to lie slippery on sodden ground had watched a womans face burn away melting to bone hed seen bloodeaglings a karchite hostage torn apart between whipped horses and never flinched even when he was sober these were the northlands life was what it was hard things happened but his hands were trembling now like an old mans he actually wondered if he was going to fall he thought of his grandmother these long years dead who had known of such things as the creature out there in the night must be perhaps even its name ingavins blind eye kneel he rasped the words forming themselves forced from him but when he looked over he saw that the other two were already kneeling on that dark ground by the pool the smell from beyond the glade was overpowering you could gag or retch thorkell apprehended something hideous and immense ancient not to be in any way confronted by three men frail with mortality in a place where they should not be in terror then weariness entirely gone thorkell looked at the shapes of the two men kneeling beside him and he made a decision a choice took a path the gods called you to themselveswherever and whatever the gods might beas it pleased them to do so men lived and died knowing this he stayed on his feet in all of us fear and memory interweave in complex changing ways sometimes it is the thing unseen that will linger and appall long afterwards sliding into dreams from the blurred borders of awareness or emerging perhaps when we stand alone on first waking at the fence of a farmyard or the perimeter of an encampment in that misty hour when the idea of morning is not quite incarnate in the east or it can assail us like a blow in the bright shimmer of a crowded market at midday we do not ever move entirely beyond what has brought us mortal terror alun would never know it for it was not a thing that could be shared in words but the image the aura he had in his mind as he sank to his knees was exactly what thorkell einarson apprehended within himself and athelbert was aware of the same thing in the blackness of that glade the smell to alun was death decay corruption that which had been living and was no longer so not for a long time and yet was moving as it rotted crashing in some vast bulk through trees he had a sense of a creature larger than the woods should by rights have held his heart hammered blessed jad of light the god behind the sun was he not to defend his children from terrors such as this whatever it was he was drenched in sweat im im sorry he stammered to athelbert beside him this is my doing my mistake pray was all the anglcyn said alun did so choking on the rotting stench that filled the grove he saw cafall trembling ahead of him the horses were steadier strangely one had whinnied now they stood transfixed statues as if unable to move or make a sound and he remembered how he and a different horse had been immobilized like that inside another pool in another wood when the queen of the faeries had passed by this was he knew another creature from that spirit world what else could it be massive carrying the odour of decaying animal and death not like the faeries this was something beyond them get down he said to thorkell the erling had not knelt didnt turn his head afterwards alun would have a thought about that but in that moment whatever it was that bulked beyond the clearing roared aloud the trees shook it seemed to alun ears and mind blasted by immensity of sound that the stars above the forest had to be swinging in their courses like carried censers in a wind almost deafened his hands in helpless spasm he stared into the blank night and waited for this death to claim them cafall was on his belly flat to the ground beside the dog still on his feet thorkell einarson took his hammer andmoving slowly as if in some dream alun was having or pushing into a galehe laid the shaft across both his palms and he stepped towards the sound and then he set the hammer down carefully an offering upon the grass alun didnt understand he didnt understand anything beyond terror and the awareness of their transgression and the engulfing power just out of sight thorkell spoke then in the erling tongue and his ears still ringing alun yet understood enough to hear him say we seek only passage lord only that will harm no living creature of the wood if it be thy will to grant us leave and then there was something else spoken more softly and alun did not hear it there came a second roaring even louder than the first whether in reply or entirely oblivious to the feeble words of a mortal man and it seemed to those in the glade as if that noise could flatten trees it was athelbert of the three of them who thought he heard another thing within that sound woven into it he never put it into words then or after but what he sensed while he cowered stuttering prayers in the gutharrowing certainty of dying was pain something older than he could even attempt to fathom the downward reach of his soul didnt go deep enough for that he heard it though and had no idea why this was allowed there was no third roaring alun had been waiting for it instinctively but then in the silence it occurred to him that triads things in threes were a shaping of bards a mortal conceit a way of the cyngael not a grounded truth of the spirit world he would take that with some other things away from that glade for it seemed they were going to be allowed to leave the silence continued it grew rippled reclaimed the woods around none of them moved the stars did ceaselessly far above and the blue moon was still rising climbing the long track laid out for it in the sky time does not pause for men or beasts though it might seem to us to have stopped at some moments or we might wish it to do so at others to suspend a shining call back a gesture or a blow or someone lost the dog stood up thorkell was still shivering the odour was gone that smell of maggoteaten meat and fur and old blood he felt sweat drying on his skin cold in the night he found himself eerily calm he was thinking in fact of how many people he had killed in his raiding years another in an alley last night once a shipmate and of all of them named or nameless known or seen only in the red moment his hammer or axe blade slew them the one he so much wanted back the moment hed reclaim from time if he could was nikar kjellsons killing in the tavern at home a year ago in the otherworldly stillness of this glade he could very nearly see himself going out through the low tavern door stooping under the beam into a soft night walking home under stars through a quiet town to his wife and son instead of accepting one more flask of ale and a last round of wagering on the tumbled dice hed have that one back if the world were a different place it was different now he thought after what had just happened but not in the way he needed it to be it occurred to him with something bordering astonishment that he might weep he rubbed a hand through his beard drew it across his eyes felt time grip him again carrying them small boats on a toowide sea why are we alive alun ab owyn asked his voice was rough it was thorkell thought the right question the only one worth asking and he had no answer we didnt matter enough to kill athelbert said surprising the other two thorkell looked over at him they were shapes here only all of them what did you say to it at the end when you put down the hammer thorkell was trying to decide what to answer when the dog growled deep in its throat dear jad alun said thorkell saw where he was pointing he caught his breath something green was shimmering at the edge of their glade beyond the pool a human form or nearly so he looked the other way quickly a second one on their right then a third beside that one no sound at all this time just the pale green glowing of these figures he turned back to the cyngael prince do you know is this what you he began no said alun and again no flatly no hope offered cafall hold the dog was still growling straining forward the horses thorkell saw were agitated now there was a risk they might break free of their tethers or hurt themselves trying the shapes whatever they were were about the height of a man but the shimmer and glow of them wavering made their appearance hard to determine he wouldnt have seen anything if they hadnt cast that faint green illumination there were at least six of them perhaps one or two more behind those ringing the glade his hammer was on the grass where hed laid it down do i shoot said athelbert no thorkell said quickly i swore that wed harm no living thing so we wait till they we dont know what this is alun said you imagine theyre bringing pillows for our weary heads athelbert snapped i have no idea what to imagine i can only a neverfinished thought that one speech can be rendered meaningless sometimes the soughtafter clarity of words the fierce white light that burst from the pond shattering darkness like glass made all three of them throw hands before their eyes and cry aloud they were blinded as unable to see as they had been in the blackness too much light too little light the same consequence they were men in a place where they ought not to have been the sounds in the glade were their own cries fading in the charged air the horses neighing thrashing of hooves nothing from the dog now no noise at all from the green creatures that had encircled them or from whatever had made that annihilating flare of light which was also gone now it was black again alun standing rigid and afraid eyes clenched shut in pain caught a scent heard a rustling a hand claimed his then a voice at his ear music scarcely a breath drop your iron please come i must get away from it the spruaugh are gone fumbling he let fall his sword and belt let her lead him his senses dazzled eyes useless heart painful too large for his chest wait i cant leave the others he stammered after theyd gone a little distance from the glade why she said but she did stop hed known she would say that they were impossibly different the two of them beyond his power to even nearly comprehend the scent of her was intoxicating his knees felt weak her touch conjured a kind of madness she had come for him i wont leave the others he corrected there were flashes and spirals of light in his field of vision it was painful when he opened his eyes he still couldnt see what what were spruaugh he could hear disgust in her voice could imagine her hair changing colour as she spoke but he still couldnt see it occurred to him to be afraid again to wonder if he would be forever blinded by that shattering flash but even with the thought came the first hints of returning vision she was a spilling light beside him what are we dont know or i dont the queen might they are mostly in this forest a few come into our small one linger near us but not often they are cold and ugly soulless without grace they try sometimes to make the queen attend to them flying to her with tales when we do wrong but mostly they stay away from where we are in here are they dangerous for you everything is dangerous here you should not have come i know that there was no choice he could almost see her her hair was an amber glow no choice she laughed rippling he said did you feel you had a choice when you rescued me it was as if they had to teach each other how the world was made or seen a silence as she considered is that what you meant he nodded she was still holding his hand her fingers were cool he brought them to his lips she traced the outline of his mouth amid everything after everything here was desire and wonder she had come what was it before them the thing that fingers flat against his mouth pressing we do not name it for fear it will answer to the name there is a reason why your people do not come here why we almost never do that one not the spruaugh it is older than we are he was silent for a time her hand was moving again tracing his face i dont know why were alive he said nor do i matteroffactly a simple truth one of you did make an offering the erling thorkell his hammer yes she said nothing though he thought she was about to instead she stepped nearer rose upon her toes and kissed him on the lips tasting of moonlight though it was dark where they stood except for her the blue moon outside above shining over his own lands hers over the seas he brought his hands up touched her hair he could see the small shining impossibility of her a faerie in his arms he said will we die here you think i can know what will come i know that i cant she smiled i can keep the spruaugh from you can you guide us to brynnfell that is where you are going the erlings are we think another raid she made a face distaste more than anything else offended rather than fearful or dismayed iron and blood near to their small wood and pool and truly why should the deaths of mortal men cause a spirit such as this dismay alun thought then he had another thought before he could back away from it he said you could go ahead warn them brynn has seen you he might come up the slope if you were there again brynn had been there with him after the battle and in that pool in the wood when he was young he might fight his visions of the spirit world but surely surely he would not deny her if she came to him she stepped back her hair amber again soft light among tall trees i cannot do that and guard you i know alun said or guide he nodded i know we are hoping that cafall can the dog he might it is many days for you five or six we thought perhaps and you can be there sooner than that will you she was so small delicate as spray from a waterfall he could see her chasing a thought her hair altering as she did dark then bright again she smiled i might grieve for you the way mortals do i may start to understand he swallowed with sudden difficulty i we will hope not to die here but there are many people at risk you saw what happened the last time they came she nodded gravely this is what you wish it was what he needed wishes were another thing he said it will be a gift if you do this so still a place where they were there ought to have been more noises in a wood at night the pad of the animals that hunted now scurry of those that moved along branches between roots fleeing it was silent perhaps the light of her he thought steering the creatures of the forest away she said serious as children could sometimes be you will have taught me sorrow will you call it a gift he remembered what shed said the night before she bit her lip i do not know but i will go home to the hill above brynnfell and try to tell him there are men coming from the sea how do you how do mortals say farewell he cleared his throat many different ways he bent with all the grace he could command and kissed her on each cheek and then upon the mouth i would not have thought my life would offer such a gift as you she looked he thought surprised after a moment she said stay with the dog she turned was moving away carrying brightness and music he said in a panic sudden and too loud startling them both wait i dont know your name she smiled neither do i she said and went darkness rushed back in her wake the glade and pond were not far away alun made his way there called out as he approached so as not to startle them cafall met him at the clearings edge both men were standing do we know what that was thorkell asked the light another spirit alun said this one a friend she drove them away with it i dont think we cant stay here i believe we need to keep moving tsk and here i was imagining youd gone to fetch those pillows for our heads said athelbert sorry dropped them on the way back alun replied dropped your sword and belt too said the anglcyn prince here they are alun took both buckled the belt adjusted the hang of his sword thorkell your weapon asked athelbert it stays here said the erling alun saw athelbert nod his head i thought as much take my sword ill use the bow cafall said alun the dog padded over take us home they untied and mounted their horses left glade and silent pond behind though never the memory of them pushing westward in the dark on a narrow subtle track following the dog a hammer left behind them in the grass kendra would have liked to say that it was because of concern for her brother an awareness of him that she knew what she knew that night but it wasnt so word or a first word came to esferth very late the kings messengers sent from the sea strand to drengest had carried orders that one ship should go to the cyngaelto prince owyn in cadyr who was closestwith word of a possible erling raid upon brynnfell on the way to drengest the three outriders had divided on orders one of them racing his tidings to the nearest of the hilltop beacons from there the message had come north in signal fires the erlings were routed many of them slain the rest had fled prince athelbert had gone away on a journey his brother was to be kept safe the king and fyrd would be home in two days time further orders would follow osbert dispatched runners to carry word of victory to the queen and to the city and the tents outside there was a fair about to begin men needed reassurance urgently the rest of the message was not for others to hear it wasnt actually difficult kendra thought as the meaning of the words sank in to realize what lay beneath the tidings of her brother you didnt have to be wise or old there were a dozen of them in the hall she had found it impossible to sleep and equally difficult to stay all night in chapel praying this hall with osbert seemed the best place gareth had obviously felt the same way judit had been here earlier was somewhere else now she looked over at gareth saw how pale he had become her heart went out to him younger son the quiet one had never wanted more than the role life seemed to be offering him you might even have said what he really wanted was less of a role but the very specific instructionskept safesaid a great deal about what sort of journey their older brother was taking though not where if king aeldred and the anglcyn ended up with only one male heir left life was about to change for gareth for all of them kendra thought she looked around she had no idea where judit was their mother was at chapel still of course athelbert in the name of jad what is what has he done now osbert asked of no one in particular the chamberlain seemed to have aged tonight kendra thought burgreds death would be part of it hed be moving through memories right now even as he struggled to deal with unfolding events the past always came back in a way you could say that none of those whod lived through that winter in beortferth had ever left the marshes behind her fathers fevers were only the most obvious form of that i have no idea someone said from down the table gone chasing them they have ships gareth protested he cant chase them some of them might not have made it back to the sea then hed have the fyrd theyd all go and this message wouldnt say we will learn more soon osbert said quietly i shouldnt have asked theres little point in guessing like children at a riddle game and that was true enough as most things osbert said were but it was then in precisely that moment looking at her fathers crippled beloved chamberlain that kendra realized that she knew what was happening she knew as simple and appalling as that and it was because of the cyngael prince who had come to them not her brother something had changed in her life the moment the cyngael had crossed the stream the day before towards where she and the others were lying on summer grass idling a morning away just as she had the night before she knew where alun ab owyn had gone and athelbert was with him as simple as that as impossible had she asked for this done something that had brought it upon her as a curse am i a witch the thought came intrusive her hand closed a little desperately on the sun disk about her neck witches sold love potions ground up herbs for ailments blighted crops and cattle for a fee held converse with the dead could go safely into enchanted places she took her hand from the disk closed her eyes a moment it is in the nature of things that when we judge actions to be memorably courageous they are invariably those that have an impact that resonates saving other lives at great risk winning a battle losing ones life in a valiant attempt to do one or the other a death of that sort can lead to songs and memories at least as muchsometimes morethan a triumph we celebrate our losses knowing how they are woven into the gift of our being here sometimes however an action that might be considered as gallant as any of these will take its shape and pass unknown no singer to observe and mourn or celebrate no vivid worldchanging consequence to spur the harpists fingers kendra rose quietly as she always did murmured her excuses and left the hall she didnt think anyone noticed men were coming and going despite the hour the beacon fires tidings were running through the city outside in the torchlit corridor she found herself walking a little more quickly than usual as though she needed to keep moving or she would falter the guard at the doors someone she knew smiled at her and opened to the street outside an escort my lady none needed my thanks im going only back to chapel and my lady mother the chapel was to the left so she had to turn that way at the first meeting of lanes she paused out of sight long enough for him to close the door again then she went back the other way heading towards the wall and gates for the second time in as many nights footsteps a known voice you lied to him where are you going she turned felt a swift unworthy flowering of relief offered thanks to the god she would be stopped now would not have to do this after all gareth his face taut with concern came up to her she had no idea what to say so offered truth gareth listen i cant tell you how and it frightens me but i am quite certain athelbert is in the spirit wood he had taken a blow this evening with the tidings harder than hers he was still adjusting to it she saw him step back a little a witch unclean she thought couldnt help but think unworthy that thought this was her brother after a moment he said carefully you feel a sense of him he was close to truth it wasnt athelbert in fact but that much she wasnt ready to divulge she swallowed hard and nodded i think he and some others are trying to get west through that forest no one kendra thats folly thats athelbert she said but it didnt come out lightly not tonight i think they feel a need to go very fast or even he wouldnt do this gareths brow had knitted the way it did when he was thinking hard a warning the erlings going that way by sea she nodded i think that must be it but why would athelbert care this became difficult he might be joining others making one with them the cyngael prince he was clever her little brother he might also be the kingdoms heir by now she nodded her head again but how kendra how would you know she shrugged you said it a sense of him a lie but not too far from truth he was visibly struggling with this and how should he not she was struggling and it was inside her he took a breath very well what is it you want to do there it was she wasnt going to be stopped unless she stopped herself she swallowed only one thing she said a small thing take me outside the walls it will be easier if im with you he loved her his life was altered forever if athelbert died and in a different way she supposed if she died gareth looked at her a moment then nodded his head they went to the gate together in the blue moonlight a different man on watch which was good the last one would have been stricken with fear to see her after what had happened the night before there were still hundreds of men and not a few women she knew outside by the tents theyd have heard glorious tidings by now a celebration would be beginning gareth had no trouble persuading the guard that they were going out to join in that suggested that their sister the princess judit would likely be not far behind which happened to bevery probablythe case if she wasnt ahead of them having gone out another way outside walking quickly west not north towards the lights and the tents kendra had a tardy thought she stopped again you the message said you were to be kept safe gareth uncharacteristically swore it would have been more impressive if he hadnt sounded as though he were imitating judit she might have been amused at any other time he glared at her she lowered her gaze they moved on came at length to the river it all felt oddly like a dream now a repeating of something done she had been here last night shed stopped on this side then waited for someone to come out of the trees kendra hesitated now looked up at her brother you are going in arent you he said the forest to spirits there not really a question she nodded her head stay for me please i can come she touched his hand that was brave very much gareth would bring her to tears if she wasnt careful if you do i will not go you may curse all you like at instructions but i will not lead you into the spirit wood i wont be long or go far say youll stay here or we both go back now that last sounds perfectly good to me she didnt smile though she could see he wanted her to she waited he said finally you are sure of this she nodded again another lie of course but at least not a spoken one this time he leaned forward kissed her on the forehead you are so much better than all the rest of us he said jad defend you ill be here moonlight on the water reflecting from the stream very little breeze the night mild late summer she went quickly wading in and across before she could lose what felt like a toosmall store of courage or he could see that she was crying after all the forest here began only a little way beyond the water it slanted west farther south and then there was the long knife of the valley half a days ride that wayand the holy house at retherly where her mother was going to go after judit was wed she knew about that and judit did she didnt think her brothers had been told yet marriages and retreats kendra couldnt say shed spent any great amount of time thinking about either or about boys and men perhaps she ought to have perhaps this had been a sisters reaction to judit whose lifelong defiance of any imposed order or protocol had led her far from the norms of a proper young womans behaviour kendra was she supposed the proper young woman of the family an alarming thought at that particular moment it hadnt ever felt as though she was it was more a matter of not enough inclination to pursue such matters and no onein truthalluring or engaging enough to change her mind on the vague but undeniably important subject of men her brothers and sisters made jokes about hakons interest in her they werent kind to him about it but kendra considered him a friend and a boy really there wasnt much point thinking about it in any case her father would decide where she wed just as he had with judit her sisters fiery recklessness hadnt done much to alter the fact that she was marrying a thirteenyearold rheden prince this winter as far as kendra was concerned defiance needed to get you somewhere or it was just being noisy she wasnt sure whether what she was doing now was defiant or mad ormost alarminglyif it was something dark and complex and having to do with a man after all there was nothing ordinary about it she knew she also knew very near the trees now that if she even slowed let alone broke stride here at the woods edge fear would take hold of her entirely so she kept walkinginto the darkness of branches and leaves where alun ab owyn had gone the night before the strangeness this terrible unsettling inward strangeness grew stronger he was in these woods she knew it and she even seemed to know exactly where she needed to go now where he had been last night this is unholy she thought and bit her lip i could burn for this it wasnt far which was a blessing of the god upon her life and might mean she was not yet entirely cast out from jads countenance and protection she had no time to try to think that through where she stopped was less a clearing than an easing of the press of trees around where grass might grow she thought about wolves then snakes made herself stop that she stood very still because this was the place she waited and nothing happened a sense of foolishness assailed her that too she pushed away she might not understand this awareness within but it would be the worst sort of lie to the self to deny it was in her and she would not do that she cleared her throat too loudly almost made herself jump in the darkness of the spirit wood kendra said very clearly if you are here whatever it is you are whatever was here last night that he came to meet you need to know that hes in the woods again now to the south which is very dangerous and with him is my brother athelbert maybe others if you mean him well and i pray to my god that you do will you help them please silence her voice words spoken then nothing as if the sounds had been simply swallowed absorbed sinking away into neverhavingbeen that feeling of foolishness again hard to push back they would name her mad or a witch or both that ferrieres cleric visiting had spoken in the royal chapel four days ago of the heresies and pagan rites that still flourished in corners of the jaddite world and his voice had hardened when hed told how such things needed to be burned away that the light of the god might not be dimmed by them this was she supposed a corner of the world she saw a light where none had been kendra cried out then covered her mouth quickly she had come here to be heard trembling groping for courage she really wasnt sure she possessed she saw something green appear in front of her beside a tree trunk a little taller than she was slender hairless it was hard to discern features or eyes for the glow was strange obscuring as much as it illuminated so this she thought was what alun ab owyn had come to meet in the oddest almost inexplicable way seeing this vague sexless indeterminate shape she suddenly felt bettercouldnt sort out why that might be it didnt seem malevolent nor should it be she thought if alun had been here to meet it thank thank you she managed for co coming to me did you hear they are south near the coast i believe they they are trying to get through the wood do do you understand anything i say no response no movement no eyes to see or read a green shape a muted glow in the wood it was real however the spirits were real she was speaking to one fear and wonder and a sense of very great urgency can you help them will you nothing at all the creature was motionless as if carved only a slight shimmer of the green aura suggested it was a living thing but fire glowed and shimmered and was not alive she might be wrong she might not understand any of this properly and that last thought in fact was nearest to the truth why should she have understood what was happening how could she do so the spruaugh stayed another moment and then withdrew leaving darkness behind it again deeper for the lost light kendra sensed immediately that this was all she was going to see all that would happen the space among the trees felt emptied out fear had gone she realized replaced by wonder a kind of awe the world she thought was never going to seem the same again going back she wouldnt be returning to the same stream or moonlight or the city she had left there were green shimmering creatures in the woods beside esferth whatever the clerics might say and people had always known this was so why else the centurieslong fear of this forest the stories told to frighten children or around night fires she stayed where she was another moment a pause before returning breathing in the darkness alone as she had been last night but not quite the same and so a difficult truth about human courage was played out among those trees a truth we resist for what it suggests about our lives but sometimes the most gallant actions those requiring a summoning of all our will access to bravery beyond easy understanding or description have no consequence that matters they leave no ripples upon the surface of succeeding events cause nothing achieve nothing are trivial marginal this can be hard to accept aeldreds younger daughter did something almost unspeakably brave going alone at night into the blackness of a wood believed to be haunted intending to confront the spirit worldwhich was the most appalling heresy according to every tenet she had ever learned and she did do that and spoke a message the warning shed come to giveand it signified nothing at all in the wheel and turn of that night the faerie had gone already long before she had in fact been tracking aeldreds fyrd all the previous night and through this day and into evening from within the wood almost all of the spruaugh in the forest were south as well by now and this one hearing and yes understanding kendras words set itself to quickly go that way also but pursuing its own desires such desires as those creatures still possessed which had nothing to do with guarding three mortal men in a forest that had once been named a godwood in the days when men dissembled less about such things a hard truth that courage can be without meaning or impact need not be rewarded or even known the world has not been made in that way perhaps however within the self there might come a resonance the awareness of having done something difficult of having done something that can ripple might do so though in a different way mostly walking as quickly now as she dared in the rootandbranch darkness what kendra felt was relief a rush of it like blood to the head when you stand up too quickly she had no idea what that green spirit had been but it had come to her spirit world halfworld she had seen it a glowing in the night everything altered with that she came to the edge of the trees saw moonlight through the last screening leaves then unmediated with stars as she came out the stream the summer grass her brother on the far bank and what she felt emerging was near to joy the world had changed in ways she couldnt sort through but it was still in the main the place shed always known the water as she waded through was cool pleasantly so on a summer night she could hear music and laughter to her left north of the city she could see the walls in the distance torches for the guards on the ramparts she could see her brother solid and familiar and reassuring she stopped in front of him he seemed taller kendra thought somewhere over the summer gareth had grown or was that a sense that came from what she knew about athelbert gareth touched her shoulder im me she said not spiritclaimed shall i kick you to prove it he shook his head id think judits soul had claimed you do you want to go to the tents be with people he hadnt probed or pressed her at all she shook her head my clothing and boots are wet i want to change then i think i need to go to chapel if thats all right you can go over to the ill stay with you the guard said nothing what was he going to say when they called to come back in so soon after going out kendra went to her rooms woke her women had two of them help her change they raised eyebrows but said nothing eitherand what were they going to say then she went back out to where gareth had waited again and they went to chapel together the streets were busy for so late an hour but esferth was crowded and jubilant they could hear the noise from the taverns as they went walked past the one where shed stood across the street last night when alun ab owyn had come out with his dog and shed called the erling over to her gareth broke their silence is he all right who athelbert of course she blinked had made an error there she managed a shrug i think hell be all right after all judit is nowhere near him gareth stopped for a second then burst out laughing he dropped an arm around her shoulder and they continued that way turning right at the next junction of streets towards the chapel where is judit do you think she asked i imagine at the tents he was probably right kendra thought there was cause for wine and celebration with the erlings slaughtered and driven away in the event however they were wrong entering the royal chapel they saw their sister beside the queen at prayer kendra stopped for a moment in the side aisle surprised she found herself gazing at two profiles candlelight upon them the queens face round fleshy though still smooth hints of a nearly lost beauty judit in the bright flush of redhaired fairskinned glory on the cusp of her journey north to rheden and marriage kendra knew she had been avoiding the thought of that so much would change their mother would leave for retherly and once judit was married it would be her turn next there might be green spirits in the wood but the way of the world was not going to change for an anglcyn princess because of them aeldreds two younger children went over and knelt beside their mother and sister looking towards the sun disk and the altar and the cleric standing there leading the prayers after a moment they added their voices to the incantations and responses some things at least still seemed clear enough and needful in the nighttime you prayed for light fourteen sometimes as events in a given saga or idyll or tale move towards what may be seen as a resolution those in the midst of what is unfolding will have a senseeven at the timeof acceleration a breathlessness urgency speed often however this emerges only in looking back an awareness long after the fact sometimes accompanied by belated fear as to how many strands and lives had been coming togetheror breaking apartat the same time men and women will wonder at how they did not perceive these things and be left with a sense that chance accident or miraculous intervention for good or ill lay at the heart of the time it is the humbling daunting nature of this truth that can lead us to our gods when pace and press subside but it also needs to be remembered that sagas and idylls are constructed that someone has composed their elements selected and balanced them bringing what art and inclination they have as an offering the tale of the volgans raid with a handful of men on a sanctuary of the sleepless ones in ferrieres will be very differently told by a cleric surviving the attack chronicling the round of a dismal year and an erling skald celebrating a triumph those inside a story do not usually think of themselves that way though some may have an eye to fame and those who come after mostly we are engaged in living riding back from the coast in bright summer daylight on the main road by the river thorne birdsong above harvestready fields to the east and the forest receding for a time as a valley cut it away ceinion of llywerth watched the anglcyn fyrd struggle to define a collective state of mind and he understood their difficulty the victory was magnificent memorable complete a considerable erling force had been shattered driven away with major losses on the raiders side and next to none on theirs no deaths in fact after the initial night killings that had sparked the kings ride it was a time of glory there were traders from abroad in esferth for the fairthe story of aeldreds riding out at night would be in ferrieres and batiara before autumn changed the leaves it would reach alrassan when the silkclad horse traders went home glory then more than enough to share but the death that had begun it mattered they all mattered of course ceinion told himself but it was idleeven for a cleric dispensing pietiesto pretend that some lives did not signify more for their people than others and burgred of denferth had been one of the three great men in these lands so there was that to dim the joy of this homeward ride there was also the prince gone into the spirit wood the madness of that the death at the heart of it and so those of the fyrd who wished to let their spirits soar kept a distance from king aeldred and the mask that had become his face this morning and so again it seemed to ceinion as it had by the sea at twilight that they were waiting on him in a way it was an irony he was only a visitor here and the cyngael were far from allies of the anglcyn in another sense the reason prince athelbert was in the wood was that alun ab owyn had gone there and ceinion knew it and so did the king you could say that it properly fell to a cyngael to their high cleric to provide consolation and hope right now ceinion didnt know if it was possible he was very tired unused to so much riding with a body that didnt ease and loosen as it once had in the mornings he was also heartsick and afraid picturing the dragonships that might even now be cleaving seas to the west there were blue skies overhead he had prayed for storms in the night these inward sorrows didnt matter or couldnt be permitted to matter if you accepted the duties of your office ceinion twitched his reins and cantered his horse over beside aeldreds the king glanced at him nodded no more than that no one was near them ceinion took a breath do you know he said coldly if i were cleric of your royal chapel i would be ordering you to do penance now and why would this be aeldreds voice was equally cold within ceinion quailed at what he heard but forced himself to push on for the thoughts that are written in your face ah thinking now is cause for chastisement it always has been certain kinds of thought how illuminating and what unspoken reflections of mine amount to transgressions cleric the title again not his name ceinion looked over at the king trying not to be obvious about his scrutiny he wondered if aeldred were succumbing to one of his fevers if that might explain i am perfectly well said other man bluntly please answer my question ceinion said as briskly as he could heresy a breaking from holy doctrine he lowered his voice you are easily wise enough to know what i am saying i am glad you are well my lord pretend if you will that i am not wise at all that you ride beside a fool deficient in sense explain the kings face had flushed fever or anger they said he still denied when his illness was coming on after twentyfive years a refusal to accept that gave ceinion a thought let me ask a question do you truly believe two royal princes and an erling who rowed with siggur volganson are incapable of contending with wolves and snakes in a wood he saw what he was looking for the flicker in the other mans eyes swift awareness of where this was going i would imagine said king aeldred they ought to be able to defend themselves against such but you decided even before we set out this morning that your son is now dead you have accepted his death you said as much on the strand last night my lord no reply for a time the horses cantered a groundcovering pace without urgency it was warm in the sunlight the weather accursedly benign a scattering of soft clouds he needed black storms the howl of wind obliterating seas aeldred said you are upbraiding me for beliefs about the forest tell me ceinion did you come here through the wood or did you and your companions avoid it and why said the cleric deliberately sounding surprised would i choose to risk getting lost in a wood when the coastal path from cadyr lay open before us ah good and it has always been from cadyr that you set out it is from that coast that all of the cyngael coming east have departed tell me high cleric who it is has made a journey through that wood in living memory or in your chronicles and songs or do not the songs of the cyngael tell something different entirely ceinion felt equal to this by training and disposition and necessity he said firmly it is my task and yours my lord to steer the peopleour people in both lands where we share the blessing of jadaway from such pagan fears if you think your son and his companions equal to wild animals and to not losing their way you must not surrender hope that they will come out in the west and there is a chance they will save lives doing so birdsong horses hooves mens voices laughter though not near to them aeldred had turned his head was looking directly at him the eyes bright clear no fever only knowledge after a moment he said ceinion dear friend forgive me or do not as you will or must but i saw spirits close on twentyfive years ago the night of the battle we lost at camburn and then in beortferth that winter lights in the swamp at twilight and at night moving taking shape not marsh fires not fever not dream though the fevers did begin the night of the battle high cleric ceinion hear me i know there are powers in that wood who do not mean us well and are not to be mastered by men it had taken so little time to say and to hear but how much time did a sword stroke take an arrows flight how long was there between the last breath of someone you loved when they were dying and the breath they did not take ceinions heart was pounding an easy ride their battles over talking on a summers day even so he felt himself assaulted under siege he was not necessarily equal to this after all you brought your own memories and ghosts to these exchanges however much you fought to keep them out to be simply a holy man a distilled voice for the teachings of the god you served he knew what he should say to this what he was required to say he murmured my lord surely you just gave yourself answer it was the very night your kingdom was lost after the battle your father and brother slain the worst night of your life is it any wonder that ceinion do me enough courtesy to believe i have thought of this they were present for me before long before from childhood i have since come to understand i denied them avoided would not accept until the night of camburn and in the marshes after what had he expected that his words would shed a dazzling illumination upon a confused soul he knew what this man was he tried another way because he had to do you do you not know how arrogant it is to trust our mortal vision over the teachings of faith i do but i am not able to deny what i do know call it a flaw and a sin if you will could you do that denying the question he hadnt wanted an arrow flying yes he said finally though not easily aeldred looked at him opened his mouth no questions i beg of you ceinion said raw as an open wound all these years after the king gazed at him a long moment then looked away and was silent they rode for a time through the mild sweet glory of late summer ceinion was thinking as hard he could careful thought his refuge the fevers he said my lord could you not see that they that i conceived visions in my fevered state no not so two very clever men longlived and subtle ceinion considered this a moment then realized that he understood something else as well he gripped his reins tightly you believe that the fevers are that they come to you as he reached for words this was difficult for many reasons as punishment yes i do said the king of the anglcyn his voice flat for your heresy this belief for this belief my fall from the teachings of jad in whose name i live and rule do not believe that what i am telling you has come kindly to me he couldnt imagine believing that who knows of this osbert burgred did and the queen and they believed you what you saw the two men did they saw these things as well no he said it quickly they did not but they were with you aeldred looked at him again you know what the old tales tell yours and ours both that a man who enters the sacred places of the halfworld may see spirits there and if he survives he may see them after all his days but it is also told that some are born with this gift this i came to believe was so with me not burgred not osbert though they stood by me in the marsh and rode with me from camburn that night the sacred places of the halfworld uttermost heresy a mound not far from brynnfell another summer long ago a woman with redgold hair dying by the sea he had left her with her sister taken horse gone riding in a frenzy in a madness of sorrow beyond words no memory at all of that ride had come to brynnfell at twilight two days later bypassed it entered the small wood he made himselfas alwaystwist his mind away from that moonshaped memory it was not to be looked upon you trusted and believed in the words of jad not in your own frail pretense of knowing the truth of things and the queen he asked clearing his throat what does the queen say it was the hesitation aeldreds delay in replying a lifetime of listening to men and women tell what was in their hearts in words in pauses in the things not quite said the man beside him murmured gravely she believes i will lose my soul when i die because of this it was clear now ceinion thought it was achingly clear and so she will go to retherly aeldred was looking at him he nodded his head to pray each day and night for me until one of us dies she sees it as her first duty in love and in faith a burst of laughter off to their right somewhere behind men riding home in triumph knowing songs and feasting awaited them she might be right of course said the king his tone light now as if discussing the coming barley harvest or the quality of wine at table you should be denouncing me ceinion is that not your duty ceinion shook his head you seem to have done that to yourself for twentyfive years i suppose but then came what i did last night ceinion looked quickly over he blinked then this too slipped into understanding my lord you did not send athelbert into that wood his going there is no punishment of you no why not is it not sheerest arrogance to imagine we understand the workings of the god did you not tell me that think wherein lies my transgression and where has my son now gone wolves and snakes ceinion had said foolishly moments ago to this man who was bearing more than two decades of guilt trying to serve the god and his people and carrying these memories i believe aeldred was saying that sometimes we are given messages if we are able to read them after i taught myself trakesian and sent out word i was buying texts a waleskan came to raedhillthis was long agowith a scroll not more than that he said hed bought it on the borders of sarantium im sure he looted it one of the plays the king shook his head songs of their liturgy fragments the horned god and the maiden it was badly torn stained it was the first trakesian writing i ever bought ceinion and all this morning i have been hearing this in my head when the sound of roaring is heard in the wood the children of earth will cry when the beast that was roaring comes into the fields the children of blood must die ceinion shivered in sunlight he made the sign of the disk i believe aeldred went on if you will forgive me and it is not an intrusion that you did not denounce what i have just said because you also have some knowledge of these things if i am right in this please tell me how do you carry that how do you find peace he was still half in the spell of the verse the children of earth will cry ceinion said slowly choosing words i believe that what doctrine tells us is becoming truth that by teaching it we help it become the nature of jads world if there are spirits powers a halfworld beside ours it is coming to an end what we teach will be true partly because we teach it believing makes it so aeldreds voice was wry yes said ceinion quietly he looked at the other man with the power we know lies in the god we are his children spreading across his earth pushing back forests to build our cities and houses and our ships and water mills you know what is said in the book of the sons of jad that is new not canonical he managed a smile a little more so than a song of the horned god and the maiden he saw aeldreds mouth quirk they use it as liturgy in esperaña where it was written have begun to do so in batiara and ferrieres now clerics carrying the word of jad to karch and moskav have been told by the patriarch to cite that book carry it with themit is a powerful tool for bringing pagans to the light because it teaches that the world is ours is it ceinion is it ours ceinion shrugged i do not know you cannot imagine how much i do not know but you asked how i make my peace and i am telling you it is a frail peace but that is how i do it he met the other mans gaze he hadnt denied what aeldred had guessed he wasnt going to deny it not to him the kings eyes were clear now his flush had receded the beast dies roaring not the children rhodias succeeded trakesia and sarantium rhodias under jad we are at the edge of the world here but we are children of the god not just of blood silence again slightly altered then the king said i did not expect to be able to speak of this the cleric nodded i can believe that ceinion ceinion i will need you with me surely you can see that even more now the other man tried to smile but failed we will talk of that but before we must pray with all piety we may command that the erling ships sailed for home or if not that your son and his companions pass through the woods and in time i can do that said the king rhiannon wondered often why everyone still looked at her the way they did concern written large vivid as a manuscripts initial capital in their eyes it wasnt as if she spent her days wan and weeping refusing to rise from her bed her mother wouldnt have allowed that in any case or drifting aimlessly about the farmhouse and yard she had been working as hard as anyone else all summer helping to bring brynnfell back from fire and ruin tending to the wounded in the early weeks riding out with her mother to the families of those whod suffered death and loss and taking what steps needed to be taken there she devised activities for herself and helda and eirin ate at table with the others smiled when amund the harper offered a song or when someone said anything witty or wry and still those furtive searching looks came her way by contrast rania had been allowed to leave the youngest of her women with the sweetest voice had been so terrified in the aftermath of the raid that enid and rhiannon had decided to let her go the farmhouse had too many images of burning and blood for rania just now she had left them early in the summer weeping visibly shamed despite their reassurances with the contingent of men who would spend the summer by their castle towards the wall the land there needed defending in summertime there was little love lost between the men of rheden and the cyngael of the hills and valleys north of the woods cattle and horses had been stolen on both sides sometimes the same ones back and forth for as long as anyone could remember that was why rheden had built the wall why brynn and others had castles there not farmhouses her parents were here though attending to brynnfell and its people so rania had gone away and everyone seemed to understand why she had been so distressed to accept it as natural but rhiannon was right here doing whatever needed to be done undeterred by nightmemories of an erling hammer smashing her window or a blade held to her throat in her own rooms by a screaming bloodsmeared man vowing to kill her she made her morning visits to the labourers huts carried food to the men repairing the farmyard structures offered a smile and a word of encouragement with their cheese and ale she attended at chapel twice a day spoke the antiphonal responses in her clearest voice she shirked nothing avoided nothing she just wasnt sleeping at night and surely that was her own affair not shared not proper cause for all those thoughtful glances from helda and her mother besides these past few days as the rebuilding drew to a close and preparations for the harvest began her father seemed to be afflicted in the same way rhiannon rising quietlyas she had been doing all summerstepping past her sleeping women to go out into the yard wrapped in a blanket or shawl to pace along the fence and think about the nature of a persons life and was there something wrong in that had found her father out there before her for three nights now the first two times shed avoided him turning back another way for wasnt he to be allowed his own solitude and thoughts the third night tonight she gathered her green shawl about her shoulders and walked across the yard to where he stood gazing up at the slope south of them under the stars the blue moon a crescent was over west almost down it was very late a breeze tonight she said coming to stand beside him at the gate her father grunted glanced over and down at her he was clad only in his long nightshirt and barefoot as she was he looked away into the darkness a nightingale was singing beyond the cattle pen it had been with them all summer your mothers troubled about you brynn said at length a finger going to his moustache he had trouble with these conversations she knew rhiannon frowned i can see she is im beginning to get angry about it dont you know she leaves you alone usually he glanced at her briefly then away it isnt right for a young girl to be unable to sleep you know she gripped her elbows with both hands why a young girl only why me what about you then just the last few days for me girl its different why because im supposed to go singing through the day brynn chuckled youd terrify everyone if you did she didnt smile smiles shed admit tended to be forced now and in the darkness she didnt feel she had to so why are you awake she asked its different he repeated it was possible he was coming out to meet one of the girls but rhiannon didnt think so for one thing he obviously knew she was in the yard at night everyone seemed to know she didnt like it being watched that way too easy an answer she said a long silence this time longer than she was happy with she looked over at her father the bulky figure more paunch and flesh than muscle now hair silvergrey what was left of it an arrow had been loosed from this slope above them to kill him that night she wondered if that was why he kept looking up at the shrubs and trees on the rise you see anything he asked abruptly she blinked what do you mean up there see anything rhiannon looked it was the middle of the night the trees what you think someones spying on she was unable to keep fear from her voice her father said quickly no no not that nothing like that what then he was silent again rhiannon stared up shapes of trunk and branch bushes black gorse stars above them theres a light brynn said he sighed ive seen a jadcursed light for three nights now he pointed his hand was steady enough a different kind of fear now because there was nothing at all to be seen the nightingale was still singing she shook her head what what kind of light changes its there now he was still pointing blue she swallowed and you think i dont think anything he said quickly i just see it third night have you told who your mother the cleric he was angry not with her she knew she stared into emptiness and dark cleared her throat you you know what some of the farmers say about the our woods over up there i know what they say her father said only that no swearing it frightened her actually she was gazing up the slope and there was nothing there for her she saw her fathers large capable hands gripping the top rail of the fence twisting as if to break the bar off make it a weapon against what he turned his head the other way and spat into the darkness then he unlatched the gate cant keep doing this he said not every night stay and watch me you can pray if you like if i dont come back down tell siawn and your mother tell them what he looked at her shrugged in the way that he had whatever seems right what was she going to do forbid him he swung open the gate went through closed it behind himhabits of a farmyard she watched him begin to climb lost sight of him halfway up the slope he was in his nightshirt she was thinking carried no weapon no iron she knew that that was supposed to matter if this was what they were so carefully not saying it might be she wondered suddenly though not unexpectedly since it happened every night where alun ab owyn was now in the world and if he hated her still she stayed by the gate a long time looking up and she did pray like one of the sleepless ones in the dark for her fathers life and the lives of all those in the house and the souls of all their dead she was still there when brynn came back down something had changed rhiannon could see it even in darkness she was afraid before he spoke come girl her father said reentering through the gate moving past her towards the house what she cried turning to follow what is it we have much to do said brynn ap hywll who had slain siggur volganson long ago i cost us three days not going up before tonight they may be coming back she never asked who they might be or how he knew but with the words she felt a seizure a roiling spasm within herself she stopped clutching at her waist and bent over to throw up what was in her stomach shaking she wiped at her mouth forced herself to straighten she followed her father into the house his voice could be heard roaring an alarm like some halfbeast come down from the trees rousing everyone from sleep everyone but not enough of them too many of his men were north and east days away even as she reentered tasting bile that thought was in her head then another one swift blessedly so for it gave her a pulsebeat of time to anticipate rhiannon her father said wheeling to look at her get the stablehands to saddle your horses you and your mother must ride out to alert the labourers i know then well begin preparing to deal with any wounded what else she stared at him as calmly as she could which was not easy she had just been physically sick her heart was pounding there was sweat cold on her skin no he said that is not it you and your mother will ride to the farm workers then begin preparations here as rhiannon said brynn turned and confronted his wifes steady gaze a man stood behind her holding a torch enid wore a blue night robe her hair was down almost to her waist no one ever saw it that way rhiannon seeing the look exchanged between her parents felt unsettled by the intimacy of it the hallway was filled with people and light she felt herself flush as if caught in the act of reading or hearing words meant for another it occurred to her even in that moment to wonder if she would ever exchange such a glance with anyone before she died enid she heard her father say erlings come for the women you make us weaker not this time they are coming for you husband erlings bane volgans slayer the rest of us are ordinary fare if anyone leaves we should all leave including you brynn drew himself up abandon brynnfell to erlings at this point in my life are you seriously no said his wife i am not that is why we stay how many are coming how much time do we have for a long moment he looked as if he were going to hold his ground but then more than last time i think say eighty of them time im not sure theyll come from llywerth again through the hills we need more men i know castles too far ill send but they wont get back in time what do we have here forty a little less than that if you mean trained to weapons there were two lines on her mothers forehead rhiannon knew them they came when she was thinking enid said well get as many of the farm workers as we can rhiannon and i and their women and children for shelter we cant leave them out there not the women send them north to cwynerth with the young ones theyll be safer away as you saidbrynnfell is what they want and me and the sword his wife said quietly rhiannon blinked she hadnt thought of that likely so her father was saying nodding his head ill send riders to prydllen and cwynerth there should be a dozen men at each for the harvest will they come against erlings theyll come in time i dont know and we defend the farm he was shaking his head not enough men too difficult no they wont expect us to have a warning if were quick enough we can meet them west at a place we choose better ground than here and if you are wrong brynn smiled for the first time that night im not wrong rhiannon listening realized that her mother too had not asked about the warning how brynn knew what he seemed to know she wouldnt ask unless perhaps at night when the two of them were alone some things were not for the light jad ruled the heavens and earth and all the seas but the cyngael lived at the edge of the world where the sun went down they had always needed access to knowledge that went beneath not to be spoken they werent speaking of it her mother was looking at her frowning again doing so that expression everyone had been giving her since the end of spring lets go rhiannon said ignoring it enid her father said as the two women turned away they both looked back at him his face was grim bring every lad over twelve summers with anything at all that might do for a weapon that was too young surely her mother would refuse rhiannon thought she was wrong brand leofson commanding five jormsvik ships as they made their way west knew where he was going hed rowed his first dragonships in the final years of the volgans raids though never with siggurs men had lost his eye in one of those had been recovering at home when the last of the volgans journeys had ended in disaster in llywerth hadnt been there depending on his mood in the intervening years and on how much hed been drinking he either felt fortunate to have missed that catastrophe or cursed not to have been one of thosetheir names were knownwhod been with siggur in the glory years at the end you could say if your mind worked that way that his failure to be in llywerth was a reason he was taking five undermanned ships west now the past what we have done or not done slips and flows like a stream to a carvedout channel into the things we do years after it is never safe or wise to say that anything is over they were at risk he knew it and so would the other captains all the more experienced men here they still had all their ships but theyd lost sixty men if the weather turned it would get bad at sea so far it hadnt on the second night the wind switched to southerly which pushed them closer than he liked to the rocky coast of cadyr but they were erlings mariners knew how to stay clear of a lee shore and when they reached the western end of the cyngael coastline and turned north that wind held with them your danger could become your gift ingavins storms could drown you at seaor terrify your foe on land adding fire and the flash of lightning to your own war cries and the god too brand was always telling himself his private thought had only one eye after his nights on the tree where the world began salt in the air sail full on each ship now stars fading above them as the sun rose brand thought of the volgan and his swordfor the first time in years if truth be told he felt a bonedeep stirring within ivarr ragnarson had been malformed evil and devious had deserved to die but hed had a cleverenough thought or two in his head that one and brand wouldnt be the one to deny it to have turned home with sixty dead and nothing to show for their loss would have been a disaster to come back and report the volgans slayer slain and the sword found and reclaimed that would be something different it could make up for the deaths and more for not having been one of that company twentyfive years ago it had occurred to bern rowing west that there was something unsettling about what he was and how the world saw them all they were erlings riders of the waves laughing at wind and rain knifing through roiling seas yet he himself was one of them and he had no idea what to do in rough weather could only follow directions as best he could and pray the seas did not in fact roil more they were jormsvikings feared through the world as the deadliest fighters under sun and stars and the two moons but bern had never fought a battle in his life only one single combat on the beach below the walls that wasnt a battle it was nothing like a battle what came the thought as they turned north and wind took the sails if all of the others weremore or lesslike him ordinary men no better or worse than others what if it was fear that made men believe the jormsvik mercenaries were deadly they could be beaten after all they had just been beaten aeldreds fyrd had used signal fires and archers brand and garr hoddson had called it cowardly womanish making mock of the anglcyn king and his warriors spitting contempt into the sea bern thought that it would be better to consider learning to use bows themselves if their enemies did then he thought even more privately almost hiding the notion from himself that he really wasnt sure raiding in this way was the life for him he could curse his father again easily enough for it was thorkells exile that had thrust bern into servitude and then off the isle without an inheritance butin sunlit truththat channel of the thoughtstream wasnt so easy any more the farm his inheritance was only theirs because of raiding wasnt it his fathers longsung adventure with siggur in ferrieres a cluster of men burning a royal sanctuary and no one had made bern take halldr thinshanks horse to jormsvik he thought of his mother his sisters on the mainland and then of the young woman at the womans compoundhed never learned her namewhod been bitten by the volurs snake and saved his life because of it partly because of it women he thought would probably see this differently he rowed when ordered rested when the wind allowed took food to gyllir among the other horses standing tethered in the central aisle of the wide ship shovelled horse dung overboard felt a surge of excitement despite everything when they reached the harbour that garr and brand both knew in llywerth no one in sight all along the coast coming north or here they pulled the ships ashore in the hour before dawn and spoke their thanks to ingavin on the beach theyd leave the boats here men to guard themhe might be one of those had no clear sense of how hed feel about that then the others would head inland to find brynnfell and kill a man and claim a sword again you couldnt deny it was matter for skald song through a winter and beyond in the northlands that mattered perhaps everyone shared these doubts he was having bern thought he didnt think so actually looking at his shipmates but it would have been good to have someone to ask he wondered where his father was thorkell had told him not to let them come this way hed tried you couldnt say he hadnt tried he wasnt leading this raid was he and if your life steered you to the dragonships well it steered you there ingavin and thünir chose their warriors and maybemaybehed come out of this with a share of glory his own a name to be remembered men lived and died pursuing that didnt they fair fame dies never was bern thorkellson of rabady isle the one to say they were wrong was he that arrogant bern shook his head drawing a glance from the man next to him on the beach bern looked the other way embarrassed saw beyond the strand the darkly outlined hills of the cyngael knew that the anglcyn lands lay beyond far beyond and farther east across the seas where the sun would rise was home no one he thought travelled as the erlings did no people were so farfaring so brave the world knew it he drew a breath pushed the dark thoughts away from him sunrise came brand leofson picked his men for the raid bern started east with the other chosen ones they had been living for three days on nuts and berries like peasants foraging in a dry season or during a toolong winter with the storeroom empty cafall led them to water so there was that for themselves and the horses it was oppressively dark in the forest even in daytime on occasion a square of sky could be seen through the trees light spilling down a reminder of a world beyond the wood sometimes at night they caught a glimpse of stars once they saw the blue moon and paused in a glade without a word spoken looking up then they went on they were following the dog north and west towards arberthor they had to assume that was so none of them could do more than hazard a guess at where they were how far theyd come how far yet there was to go five days alun had said the passage through the forest might be that too had been a guess no one had ever done this they pushed themselves and the animals hard an awareness of urgency and the equally strong feeling that it was better to keep moving than be still in one place for too long they never again heard or sensed the beastgod that had come the first night or the green creatures of the halfworld that had followed they knew they were here however and when they slept or tried to one always awake on watch the memory of that unseen creature would come back they were intruders here alive only on sufferance it was frightening and wearying one had to work to avoid startling shamefully at sounds in the woodand all forests were full of sounds they knew they had been three nights here but in another way this had become for them a time outside of time athelbert had a vision once almost asleep in the saddle of the three of them coming out to a world entirely changed he didnt know for he didnt speak of this that alun had had that same fear meeting a faerie outside esferth before the fyrd had ridden south through the first two days theyd talked mostly to hear voices human sounds athelbert had amused the others or tried to singing tavern songs invariably bawdy thorkell after extended urging had offered one of the erling sagaverses but the younger men became aware he was doing it only to indulge them by the fourth day they were riding in silence following the grey dog in the gloom near sundown they came to another stream cafall was doing this without urging each one of them was aware that theyd have been lost days ago without aluns dog they didnt speak of this either they dismounted bonetired to let the horses drink dim filtered twilight clink of harness creak of saddle leather crunch and snap of twigs and small branches by the stream and they nearly died again the snake wasnt green it was alun who trod too close athelbert who saw it whipping out his dagger gripping it to throw it was thorkell einarson who snapped a command hold alun dont move the black snakes were poisonous their bite tended to be lethal i can kill it athelbert rasped through clenched teeth alun had frozen where he was in the act of approaching the water one foot was incongruously lifted so that he was poised like some ancient frieze of a runner in one of the villas left behind when the rhodian legions retreated south the snake remained coiled its head moving an easyenough target for someone skilled with a blade i swore an oath thorkell said urgently our lives depend in that same moment alun ab owyn murmured very clearly holy jad defend my soul and sprang into the air he landed in the water with a splash the stream was shallow he came down hard knees and hands on stone and cursed the snake affronted disappeared with a slither and glide into underbrush the bear cub which none of them had seen looked up from the far side of the water where it had been drinking backed away a few steps and essayed a provisional growl in the direction of the man in the stream oh no said athelbert he wheeled cafall barked a high furious warning and streaked past him the mother bear had entered the clearing already roaring her head swinging heavily back and forth she rose on her hind legs huge against the black backdrop of trees spittle and foam at her gaping mouth they were between her and the cub of course they were the horses went wildand they were untethered aluns plunged through the stream thorkell seized the reins of the other two and hung on alun scrambled to his feet splashed over and claimed his trembling horse on the far bankit was blocked there by trees had nowhere to go frantically it tried to rear nearly pulled him off the ground the cub equally frightened backed farther away but was much too close to him athelbert sprinted over to thorkell and the horses fumbling for his bow at the saddle mount up thorkell shouted fighting his way into his own saddle athelbert looked at him do it the erling screamed we are dead if we kill here you know it athelbert swore savagely hooked a leg into a swinging stirrup the horse skittered sideways he almost fell but levered himself up on the far bank alun ab owyn also a horseman clambered on his mount it wheeled and bucked eyes white and staring the bear came forward still roaring it was enormous they had to move past it to get out ill shoot to wound athelbert cried are you mad youll make it wild what is it now the anglcyn prince screamed back jads blood he added very quickly and with extreme necessary skill mastered his rearing mount and leaning far over to one side lashed it past the bear which was almost on top of them thorkell einarson was an erling his people lived for longships white foam a moonlit sea surf on stony strands not for horses he was still struggling to control his spinning terrified steed move alun screamed from the far bank not helpfully there wasnt enough time in the world or room in the glade to move or there wouldnt have been if a lean blurfast grey creature hadnt knifed over and sunk its teeth into the hind leg of the bear the animal roared in rage and pain turned with shocking speed on the dog thorkell kicked his horse in that same moment sawed at his reins and moved following athelbert out alun joined them in that same instant of reprieve splashing across the water cutting out of the glade it was very hard to see a bear was roaring behind them a noise that shook the woods and entangled with it back there was a wolfhound with unspeakable courage and something more than that they were out though all three of them it was far too black and tangled to gallop they moved as quickly as they could along the twisting almostpath a little distance farther they stopped of one accord turned to look back staringready to move if anything remotely bearlike should appear why in the name of everything holy did we keep our weapons if you wont let us use them athelbert was breathing in gasps so was thorkell gripping his reins too tightly in a big fist he turned his head you think you think if we get out of this ingavincursed forest theyll be dancing to greet us what the big man wiped at his face which was dripping with sweat think it im an erling enemy youre an anglcyn enemy that one is the prince of cadyr and were heading for arberth which of us do you think any men we meet will want to kill first there was a silence oh said athelbert he cleared his throat um indeed not dancing ah you id wager youd be first what er shall we bet they heard a sound along the path both men turned dear jad said alun ab owyn quietly he slipped down off his horse walked a few steps back along the way they had come crunching twigs and leaves again then he knelt on the path he was crying although the other two couldnt see that he hadnt cried since the beginning of summer out of shadow and tree the dog limped towards them head low moving with effort it stopped a short distance from alun and lifted its head to look at him there was blood everywhere he saw and in the nearblack he thought an ear was ripped away he closed his eyes a moment swallowed hard come he said a whisper really all he could manage his heart was aching this was his dog and it wasnt it was brynns wolfhound a gift hed accepted it been accepted after a fashion never allowed himself a deeper bond something shared companionship please come he said again and the dog stepped forward slowly the left front paw favoured the right ear was indeed missing alun saw as it drew near and he put an arm around it gently and laid his face carefully against that of the creature which had come to him the night his brothers life and soul were lost thorkell was aware that the dog had saved their lives he wasnt about to get drunk on the thought he and siggur had saved each other at least half a dozen times each way years ago and other companions had guarded him or been saved by him it happened if you went into battle or at sea when storms came once a spear thrust hed not seen had missed him only because hed stumbled over a fallen shipmates body in a field the spear had gone behind him and above hed turned and cut through the spearmans leg from below that one as it happened he remembered the blind chance of it hed never been saved by a dog before he had to acknowledge that the animal was badly hurt which might be a difficulty since they had no hope of getting through the wood without it ab owyn was still on his knees cradling his dog hed known men who treated their hounds like brothers even sleeping with them hadnt thought the cyngael prince was one such on the other hand something extraordinary had happened here he owed his life to it it wasnt quite the same as siggur covering his left side on a raid he looked away feeling unexpectedly awkward watching the man and dog and doing so he saw the green figure among the trees it wasnt far away out of the corner of his eye he registered that athelbert had also seen it was staring in the same direction the curious thing was that this time he didnt feel afraid the anglcyn didnt seem frightened either sitting his horse looking into the trees at a green softly glowing figure it was too far away for details of face or form to be clear the thing looked human or near to being so but a mortal didnt shine couldnt hover over water as these things had done thorkell looked into the darkness at that muted glow after a moment it simply went away leaving the night behind he turned to athelbert i have no least idea what that is the prince said softly thorkell shrugged why should we have an idea he said lets go said alun ab owyn they looked back at him he was on his feet a hand still touching the dog as though reluctant to be parted now can he lead us thorkell asked the dog had at least one bad leg there seemed to be blood not as much as there might have been he can alun said and in the same moment the dog moved ahead of them he turned back and waited for ab owyn to mount up and then started forward limping not going quickly but taking them through the spirit wood towards his home they rode through that night dozing at times in the saddle the horses following the dog they stopped once more for water cautiously alun bathed the dog by that pool washing away blood the animals ear was gone the wound seemed strangely clean to thorkell but how could you say what was strange and what was proper in this place how could you dream of doing so they reached the end of the forest at sunrise it was too soon all three of them knew it they ought not to have been able to get through nearly so quickly athelbert seeing meadow grass through the last of the oaks cried aloud he remembered his thoughts about time passing differently everyone dead the world changed it was a thought but not an actual fear he was aware they all were though they never spoke of it that something out of the ordinary had happened it felt like a blessing he touched the sun disk around his neck why should we have an idea the erling had said it was true they lived in a world they could not possibly comprehend the belief that they did understand was illusion vanity athelbert of the anglcyn carried that as a truth within himself from that time onward there is somethingthere is always somethingabout morning dawns mild light end of darkness and the night they rode out of the trees into arberth and saw the morning sky above green grass and athelbert knewhe knewthat this was their own world and time and that they had come through the godwood alive in four nights we should pray he said a woman screamed it really should have been possible meghan thought indignantly for a girl to crouch and relieve herself in the bushes outside the shepherd hut without having a man on a horse appear right beside to her three men coming from the spirit wood shed screamed at the voice but now a colder fear came as she realized that theyd ridden out of the forest no one went into the wood not even the older boys of their village and farms daring each other drunk would go farther than the first trees in daylight three men a dog with them had just emerged on horses from the woods which meant that they were dead spirits themselves and had come for her meghan stood up adjusting her clothing she would have run but they were on horses they looked back at her oddly as if they hadnt seen a girl before which might be true of ghosts perhaps they looked ordinary enough or if not ordinary at least alive human thenthird shock of a morningmeghan realized that one of them was an erling the riders from brynnfell that had come and taken all the men away with them had spoken of an erling raid there was an erling here looking down at her from his horse becauseof courseher scream had revealed to them where she was peeing in the bushes before seeing to the sheep she was alone bevin had gone with the others to brynnfell yesterday at sunrise her brother would have laughed at her for screaming maybe maybe not with men coming out of the wood armed one of them an erling the first man had spoken in a tongue she didnt know the dogs fur she saw was torn streaked with blood they were still looking at her strangely as though she were someone important the erlings had bloodeagled a girl named elynanother farm girl only thatto the west after the brynnfell fight meghan would have screamed again thinking of that but there was no point no one near them the farmhouses too far and the sheep wouldnt help her child said one of them child we mean you no harm in all the gods sweet world he spoke cyngael meghan drew a breath a cadyri accent they stole cattle and pigs scorned arberth in their songs but they didnt kill farm girls he dismounted stood in front of her not a big man but young handsome actually meghan whose brother said she would get herself in trouble if she wasnt careful decided she didnt really like it that hed called her child she was fourteen wasnt she you could have a child at fourteen that was what her brother meant of course he wasnt here no one was the cadyri said how far are we from brynnfell we must go to them there is trouble coming feeling extremely knowledgeable and not as shy as she probably should have been meghan said we know all about it erlings riders came from brynnfell and took our men with them the three men exchanged glances meghan felt even more important how far is it it was the erling speaking cyngael she looked dubiously at the one standing beside his horse hes a friend he said we must get there how far she thought about it they had horses you can be there before dark she said up the swale and back down and pretty much west point us to the path the erling said cafall will know said the cyngael quietly the third one hadnt spoken since his voice had made her scream his eyes were closed meghan realized he was praying did you really come out of the forest she had to ask it was the wonder at the heart of this it made the world different bevin and the others would not believe her when she told them the one standing in front of her nodded how long ago did your menfolk leave yesterday morning she said you might almost catch them up on horse the one who seemed to be praying opened his eyes the one on the ground swung back into the saddle pulled at his reins they left without another word the three of them the dog not looking back at her meghan watched until they were out of sight after she had no idea what to do with herself she wasnt used to being here aloneyesterday had been the first time ever the sun rose as if declaring it was just another day meghan felt tingly though all strange eventually she went back to the hut and built up the fire she made and ate her morning pottage and then went to count the sheep all morning all day she kept seeing them in her mind those three riders hearing what theyd said already it was beginning to feel too much like a dream which she didnt like she felt as if she needed to root it in herself like a tree make it real meghan mer gower told the story all her life only not the part about how shed been squatting to pee when they came out of the trees given what followed who the three of them had turned out to be even bevin had to believe her which was very satisfying half a century later it was gweith her grandsonhaving heard his grandmothers story all his dayswho took thought one autumn morning after a fire had destroyed half the houses in the village after he walked south cap in hand to the sanctuary at ynant and spoke with the clerics there asking their blessing for what he was of a mind to do it was not the sort of thing you did without a blessing he received more than that fifteen clerics from ynant yellowrobed most of them unhandy in the extreme came walking with him back to the village the next morning they offered the dawn invocation and then with all the villagers gathered to watch in awe and wonder the clerics began to helpafter a fashionas gweith set about cutting down the first trees at the edge of the spirit wood some of the other young men joined them they were more useful gweith didnt die nor did anyone else no one was stricken with palsy or dropsy or fever in the days that followed neither were the clerics though many of them did complain of blistered hands and muscle pains men began taking axes to the wood at about that same time in the way of such things where an idea a notion reaches the world in many places at once the same forest in the anglcyn lands was entered into by men in search of urgently needed wood they brought their axes to the trees west of esferth and farther south beyond retherly towards where the young king had ordered a new shipyard and burh to be built a growing kingdom needed lumber there was no getting around it at a certain point in the name of jad you couldnt let old womens tales stop you from doing what had to be done none of the first woodcutters on that side of the wood died either except for those suffering the usual accidents attendant upon sharp blades and falling trees and carelessness it began it continued the world does not stay the way it was ever years after all of this a great many years actually an anglcyn charcoal burner at what had become the southeastern edge of a considerably reduced forest came upon something curious it was a hammeran erling battle hammerlying in the grass by a small pond the odd thing was that the hammers head clearly ancient gleamed as if newly forged unrusted and the wood of the shaft was smooth when the charcoal burner picked it up he swore he heard a sound something between a note of music and a cry actions ripple in so many ways and for so long fifteen kendra would remember the days before and during the fair that year as the most disconnected shed known intensity of joy intensity of fear the fyrd had been home for two nights after riding in loud triumph through the wideopen gates of esferth amid shouts and cheering and music playing the city was thronged with merchants there could not have been a better time for aeldred to achieve such a victory over the erlings slain in numbers driven away no losses at all for the anglcyn if you didnt count a prince gone into the godwood riding up the main street from the gates a screaming colourful crowd on either side her father had waved smiled gravely let the people see a king calmly aware of achievement and as calmly set on repeating it as often as necessary let his subjects know this and let all who were here from abroad carry word back to their homes kendra with her mother and sister and brother the one brother here in front of the great hall had looked at her father as hed dismounted and shed knownright thenthat he was dissembling athelbert outweighed sixty erlings killed by so much there had been searaids for a hundred years and they would not stop with this one but the king of the anglcyn had only two sons whod survived infancy and the older was gone now into a deadly place and the younger they all knew had never wanted to be a king truth be told it was judit thought kendra beside her redhaired sister on the steps who ought to have been a boy at birth and now a man judit could have sat a throne incisive and confident in the fierce brightness of her spirit she could have wielded a sword she did wield swords commanded the fyrd drunk ale and wine and mead all night and walked steadily away from a trestle table at dawn when all those who had been with her lay snoring amid cups judit knew this too kendra thought she knew she could have done these things instead she was going off this winter escorted by most of the court to marry a thirteenyearold boy and live among the people of rheden to bind them close for that is what young women in royal families were born to do things went awry sometimes kendra thought and there was no one to give her a good answer why jad had made the world that way theyd feasted that night heard music watched jugglers and tumblers perform the rituals of victory theirs were lives on display to be seen more of the same at sunrise at chapel to pray then she and judit dutiful just now more shaken than shed want to admit by what athelbert had done had made a point of walking through the thronged ropedoff marketplace three separate times to be seen fingering fabrics and brooches theyd made gareth come with them the third time hed been quiet extremely so judit bought a jewelled knife and a gelding from alrassan kendra bought some fabrics she made her way through the duties of the day with difficulty then after the evening rites she went looking for someone she had questions that needed answering ceinion of llywerth had not been at the royal chapel for the sundown services there were a small number of cyngael merchants here for the fair theyd come along the same coastal path he had or been granted passage through the rheden wall she found the cleric with his own people at a chapel on the eastern side of esferth leading the rites there he had just finished when aeldreds younger daughter arrived with one of her women in attendance they waited until the cleric was done talking with some of the merchants and then kendra had her woman withdraw and she sat down with the greyhaired cleric towards the front of the old chapel near the disk it needed polishing she noticed shed tell someone tomorrow ceinions eyes she thought were curiously like her fathers alert and just as unsettling when you had something you wanted to hide she wasnt here to hide she wouldnt be here if she were hiding princess he said calmly and waited i am afraid she said he nodded his face was kind smoothshaven less lined than was usual for a man his age he was small and trimly formed not a ladentable winecup cleric like the other one here from ferrieres her father had told them some time ago before the first visit that this man was one of the most learned scholars in the world that the patriarch in rhodias sought his views on clashes of doctrine in some ways it was hard to creditthe cyngael lived so cut off from the world many of my people are greatly afraid just now he said you are generous to share it with us your father has been very good sending a ship to arberth messengers to the rheden wall we can only hope no she said that isnt it she looked at him i knew when alun ab owyn entered the wood with my brother and the erling a silence she had shaken him she saw he made the sign of the disk that was all right shed have done the same you you see spirits he was very direct she shook her head well once i did one of them a few nights ago that isnt what i from the time you came across the river the other morning when we were lying on the grass she heard herself sounding like a child this was so difficult he nodded well from that time i i cant explain this well but i knew ab owyn the prince i could read things in him know where he was dear jad whispered the high cleric of the cyngael what is it that is coming among us what do you mean she asked he was looking at her but not with eyes that spoke denunciation or disbelief strange things are happening he said not just to me she was extremely determined not to cry not just to you child to him and others others he nodded hesitated then moved a hand sideways back and forth he wasnt going to say clerics she thought were good at not telling what they didnt want to tell but hed already said something and shed needed to know it so much she wasnt alone or going mad he swallowed and now she did see a hint of fear which frightened her in turn she knew what he was going to ask before he spoke do you see him now where they are she shook her head not since they went in ive been having dreams though i thought maybe you could help me oh child i have so little help to give in this i am enmeshed in fears youre the only person i can think of her fathers eyes very nearly ask me then he said it was quiet here everyone had gone except the aged cleric of the chapel straightening candles at a sidealtar near the door and her own woman in a far row waiting this chapel was one of the oldest in esferth the wood of the benches and flooring worn smooth with years it was dark where the lamps didnt reach softly lit where they did a feeling of calm or there ought to have been kendra thought what can you tell me she asked about the volgans sword the ambit of a womans life could not be said to be very wide but how wide might it be for the majority of men alive on the gods earth struggling to feed themselves and their families to be warm in winter or sheltered from the sandstorms in the south safe from war and disease searaiders and creatures in the night the book of the sons of jad more and more widely used in chapels now even here in the cyngael lands taught that the world belonged to the mortal children of the god saying so in words that were incantation eloquent and triumphant it was difficult for meirion mer ryce to believe this to be true if they were all the glorious children of a generous god why did some of them end up bloodeagled soaked in blood ripped apart though they had only been a girl walking back from pasture with brimming pails after milking the two cows on a morning at the end of spring it was wrong thought meirion defiantly remembering her sister as she did every single time coming back from the milking in the mist before dawn elyn was not a person who ought to have died that way it wasnt what life should have held for someone like her meiri knew she wasnt wise enough to understand such things and she knew what the cleric in the village had been telling them over and again since summer began but cyngael women were not particularly submissive or deferential and if meirion had been asked by someone she trusted to describe what she really felt she would have said she was enraged no one ever asked no one was trusted so much but the anger was there each day every night listening for sounds that never came now from the empty pallet along the adjacent wall and it was with her when she rose in darkness to dress and go past the bed where elyn wasnt any more to do the milking her sister used to do her mother had wanted to take the pallet apart make more space in the small hut meiri hadnt let her though lately as summer had turned towards harvest and autumn a chill now some nights shed begun thinking she might do it herself one afternoon after work was done shed choose a clear day when flame and smoke could be seen a long way and shed burn the bedding on the sunbrowned tor above the fields as a memorial not enough no remotely adequate answer to loss and helpless fury but what else was there elyn hadnt been a noblewoman or a princess there was no consecrated place in the vault of a sanctuary for her bones no carved words above or image on stone no harp songs she wasnt heledd or arianrhod lost and lamented shed been only a farmers daughter in the wrong place one toodark predawn hour raped and carved open by an erling and what was there that a sister could make for her remembering a song meiri didnt know music or even how to write her own name she was a girl unmarried no man to fight for her living with her parents near the border between llywerth and arberth what was she going to do take fierce and fell revenge intervene in some battle strike a blow against erlings in the event she did do that sometimes despite all the weight of likelihood we can it is a part of the mystery of the world and needs to be understood that way in an hour before sunrise at the end of that summer meirion heard sounds muffled in mist to her right as she made her way home along the worn grassy path from the summer pasture the path ran parallel to the road from llywerth though to call it a road was somewhat to overstate roads werent much a part of the cyngael provinces they cost a great deal in resources and labour and if you made a road it was easier to be attacked along it better times being what they were to live with some difficulty of travel and not smooth the way for those who meant you ill the rough path south of her running past their farm and the hamlet was one of the main routes to and from the sea however cutting through a gap in the dinfawr hills to the west and continuing east below the woods along the north bank of the aber thats why elyn had died people passed too near them all the time going east and west thats why meirion stopped now and carefully quietly set down her neck yoke with the brimming pails on either side she left it in the grass stood a moment listening horse hooves harness creak of leather clink of iron there was no good reason for armed horsemen to be on this path before sunrise her first thought was a cattle raid llywerth outlaws or noblemen crossing into arberth her village tried to stay out of these affairs they didnt have enough cattle enough of anything to be a target for raiders better to let them go by both ways know nothing or as little as possible if pursuit came after either way with questions asked shed have gone quietly back along her own path walking home with the morning milk if she hadnt heard voices she didnt understand the wordswhich was the point of course she would have if these men had been from llywerth they werent they were speaking erling and meiris sister fiercely loved had been slain and defiled by one of them at the beginning of summer she didnt go home anger can channel fear sometimes master it meiri knew this land as she knew the tangles of her own brown hair she crouched down leaving the milk behind in the path a fox found it later in the day drank its fill in the greyness she moved towards the voices and the trail after a bit she went on her belly among the grass and scrub and wriggled closer she didnt know anything about how erlings or anyone else arranged themselves on a marchandride so it was good fortune more than anything else that no outriders were sweeping the scrubland north of the trail much of what happens in a life turns on good fortune or bad which unsettles as much as it does anything else what she saw peering through brambles was a company of erlings some horsed more of them afoot stopped to talk barely visible in the darkness and notyetlifted fog what she heard was brynnfell twice unmistakably the name springing at her from snapped and snarled words that made no sense at all over the hammering of her blood she knew what she needed to know she started to wriggle backwards on knees and elbows heard something behind her froze where she was not breathing she didnt pray ought to have of course but was too bonefrightened the lone horseman continued moving passing just behind where she lay she heard him cut down beyond the bushes shed been peering through and rejoin the company on the road any raiding party had outriders especially in hostile country where you werent sure of your way a dog would have found her but the erlings had no dogs meirion fought a desire to stay where she was motionless forever or until they went away she heard the riders dismount the river was close here just to the south they might be stopping for water and food she wanted that listening carefully behind her as well now she crawled backwards regained her own path left the milk where it was and began to run she knew where these raiders were going and what needed to be done she wasnt certain if the men in the fields would listen to her she was prepared to kill someone to make them do so she didnt have to sixteen farmers and farmhands and tenyearold derwyn ap hwyth who never let himself be left behind set off before the sun was fully up running east to brynnfell taking the old track that one stopped at their forest it was a known and tamed wood though source of kindling and building logs and there was a trail that would bring them out eventually near brynn ap hywlls farm meirions father whose bad leg meant he couldnt keep up took the one horse in the village and went north to penavy found twelve men working by there said what needed to be said they too went running straight from the harvest fields seizing whatever came to hand that was sharp and could be carried for a day and a night at speed almost thirty men meirions response not trained fighters but hardy knowing the land and filledeach one of themwith anger bright and cold as a winter sun this wasnt a vast invading fleet of dragonprows from erling lands this was a raid skulking through their land they would fear the northmen always but they would not run from them it was crippled ryces daughter his surviving daughter who had come upon the raiders and carriedlike a queen of legendneedful tidings back of where they were bound a woman of the cyngael worthy of song and they all knew in the lands and villages around what had been done to her sister they would reach brynnfell half a day before the erlings did the afternoon of the day she saw the raiders meirionin a frenzy born of waitingtook elyns pallet apart she began to carry the straw and bedding up the tor her mother and the other women saw what she was doing and set themselves to help gathering wood arranging it on the flat summit all of them working women walking up and down the hill late in the day the sun westering and the last crescent of the blue moon rising no moons at all tomorrow they lit a bonfire there for elyn only a girl no one important at all by any measure you might ever think to use bern could not shake a premonition death hovering like some dark bird one of ingavins ravens waiting fog among encroaching hills sounds muffled vision limited even when day broke and the mist lifted that sense of oppression of a waiting stillness in the land lingered he felt they were being watched they probably were though they saw no one this was a strange land bern thought different from any hed known and they were moving away from the sea he had no illusions of being prophetic of any kind of truesight or knowing he told himself this was no more than apprehension hed never been in a battle and they were heading towards one but it wasnt fear it really wasnt he had memories of fear the night before his jormsvik fight hed lain beside a prostitute hadnt slept at all listened to her untroubled breathing hed been quite certain it was the last night hed know fear had been within him then there was something different now he was wrapped in a sense of strangeness something unknown fog in these hills and the nature of the lives men lived his father entangled in it much as he might want to deny that denial would be a lie simple as that thorkell had told him not to let them sail to the cyngael lands brand had killed the last of the volgans for his deception yet here they were now on the quest ivarr had tried to deceive them into taking on brand oneeye and the other leaders had seized upon ivarrs idea vengeance and the volgans sword a way out of humiliation so they were doing what hed wanted them to do even though theyd killed him for it and tossed him to the sea it could make you feel things had gone awry brand had spoken of it calmly enough sailing west and then north with the wind to where theyd beached how this was a bad time for them to suffer defeat was there a good time bern had wondered how claiming the sword would be a triumph hewn brilliantly out of failure and defeat a talisman against ambitious men in the north who thought they could be king and impose their will upon the jormsvikings bern wasnt so sure it seemed to him that these named reasons were covering something else that brand leofson was wishing hed thought of ivarrs quest himself that what the oneeyed man was seeing in his mind was glory that would be fair enough ordinarily what else as the skalds sang to harp by hearth fire all winter was there for the brave to seek wealth dies with a man his name lives ever ingavins halls were for warriors ripe pliant maidens with red lips and yellow hair did not offer mead and themselves to farmers and smiths at the golden tables of the gods but his father had told them not to come this way they werent even certain where they were going in these hills and narrow valleys brand and carsten had known the harbour from years before but neither of them nor garr hoddson had ever been as far inland as brynnfell theyd started east thirty riders sixty on foot fifty left to the ships to get them offshore if they were found scarcely enough for that bern had thought but he was one of the youngest here what did he know carsten had urged a fast outandback raid with just the horsemen since they were only going to kill one man and find one thing brand and garr had disagreed ap hywlls farm would be defended theyd have to go more slowly with men on foot a larger force bern on gyllir was one of the horsemen sweeping both sides of the path just a track really as they went they saw no one a good thing you might have said preserving their secrecybut bern couldnt shake the feeling that others were seeing them they didnt belong heresomehow the land would know itand the sea their real haven was farther away every moment on the second day going through a range of hills in a drizzle of rain one of the outriders had found a woodcutter and brought him back hands tied behind him running before the horse at swordpoint the man was small dark raggedly clothed his teeth were rotting he didnt speak erling none of them spoke cyngael they hadnt expected to be here hadnt chosen any of those who did know the tongue this was supposed to have been a raid on undefended anglcyn burhs thats what ivarr had paid them for they tried talking to the woodcutter in anglcyn which should have been close enough the man didnt know that language either hed soiled himself in terror bern saw brand impatient edgy angry now had drawn his sword seized the mans left arm and sliced his hand off at the wrist the woodcutter hair plastered with rain drenched in his sweat and stink had stared blankly at the stump of his wrist brynnfell brand had roared in the falling rain brynnfell where the woodcutter had looked up at him a moment vacanteyed then fainted dead away brand had sworn savagely spat looked around as if for someone to blame garr scowling put a sword through the cyngael where he lay theyd moved on the rain continued to fall berns feeling of oppression had begun to grow then theyd travelled through the evening stopping only briefly at night they heard animals moving owls overhead and in the trees on the slopes around saw nothing at all before morning theyd come out of the hills into more open lowlands though the mist was still there there would be farms here but brand thought brynns was another day away at least he was going by halfremembered stories they made a stop before dawn doled out provisions drank at the river just south of them moved on as the sun came up bern thought of his father mending a barn door on rabady a sunset hour glory it occurred to him might come at a heavy price it might not be the thing for every man he leaned forward patted gyllir on the neck they continued east a forest appearing north of them the river murmuring south running beside their path and then turning away bern didnt like the secretive greengrey closeness of this land the sun went down the last crescent of the blue moon was in front of them and then overhead and then behind they stopped for another meal continued through the night they were mercenaries of jormsvik could do without sleep for a night or two to gain the advantages of surprise and fear speed was the essence of a raid you landed struck left death and terror took what you wanted and were gone if you couldnt do that you didnt belong you shouldnt be on the dragonships you were as soft as those you came to kill you might as well be a farmer or a smith it was a brighter morning at least they seemed to have left the mists behind they went on late in the day with a breeze and white clouds overhead they were met by brynn ap hywll and a company of men at a place where they were moving up a slope and the cyngael were waiting above them not soft not surprised or afraid looking up bern saw his father there alun didnt see ivarr ragnarson the sun was behind the erlings forcing him to squint brynn had taken the higher ground but the light might become a problem the numbers were close and they had twenty men in reserve hidden on either side of the slope the erlings had horsemen twentyfive or so he guessed they werent the best riders in the world but horses made a difference and these were jormsvikings they were about to face with a company that was mostly farm labourers it was better than it might have been but it wasnt good the erlings had stopped at first sight of them aluns instinct would have been to charge while the horses were halted use the downslope to effect but brynn had given orders to wait alun wasnt sure why he found out soon enough ap hywll called out the big voice carrying down the slope hear me you have made a mistake you will not get home your ships will be taken before you return to them we had warning of your coming he was speaking in anglcyn that is a lie a oneeyed man easily as big as brynn moved his horse forward battles began this way in the tales alun thought challenge counterchallenge speeches for the harpers this wasnt a tale he was still scanning the erlings for the man he needed to kill brynn had the same thought it seemed you know it is true or we wouldnt be here with more men than you have surrender ivarr ragnarson and give hostages and youll sail alive from these shores i shit upon that the big man shouted and then ragnarsons dead anyhow alun blinked he looked at thorkell einarson beside him the redbearded erling was staring at the opposing forces his own people how so brynn cried how is he dead by my blade at sea for deceiving us amazingly brynn ap hywll threw his head back and laughed the sound was startling utterly unexpected no one spoke or moved brynn controlled himself then what in jads name are you doing here come to kill you the other man said his face had reddened at the laughter are you ready to find your god a silence late afternoon late summer late in life really for both of the men speaking now ive been ready a long time said brynn gravely i dont need a hundred men to go with me tell me your name brand leofson of jormsvik you lead this company i do they accept that what does that mean they will follow orders you give kill any man who doesnt of course you will very well you leave two ships to us twenty hostages of our choosing and all your weapons the rest of you will be allowed to go i will send a rider to llywerth and another to prince owyn in cadyrthey will let you leave i cannot speak to what will happen when you sail past the anglcyn coast two ships the erlings voice was incredulous we never leave hostages you shitsmeared fool we never leave our ships then the ships will be taken when you die in these lands you will never leave any of you decide i am not of a mind to talk his voice was cold now one of the erlings came forward on foot stood by the stirrup of the oneeyed man they whispered together alun looked at thorkell again saw that the other man was gazing over at brynn how do we know you arent lying about llywerth and cadyr how would they know about us it was the second erling standing by the one named leofson a horseman twitched his reins and moved forward to sit his mount beside brynn you know because i tell you it is true we rode through the spirit wood three of us to bring warning of your coming here through the spirit that will be a lie who are the erling fell silent hed sorted the answer to his own question it was the accent alun realized the flawless courtly anglcyn tones my name is athelbert son of aeldred said the young man beside brynn who had ridden with them through the godwood to serve a cause that wasnt his own our fyrd killed sixty of you i will be unspeakably happy to add to that number here my father has sent a ship from drengest right behind yours with a warning for cadyr they will have had it days ago while you were coming here ap hywll speaks truth if we do not send to stop them the cyngael will take your ships or drive them offshore and you will have nowhere to go you are dead men where you stand jormsvik will never be the same they will mock your names forever you cannot possibly imagine the pleasure it gives me to say these words a murmuring among the erling host below them alun heard anger but no fear he hadnt expected to he saw some of them begin to draw blades and axes with a hard fierce sense of need he unsheathed his sword it had come it had finally come wait said thorkell quietly beside him theyre drawing weapons alun rasped i see it wait they will win this fight they will not trust me they will ap hywll knows it too numbers are close but they have horsemen and fighters brynn has his thirty men but the rest are farmers with scythes and sticks think his voice carried towards the front later alun decided he had meant it to do so brynn turned his head slightly they know they cannot leave these shores alive he said softly i think they do thorkell einarson said still quietly speaking cyngael it wont matter they cannot give you hostages or ships and go back to jormsvik they will die first so we fight kill enough of them so that tomorrow or the next and what will your wives and mothers say and the fathers of these two princes thorkell never raised his voice brynn turned around alun saw his eyes in the lateafternoon light they will say that the erlings accursed of jad and the world slew yet more good men before their time they will say what they have always said there is a way out brynn stared at him i am listening he said alun felt the breeze blowing making their banners snap we challenge him thorkell said he wins they are allowed to leave he loses they yield the two ships and hostages you just said they cannot surrender ships they can lose a fight honour requires they deal fairly then they will this is jormsvik that difference matters enough thorkell nodded always has good said brynn after a moment smiling good i fight him if he will do it looking back alun remembered that four people said no at the same moment and he was one of them but the voice that continued when the others stopped in surprise was a womans no she said again alun turned they all did on the side slope quite close in fact on horseback were the lady wife and the daughter of brynn ap hywll he saw rhiannon saw her looking at him and his heart thumped a barrage of memories and images falling like arrows from the bright sky it was the mother who had spoken brynn was gazing at her she shifted her mount to come forward among them i told you to stay at home he said mildly enough i know you did my lord chastise me after but hear me first the challenge is proper i heard what he said but it is not yours this time it has to be mine enid they came to kill me and must not be allowed the pleasure my dear you are the summit and glory of all men living i like the sound of that said brynn ap hywll i imagine you do said the lady enid you are vain it is a sin you are also i grieve to tell you old and shortwinded and fat i am not fat i am you are and your left knee is aching as we speak and your back is stiff each day by this hour hes old too that oneeyed captain carries his years hes a raider my lord it was thorkell i know the name he is still a fighting man my lord what she says is truth are you here to shame me wife are you saying i cannot defeat my love three princes and their sons stood aside for you twentyfive years ago i see no reason why do not leave me said enid not this way alun heard birdsong the doings of men here the wrack and storm of them hardly mattering at all it was a summers day the birds would be here when this was over one way or another brynn was gazing at his wife she dismounted without assistance and knelt on the grass before her husband brynn cleared his throat it was athelbert who broke the stillness he twitched his reins and moved towards the erlings down the slope a little way hear me we are told that you cannot surrender the ships you must understand you are going to die if so a challenge is now offered you choose a man we do the same if you are victorious you will be permitted to sail from here and if we lose they were going to accept alun knew it before theyd even heard the terms it was in the quickened voice of the oneeyed captain these were mercenaries bought to fight not berserkirs lusting after death he was feeling something strange a circling of time three princes and their sons his father had been one of those sons twentyfive years ago aluns age very nearly brynn had been too what was unfolding here felt as if it were part of a skein spun back to that strand in llywerth athelbert was speaking again you forfeit two ships your weapons including those on the ships and ten hostages as surety to be released in the spring not a surrender a challenge lost how do we get home without weapons if we meet anyone at all then you had best win hadnt you and hope you dont encounter my fathers ships accept now or fight us here accepted said brand leofson even faster than alun had thought he would aluns heart was beating hard now it had come he was thinking of dai of course ragnarson was dead but there was an erling raider below them with a sword the skein was spun he drew a steadying breath his turn to twitch reins move his horse forward towards the destiny that had been shaped for him at the end of spring ill do it said thorkell einarson alun pulled up his horse looked quickly back i know you will said brynn very softly i suppose thats why jad led you here alun opened his mouth to protest found he had no words reached for them urgently thorkell was looking at him an unexpected expression in his eyes think of your father he said and then turning away prince athelbert have i leave to use the sword you gave me in the wood athelbert nodded did not speak alun wondered if he looked as young as the anglcyn did just now he felt that way a child again allowed passage among the men like the tenyearold who had joined them with the farmers from the west thorkell swung down from his horse not a hammer brynn asked brisk now not in single combat this is a good blade will you suffer a cyngael helm if it doesnt split because of cheap workmanship brynn ap hywll didnt return the smile its my own he took it off handed it across i am honoured said the other man he put it on armour thorkell looked down the slope were both in leather leave it be he turned to the woman still kneeling on the grass i thank you for my life my lady i have not lived a life deserving of gifts after this you will have said brynn gruffly his wife looked at the redbearded erling made no reply brynn added you see his eye how to use that kill him for me thorkell looked at him shook his head ruefully the world does strange things to a man if he lives long enough i suppose said brynn because you are fighting for us for me thorkell nodded i loved him nothing was ever the same after he died alun looked at athelbert who was looking back at him neither said a word the birds were singing all around them who fights for you shouted the big erling down the slope he had dismounted and come up alone halfway to where they were hed put on his helmet i do said thorkell he started down a murmur rose from below when they saw it was an erling alun saw that enid was wiping at tears with the back of one hand rhiannon had come up beside her mother he still didnt have his own hearts beating under anything like control think of your father how had he known to say that bern watched his father coming down he had been staring in disbelief from the moment they saw the cyngael thorkell was easy to see he always had been half a head taller than most men with the red banner of his beard so the son had known without hearing a word spoken but watching the telltale gestures of the men above them that it had been thorkell who had spoken of single combat when battle had been upon them so many of the stories told and sungall the way back to siferth and ingeld in the snowwere of single combat glory and death what brighter way to find either of them hed heard others beside him calculating swiftly trying to decide if there were cyngael hidden behind the slopes either side and if so how many bern had no sense of such things could only register what hed heard they could win this fight it was judged but would take losses especially if there were arrows among those in reserve and they wouldnt leave these lands they had understood that from the moment the anglcyn princeimpossibly here among themsaid what he did bern had had those premonitions of disaster on the longship coming here and all the way through the black hills east it seemed he might have more claim to foresight than hed ever thought not the best time to discover that then the anglcyn prince came forward a second time and offered the challenge it would be easy to hate that voice that man bern thought terse muttering beside him experienced men if they gave up their weapons they might as well be naked one said heading back through a hostile land then trying to get home rowing into the wind desperately vulnerable to anyone they met with aeldreds ships waiting for them without weapons they couldnt winter over either it was a challenge that offered the illusion of survival if they lost not more than that but they were dead if they did battle here win or lose brand you can slice the fat man apart he heard garr hoddson rasp do it we get home and youll have killed brynn ap hywll why we came brynn ap hywll bern looked up at the volgans slayer erlings bane he was an old man brand could do it he thought remembering the speed of leofsons blade looking at the hard scarred tautness of him he would save them as a leader should there was a window opening bern thought brand shouted accepted and drew his sword then he cried who fights for you and the window closed bern heard his father say i do and saw him start down towards where brand was waiting the setting sun made a firebrand of thorkells beard and hair they were so far bern thought looking up at him from the barn and field on rabady but the lightthe light now was the same as on evenings he remembered neither man was young both had done this before combat could start a battle or avert it and there was fame for the winning even if this was a skirmish a raid not a war they approached each other both eyeing the ground in no obvious haste to begin brand leofson smiled thinly were on a slope want to move to flatter ground the other manbrand had a vague sense he ought to know himshrugged same for both might as well be here the two swords were the same length though brands was heavier than the others anglcyn blade they were both big men of a height pretty much brand judged he had several years advantage still he was disconcerted to be facing another erling it was unexpected just about everything on this ingavincursed raid had been what did they do promise to free you if you won the other was still looking around at the grass gauging it he shrugged a second time indifferently i imagine they might do that but it didnt come up i suggested this actually hungry for death the other man met his gaze for the first time he was still higher up looking down brand didnt like it resolved to do something about that as soon as they started it comes for us no need to be hungry is there one of those it seemed not the sort of man brand liked good made this even easier he took a few more moments to do what the other was doing noted a fallen branch to his left a depression in the ground behind it he looked at the other man again you suggested it did me a service then this has been the worst voyage i know i was with aeldred when they butchered you its because of ragnarson ill luck in the man you really killed him on my ship should have turned home then didnt someone tell you to a good leader cuts losses before they grow brand blinked then swore who in thünirs name are you to tell me what a leader does im a jormsvik captain who are you thorkell einarson only that and brand knew of course he knew strangeness piled on strangeness red thorkell this one was in the songs had rowed with siggur his companion one of those on the ferrieres raid when theyd found the sword the sword brand had come to regain well that wasnt about to happen a weaker man he told himself would have been disturbed by this revelation brand wasnt he refused to make too much of it all that history just meant the other man was older than hed guessed good again will they honour the terms he asked not commenting on the name or showing any reaction it was on his mind though how could it not be the cyngael theyre angry have been since the raid here you kill anyone on the way no one oh well one woodcutter the redbeard shrugged again one isnt so much brand spat cleared his throat we didnt know how to get here i told you a terrible raid worst since a time in karch that was deliberately told let this one know brand leofson had been about too something occurred to him you were the volgans oarmate what are you doing fighting for the pig who killed him a good question not the place to answer it brand snorted you think well find a better place no einarson had courteously moved down and to one side so they stood level on the slope facing each other he lifted his blade pointing to the sky in salute the conversation evidently was over an arrogant bastard a pleasure to kill him im going to slice you apart brand saidhoddsons words a moment ago he liked the ring of them he returned the salute einarson seemed unruffled brand needed more from him he was trying to work himself into anger the fury that had him fighting his best you arent good enough thorkell einarson said that would help oh want to see old man i suppose im about to youve charged your companions with what you want done with your body have you a request of me courtesy again erling ritual he was doing everything properly and brand was beginning to hate him it was useful he shook his head i am ready for what comes ingavin watch now and watch over me who guards your soul einarson the jaddite god another good question the redhaired man hesitated for the first time then smiled a curious expression no habits die hard after all with that same odd look on his face he said exactly as brand had done i am ready for what comes ingavin watch now and watch over me and whatever all that meant brand didnt know nor did he care someone had to start you could kill a man at the start they were only wearing leather he feinted a thrust and cut low on his backhand if you took someone in the leg he was finished a favourite attack done with power blocked it began what he knew of fighting he knew from his father a handful of lessons as hed grown through boyhood offered irregularly without notice or warning at least twice when thorkell had been suffering the aftereffects of stumbling at dawn out of a tavern hed grab swords helms gloves order his son to follow him outside something in the way of a fathers duty was the sense of it there were things bern needed to know thorkell told them or showed them briskly not lingering to amplify then had bern take the weapons and armour back in while he carried on himself with whatever else needed tending to on a given day a sons footwork as importantnot necessarily more soas a milk goats bad foot you noted your opponents weapon looked to see if he had more than one studied the ground the sun kept your own blade clean had at least one knife on you always because there were times when weapons could clash and shatter if you were very strong you could use a hammer or an axe but they were better in battle not individual combat and bern was unlikely to grow big enough for them hed do better to be aware of that work at being quick you kept your feet moving always his father had said nothing ever in the tone bern remembered beyond simple observation and observation simple or otherwise was the underlying note to all the terse words spoken bern had killed a jormsvik captain with these injunctions in his head judging the other man to be hottempered overconfident too full of himself for caution riding a lesssure horse than gyllir bern was a rider gyllir his advantage you watched the other his father had said learned what you could either before or while you fought bern watched the lateday light was uncannily clear after the mist of the mornings through which theyd come to this ending the two men circling each other engaging breaking to circle again were etched by brilliant light nothing shrouded now you could see every movement every gesture and flex his father was years removed from fighting days had the bad shoulder his mother used to rub liniment into it at night and a hip that nothing really helped in wet weather brand was harder still a raider quicker than such a big man ought to be but had the bad covered eye he also bern realized after the two men had exchanged half a dozen clashes and withdrawals did something when he tried a certain attack bern was watching saw it his father had taught him how his father was fighting for his life bern felt unsteady lightheaded couldnt do anything about that jads blood hes too old to keep parrying he needs to win quickly brynn was at aluns side swearing and exclaiming in a steady ferocious undertone his own body twisting with the two men fighting below alun didnt see either man faltering yet or any obvious opportunities to end it quickly thorkell was mostly retreating trying to keep from being forced below the other man on the slope the jormsvik leader was very fast and alun was putting real effort into resisting a deeply private shaming awareness of relief he wasnt at all sure he could have matched this man in fact hah again see it see because of the eye what alun glanced quickly at brynn turns his head left before he cuts on the backhand to follow his line he gives it away holy god of the sun thorkell has to see that alun hadnt noticed it he narrowed his gaze to concentrate watch for what brynn had said but in that same moment he began to feel something strange a pulsing a presence inexplicable even painful inside his head he tried to thrust it away attend to the fight the details of it green kept impinging though the colour green and it wasnt the grass or the leaves rhiannon watching two men fight was dealing with something so new to her she couldnt identify it at first it took her some moments to understand that what she was contending with was rage a fury white as waves in storm black as a piledup thundercloud no shading to it no nuance at all anger consuming her her hands were clenched she could kill it was in her she wanted to kill someone right now we should not have come her mother said softly we make them weaker not what she wanted to hear hed have taken the fight himself if you hadnt been here theyd have stopped him enid said theyd have tried youre the only one who could you know it her mother looked at her seemed about to say something but did not they watched the men below it was eerily clear and bright just now the men below what rhiannon mer brynn thought savagely was a woman what was her life even here in the cyngael lands celebratedor notoriousfor their womenfolk what really could they ever hope to be or do at a time like this a time that mattered easy enough she thought bitterly as swords clashed they could watch and wring their delicate hands her mother and herself but only if they first disobeyed clear and specific instructions to stay away and hide hide hide or they could be targets for an attack be violated killed or taken and sold as slaves then mourned and exalted in song song rhiannon thought savagely she could kill a singer too women were children till they first bled then married to make children andif jad was kindtheir children would be boys who could farm and defend their land or go off to fight one day there was a tenyearold boy here with a small scythe a tenyearold she stood by her mother aware that enid was still trembling uncharacteristically because shed been so sure brynn would fight and die here there might be some pattern or purpose at work that her mother had saved a redbearded erlings life in the farmyard that night claiming him and now that man had taken brynns fight upon himself there might be a pattern rhiannon didnt care not right now she wanted them all dead these erlings here simply because they could come in their longships with their swords and axes because they exulted in killing and blood and death in battle so their gods would grant them yellowhaired maidens for eternity rhiannon wished she had the powers of the cyngael goddesses of old the ones they were forbidden even to name since theyd embraced jad here in the west she wished she could invoke stone and oak kill the raiders herself leave bodies hacked in pieces on this grass let those yellowhaired maidens put them back together if they wanted to shed bloodeagle them see if the sofierce raiders of the sea came back here after that her mood of the long summer was entirely gone swept like fog before wind that wistful aching sleepless sense that things had gone awry they had they had but there was a lesson to be learned love and longing were not what life in the northlands was about she knew it now she was seeing it the world was too hard you needed to become harder yourself she stood beside her mother her face expressionless showing no least hint of what was raging within her you could look at rhiannon limned in that brilliant light and see her as a darkhaired maiden of sorrows she would kill you if she could for thinking that another young woman in esferth far to the east would have entirely understood these thoughts sharing many though with a different fire in her and one shed lived with all her life no sudden discovery the bitterness of a womans lot the helplessness with which you watched brothers and other men ride out to glory with iron at their sides was nothing new for her judit daughter of aeldred wanted battle and lordship and hardship as much as any erling raider cresting waves in a dragonship coming ashore in surf instead she was readying herself for her wedding this winter to a boy in rheden she was working this day with her mother and her ladies embroidering there were skills a highborn lady was expected to bring to her marriage house by contrast to both of these king aeldreds younger daughter saw the world in a very different way although this too had been suffering change moment by moment through these last late days of summer right now with a pulsing pain behind her eyes and images impinging erratic and uncontrollable like sparks from a fire kendra knew only that she needed to find the cyngael cleric again to tell him something important he wasnt at the royal chapel or the smaller one where hed been before she was in real distress the sunlight late in the day forced her to screen her eyes it occurred to her to wonder if this was what happened to her father when his fever took him but she wasnt warm or faint only hurting and with a terrifying impossible awareness of fighting in the west and a sword in her mind flashing and going and coming again over and over it was her brother who found ceinion for her gareth summoned by a messenger had taken one frightened look at kendra sitting on a bench in the small chapel unable to go back into the light just yet and had gone running shouting for others to join him in the search he came back she wasnt sure how much time had passed and led her by the elbow through the streets to the bright too bright airy room her father had had made for the clerics who were transcribing manuscripts for him shed kept her eyes closed let gareth guide her the king was there among the working scribes and ceinion was with him blessedly kendra walked in one hand held by her brother the other to her eyes and she stopped desperately unsure of how to proceed with her father here father my lord high cleric she managed that much then stopped ceinion looked at her stood quickly could be seen to make a decision of his own prince gareth of a kindness will you have a servant bring the brown leather purse from my rooms your sister needs a remedy i can offer her ill get it myself said gareth and hurried out the door ceinion spoke a quiet word the three scribes stood up at their desks bowed to the king and went out past kendra her father was still here my lady said ceinion is this more of that matter of which we spoke before she hesitated in pain in something more than pain they burned witches for heresy she looked at her father and heard ceinion of llywerth say gravely changing the way of things one more time there is no transgression here your royal father also knows the world of which you speak kendras mouth fell open aeldred had also stood looking from one to the other of them he was pale but thoughtful calm kendra felt as if she were going to fall down child said her father it is all right tell me what you are seeing from the halfworld now she didnt fall she was spared that shame they helped her to a high stool where a cleric had been working the manuscript in front of her on the tilted surface of the desk had a gloriously coloured initial capital half a page in height the letter g with a griffin arched along its curve the word it began kendra saw was glory she said as clearly as carefully as she could they are through the spirit wood or the cyngael prince alun ab owyn is hes the one i can see there are blades drawn there is fighting where i dont know athelbert she shook her head the movement hurt i dont see him but i never did only the cyngael and i dont know why why should we understand her father said after a moment gentle as rain he looked at ceinion and then back at her child forgive me this comes to you from me i believe you have the gift or curse i carry to see that which most of us are spared kendra there is no sin or failing in you nor in you then my lord said ceinion firmly if that is true and i believe it is nor need you punish yourself for it there are purposes we do not understand as you say good and the will of the god are served in different guises she saw her father look at the greyhaired cleric in his pale yellow robe of the god the brightness of the robe hurt her eyes they are fighting her father said turning back to her someone is i see swords and and another sword close your eyes said ceinion you are loved here and will be guarded do not hide from what you are being given i do not believe there is evil in it trust to jad to jad but how how can i trust do not hide his voice held the music of the cyngael kendra closed her eyes dizziness disorientation unrelenting pain do not hide she was trying not to she saw the sword again the one shed asked the cleric about before small silver shining in darkness though there were no moons she saw green again green didnt understand and then she remembered something though she still did not understand green was wrapped around this as a forest wrapped a glade she cried out then real pain grief in a bright room in esferth and on a slope in arberth above where two men were fighting to the death someone heard her cry in his mind and saw what she saw what she gave him and knew more than she knew she heard him say her name in fear and wonder then another name and then with exquisite courtesy given what shed just done to him and what he had understood from it he paused long enough to offer clearly to her mind to mind across river and valley and forest what she surely needed to be told so far away who can know who can ever know for certain how the instruments are chosen kendra opened her eyes looked at her fathers hand which was holding hers the way he hadnt done since she was small and she gazed up at him crying first time that day and said athelbert is there he came alive through the wood oh jad said her father oh my children if you wanted to defeat a man like this you had a narrow path to tread and you kept your feet moving brand leofson wasnt going to fall to some reckless thrust or slash and he was too big to overpower you needed enough time to mark him discover inclinations the way he responded to what you tried how he initiated his own attacks what he said some men talked too much but the time passing cut both ways as it slashed by the jormsviking was fast and younger than you were youd be lying to yourself fatally if you thought you could linger to sort things out or wear him down you had to do your watching quickly draw conclusions if there were any to be drawn set him up for whatever it was you found such as for example a habitclearly never pointed out to himof turning his head to the left before he slashed on the backhand to let the good right eye follow his blade and he liked to slash low searaiders attack a man with a wounded leg was out of a fight you could move right past him so you knew two things quite soon in fact and if you wanted to defeat a man like this you had an idea what needed to be done you were also a quartercentury past your own best years still more than good enough to do it and no lying to the self in that thorkell einarson hadnt been prone to that vice for a long time there was a hard expression on his face as he retreated again and read the backhand cut one more time he blocked it didnt let it seem too easy circled right around again below and then back to level denying the other man the upslope he wanted not hard not really hard yet knew what he was doing still could be worn down would grow tired but not too soon if leofson kept signalling half his blows like that there was a sequence you could use when you knew the other man had committed to a backhand slash the light was really very bright an element in this combat the westering sun shining along their slope striking the two of them the trees the grass the watchers above and below no clouds west dark ones piled up eastand those underlit made the lateday sky seem even more intense hed known evenings like this among the cyngael perhaps more valued because of the rain and mist that usually wrapped these hills and silent valleys a land some men could grow accustomed to but he didnt think he was the sort unless in llywerth by the sea he needed the sea always had salt in the blood didnt leave you he parried a downward blow heavy that one then feinted a first low forehand blow to see what leofson would do overreactedhe would worry more on that side because of his eye hard on the hip though slashing that way ap hywlls wife had named her husbands ailments it might have been amusing somewhere else thorkells could have done the same with his he briefly wondered where frigga was now how the two girls were faring the grandsons he hadnt seen bern was here his son was here it had been thought thorkell einarson a longenough life not without its share of rewards jador ingavin and thünir whatever was waiting for himhadnt been unkind to him he wouldnt say it you made your own fortune and your own mistakes if you wanted to defeat a man like this he smiled then and began it was time the raider facing him would remember that smile thorkell feinted again as before to draw the toowide response followed quickly with a downward blow that brand blocked jarringly then he let himself seem to hesitate as if tired unsure his right leg still forward exposed watch said ap hywll sharply higher up the slope bern below them caught his breath brand leofson went for the deception signalling his backhand again with a turned head and once hed committed himselfthorkells blade moved high to his own backhand too soon before leofson had fully shifted his weight a terrible mistake right side and chest wide open to a man still balanced a fighting man with time it was time to change from a sweeping backhand slash to a short straightahead thrust with a heavy sword heavy enough to pierce leather and flesh to the beating offered heart watching bern sank to his knees a roaring in his ears a sound like the surf on stones so far inland leofson pulled free his blade not easily it had gone a long way in he had an odd expression on his face as though he wasnt sure what had just happened thorkell einarson was still standing and smiling at him watch the backhand the redhaired man said to him very low no one else in the world to hear it youre giving it away every time brand lowered his bloodied sword brow furrowing you werent supposed to you didnt say things like that thorkell swayed another moment as if held up by the light in the light then he turned his head not towards ap hywll for whom hed taken this fight or the two young princes with whom hed gone through a wood and out of time but to the erlings on the slope below them led here to what would have been their dying or to one of them really at the end and he had enough strength left before he toppled like a tree cut down to speak not very clearly a single word champieres he seemed to say though it could have been something else then he fell into the green grass face to the far sky and whichever god or gods might be looking down or might not be a longenough life not without gifts taken and given all mistakes his own ingavin knew sixteen kendra had been keeping her eyes closed the light entering the room was still too bright making the pain in her head worse and when she looked around the sense of disorientationof being in two different placesonly grew with eyes closed the inner sight vision whatever it was didnt have to fight against anything except her and all shed thought she knew about the world but now she made herself look up and open her eyes her father and ceinion with her no one else gareth had come with the herbs and had gone back out shed heard her father giving him another task to do they were really just sending him from the room that he not be burdened as they were with the awareness that king aeldreds younger daughter seemed to be having the sort of visions that had you condemned for trafficking with the halfworld the world the clerics saidby turnseither did not exist at all or must be absolutely shunned by all who followed the rites and paths of holy jad well and good to say but what did you do when you saw what you did see within kendra said her voice thin and difficult someone has died i think i think it is over athelbert her father had to ask that couldnt help himself i dont think so there is distress but not not fear or pain right now in him in alun ab owyn that was ceinion she had to close her eyes again it really was difficult seeing and seeing yes i think i dont think either of them was fighting single combat then her father said shrewdest man in the world all her life a gift for her and judit a burden at times for his sons she had no certain idea he was right but he almost always was if two men fought someone has lost there is alun is heavy with sorrow dearest jad it will be brynn then said ceinion she heard him sit heavily at one of the other stools made herself look squinting in pain i dont think so she said this is not so sharp a grief they looked at her the most frightening thing of all in some ways was that these two men believed every impossible thing she was telling them then she had to close her eyes once more for the images were in her again imposed pushing through her towards the other one so far away same as before stronger now green green green and something shining in the dark i need this to stop kendra whispered but knew it wasnt going to not yet brynn was the first one down the hill but not the first to reach the two of them one standing with a red sword the other lying in the grass brand leofson still caught in strangeness not sure yet what had happened sawanother mysteryhis young shipmate come up to them and kneel on the grass beside the dead man brand heard a sound from above saw ap hywll coming down you will honour the fight he asked heard brynn ap hywll say bitter and blunt he let you win he did not brand said not as forcefully as he wanted to the young one bern looked up why do you say that he asked speaking to the cyngael not to his own leader the hero who had saved them all brynn was swearing a stream of profanity as he looked down at the dead man we were deceived he said in anglcyn he took the fight on himself intending to lose he did not leofson said again brynns voice had been loud enough for others to hear dont be a fool you know it snapped the cyngael men were coming over now from below and above you show your backhand every time he set you up for that bern was still kneeling for some reason beside the dead man i saw that he said looking again at ap hywll brand swallowed hard watch the backhand youre giving it away what kind of a fool he stared at the boy beside the fallen man the late light fell on both of them why are you there he said but he wasnt a stupid man and he knew his answer before it came my father said bern no more than that but much came all too clear brynn ap hywll gazed down at the two of them the living one and the dead and began to swear again with a ferocity that was unsettling brand oneeye hearing him and with duties here said again loudly you will honour the fight within he was badly shaken what kind of a fool did something like this now he knew brynn ignored him insultingly the force of his fury slowed he was looking at bern you understand that he prepared all of this still speaking anglcyn the shared tongue bern nodded i think i do he did it was a new voice he came through the godwood with us to do this i think or make it possible bern looked over aeldreds son the anglcyn prince there was a smaller young man cyngael beside him he almost told us that prince athelbert went on i said i was in the wood because of my father and alun was for his brother and thorkell said he was a fit with us and would explain later how he never did yes he did said brynn ap hywll just now leofson cleared his throat this was all blowing much too far in a bad direction you had to be careful when the rocks got close i killed this man in fair combat he said he was old he grew tired if you want to try to be silent said ap hywll not loudly but with no respect in his voice none of what should come to a man whod just saved his entire company we will honour your fight because i would be shamed not to but the world will know what happened here would you really have gone home and claimed glory for this and to that brand leofson had no reply leave now brynn continued bluntly siawn we do this properly there is a dead man to be honoured send two riders to the coast to bring word to those of cadyr who might be looking for the ships heres my ring for them no one is to attack tell them why and take an erling their best rider to explain to the ones left there he looked at brand again the way one looked at a lowranking member of his household which of your men can handle a horse i can said the one kneeling beside the dead man looking up ive the best horse ill go he hadnt stood up yet are you certain we will bury your father with all proper rites if you wish to stay for no give him to us brand said assertive for the first time he entrusted his soul to ingavin before we fought this is truth brynns mood seemed to change again sorrow in his face anger spent the cyngael it was said were never far from sadness rain and mist dark valleys music in their voices ap hywll nodded his head that seems fitting i have to say very well take him with you you will do him honour we will do him honour brand said with dignity he was the volgans shipmate once her own anger rhiannon realized had also gone it was more than a little unsettling how one could be consumed defined by rage the desirethe needto kill and then have it simply disappear drift away leaving such a different feeling behind she hadnt cried earlier she was weeping now for a treacherous erling servant of her mothers she shouldnt be doing this she thought she shouldnt her mother put an arm about her shoulders enid was calm again thoughtful holding her child it is over rhiannon told herself at least it is over now in the sagas bern thought when the hero died to the monsters claws and teeth or the assembled might of deceitful foes he always lay alive for some last moments so those who loved him could come and say that and hear the last words he would speak and carry them away siferth had died that way years after killing ingeld on the ice and so had hargest in his brothers arms speaking the words at the heart of all the sagas cattle die kinsmen die every man born must die fierce hearth fires end in ash fame once won endures ever it made for good verse it might even be true but not all of us are granted final words with those we are losing not all of us are equal to the task of the last memorable thing to say or allowed it even if we are you were supposed to have that moment bern thought bitterly in the jaddite songs too there were such exchanges the king speaking to his servant words to be remembered to echo down the ages the dying high cleric telling a wavering acolyte that which confirms him in faith and mission and changes his lifeand the lives of others after it wasnt right that there was nothing here but this kneeling beside a death among so many strangers enemies in a distant land far from the sea it wasnt right that your own last encounter had been so harsh his father had saved him there too carrying him out of esferth to his horse sending him away with instructions not to come to brynnfell if theyd listened if theyd gone home this wouldnt have it wasnt his fault not his doing hed taken heed a good son ivarr ragnarson was dead because bern had exposed him as his father had wanted hed done what hed been told hed hed honoured his fathers words his father had killed two men been exiled cost his family home and freedom the shape and pattern of their lives had given one life back here bought with his own they were speaking above him of needing an erling to ride to the ships with the cyngael bern looked up hoping they couldnt see how blurred and unmoored he felt and said hed go he heard brand say quietly that thorkell had chosen ingavin for his soul at the end he wasnt surprised how could that be a surprise but it did give him a thought he slipped the hammer from about his neck and lifted his fathers head still warm in the lateday sunlight and he gave thorkell back his gift to carry up to the gods halls where mead was surely surely being poured for him now with siggur volganson there to lead the cries of welcome after waiting for so long he stood up carefully looked down at his father it had been dark in the river the last time nothing clearly to be discerned it was bright here now some grey in the hair and beard but really very little for a man of his years red thorkell still at the end he looked over met the gaze of brynn ap hywll hadnt expected what he saw there theyd come to kill this man neither of them spoke it crossed berns mind to say that he was sorry but an erling didnt say that to a cyngael he just nodded his head the other man did the same bern turned away and went down the slope to get gyllir and ride it was over in the great stories there were last words from the dying and for them from those left behind in life it seemed you galloped away and the dead were borne after you towards a burning by the sea it is over bern thought riding away and rhiannon mer brynn had told herself the same thing a little higher up the hill both were wrong though young enough to be forgiven for it it does not end a story finishesor does for some not for othersand there are other tales intersecting parallel or sharing nothing but the time there is always something more alun ab owyn so pale that it was noted by all who looked at him walked over towards brynn he was breathing carefully holding himself very still lad what is it brynns gaze narrowed i need i must ask something of you after coming through that wood for us jads blood there is nothing you could ask that dont say it this is large the older man stared at him let us walk away then and you will ask me and i will say if i can do what you need they walked away and alun asked only the dog cafall whom both of them had called theirs was near to them following there was a breeze from the north sliding the clouds away a clear night coming latesummer stars soon no moons it is very large brynn agreed when alun had done he too was pale now and this is from this is from the halfworld the one that we both know are you certain you understand no no im not but i think i have been caused to see something and i am being besought to do this from when you were in the godwood before it began here brynn looked at him he wished ceinion were with them he wished he were a wiser better holier man the sun was low the erlings he saw glancing down the slope had taken the body of the dead man siawn had detailed men to go with them escorts brynn didnt think there would be trouble something had changed with einarsons death he was still trying to sort that through if hed have done the same thing to save his own son or daughters he thought so but didnt know he honestly didnt know owyns son was waiting staring at him his mouth pinched clearly in great distress he was the musician brynn remembered had sung for them the night the erlings came his brother had died here this one had come through the spirit wood to warn them and sent a faerie ahead to brynn three nights she had waited above the yard for him to come to her failing that the farm would have burned tonight and enid rhiannon he nodded his head ill take you to siggur volgansons sword where i buried it jad defend us both from whatever may befall it does not end there is always more she is watching of course she is watching how could she not have followed here she is trying from a distance away from all the iron to understand movements gestures she is not skilled at this how could she be she sees him walk away with the other one with whom shed spoken on the slope who is afraid of her of what she is they do not see her she is in the trees muted trying to understand but distracted by the aura of other presences gathering as sundown nears the ride is close by of course and spruaugh many of them whom she has always disliked one of those she thinks will have flitted to tell the queen already about what shes done what she is doing now there was one dead man taken up by the others now only one she has seen this before years ago and years ago it is a game men play at war though something more than that perhaps they die so swiftly she sees the two of them turn and go to their horses and start back east alone she follows of course she follows among the trees but just then watching the two of them she feelsinexplicably strange at first then not sosomething she has never felt before in all the years since wakening and then she realizes what it is she is feeling sorrow seeing him take horse and ride a gift never before she enters the small wood above brynnfell with the two of them and the grey dog the ride is waiting by the pool she feels the queens summons and goes to her as she must it grew darker as they rode both carrying torches now the first stars out clouds chased south by the wind cafall loped beside the horses no one else was with them alun looked at the sky no moons tonight brynn simply shook his head the big man had been silent on the ride alun was aware that this particular journey would be laden with memory for him like a weight this is very large he had said it was no moons that alun thought but did not sayfor brynn was carrying enoughwas the other reason time had altered for the three of them in the spirit wood coming here allowed to come here he was remembering thorkells hammer laid upon the grass where theyd heard the creature roaring an offering and perhaps not the only thing offered he too had ended up lying on grass this was a different wood the insistent images painfully imposed coming from an anglcyn princess in esferth were green and shining still as they entered among the trees carrying their flames hed chased ivarr ragnarson here and his erling horse had entered the pool and been frozen there and hed seen faeries heard their music seen dai with the queen never found ivarr that one was dead it seemed not by aluns hand not his revenge something else a larger thing to be done now he was afraid the images in his mind had stopped they were gone as if the girl had been worn out sending themor wasnt needed any more now that he was here he was supposed to know by now why he was in this wood he was almost certain he did that sense of something pushing into awareness was replaced by something else more difficult to name he dismounted when brynn did and he followed him through the darkness a twisting path through high summer trees a small wood this but an old one surely so with faeries here they were cautious with the torches a forest could burn he saw the pool his heart was beating fast he glanced at brynn who had stopped saw that the other mans face was rigid with strain brynn looked around aligning himself the sky was clear above the pool they could see stars the water was still a mirror no wind here no sound in the leaves brynn turned to him hold this he said handing alun his torch he set off around the edge of the pool towards the south longstriding almost hurrying now that they were here he would be tangled in memories alun thought he followed carrying light again brynn stopped again took his bearings then he turned his back on the water and walked over to a tree a large ash he touched it and went past three more trees then he turned to his left there was a boulder mosscovered green massive here too brynn rested his hand a moment he looked back at alun it was too hard to read his thoughts by torchlight alun could guess though why didnt you destroy it he asked softly his first words in the wood i dont know the other man said i felt as if it should stay with us lie here it was very beautiful he stayed that way a moment then he turned his back on alun drew a breath put a shoulder to that huge rock and pushed an enormously strong man nothing happened brynn straightened wiped at his face with one hand i can alun began no said the other i did it myself then twentyfive years ago a young man in his glory a life ahead of him the greatest deed of his days already done what hed be remembered for hed taken that fight for his own over those whose rank should have made it theirs today he had let a man take another combat for him this was a proud man alun stood with the torches cafall beside him and watched as brynn turned back to the rock spat on both his hands and put them and his shoulder to it again driving with body and legs churning grunting with exertion then crying aloud jads name the god even here and the boulder rolled with that cry just enough to reveal by the light of aluns torches a hollow beneath where it had been and something wrapped in cloth lying there brynn straightened wiped at his dripping face again with one sleeve then the other he swore though softly without force alun remained where he was waiting his heart was still pounding the other man knelt claimed the cloth and what lay inside it he stood up and carried it back before him the few steps out of those trees past the ash to the grassy space by the starlit pool he cried aloud raised a quick warding hand alun following looked past him they were here waiting not the faeries the green hovering figures hed seen with the others in the spirit wood they were here and they were the reason he was here he knew what these were now finally and what they needed from him besought he was being pleaded with to intervene a mortal who could see the halfworld who had been in the rides pool here had lain with a faerie in the northern reaches of the spirit wood they would know this when hed entered the wood again with thorkell and then athelbert they had come for him his heart was twisted entangled holding a weight that felt like centuries he didnt know how the girl in esferth was part of this didnt know shed been in the wood that same night but she had given him the images they needed him to see she had a different kind of access to this and had brought him here a second time they will not harm us he said quietly to brynn you know what these are yes said alun i do now brynn didnt ask the next question either he didnt want to know or more probably he was leaving this in courtesy to alun alun said if you will give me the sword i think you should take cafall and go you do not need to stay with me yes i do said the other man hugely proud all his days a man had died taking his fight this afternoon brynn unwrapped the cloth from around what it had held for so many years and alun coming nearer with both torches saw the volgans small jewelhiked sword taken from the raid on champieres and carried as a talisman until the day he died in llywerth by the sea the man whod killed him held it out towards alun alun handed him a torch took the sword gave brynn the other flame he unsheathed the blade to look upon it it was silver siggur volgansons sword not iron hed known it would be from the girl there came a sound from the green shapes gathered theretwenty of them or nearly so he judged a keening noise wind in leaves but higher sorrow was in him the way of the cyngael you are certain you wish to stay brynn nodded you dont want to be alone here he didnt it was true but still i dont think i have permission to do this i dont expect to live your wife asked you i know what she said i will not leave you alone do what you must we will bear witness cafall and i alun looked beyond him one of the green shapes had come nearer they were almost human as if twisted by time and circumstance a little away he knew what they were now what they had been brynn stepped away back towards the encircling trees carrying the torches the dog was silent when it might have growled it had done so in the spirit wood alun remembered something had changed he set the scabbard down you wish this truly he said not to the other man this time brynn was behind him now he was holding a silver sword and speaking to the green creatures that had come they were in a clearing by the faerie queens pool under stars on a night when neither moon would rise souls walked on such nights so the old tales told no reply or none spoken aloud he had no idea if they could speak any tongue he might know but the figure before him came nearer yet slowly so as not to startle him or cause fear was the thought that came and it knelt upon the dark grass before him he heard brynn make a sound the beginning of a prayer and then stop himself the other man had just realized alun thought what was about to happen though he wouldnt know why alun knew why he had not asked for this hed only ridden north from home one bright morning at the end of spring with his brother and favourite cousin and their friends on a cattle raid as young men of the cyngael had done since all songs began he had ridden into a different older story it seemed much older these green things and he still didnt know what they were called had been human once like brynn like alun himself like dai entirely like dai these he understood heart aching were the souls of the faerie queens mortal lovers after she tired of them and sent them from her side this is what became of them after who could know how many years and he was here in a tale he had never known he was in to set them free with silver under stars his eyes were dry his hand steady holding the small sword he touched the point and stillsharp edges not a warriors blade this one a slender ceremonial sword this was a ceremony as much as anything else he drew a breath there was no reason to wait or linger hed been brought here for this he stepped forward let there be light for you he said and thrust the volgans blade into the kneeling shimmering creature below what would have been its collarbone long ago he was ready this time for the sound that came and so did not flinch or startle when he heard that cry of release or the deeper sound that came from the others gathered here no wind the water utterly still stars would be reflected in it there was nothing kneeling before him now where the blade too smoothly almost no resistance had gone alun understood it was a soul not a mortal body it had died long ago he was stabbing hearth smoke and memory he told himself that again and again as he besought light besought for each of them one by one as they came and knelt and he did what they had drawn him here to do for them he became aware of how grateful he was that brynn had stayed after all that he wasnt here alone to do this in the dark wrapped in sorrow hearing that aching joy in each of them at their release the sound they made his hand was steady each time over and again he owed them that having been chosen for this exchanges in spirit woods he was thinking a hammer laid down in one forest that a sword might be lifted from under a boulder in another thorkells life for his and athelberts and so many others on that slope today mortals all he had no idea how much time had passed or if indeed it had he looked down upon the last of these kneeling souls taken once and discarded by the faerie queen he offered his prayer for it and plunged the sword and heard the cry and saw this last one flicker and drift from sight as the others had done nothing green left glimmering in the glade and so this alun thought was the last exchange final balancing an ending he too was young to be forgiven this error as the others were he heard music looked up behind him brynn began quietly to pray light upon the water pale as if moonlight were falling and then the light which was not moonlight took shape attained form and alun saw for a second time faeries coming across the surface of the pool to the sound of flutes and bells and instruments he did not know he saw the queen again borne in her open litter very tall slim clothed in what would be silk or something finer silverhued like his sword faeries passing by or not in fact passing not this time the music stopped he heard brynn behind him ceaselessly speaking the invocation of light the first the simplest prayer the dog was silent still alun looked at the queen and then made himself look beside her dai was there as he had been before so little time would have passed for them he thought he was riding a white mare with ribbons in her mane and the queen was reaching out and holding him by the hand silence upon the water brynns murmuring the only sound in the glade alun looked at that shining company and at his brother his brothers taken soul without having intended to he knelt then on the grass his turn to kneel they were so far inside the halfworld only with mercy would they ever come out and faeries were never known for mercy in the tales they did make bargains though with mortals they favoured and there can be a final balancing though we might not expect it or know when it has come kneeling looking upon that tall pale exquisite queen in her silvered light upon water he saw her gesture a movement of one hand and he saw who came forward obedient dutiful from among those in her train to her side no sound brynn he realized had fallen silent grave unsmiling achingly beautiful the faerie queen gestured again twice looking straight at alun and so he understoodfinallythat there could be indulgence mercy a blessing even entangled with all sorrows the cup from which we drink she reached out one arm and laid it like a barrier before the small slim figure of the one who had come forward the one he knew had spoken to had lain with in a forest on the grass will you come back into the wood will you sorrow if i do not he had asked her hair was changing hues as he watched golden to dark violet to silver like the queens he knew these changes knew this about her from behind the barrier of that arm that banning she looked at him and then she turned her head away and gazed at the figure on the other side of the queen and alun followed her glance and began now to weep final balancing the queen of the faeries released his brothers hand and with those fingers a gesture smooth as water falling she motioned for dai to go forward if he wished if he wished he was still wrapped like a raiment in his mortal shape not green and twisted away from it as the others had been he was too new still her favoured one riding the white mare at her side holding her hand amid their music upon water in the night woods within the faerie mounds if he wished how did one leave this go from that shining alun wanted so much to call to him but tears were pouring down his face and his throat was blocked with grief so he could only watch as his brother his brothers soul turned to look at the queen in her litter beside him he was too far away for alun to see what expression was on his face sorrow anger fear yearning puzzlement release it is as has long been said the nature of the cyngael that in the midst of brightest shining joy they carry an awareness of sorrows to come an ending that waits the curving of the arc it is their way the source of music in their voices andperhapswhat allows them to leave the shining behind in due time when others cannot do so gifts are treasured known not to be forever dai twitched the reins of his mare and moved forward alone across the water alun heard brynn again praying behind him he looked for one brief moment that could be made to last a lifetime if held clearly enough in memory upon the faerie that had come to him his own gift a shining left behind and saw her raise a hand to him from behind the arm of the queen final balancing dai reached the waters edge dismounted walked across the grass not hovering as the others had not yet still clothed in the form his brother had known alun made himself stand still he held the volgans sword dai stopped in front of him he did not smile or speak no words spoken across that divide nor did he kneel owyn of cadyrs older slain son not before a younger brother one could even smile at that perhaps later dai spread his feet a little as if to steady himself alun was remembering the morning they had ridden north from home coming here other memories followed in waves how could they not here he looked into his brothers eyes and saw that they had changed were still changing it seemed to him there were stars to be seen there a strangeness so great let there be light for you he murmured scarcely able to speak let it be done with love said brynn behind him soft as a benison words that seemed to be from some ancient liturgy alun didnt know how not he said to brynn to dai to the bright queen and all her faeries and the one he was losing now to the dark night and the stars he drew back the sword a last time and drove it into his brothers chest to accept the queens gift of his soul the balancing and set it free to find its harbour after all when he looked up again dai was gone was gone and the faeries had disappeared all that shining it was dark upon the water and in the glade he drew a ragged breath felt himself shivering there was a sound the dog come up to nuzzle him at the hip alun put a trembling hand down touched its fur between the ears another sound he turned towards it wordlessly and he let brynn ap hywll gather him in his arms as a father would with his own father so far away they stood so for a long time before they moved brynn claimed the scabbard wrapped the sword in its cloth again as before and they walked over and he laid it in the hollow where it had been then he looked up it was dark the torches had burned out will you help me lad he asked this accursed boulder has grown it is heavier than it used to be i swear ive heard they do that said alun quietly he knew what the other man was doing a different kind of gift together shoulders to the great rock they rolled it back and covered the volgans sword again then they left the wood cafall beside them and came out under stars above brynnfell lanterns were burning down there to guide them back there was another torch as well nearer to them she had waited by the gate the last time when her father went up this time rhiannon slipped out of the yard amidst the chaos of returning her mother was arranging for a meal to be served to all those who had come to their aid invited and unexpectedly from the farms west where someonea girl it seemedhad seen the erlings passing and run a warning home you honoured such people rhiannon knew she was needed ought to be with her mother but she also knew that her father and alun ab owyn were in the wood again brynn had told his wife where he was going though not why rhiannon was unable to attend to whatever duties were hers until they came out from the trees standing on the slope above their farmyard she listened to the bustling sounds below and thought about what it was a woman could do and could not waiting she thought was so much a part of their lives her mother giving swift incisive orders down below might call that nonsense but rhiannon didnt think it was there was no anger in her any more or any real feeling of defiance though she knew she shouldnt be up here needful as night she had said in the hall at the end of spring entirely aware of the effect it would have shed been younger then rhiannon thought here she was after nightfall and she couldnt have said what it was she needed an ending shed decided to whatever had begun that other night she heard a noise the two men came out from the trees and stood there the grey dog beside alun she saw them both look down upon the farmhouse and the lights then her father turned to her jad be thanked rhiannon said truly he replied he came over and brushed her forehead with his lips as was his habit he hesitated looked over his shoulder alun ab owyn had stayed where he was just clear of the last trees i need to drink and drink brynn said both at once ill see you below he went over and took both horses reins and led them down she was unexpectedly calm the springtime seemed so long ago the wind had died down the smoke from her torch rose up nearly straight did you i have so much they both stopped rhiannon laughed a little he did not she waited he cleared his throat i have so much need of your forgiveness he said after what you did she said coming here again he shook his head what i said to you this she could address you said some things in grief and loss on the night your brother died he shook his head it was more than that she had stood by the gate seen her father go up the two of them had just come out of the wood she knew something of this she said then it was more and you are the more to be forgiven you are gracious too i have no right none of us has a right to grace rhiannon said it comes sometimes that night i asked you to come to me to sing i know i remember of course will you sing for me tonight he hesitated i i am not certain that i for all of us she amended carefully in the hall we are honouring those who came to help us he rubbed at his chin he was very tired she saw that would be better he said quietly that would be better some paths some doorways some people were not to be yours though the slightest difference in the rippling of time might have made them so a tossed pebble landing a little sooner a little later she looked at him standing this near the two of them alone in darkness and she knew she would never entirely move beyond what had happened to her that night at the end of spring but it was all right it would have to be all right you could live with this with much worse will you come down my lord she said i will follow you my lady if i may i am not entirely ready i will do better after some moments alone i can understand that rhiannon said she could hed been in the halfworld would have a long way back to travel she turned away from him and started down just outside the gate to the yard a shadow moved away from the fence my lady said the shadow your mother said you would be up that slope and unlikely to welcome someone following i thought i would risk coming this far her torchlight fell upon athelbert as he bowed he had come through the spirit wood to bring them a warning they were not even allies of his people he was the kings heir of the anglcyn he had come out to wait for her rhiannon had a vision then of her life to come the burdens and the opportunities of it and it was not unacceptable to her there would be joys and sorrows as there always were the taste of the latter present in the wine of such happiness as mortals were allowed she could do much for her people she thought and life was not without its duties my mother she said looking up at him by the light of his lifted torch is generally right but not always so it is said athelbert smiling a terrible thing when a parent is always right youd have to meet my father to see what i mean they walked into the yard together rhiannon closed and latched the gate behind her the way they had all been taught to do against what might be out there in the night he wasnt alone he had said that he needed to be but it was a dissembling sitting on the grass above brynnfell not far from where hed first walked up to the faerie he could see the sapling to his left alun set about shaping and sending a thought again and again in his mind it is over it begins it is over it begins he had no idea what the boundary markers of this might be if she could sense anything from him the way hed been so painfully open to the images shed sent but he stayed there his dog beside him and he shaped those words wondering then wonder ceased and a greater wonder began for he felt her presence again and caught soundlessly within a note of laughter it is over if you are very fortunate and i am feeling generous it begins alun laughed aloud in the darkness he would never be entirely alone again he realized it might not have been a blessing but it was because of what she was and he knew it from the beginning that same night looking down upon the farm he stood up and so did the dog there were lights below food and wine companionship against the night people waiting for him with their needs he could make music for them come back to me he heard joy the other taste in sorrows cup seventeen nine nights after leaving brynnfell as they rowed into the wind back east skirting close to ferrieres to be as far from aeldreds ships as they could bern realized that his father had spoken a last word to him it was a bright night both moons in the sky a little more light than was entirely safe for them he remained thinking for some time longer hands to his oar in the night he rocked his body back and forth pulling through the sea tasting salt spray and memories then he lifted his voice and called out to brand they were treating him differently now brand came directly over he listened as thorkell einarsons son shared a thought which seemed to leofson to come under the two moons as guidance from a spirit burned with all proper rites on a strand in llywerth benevolently mindful of their fate at dawn they lashed the ships together on choppy seas and took counsel they were jormsvik mercenaries feared through the north and theyd had humiliations beyond endurance on this journey here was a chance to come home with honour not trammelled in shame there were reasons to roll these dice it was past the end of raiding season theyd be entirely unexpected they could still land nearly a hundred men and carloman of ferrieres had his hands full garr hoddson pointed out farther east with the karchites who were being pushed towards him by the horsemen of waleska and most of them had heardand each now believed he understoodthe last cry of thorkell einarson whod lost a single combat deliberately to save their lives brand oneeye had stopped even trying to proclaim it otherwise there was no dissent they put the ships ashore in a shallow cove west of the brienne river mouth they knew roughly where champieres was though not with certainty since the volgans raid no one had been back to that hidden valley where kings of ferrieres were laid to rest chanted over by holy men in the early years theyd known it would be guarded after what had happened and later it was as though champieres had become sacred to the erlings too in siggurs memory well there were limits to that werent there a new generation had its needs they did in the event know enough to find it beyond the river an eastwest valley entered from the east it wasnt hugely difficult for trained experienced men what followed three nights later was what tended to follow when the erlings came they sacked the royal sanctuary of the sleepless ones set it afire killed three dozen clerics and guards not enough fighting men any more garr had been right about the karchites they lost only eight of their own carriedloading the horses burdened like beasts themselvessacks of silver and gold artifacts coins candlesticks censers and sun disks royal gems jewelhilted blades none silver not this time ivory caskets coffers of sandalwood and ebony spices and manuscripts men paid for those and a score of slaves whipped towards the ships to serve them in jormsvik or be sold in a market town a raid as gloriously triumphant as anyone could remember an echo even of what the volgan had done enough looted to leave each one of them wealthy even after the share given over to the treasury when they came home a hearth fire story too you could hear the skalds already the dying heros last word volgans friend understood only by his son one night at sea sending them to champieres where the father had been twentyfive years and more ago in the name of ingavin it made a saga by itself there were storm winds in their faces for two days and nights as they continued home lightning cracked the sky waves high as masts roared over the decks drenching them sweeping some of the horses screaming overboard they were erlings though lords of the sea roads however wild they might become this was their element ingavin and thünir sent storms as a trial for men a test of worthiness they wiped streaming water from eyes and beards and fought through rain and gale defying them as no other men alive dared do they came into jormsvik harbour on a bright cold afternoon singing at their oars theyd lost one ship hoddsons and thirtytwo men to be lamented and honoured each one of them but the sea and the gods claim their due and where was glory after all when the task was easily done it was a very good winter in jormsvik it was judged the same way in esferth and raedhill and elsewhere in the anglcyn lands king aeldred and his wife and court travelled north to rheden to celebrate the marriage of their daughter judit to prince calum there the redhaired princess was fiercely beautiful even more fiercely strongwilled and clearly terrified her younger husband that her siblings agreed privately had been predictable why should the prince be different from anyone else not remotely overlooked in the ceremonies and entertainments of that fortnight was the moment in the midwinter rites when withgar of rheden knelt before king aeldred kissed his ring and accepted a disk of jad from him while clerics chanted praise of the living sun you paid a price to join your line to a greater one and rheden was not unaware that esferth was increasingly secure from the erlings it wasnt difficult to guess in which direction aeldreds eyes might turn better to marry turn risk to advantage they were all one people in the end werent they not like the dark little cattlethieving cyngael on the other side of the wall as it happened some time before leaving esferth for the north the anglcyn king had put his mind and his clerics to work on the formal terms of another marriage west with those same cyngael withgar of rheden hadnt been told about these plans as yet but thered been no reason to inform him many a marriage negotiation had broken down this one however seemed unlikely to do so his daughter kendra normally the gentle compliant one of his four children and best loved as it happened had spoken with her father and the cyngael cleric in privacy shortly after certain events that had taken place at summers end by a farm called brynnfell in arberth events they knew altogether too much about because of her and the young prince of cadyr owyns surviving son and heir the man she intended to wed she told her father as much aeldred notoriously said to anticipate almost all possible events and plan for them was not remotely ready for this nor could he furnish any immediate reply to his daughters firm indication that she would follow her mother straight to the sanctuary at retherly if the unionso clearly a suitable onewere not approved it is marginally acceptable i grant you but do you even know he wants this or that prince owyn will approve aeldred asked he wants this kendra replied placidly and youve been thinking about a union west for a long time this of course happened to be true his children knew too much the king looked to ceinion for help the clerics manner had greatly changed over the course of a few days with word of events at brynnfell he bore a genial amused manner through the days and evenings it was difficult to provoke an enjoyable argument on doctrine with him he smiled at aeldred my delight my lord is extreme you know i hoped for such a union owyn will be honoured after i finish speaking with him which i will do so much for help from that quarter it doesnt matter kendra said with alarming complacency alun will deal with it both men blinked looking closely at her this aeldred thought was his shy dutiful daughter she closed her eyes they thought it was selfconsciousness under the doubled scrutiny she looked at them again i was right she said hell be coming here with my brother theyll be taking the coastal road they are on the way to cadyr now to speak with his father she smiled gently at the two of them weve agreed not to do this too much before the wedding so dont worry he says to tell ceinion hes making music again there wasnt a great deal one could do about this though prayer was clearly indicated kendra was diligent about attendance at chapel morning and evening the marriage did make sense there had been some brief discussion the king remembered about athelbert and brynn ap hywlls daughter well that wouldnt need to be continued now you didnt marry two children to achieve the same result ceinion of llywerth offered his own two wedding gifts to the king the first was his longsought promise to spend part of each year with aeldred at his court the second was quite different it emerged after a conversation between the high cleric of the cyngael and the extremely devout queen of the anglcyn in the wake of this frank and illuminating exchange and after two allnight vigils in her chapel queen elswith arrived at her husbands bedchamber one night and was admitted the queen placidly informed her royal spouse thatupon reflection and religious counselhis soul was not so very gravely in danger as to require her to withdraw to a sanctuary immediately after judit was married after all she was content to wait until kendra in turn was wed to this prince in the west perhaps in late spring aeldred and osbert in her view would be incapable of properly dealing with this second celebration without guidance further it now struck the queen as reasonable to spend some of her time at court even after she retired to the sanctuary these matters could be addressed in a balanced fashion as the teachings of faith suggested for all things on the subject of balance the kings earthly state was certainly part of her charge his diet for example with the winter feasting season approaching judits wedding in rheden ahead of them was excessive he was gaining weight at risk of gout and worse he would need her with him at intervals to observe and assess his needs the king who had not suffered another of his fevers since a certain conversation with ceinion on the ride back from chasing the erlings to the coast and would not endure one again ever happily proposed she begin such assessing right where they were the queen declared the suggestion indecent at their age but allowed herself to be overmastered in this youre taking a long time you know why i had to go to my father first couldnt rush away im almost with you three more days there are emissaries with us well present the marriage proposal to your father ill ask ceinion to help i think he will doesnt matter my fathers going to consent how do you know this is a very i spoke with him and he just said yes right now i think hell say yes to anything i ask of him a small silence in the shared channel of two minds so will i you know oh good shed done her first harvesttime sacrifice two lambs and a kid anrid had added the goat to the ceremony naming it as fullas offering mostly to be seen to be doing things the old volur had not done changes setting her own imprint upon rituals as a seal marked a letter shed worn the accursed snake about her neck it was growing heavier it had crossed her mind that if the ship from the south came back in spring it would be prudent to arrange for another serpent or perhaps theyd have one on board perhaps arrangements had already been made frigga when consulted thought this might be so the harvest turned out to be a good one and the winter was mild on rabady the new governor and volur were both toasted in the taverns and the womens compound saw its share of afterharvest gifts anrid claimed only a dark blue cloak for herself let the others divide the restthey needed to be kept happy and a little bit afraid the serpent helped with that the wound on her leg had become a small pair of scars she let the others see them now and again as if by chance serpents were a power of earth and anrid had been given some of that power it was mild enough through winter that some of the younger men took their boats across to vinmark for the adventure of it in a hard winter the straits might freeze though not safely so and rabady could be entirely cut off this year they did learn things although in winter there wasnt much to know a blood feud in halek six men dead after a woman had been stolen it appeared the woman had consented so she was killed as well when reclaimed by her family people were too close to each other when the snow came in spring the roads and sea opened again and pentup violence could be sent away it had always been like that they were shaped by the cold season preparing for winter needing it to end preparing again one day with spring not yet arrived a small boat was rowed across to the isle three mariners aboard heavily armed spears and round shields they came ashore with a chest and a key spoke courteously enough to the men sent down to meet them they were looking for a woman from the town they were sent through the walls and across the ditch to trudge snowclad fields to the womens compound a halfdozen boys glad of the diversion escorted them the chest was for frigga it revealed when opened in anrids chamber only the two of them there for the turning of the key silver enough to buy any property on the isle with a good deal left over there was a note anrid was the one who could read friggas son bern sent his respects to his mother and hoped she remained in health he was alive himself and well he was sorry to have to tell her that her husband her first husband had died in cyngael lands at summers end his passing was honourable he had saved other men with his death he had been given rites and burning there done properly the silver was to make a new beginning for her in a hard way to explain the note said it was really from thorkell bern would send word again when he could but would probably not risk coming back to rabady anrid had expected the other woman to weep she did notor not when anrid was near the chest and silver were hidden there were places to hide things here frigga had already made her new beginning her son could not have known that she wasnt at all certain she wished to leave the compound and the women go back to a house in or near the town and she wouldnt go to her daughters in vinmark even with wealth of her own that wasnt a life growing old in a strange place it was a great deal of money you couldnt just leave it in the ground shed think on it she told anrid anrid had memorized the note a quick mind before they put it back in the chest probably not was what he had said she took thought and invited the governor to visit her another new thing sturlas coming here but the two of them were at ease with each other now shed gone into town to speak with him as well formally garbed surrounded by always several of the women iord the old volur had believed in the mystery that came with being unseen removed anrid and frigga when they talked thought power also came from people knowing you were there bearing you in mind she always had the serpent when she went to the town or met with ulfarson at the compound as now hed deny it of course but he was afraid of her which was useful they discussed adding buildings to the compound when the last snow melted and the men could work again this had been mentioned before anrid wanted room for more women and a brewhouse she had thoughts of a place for childbirth people gave generously at such times if the child was a boy and lived it would be good to become known as the place to come when a birth drew near the governor would want a share but that too shed anticipated he wasnt difficult to deal with sturla as he was leaving after ale and easy talk about the feud over on the mainland she mentioned casually something shed learned from the three men with the chest about events a year ago when halldr thinshanks horse had gone missing it made a great deal of sense what she told the governor everyone had known there was no love lost between the old volur and thinshank ulfarson had nodded owlishly he had a tendency to look that way after ale and asked shrewdly why the boy hadnt come home by now if this was so the boy she told him had gone to jormsvik choosing the world of fighting men to put behind him the dark womanmagic that had brought him shame how did she know the chest was from him hed written to his mother here he was greatly honoured it seemed on the mainland now his prowess reflected well on rabady his father thorkell einarson the exile was dead it was good to let a man have tidings he could share in a tavern and even more of a hero the boy was wealthy from raiding had sent his mother silver to buy any home on the isle she wished ulfarson leaned forward not a stupid man though narrow in the paths of his thought which house he asked as she had expected he would anrid smiling said they could probably guess which house thorkell einarsons widow would want though buying it might be difficult given that it was owned by halldrs widow who hated her it might be possible she said as if struck by a thought for someone else to buy the house and land first turn a profit for himself selling to frigga when she came looking sturla ulfarson stroked his pale moustache she could see him thinking this through it was an entirely proper thing she added gravely if the two leaders of the isle helped each other in these various ways construction of her three new buildings sturla ulfarson said when he rose to leave would commence as soon as the snows were gone and the ground soft enough she invoked fullas blessing upon him when he left when the weather began to change the days to grow longer first greengold leaves returning anrid set the younger women to watch at night farther from the compound than was customary and in a different direction there was no spiritguidance no halfworld sight involved she was simply skilled at thinking shed had to become that way it could be seen as magic or power she knew mistaken for a gift of prescience she had another long conversation with frigga doing most of the talking and this time the other woman had wept and then agreed anrid who was very young after all began having restless nights around that time a different kind of disturbance than before when she hadnt been able to sleep this time it was her dreams and what she did in them he was doing what his father had done long ago bern kept telling himself that through the winter waiting for spring and if this was so it was important not to be soft about it the north was no place for that being soft could destroy you even if you left raiding for a different life as thorkell had done he would leave with honour everyone in jormsvik knew by now all that had happened on what had come to be called ragnarsons raid they knew what red thorkell had done to keep them from going to arberth and what bern had done and how the two of them the skalds were singing it had shaped destiny together after leading five ships to champieres two of the most experienced captains had spoken with bern on separate occasions urging him to stay no coercion jormsvik was a company of free and willing men theyd pointed out that hed entered among them by killing a powerful man which boded well for his future as did his lineage and the way he had begun on his first raid they hadnt known his lineage when hed entered they did now bern had expressed gratitude awareness of honour kept private the thought that he really didnt agree with this vision of his prospects hed been fortunate had received aid beyond measure from thorkell and even though the idea of the attack in ferrieres had been his by way of his father hed discovered no battle frenzy in himself no joy in the flames or when hed spitted a jaddite cleric on his blade you didnt have to tell people that but you did need to be honest with yourself he thought his father had left the sea road eventually bern was doing it earlier that was all and would ask ingavin and thunir not to pull him back as thorkell had been pulled back he set about balancing accounts through the winter when you changed your life you were supposed to leave the old one behind cleanly ingavin observed such things cunning and wise watching with his one eye bern had wealth now a fortune beyond his deserts the champieres raid was being talked about word spreading even on the snowbound paths of winter it would be in hlegest by now brand had told him in a tavern one night icicles hanging like spears on the eaves outside kjarten vidurson rot his scarred face would know that jormsvik was still no fortress to set himself against though he was likely going to try sooner or later that one bern had begun making his reckoning that same night had left the tavern for the rooms the three rooms in which hed kept thira since returning hed offered her a sum of money that would set her up back home with property and the choosing or rejecting of any man in her village women could own land of course they just needed a husband to deal with it and keep it shed surprised him but women werebern thoughtharder than men to anticipate he was good hed discovered at understanding men but hed not have expected for example that thira would burst into tears and swear at him and throw a boot and then say snapping the words like a ships captain to an oarsman out of rhythm that shed left home of her own choice for her own reasons and no manboy like bern thorkellson was going to make her go back shed accepted the silver and the three rooms though not long after she bought herself a tavern hratis in fact hrati was old tired of the life said he was ready for the table by the fire and an upstairs room she gave him that he didnt as it happened last long started drinking too much became quarrelsome they buried him the next winter thira changed the name of the tavern bern was long gone by then hed had to wait until spring when challengers began coming again in the meantime he paid three of the newer younger ones to carry a chest to rabady as soon as the weather made that possible these were jormsvikings they werent going to cheat him and mercenaries could take a paying task from a companion as easily as from anyone else more balancing in that chest his mother would surely be locked into a grim life a second husband dead and she only a second wife in thinshanks house no rights to speak of no sure home bern had left her to that taking gyllir into the sea silver didnt make redress for everything but if you didnt let yourself get soft you could say it went a longenough way in the world he couldnt safely return to rabady hed almost certainly be known even changed in his appearance taken as a horse thief and more the horse had been named and marked for a funeral burning after all the horse in fact he sold to brand leofson a good price too gyllir was magnificent a warriors ride had been wasted on the isle with halldr thinshank bought by him merely because he could buy such a creature the pride and show of it leofson wanted the stallion and wasnt about to bargain with bern not after all that had happened bern hadnt hesitated or let himself regret it you couldnt allow yourself to be soft about your animals either you could get irritated mind you and swear at them and at yourself for not choosing more carefully hed picked a placid bay from the stables for his new mount discovering too late its awkward trot and a disinclination to sustain a gallop a landowners horse good for walking sedately to town and tavern and back he wasnt going to need more he kept telling himself but he was accustomed to gyllir was that softness remembering a horse youd had maybe you didnt talk or boast about what youd done where youd been but surely you could remember it what else was your life except what you recalled and perhaps what you wanted next he waited as he had to for spring to unlock the roads and the challengers to begin arriving at the gates he was letting brand advise him leofson had been taking a protective attitude towards bern since theyd returned as if killing thorkell being allowed by thorkell to kill him gave him responsibilities to the son bern didnt feel he needed it but he didnt really mind and he knew it wouldnt last long it was useful too brand would take care of berns money send it where he needed it as he needed it once hed figured out where that was they watched the first few men arrive before the walls and issue their challenges and brand shook his head they were farmhands stableboys with outsized dreams and no possible claim to being jormsvik men it would be unjust to his fellows to claim their challenges and ride away and let them in they drew the runepieces inside the walls and the challenges were randomly taken two of the boys were killed one by accident it appeared to those watching and elkin confirmed that when he came back in two were disarmed and allowed to go with the usual promise that if they returned and tried again theyd be cut apart the fifth challenger was bigboned older than the others he had a serviceable sword and a battered helmet with the noseguard intact brand and bern looked at each other bern signalled to those on duty at the gate that he was taking this one by choice it had come you waited for things and then they were upon you he and leofson embraced he did the same with a number of the others who knew what was happening shipmates drinking companions it had only been a year but warriors could die any time and forming bonds here didnt take long hed discovered bonds could be cut though bern thought sometimes they needed to be thira hard little one only waved to him from behind the counter of her new tavern when he went to bid her farewell before going out her life was the opposite of his he thought you took care not to form any links men sailed from you and died different men climbed your stairs every night shed saved his life though he lingered in the doorway watching her a moment he was remembering the fourth stair the one missing on the way up to her room important he reminded himself not to be soft he took his new horse from the stable and the gear hed carry north and his sword and helm roads were dangerous always for a lone man they opened the gates for him and he went out to the challenger he saw relief and wonder in the mans blue eyes when bern lifted an open hand in the gesture of yielding he motioned to the gates behind him ingavin be mindful of you he said to the stranger honour yourself and those you are joining then he rode away along the path hed taken coming here he heard a clashing sound behind him spears and swords being banged on shields his companions on the walls he looked back and lifted a hand his father wouldnt have he thought no one troubled him going north he didnt avoid the villages or inns this time he passed the place where hed ambushed a single traveller himself because hed needed a sword for the challenge hadnt killed the man or didnt think he had it wasnt as if hed lingered to be sure eventually after what felt like a long slow journey he caught his first glimpse of rabady in the distance on his left as the road dropped near to the coast inland the mountains rose and then the endless pines beyond and no roads ran he came to the fishing village they all knew on rabady the one they usually went to and from he might even be known here but he didnt think so hed grown his beard and hair was bigger now across shoulders and chest he waited for twilight to fall and the night to deepen and even begin its wheeling towards dawn before he offered the prayer all seamen spoke before going upon the water he prepared to push the small boat out into the strait the fisherman roused from sleep in his hut came to help berns payment for borrowing it had been generous far more than a days lost catch he left the horse with the man to mind he wouldnt be cheated here hed said he was from jormsvik and he looked it it was black on the water as he rowed towards the isle he looked at the stars and the sea and the trees ahead of him spring full circle of a year and here he was again he dipped a hand in the water bitterly killingly cold he remembered hed thought he was going to die here he missed gyllir then thinking back shook his head you couldnt be this way in the north it could kill you he was stronger now steady and easy at the oars it wasnt a difficult pull in any case hed done it as a boy summers he remembered he beached the small craft on the same strand from which hed left he didnt think that was an indulgence or weak it felt proper an acknowledging he gave thanks to ingavin touching the hammer about his neck hed bought it in autumn nothing elaborate much like the one that had burned with his father in llywerth he moved inland cautiously he really didnt want to meet anyone people here had known him all his life there was a betterthandecent chance hed be recognized that was why hed come at night most of the way towards dawn why he hadnt been sure he would come at all he was here for three reasons last of the balancings before he changed his life all three could be done in a night if the gods were good to him he wanted to bid farewell to his mother she was in the womens compound now those whod brought the chest had told him a surprise a good decision for her though with his silver she could change that after in the same place he intended to find the old volur he wouldnt need long with her but hed probably have to leave quickly after though he also wanted to speak if possible perhaps only for a moment depending how events unfolded to a girl with a snakebite scar on her leg he might not actually be able to do so it was unlikely he could linger after killing the volur and he wasnt sure he could find a girl he wouldnt recognize the women kept watch at night even in the cold he remembered that remembered these fields too hed ridden gyllir the last time had a long walk now he kept close to the woods screened by them though it was unlikely any lovers would be out this early in spring the ground was cold youd need to be wild with desire to come out here with a girl and not find a barn or shed with straw he had two farewells to make he told himself and someone to kill then he could leave with his past squared away as much as that was ever really possible he was going to erlond hed decided where his people had settled in the anglcyn lands it was far enough away there was land to be claimed room to settle and thrive hed had a winter to think about possibilities this one made the most sense he heard a twig snap not his own footfall he froze drew his sword he had no desire to kill yet but the peace of fulla be upon you bern thorkellson when all you have to remember through the circle of an eventful year is a voice in the dark and the voice is that of someone saving your life you remember it he stayed where he was she came forward from the trees carried no torch he swallowed how is the snakebite he said only a scar now my thanks for asking she is still sending you out on cold nights iord no iord is dead his heart thumped he still couldnt see her but the voice was embedded in him he hadnt realized until this moment how much so how what i had her killed for both of us matteroffact no hint of emotion in her voice one less task for him tonight it seemed he struggled for words how did you do that one of the young women in the compound told the new governor how the volur had used magic to force an innocent young man to steal a horse from someone shed always hated he was still holding his sword it seemed silly to be doing that he sheathed it was thinking hard he was good at thinking and the young man went to jormsvik after the spell left him wanting to win glory efface his shame and did so he was fighting an entirely unexpected urge to smile and the young woman she hesitated for the first time she became the volur of rabady isle the desire to smile seemed to have gone as suddenly as it had come he couldnt quite have put into words why this was so he cleared his throat said a great and glorious destiny for her then after another pause a stillness in the dark he heard her say just a shape still an outline in the night it isnt in truth the destiny she would choose had she another path bern found it necessary to draw a breath before he could speak again his heart was pounding they way it had at champieres indeed would she have any willingness to leave the isle make a different life the other voice grew softer not as assured like mine he thought she might do that if someone wished her to it it could also be here that different life here on the isle he shook his head tried to make himself breathe normally he knew a little more of the world than she did it appeared in this matter at least i dont think so once shes been volur it would be too hard to live an ordinary life here theres too much power in what shes been this is too small a place whoever became volur after wouldnt even want her here the next volur might give permission a release from power she said it has happened he didnt know about that had to assume she did why would she do that she waited a moment then said think about it he did and it came to him he felt a prickling at his neck that sometimes meant the halfworld spirits were nearby sometimes it meant something else oh said bern i see she realized with a kind of thrill that he really did she wasnt used to men being so quick she said still carefully your mother asked me to welcome you home to say that she is waiting at the compound if you wish to see her now and to tell you that the door on the barn needs fixing again he was silent absorbing all of this i know how to do that bern said how do you know it is broken weve been to the farmhouse together the girl said your fathers it can be bought again if you want he looked at her only a shape you were not to be soft it was dangerous in these lands but you were allowed surely to feel wonder werent you a man went through the world carrying only his name some left that after them when they died lingering like a burning on a hill or by the sea most men did not could not there were other ways to live through the days the gods allowed you in his mind he spoke his fathers name ive never even seen you he said to the girl i know there are lights in the compound she said shes waiting will you come they walked that way the two of them it wasnt very far he saw the marker stone in the field a greyness beyond dawn he realized would be breaking soon over vinmark and the water upon the isle a greyer windier dawn would also come a little later farther west he still liked to keep a window open at night despite what wisdom held to be the folly of doing so ceinion of llywerth sometimes thought that if something was offered too readily as wisdom it needed to be challenged that wasnt why he opened the window however there was no deep thinking here he was simply too accustomed to the taste of the night air after so many years moving from place to place on the other hand he thought awake and alone in a comfortable room in esferth the year gone by had made one change in him he was entirely happy to be lying on this goosefeather bed and not outside on the ground in a windy night others would deny it some of them fiercely with their own reasons for doing so but he knew hed aged between the last spring and this one he might be awake sleep eluding but he was comfortable in this bed and guardedly always guardedly pleased with the unfolding of events in jads northlands he had wintered here as promised would be going home to his people now that spring was upon them again he would not travel alone the anglcyn king and queen would be sailing west to cadyr showing their new fleet to the world bringing their younger daughter to the cyngael he had wanted thissomething like thisso much and for so long alun ab owyn to whom she would be wed in what could only be named joy was the heir to his province and a hero now in arberth and ceinion could deal with his own llywerth easily there was so much that might come of this the god had been good to them beyond any deserving that was the heart of all teachings wasnt it you aspired to live a good and pious life but jads mercy could be extended as wings over you for reasons no man could understand in the same way he thought as the night outside began to turn a ruffle of wind entering the room towards morning and whatever it might bringin the selfsame way no man could ever hope to understand why losses came hearts grief what was taken away waiting for sunrise lying alone as he had these long years he remembered love and remembered her dying and could see in the eye of his mind the grave overlooking the western sea behind his chapel and his home you lived in the world you tasted sorrow and joy and it was the way of the cyngael to be aware of both another breeze entering the room dawn wind he would be going home soon he would sit with her and look out upon the sea morning was coming the gods return almost time to rise and go to prayer the bed was very soft almost time but the darkness not quite lifted light still to come he could linger a little with memory it was necessary it was allowed end it with the ending of a night i know not i what the men together say how lovers lovers die and youth passes away cannot understand love that mortal bears for native native land all lands are theirs why at grave they grieve for one voice and face and not and not receive another in its place i above the cone of the circling night flying never have known more or lesser light sorrow it is they call this cup whence my lip woes me never in all my endless days must sip c s lewis acknowledgements laura as always calmly confident from the days when i was first charting the sea lanes of this journey and remaining so when i cast off and shoals and monsters appeared that hadnt been on the charts charts can take one only so far in a novel but in a work of this sort drawing upon very specific periods and motifs of the past it is folly to embark without them and i have had the benefit of some exceptional cartographers if i may be indulged in a continuing metaphor there are too many to be named here but some must surely be noted on the vikings i owe much to the elegant and stylish synthesis of gwyn jones and to the work of peter sawyer r i page jenny jochens and thomas a dubois i have drawn upon many different commentaries on and translations of the sagas but my admiration for the epic renderings of lee m hollander is very great histories of the north are caught up in agendas today as is so much of the past and clear thinking and personal notes became a necessary aid i am grateful to paul bibire for answers suggestions and steering me to sources kristen pederson provided a score of articles and essays principally on the role of women in the viking world and offered glosses on many of them max vinner of the viking ship museum at roskald kindly answered my questions for the anglosaxons i found richard abels invaluable on alfred the great peter hunter blair stephen pollington on leechcraft and warcraft michael swantons version of the chronicles and the splendidly detailed work of anne hagen on anglosaxon food and drink were variously and considerably of use so were works written or edited by richard fletcher ronald hutton james campbell simon keynes and michael lapidge and the verse translations of michael alexander with respect to the welsh and the celtic spirit more generally i must mention wendy davies john davies alwyn and brinley rees charles thomas john t koch peter beresford ellis on the role of women the verse translations and notes of joseph p clancy and the classic unruffled overview of nora chadwick i am deeply grateful to jeffrey huntsman for permission to use his translation of the epigraph and for generously sending me alternative variants and commentary the poem that concludes the book is from the pilgrims regress copyright cs lewis pte ltd and is used here with their kind permission on a more personal level i owe gratitude to darren nash tim binding laura anne gilman jennifer heddle and barbara bersona panoply of editorsfor enthusiam en route and when i was done catherine marjoribanks brings more wit and sensitivity to the role of copy editor than an author has a right to expect my brother rex is still the first and perhaps the most acute of my readers linda mcknight anthea mortonsaner and nicole winstanley remain friends as much as agents greatly valued in both regards for many years when asked where my website was i would paraphrase cato the elder the roman statesman i would rather people asked id reply where kays website is than why kay has a website cato famously said that about the absence of statues honouring him in rome a while ago the markedly intelligent and insistent deborah meghnagi persuaded me that it was time for a statue online as it were and i gave her permission to devise and launch brightweavingscom i am deeply grateful for all shes done and continues to do with that site and i remain impressed and touched by the generous and witty community evolving there
