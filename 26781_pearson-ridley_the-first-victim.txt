ridley pearson the first victim chapter puget sound washington it came off the northern pacific as if driven by a witchs broom the remnants of typhoon mary which had killed in japan left homeless in siberia and flooded the western aleutians for the first time in sixtytwo years in the oceans open waters it drove seas to thirty feet with its eightyfivemileperhour winds dumping three inches of rain an hour and barreling toward victoria island the san juan islands and the largest estuary in north america known on charts as puget sound it headed for the city of seattle as if it had picked its course off a map and it caused the biggest rush on plywood and chipboard that king county had ever seen in the partially protected waters west of elliott bay one nautical mile beyond the established shipping lanes that feed seattles east waterway docklands the pitchblack night was punctured by the harsh illumination of shipboard spotlights that in clear weather might have reached a half mile or more but failed to stretch even a hundred yards in the dismal deluge that had once been mary the freighter visage a container ship rose and sank in fifteenfoot swells rain drumming decks stacked forty feet high with freight cars the asian crew followed the orders of the boatswain who commanded a batteryoperated megaphone from an upper deck instructing them to make ready the huge ship pitched and yawed and rolled port to starboard threatening to dump its topheavy cargo the crew had been captured inside marys wrath for the last three hundred nautical milesthree impossibly long days and nightsrarely able to sleep some unable to eat at work all hours attempting to keep the hundreds of containers on deck secure early on in the blow a container had broken loose sliding across the steel deck like a seventon brick and crushing the leg of an unsuspecting crewman to where the ships medic could find no bones to set only soft flesh where the shin and knee had once been three of the crew had tied themselves to the port rail where they vomited green bile with each and every rise and fall only four crewmen were available for the transfer that was to come the neighboring tug and barge seventy feet and closing off visages starboard bow were marked by dim red and green running lights a single white spot off the tugs bow and a pair of bright halogens off the tower of the telescoping yellow crane chained down to the center of the barge the tug and barge disappeared into a trough rising and reappearing a moment later only to sink once again into the foam the crane as ominous and unnatural as an oil platform the storm prevented any hope of docking the barge to the freighter but both captains had enough motivation in their wallets to attempt the transfer nonetheless like two ends of a seesaw the vessels rose and fell alternately the cranes tower pointing like a broken finger into the tar black clouds radio communication was forbidden signal lights flashed the only contact between the two captains finally in a dangerous and daring dance the two vessels drew close enough for the cranes slip harness to be snagged by the freighters crew on an upward pendulum swing briefly the barge and container ship were connected by this dangling steel cable but it broke loose of their hold the barge lost to another swell it was twenty minutes before the cranes steel cable was finally captured for a second time the vessels bobbed alongside one another the slack in the cranes cable going dangerously tight with each alternating swell the exhausted deckhands of the visage worked furiously to be rid of this container to a member wondering if it was worth the bonus pay they had been promised when the moment of exchange arrived the crane made tight the cable and the deckhands cut loose the containers binding chains while lines secured to winches on both vessels attempted to steady the dangling container for if it swung too violently it was likely to capsize the barge as the first of these four lines snapped the container dangling precipitously over the void of open foam between barge and ship shifted awkwardly suddenly at a treacherous angle above the deafening whistle of wind and the lions roar of the sea came the muted but unmistakable cry of human voices from within this container a crewman crossed himself and looked toward heaven a second line snapped a third the container swung and slipped out of the harness splashing into the water it submerged and then bobbed back up like a whale surfacing the captain of the visage barked his orders the mighty twin screws spun to life the gigantic ship lumbering to port and away from the barge and crane in an effort to keep the container from being crushed between the vessels the spotlights on the freighter were ordered extinguished as the ship was consumed by the storm lumbering back toward the shipping lane where it belonged behind it in its wake the abandoned container singing of human screams and cries of terror rode the mounting swells into darkness lost to the wash of the waves and the whim of the wind chapter on the evening of monday august when the coattails of typhoon mary had receded into little more than a torrential downpour a rust orange container appeared bobbing in the churning green waters and whitecaps of puget sound spotted by a copilot of a test flight returning to boeing field it was immediately reported to the coast guard loose containers were not an uncommon occurrence in the sound the urgency behind the coast guards efforts to recover the orphaned container began as a result of the threat to navigation especially with night closing in metal icebergs they were called this urgency was heightened however as the coast guards patrol boat came alongside the partially sunken container and human cries were heard from within at that point the call went out to the seattle police department the piano sounded better than ever for an old beatup baby grand in a smokefilled comedy bar where no one paid the instrument any attention except for the homicide cop who presently occupied its bench his large hands and stubby fingers evoking a somber rendition of blue monk its tone was earthy and mellow just the way jazz and blues were supposed to sound the notes flowed out of lou boldt without conscious thought or preparation sounding of the torments born of fortyodd years of life and a job involving all too much death boldt aimed his interpretation toward the table where his wife and friends sat if his fiveyearold son and threeyearold daughter had been there he would have had everything and everyone that mattered to him in this one room elizabeth his sweetheart wife and partner doc dixon the county medical examiner whod been his friend for most of boldts twentyplus years with seattle police john lamoia who had taken boldts place as a crimes against persons squad sergeant bobbie gaynes the first woman cop to join that squad daphne matthews forensic psychologist and confidante and the labs bernie lofgrin with his cokebottle glasses and leakingballoon laugh he didnt need to invent an emotion behind his playing lizs lymphoma had been in remission for one full year and boldts happy hour performance that night at bear berensons club the jokes on you had developed into an impromptu celebration of her progress a celebration that only a cops wife could tolerate but one that liz would actually appreciate morbid humor was a way of life with this group and while liz didnt totally fit in with the others they were family to her just as they were to her husband while few at the table were above teasing liz about how shed looked when her hair had fallen out during treatment or about smoking pot to bring on a taste for food no one was really talking about anything either no one discussed that his new desk job was a problem for boldt that he ached for the opportunity to slap on a pair of latex gloves and get back out into the field similarly no one talked about the fact that for lizs doctors her long remission was both unexpected and still unexplained they wouldnt recommend breaking out the champagne for another three to five years but liz herself was sanguine she credited god with her healing and boldt kept his mouth shut on that one he felt that he and liz had yet to recapture their comfort zone but he wasnt about to talk about that either so that night no one discussed much of anything they joked they drank they drank some more when the pagers started sounding it seemed like something orchestrated for a comedy sketch except that everyone knew immediately that it must be serious since one call simultaneously summoned the lab the medical examiner and the homicide squad lamoia flipped his cellphone closed and said its a shipping container sinking out in the sound people screaming inside still alive coast guards towing it ashore still alive liz echoed watching as all but daphne matthews headed for the exit those words meant more to her than anyone at the table liz offered a look of surprise that daphne stayed behind daphne explained they dont need me well i do liz replied though retreating into silence both confusing daphne and making her curious when club owner bear berenson got the jukebox going a few minutes later the rock music clashed with the earlier mood set by boldts piano he doesnt understand it liz told daphne she meant boldt the prayer he cant accept that i was healed by something outside of that hospital his background daphne said uncomfortably attempting to explain the womans husband to her if he wasnt a detective hed be a lab guy you know yeah i know liz agreed but its more that that he wont give it a chance it drives him crazy hes glad youre well however you got there he doesnt trust it has he talked to you about it no daphne lied she and boldt had once been more than friends just briefly she knew well enough to protect the deeper friendship they had now he doesnt say anything liz continued not directly but i know hes waiting for the other shoe to drop not that he wants itim not saying that of course not its just that he doesnt believe in it its inconceivable to him that prayer that god can have that kind of power that kind of consequence she organized the dirty glasses on the table for the waitress he doesnt believe it she repeated liz looked toward the door as if he were still there what if i talked to him about it daphne offered its not something that can be sold he needs to hear that from all sides daphne suggested he needs to hear this from within daphne thats the only way its going to make sense to have any resonance especially to him liz reached for daphnes hand and gave it a squeeze daphne felt this womans cold fingers held in her own warm palm and thought how quickly things change there had been a time when she would have cheered for liz to leave her husband now she was cheering for lizs survival youre an amazing woman she said as a chill whispered through her boldt marveled at the emptiness of the docklands at night the wide streets and warehouses deserted huge shipping cranes towered along the shoreline silhouetted against dull gray clouds that reflected back the glow of city light reminding boldt of his sons construction site legos kit that currently occupied the far corner of the living room the august air blew both warm and heavy laden with salt spray forcing all who awaited the raising of the container to squint and turn a shoulder toward shore boldt wore his hair trimmed short which didnt quite fit with his otherwise professorial lookthe wrinkled khakis and favorite tweed jacket worn threadbare at the elbows and sleeves his tight jaw and erect posture belonged to a man who meant business few people interrupted him when he was locked in thought eyes distant and yet strangely focused he deservedly owned the respect of all who worked with him due to his attention to detail and dedication to procedure that many in law enforcement preached but few practiced he occasionally spoke at law enforcement seminars and conferences and at graduate criminology courses on the role of homicide victims as witnesses the victim speaks his talk on the subject had been transcribed and posted on the internet boldt grumbled to lamoia about how long it was taking the coast guard to recover the container the cries and screams continued patience was running thin lamoia had stood at boldts side for the last seven years working in his shadow studying his every movement then rising in rank to take not only the mans stripes but even his desk and office cubicle lamoia wore his jeans pressed his shirts crisp his hair perfect and his cowboy boots gleaming he was focused less on boldt and more on his bootsbrand new boots that had cost him a months salary this salt spray was beginning to really piss him off he kept rising on tiptoe to pull his boots out of the puddled water piano sounded great tonight lamoia said are you kissing my butt boldt asked what are you after john i want to keep these new boots dry lamoia confessed so get out of here ill cover as a lieutenant boldt was expected to have no active field responsibilities technically the case was lamoias he was lead detective though under boldts direct supervision both men understood this boldt resented it despite his two decades of experience he was expected in the conference room not the street under a different captain he might have been given more latitude but sheila hill paid attention to rank and procedure a ladderclimber and well connected in the department hill was not someone to cross make it quick boldt said theyre going to get this thing up and open any minute now lamoia was famous within the department for his casual attitude and his willingness to stop and chat with any and every woman he encountered okay sarge lamoia still referred to boldt by his former rank he jogged back toward his fireengine red camaro and the police line established to hold back the press from where television news crews were already shooting the detective left briefly the field belonged to boldt pollys broken down in traffic shes not going to make it we need you slow down jimmy stevie mcneal said into the phone jimmy corwin was among the stations best producers but he worked in a constant state of high anxiety stevie found his energy infectious even over the phone he was proposing she take a live segment for polly as an anchorwoman stevie picked her reporting work carefully what are we looking at she asked weve got a shipping container found by the coast guard human cries coming from inside channel seven is already onair we need you oncamera in the next ten minutes youll post it up on the feed sure we will i need a promise on that jimmy the national feed could bring offers from the larger market when we see the piece well determine now you commit now or i okay agreed and its my followup my story stevie negotiated its going to mean original segments for us not just the five oclock leftovers the phone crackled and the window flashed blue with the light of an approaching thunder cell she said tell the crew im on my way the coast guard crew had attached inflatables to stabilize the container while it was being towed to shore those same inflatables currently kept the steel box afloat as the cries from inside continued swimmers climbed up and connected the cables to all four corners a supervisor signaled the all clear and the cranes mighty diesel growled loudly the cable lurched and snugged tight as the slack was removed and a pillar of slate gray exhaust rose from the cranes rusted stack the containers sunken end lifted from the black water that spilled from every crack and the cries grew sharper splitting the air and running chills down boldts spine a cheer rang out from the workmen as the container cleared the water altogether suspended and dangling as the crane moved it to dry land boldt was not among those cheering his nose working overtime he pulled out his notebook and marked the time dead body he wrote alongside the numbers a man stepped through the police line the officers clearing the way as he displayed his id broadshouldered he exuded a confidence that advertised the sports hed played in college while the inexpensive suit clearly said federal agent brian coughlie introduced himself as the ins investigator in charge shaking his hand was like taking hold of a stick boldt didnt know many agents from the immigration and naturalization service and said so he added glad to have your help on this one what youre going to find in there once they get the doors open is anywhere from fifteen to seventy illegals more than likely all of the adults are asian women in their teens and twenties better for the sweatshops and whorehouses which is where they all would have ended up these container shipments have been a thorn in our side for over a year now glad to finally have one with something inside part of that something is dead said boldt who was a little put off by coughlies arrogance boldt touched his own nose answering coughlies quizzical expression you think coughlie asked these things arrive pretty damn ripe ill tell you what dead boldt ventured and that makes the others in there witnesses you already jockeying for position lieutenant coughlie asked calmly a reminder lest you forget these are illegal immigrants so my boss is calling this ours i pick em up and i deliver them to federal detention you want to visit our house and have a chat with them we got no problem with that but your boss will have to clear it with my boss okay meantime these visitorsthe live ones anywaytake a trip on federal tires not the local variety and the dead ones yours to keep coughlie said that okay with you so long as you keep them apart from your general population i dont want them hearing stories getting coached well clean em up shave em and give em their own custom chainlink cage coughlie agreed no problemo barracks k our detention facility is part of what used to be fort nolan you know fo no i know of it you golf no boldt answered too bad theyve got a great eighteen out there maintained courtesy of the taxpayer you and mewed a been smarter to be military cant beat that retirement package lamoia approached at a run boldt made the introductions lamoia shook hands with coughlie but on his face was the expression of someone whod picked up a sticky bottle of honey by mistake weve got the turf problems all worked out boldt said easing lamoias concerns somebodys dead lamoia remarked ahead of you on that boldt said lamoia reached into his coat pocket and brought out a pair of plastic gloves and a tube of vicks vaporrub boldt accepted the tube after lamoia had smeared a line under his nose he passed it to coughlie who did the same some things a person couldnt live without when the container was finally opened with a bolt cutter a hush overcame the crowd as one by one nine chinese womenpartially naked bone thin and weakwere helped into waiting ambulances some on their feet some on stretchers three women came out in body bags coughlie suggested boldt give it a few days before attempting interviews i seen worse lieutenant but ive also seen better too thing about our squad lamoia informed coughlie the victims dont typically get up and walk away three of them didnt boldt reminded somberly whereas in mine coughlie explained were not in the habit of sending them home in a pine box stevie mcneal arrived by yellow cab and was met by two of the remote crew one who handed her an umbrella and a wireless microphone another who explained camera position stevie headed straight for the yellow police tape that she was prohibited to cross and crossed it anyway hey a black uniformed officer with a young boyish face shouted from beneath his police cap you cant stevie stopped and faced the man allowing him a moment to recognize her oh he said she looked him in the eye putting just enough juice behind her determined expression and said whos in charge lamoias lead he answered obediently but the lieutenants here too he pointed out a group of silhouettes she stood facing lamoia boldt and coughlie there werent enough ambulances on hand a few of the illegals wrapped in emt blankets were being offered water to drink between the coast guard and the police there were uniformed officers everywhere lamoia said this is a restricted area press has to stay on the other side of the tape the rumors are wild back there sergeant some say serial killer some say illegals illegals coughlie answered stevie locked eyes with him he wore an ins identification well have a statement shortly boldt interjected stevie tried to determine who to play to she asked the ins guy is this yours or spds coughlie answered believe it or not were working in concert on this so whos in charge of this lovein one of the body bags was carried past them by a team working for the king county medical examiner not ready for prime time lamoia quipped well have a statement shortly boldt repeated stevie nodded suddenly unable to speak chapter they met in the international district on a clear and sunny tuesday afternoon the intense sunlight capturing all the surroundings in a golden luminescence stevie mcneal arrived early unusual if not unheard of for her charged with excitement she dressed down for the meeting in blue jeans a black cotton tshirt and a new khaki safari overshirt shed recently bought despite her american heritage she still spoke with a faintly british accent courtesy of her fathers overseas service house of hong a dim sum restaurant alongside an elevated stretch of i south occupied a plain cement block of a structure with a large red plastic sign on the roof for all to see its modest parking lot the asphalt cracked and heaved was surrounded by a wilted chainlink fence draped like bunting from rusting bent stanchions the clatter inside was mandarin which was the language stevie used to greet the maitre d who was clearly surprised by her perfect inflection he led her toward a table where a chinese woman sat with her back to the door melissa was chinese twentysix years old with a simple confined beauty more radiance than pure looks she wore a white mantailored buttondown shirt and blue jeans her only jewelry a rubber watch that had extra buttons for lap times she swam two miles every day at the ywca and she kept her hair unusually short so that it fit easily under her cap stevie said you look good little sister and you thank you for coming on such short notice i love seeing you you know that melissa said a chance at a job as well what could be better i just dont trust men arranging secret meetings even ones offering to sell important information if id been through what youve been through melissa said a year earlier stevie had been stalked for over three months when the private security firm the station hired finally caught the man he turned out to have an arrest record for sexual assault rape and kidnapping though no convictions a waitress interrupted offering fresh dim sum from a steaming bamboo container melissa politely declined she removed a stenographers pad from her purse and placed it on the white linen tablecloth everything in its place that was melissa so she said stevie explained he claims to have information tied to that container that came ashore you like the stories with teeth its not a documentary but no listen i appreciate it freelancing you take what you can get not that i havent offered to get you a job with the station not that you havent offered melissa echoed when i earn a job at a station then thats different theyd been over this a dozen times we grew up in the same house we spend our weekends together our holidays our vacations stevie interrupted but if you used your celebrity to get me a job i understand perfectly well even this melissa said indicating the restaurant makes me uncomfortable youre perfect for this youre chinese and youre a freelancer if this bozo has anything worthwhile who better to pursue the story stevie added besides what a great excuse to charge a lunch off to the station melissa grinned and nodded she sobered and said all that youve done for me and dont deny it if i could repay onetenth of these favors what good is anything if you dont use it these are my fifteen minutes of fame when yours comeand they will comeim counting on you to let some of it rub off on me not likely dont say that your production work is the best around youll see a story like this if it proves to be good information this could break you out change everything im not holding my breath as the only caucasian male in the restaurant the man they were expecting stood out upon his arrival balding overweight with a drinkers nose and cheeks and an apparent taste for illfitting discount sports jackets he arrived carrying beads of perspiration beneath his unfashionably long sideburns and down his equally florid neck he searched the restaurant looking a little distraught until recognizing stevie she signaled him and he sat down eyeing melissa guardedly he said to stevie you look different than on tv your phone call stevie said he was not a man with whom she wanted to lunch she ordered an iced tea wanting this meeting over as quickly as possible your eyes your hair i dont know he mopped his face with the restaurants napkin and glanced around for a waiter he ordered a cape cod a vodka and cranberry and also waved off the offer of food melissa used her chinese to request they be left alone stopping the onslaught of dim sum i watch you every night the news he lowered his voice conspiratorially i thought you were the one to make the offer to you know again he glanced at melissa she works with me stevie clarified lets talk about this offer she said im a state auditor i thought it was king county she corrected state i oversee inventories of a half dozen state agencies everything from road cones to i dont know fax machines how fascinating she said were with you melissa said salvaging stevies breach this is a big story he said then perhaps we should hear it melissa encouraged he touched stevies hand and she instinctively jerked hers away maybe i called the wrong person he said maybe you did stevie agreed you touch me again and youre having pepper spray for lunch he apologized ive never done anything like this whistleblowing to the press its not something im comfortable with you count police cones stevie said recovering slightly from her malaise are you comfortable with that what else do you count mr melissa asked attempting to drag his name out of him he mopped his face again his teeth were stained from smoking do you know how movie houses keep track of the popcorn they sell popcorn stevie blurted out youre passing me a hot tip about moviehouse popcorn its not by how much they pop because it only takes a few kernels to make a cup of popped popcorn and its too random to estimate how many kernels go into each cup and also because they end up throwing out the stuff they havent sold at the end of the night or between shows listen really they count the bags the cups melissa said exactly the owner the manager tracks the number of bags used they inventory the bagssmall medium largeand thats how much cash the employees behind the counters are responsible for putting in the till its that simple not enough cash the employees make up the difference so the employees watch those bags closely same with soda cups exact same method the number of cups used in an evening determines cash flow bags and cups stevie repeated somewhat curiously at the lsosthe licensing service officesits the laminates the number of plastic laminates that go through each department these days the laminates have some printing embedded in the plastic to help cops sniff out counterfeits washington state department of transportation it reads that laminate validates the drivers license its very important to counterfeiters she supplied he glanced between the two women were listening melissa said beginning to jot down notes she flashed a look to stevie melissas eyes were hot black pinpricks of excitement stevie felt a rush of heat pulse through her he said one of my responsibilities is to inventory the lso laminates discards are tracked as well so the numbers have to work out counterfeit drivers licenses stevie said these connect to the container how ask yourself why the state would have me counting laminates why bother they cost the state twopointsix cents per laminate even at a few hundred were talking three or four dollars worth three or four hundred melissa repeated writing it down you lost me stevie said the states waste of your manpower she asked a little more interested is that the story youre pitching its the ids melissa said whats the street value of a fake id stevie asked now youre catching on the man said what value would you put on a counterfeit drivers license miss mcneal its ms she corrected i dont know depends if its kids trying to buy cigarettes or illegals trying to buy their freedom it certainly does the man agreed she reconsidered two hundred five hundred melissa asked when the sweating man only returned a grin to stevie how about thirtyfive hundred per license stevie spit some ice back into her tea what legal residence is the first step toward a work permit a work permit is the first step toward a green card the green card leads to citizenship he grinned its a big story see he said i have a name how much stevie asked five thousand he replied without hesitation stevie coughed out a laugh this isnt nightbeat were not hard copy she returned five hundred maybe i should call nightbeat its a long distance call stevie said she won a laugh from him its the hair isnt it you wear it different on the show its not a show stevie replied she felt cold all of a sudden she didnt like the business of fans its a broadcast its news the man took a moment to consider the offer a thousand he countered five hundred up front five hundred more if the piece runs you think im giving you my name some way to find me melissa said youve told us you are a state auditor you think we cant find you the condition of my cooperation is that you leave that alone leave me alone leave me out of it he added i happen to like my job stevie repeated five hundred if our producer goes along with it melissa here will bring you the money youll provide her the name of the lso employee with the bad laminate count if we run the piece you get a second five hundred you want to call us and set up the meetings thats fine give me two hours to run it by my producer id rather deal with you he objected no offense he said to melissa its melissas story not mine im an anchorwoman not a reporter you let us do our jobs you do yours you were the reporter did that container he reminded melissa said we like our jobs too let us do them he left the restaurant a few minutes later trailing some bad cologne they ordered food once he was gone melissa said youre asking for five twominute segments a review of the container tragedy this lso expose if it proves out and a piece on the detention center and what awaits illegals whove been detained correct i have no problem with any of that but if it leads to a bigger storyif i can connect these counterfeit drivers licenses to legal illegals if i can deliver the people behind it i need to know youll stay with me that no ones going to push me out and steal it from me it wont be me stevie said thats about all i can promise as long as im a part of it no one takes this from us fair enough and if it gets political ill run with this wherever it leads wherever you take it little sister in the meantime i keep the dialogue alivethe story aliveby interviewing anyone and everyone whos a part of this the ins the cops the detainees whatever it takes and if corwin doesnt want it going that way melissa asked what did we do when susu didnt want us doing something stevie asked appealed to your father melissa answered if corwin puts up road blocks ill take it over his head to new york i have plenty of contacts left youd do that im agreeing to do that for this story yes this story or for me melissa asked the story because i i know your principles stevie reminded interrupting this isnt a handout honestly if it proves to have legs and you want to pursue it ill stick by you you want to go undercover im with you but only if its exposure not entrapment thats all im saying then weve got a deal melissa suggested having never discussed her pay you get the story i get creative autonomy yes stevie agreed we have a deal chapter lamoia delivered the medical examiners preliminary report on the three chinese illegals who had died in the container the report though scientifically stated remained indecisive an enigmatic confusion that did little to support the investigations pursuit of homicide charges for the three deaths the illegals had succumbed to malnutrition and dehydration aggravated by symptoms consistent with those caused by a virulent strain of influenza as yet unidentified doc dixons emphasis expressed his unwillingness to draw firm conclusionsat least at the stage of the preliminary report the prelim went on to say that the corpses had sustained postmortem contusions likely the result of being tossed around at sea tissue samples were being forwarded to the centers for disease control cdc atlanta in an effort to identify the particular strain of flu the extent of malnutrition and dehydration suggested to boldt the possibility of filing charges of depraved indifference to human life against the captain and crew that had transported the container this in turn might lead to plea bargaining and names of those responsible for the trafficking in human lives a strategy began to reveal itself not much different than a drug raid or organized crime sting but more than anything he also recognized doc dixons underlying interest and curiosity in the unidentified flu strain and the memos carefully worded intentionally vague language dixie was holding his cards close to his vest buying himself time for that cdc report for boldt the fastest way to the name of that ship to the captain and crew was the illegals themselvesthe passengersthe nine women who had survived the passage and were currently being detained by the ins fort nolan was no longer an army base only its golf course had survived the budget cutting of base closures in the late s congress could evidently see its way clear to losing a few hundred civilian jobs and a thousand infantry but an eighteenhole course was not to be sacrificed under any conditions the result was that retired and active officers alike regularly shanked hooked pitched and putted only a hundred yards from former barracks that currently housed indigent asians and mexicans unlucky enough to have been caught and detained by the ins the more fortunate among them found themselves in service as ground maintenance crew or caddies enjoying a limited freedom spending their days outside the razor wire and receiving the occasional gratuity the bases hasty remodel by the ins had come as a boon to the chainlink contractors in king county boldt pulled his departmentissue chevy cavalier to a stop at the guard gate he and daphne matthews displayed their badges and stated their business in the far distance a man wearing khakis and a lime green crew shirt made a nice chip shot onto the green attorneys and government employees came and went with regularity at fort nolan but a pair of seattle cops was clearly something new for the guard studied their identification badges carefully and asking boldt to pull over inside the gate made a phone call they were provided an over photocopied map of the facility upon which the guard hastily drew directional arrows daphne navigated shouldnt john be with us daphne asked in fact shouldnt you be at the office and john be here hes lead he gets the joy of the paperwork boldt replied are we in denial of our rank lieutenant hill and i disagree as to the job description boldt said lets just leave it at that will she leave it at that would you have tolerated phil shoswitz in the field its different why because its you not shoswitz exactly have you heard the term bullheaded are you familiar with the word experience he fired back at her i certainly am and my experience she said intentionally cutting him is that both you and hill are bullheaded somethings got to give thereand shes got rank on you lieutenant boldt pursed his lips and pulled up to the curb she shot a look at him that could have caught a bush on fire the interview room plain and bare contained two long metal tables with formica tops surrounded by metal chairs with worn plastic cushions on the wall hung framed portraits of the president and the regional ins director adam talmadge the interpreter was a japaneseamerican woman in her forties who stood five feet tall in shoes with heels and dressed with a simple elegance the detainee was young and silently defiant her head and eyebrows were shaved lending her an otherworldly look she wore overwashed denim pants and a thin denim shirt with no bra her blue rubber sandals slapped the gray cement floor in a steady insistent rhythm an aide delivered four cups of tea boldt cupped his hand and whispered to matthews do you recognize her no daphne answered but i only saw photos yeah well i was there and she i dont know boldt went through the formalities of introductions through the interpreter he attempted to explain that the police had no interest in pressing charges against this woman or any of her companions then pen ready he said to the interpreter please tell her we need the name of the ship that transported the container the interpreter told him youll never get that out of her to give you that would put not only her at risk but her relatives here and at home perhaps agent coughlie should brief you before translate the question please boldt said interrupting wait daphne interjected catching the interpreters warning eye she whispered into boldts ear he shrugged and deferred to her saying go ahead daphne addressed the detainee you paid a great deal of money to be brought to this country what if we could get that money back for you erase that debt boldt wrote on his pad where daphne could read it smart the chinese woman replied through the interpreter yes we pay money to be brought america we in america yes shes an illegals poster child boldt mumbled daphne tried another tactic what if we arranged for you to remain in the united states legally would you help us then the interpreter interjected i will not be party to this kind of sham what sham daphne argued the service will never agree to such a deal have you spoken to agent coughlie of course you havent brian coughlie never makes such deals boldt inquired then how do they obtain information from these people listen im only the translator but im telling you ive never offered a deal to any female detainee it just isnt done the operating premise is that the women dont know anything they are rarely if ever even interviewed the male detainees the various gang members occasionally rounded upthe coyotestheyre a different story but in terms of the women fort nolan is nothing but a big bus terminal with all the buses headed home all the more reason she should cooperate with us boldt reminded were giving her a chance to be heard but you dont control their destiny the ins does agent coughlie does the subjects eyes ticked back and forth between her interpreter and boldt who was beginning to dislike coughlie already daphne said politely please translate the lieutenants offer if we cut her a deal that included a legitimate green card and her money returned could she supply us with the name of the ship and any details of crossing the translator spoke quickly behind poorly contained anger the detainee listened carefully looked surprised and then studied both boldt and daphne carefully after a long hesitation she shook her head no why daphne pleaded why volunteer for deportation the interpreter answered because boldt chided not you her the chinese woman shook her head a second time upon hearing the translated question the interpreter tried again with daphne they are warned before they leave the mainland that the americans do not keep their word their relatives both here in the us and in china will suffer if they talk to a chinese family is everything it would be shameful to put any family member at risk boldt addressed the translator the people who took her money nearly killed her they did kill three others more will die maybe relatives of hers who follow in her footsteps doesnt that mean anything to her he hesitated leaned forward and warned tell her that we will arrest her as an accomplice to those deaths if she does not cooperate this drew daphnes attention as well he continued tell her that if convicted she will not be deported but will spend the rest of her life in a prison with convicted murderers drug addicts and thieves exactly that exactly those words please the color had drained out of the translators face her eyes pleaded with daphne for intervention but daphne nodded at boldt you wouldnt do this the interpreter objected not another word from you boldt fired back other than what comes from her or one of us no more editorial three women are dead he repeated loudly now getting his earnestness across to the subject as well now translate the interpreter spoke to the woman who subsequently blanched at the idea of a prison term after a long and searching staring match with boldt this woman addressed her translator who upon hearing the words suppressed a smirk what boldt asked impatiently and i want it word for word the translator did her job the chinese detainee smiled for the first time without using her hand to shield her mouth her front teeth were missing what boldt repeated irritably the interpreter then reported she said you americans must have big prisons chapter the following day for five hundred dollars in cash the state auditor supplied melissa with the name gwen klein and the greenwood licensing service officein washington state the equivalent of a department of motor vehicleswhere klein worked melissa spent hours in the back of her van with a bulky broadcastquality video camera and battery pack perpetually prepared to record she shot tape of klein leaving the lso and running errands tape of klein picking up her kids from day care tape of klein grocery shopping her first report card was delivered in stevie mcneals sumptuous penthouse apartment over a pair of salads that stevie had ordered by phone the wine was an archery summit pinot stevie drank liberally melissa hardly at all about the only thing i have to report is that the husband is driving a brand new pickup truck and the house appears to have a new roof extra cash stevie suggested or a dead relative or a generous banker the husband pounds nails shes a state employee thats a thirtythousanddollar truck hes driving and new roofs arent cheap lets find out how he paid for that truck stevie suggested that would help us to pressure her shes not going to talk to us stevie said not without hard evidence of her involvement drivers licenses are small she could make a drop anywhere so you stay close to her stevie suggested i can stay close but i cant stick to her sure you can not and get tape at least not with that camera its the size of a school bus let me look into getting you the digital stevie said theres a briefcase for it that we use on all the undercover stuff you can go anywhere with it that would certainly help not anywhere dangerous mind you stevie informed her i want you to remember that melissa had been a risktaker all her life and if we dont get something more positive out of her in a day or two melissa asked then our friend at the dim sum doesnt get his second payment and the women in that container we forget about them dont do this to yourself stevie said do what work yourself up go righteous on me we have two options melissa said impatiently brushing aside stevies concerns journalism the first is to confront her oncamera with what we know the second is to make something happen journalism stevie objected since when confront her sure but entrapment if you cant break the news make the news melissa quoted thats not you and we both know it make the news fake the news thats not you corwin maybe but not you not make the newsbait the news we solicit a fake id she suggested stevie stood from the couch and paced the room thats dangerously close to entrapment melissa reminded who was it that said real news is never found its uncovered dont take what i say out of context three women died in that container the others were stripped naked deloused shaved head to toe and will be on a plane back to china in less than a week if i approach klein and she offers to sell me a drivers license then weve got her by the thumbs shes ours she either leads us up the next rung of the ladder or we extort her we pressure her whats gotten into you stevie asked you hired me to get a story i hired you to pursue a lead theres a big difference not to me since when look at me look at my face if not for you and your father that could have been me in that container those women are my age and younger are you going to walk away from them because we have to work a little harder to get the story you see stevie said you see what happens with you me what if its a strong enough story to run nationally she raised her voice we may have different reasons but we both want this story dont confuse the issue the issue is three dead women and more coming in behind them every week the issue is the deplorable conditions that allowed those women to die melissa added the police are investigating those deaths as homicides thats the story im interested in bringing down whoevers responsible and ill tell you what im willing to bend the rules for the right cause if klein sells me a fake id thats her problem its our problem too if we handle it wrong little sister these people see what people who thats exactly my point lets exercise a little patience shall we youve been on this a day and a half keep up the surveillance if you want a partner ill no this is our story yours and mine no one else and im in charge stevie asserted keep an eye on her one day is nothing try telling that to the women trapped in those containers patience yeah sure melissa snorted ill work on getting the digital camera thatll help right melissa beamed then you do want this of course i want it little sister i brought it to you remember but we talk it out work it out together weve got to set aside our personal agendas i want this as much yeah yeah melissa said interrupting you dont always have to mother me you know old habits die hard get me that camera work with me stevie said a team she suggested a team melissa echoed through one day and into the next melissa chow sat impatiently in her brown van following and videotaping gwen kleins movements from home to the grocery and for the second time in three days to a car wash midmorning melissa received a phone call from stevie stevie informed her a friend who works with a credit rating service says that there are no loans no liens on the dodge x registered to joe klein wheres that camera you promised are you listening they own it free and clear melissa asked her eyes on kleins taillights as the van sat parked in the automatic car wash stevie said sarcastically thats just a little unusual for a couple with a reported combined income of sixtyseven thousand a year a little unusual melissa exploded thats damn near impossible thats a thirtythousanddollar truck theres more the kleins credit cards which for seven years had maintained balances in the midfour thousands were all paid off over the last eighteen months so if nothing else shapes up we threaten to turn the kleins over to the irs there you go again stevie said just trying to think ahead dont stay where we are youre not the one chasing the allamerican mom from the grocery store to the when melissa failed to complete her thought stevie checked that they still had a connection im here melissa acknowledged okay so i missed the obvious little sister you know those trick posters that are all color and pattern and you stare at them long enough and suddenly this threed image appears you missed what stevie asked she washed her car two days ago i mean what was i thinking i sat right in this same spot talk about lame you missed what stevie repeated shes rolling i gotta go melissa said the phone went dead chapter boldt sat on the back porch on a warm friday night the kids in bed waiting for liz the slide projector at the ready aimed at the only smooth white surface available a door that had once led into what was now the kitchen pantry painted shut lately he had felt pretty much the same way as that door closed off stuck he might have set up the projector in the living room there was a wall there pretty much of it white if the framed watercolors were removed but the noise of the carousels clicking was certain to wake sarah who was as light a sleeper as her father and if she awakened it might be an hour or two before she could be coaxed toward slumber again so the carousel sat out there on a wicker table the yellow kodak box alongside boldt blinked in an attempt to decipher the firefly mystery he couldnt figure out whether he was actually seeing fireflies or if those spots of white light before his eyes were simply another sign of his total exhaustion i think we have fireflies he told liz when she finally joined him well need to cover miles before we go to sleep remind me would you the wicker creaked as she sat into it boldt wanted her twenty pounds heavier he wanted that wicker chair to cry when she took to it not simply moan i didnt think we had fireflies six years in this house i cant remember ever seeing a firefly i dont see any fireflies she informed him give it a minute he said over toward the back fence she eyed the projector if wed bought more carousels we wouldnt have to load it each time dont use it enough to justify two carousels we should have the slides put onto video then what would we use the projector for he asked she stared out into the lawn i dont see them thats what i was afraid of what are we looking at on her seventyfifth birthday my mother gave each of us slides of old family photos i remember these right old old family photographs right thats what i said he got the projector up and running and focused the image of a grayhaired lady onto the overpainted door i love summer evenings she said the charcoal in the air the freshcut grass shouldnt ever take any of it for granted my mothers mother he said she died in her sleep i remember her clothes smelled like mothballs hair like cotton candy but what sticks in my mind is that she died in her sleep thats the cop in you youre always more concerned with how a person dies than how he lived he didnt like the comment he sensed she might apologize for it and he didnt want her doing that and he wasnt sure why i think its strange id remember that about her howd your grandfather die no idea they never told me i guess he came over first he was the one who brought us here he fastforwarded through a dozen slides liz wanted him to stop at a few but he plowed through them with the determination of a man who knew where he was going he landed on a photograph a sepia print of a young boy of eighteen standing by the butt end of a huge fallen timber he said we were polish my father called us europeans this is about the container liz stated this is about the women who died boldt worked the projector through two more slides of his grandfather we all crossed an ocean at some point he observed your people came in the early s mine during the great war you think our people would make it in now all the qualifications and requirements dont do this to yourself technically they died of malnutrition but dixie says that some kind of flu was a contributing factor if they had lived longer the flu might have killed them hows that for irony she pointed i think i saw one she craned forward i didnt think we had fireflies not over there those are those christmas lights that they never take down he pulled off the carousel leaving a blinding white box on the old painted door liz jumped out of her chair with the enthusiasm of a little girl and made hand shadows of birds flying she wore shorts her legs were tan but too thin she made a ducks head and her voice changed to donald duck donald told him he worried too much she wouldnt have jumped up like that two years ago before the illness shed become unpredictable that way he didnt know what was coming next she wouldnt deprive herself of a single moment of joy she seized each and every one unabashedly he envied her that freedom that allowance of youth she was no longer painted shut can you imagine leaving christmas lights up all year she asked there ought to be an ordinance always the cop he loaded the carousel with shots of a vacation they had taken years before if your grandfather had never made the crossing we wouldnt be here she said thats whats bugging me i think if those women had lived at least for a while they would have had a legitimate chance at freedom they found a different kind of freedom she said he wasnt going to go there he wasnt going to touch that one for anything chapter what do we know boldt asked lamoia before the man ever sat down boldts office had been transformed into an art gallery the present exhibition finger painting and crayon coloring by daughter sarah and son miles he treasured each and every drawing had invented titles for most the scientists were wrong about the world spinning on an axisit revolved around his two kids i been following up on that fabric spent the weekend with dockhands customs and my face in the yellow pages thats the part of this job you forget sarge when you went up to lieutenant you got your weekends back the polarfleece boldt said yeah the bales we hauled out of that container along with the body bags lamoia answered boldt spoke with great but unfounded confidence for he was only guessing theres no bill of lading that can be connected to it no record of the container number no import company on record two out of three aint bad sarge whered i miss officially theres no import company that we can tie to that container lamoia corrected no paperworktrue enough but unofficially when lamoia got something right which was more often than not he enjoyed dragging out the success like a kid retelling an old joke hes just heard for the first time bernie lofgrin in the crime lab had the same bad habit of turning what could be a oneline answer into a tenminute lecture boldt felt no obligation to egg him on by responding so he waited him out after i struck out iding that container i decided to put the word out on the street nice and gentle like nothing too severe theres an art to working the street you know he said fishing for a compliment uhhuh boldt agreed its like lovemaking you start slow and easy and let things develop of themselves try to get around to your point sometime today if possible lamoia didnt so much as flinch he was on stage he was performing nothing could rattle him so rather than make an issue out of this i just let it be known that we would be interested in whosoever might be ordering polarfleece by the container load okay i know its not eddie bauer or reicause ive already checked with them cant be a momandpop with that kind of quantity so what the fuck chuck john boldt raised his voice enough to send the twominute warning it wasnt a snitch sargewasnt no squirrel the right snitch and i coulda worked some monopoly magic on him you know get out of jail for free or something along those lines okay coulda come up with a name a contact something firm enough to squeeze by the neck and start choking okay he stopped talking stopped and stood there waiting to elicit some kind of response from his lieutenant who sat impassively enough to allow another unsuspecting person to believe he had died there in the chair boldt would not did not move he waited lamoia took this all in and finally understood that he was to blink first part of me thinks we should contact ii before they contact us save em the trouble iiinternal investigationa pair of initials that drove a heat rash to the back of the neck of even the most honest and upright soldierinblue ii could stall careers stop paychecks and cause months of consultation with overworked attorneys on retainer to the police officers benevolent associationthe union lamoias suggestion meant that whatever hed turned up could put one or both of them directly in harms way the implication was obviousorganized crime was involved corruption swept through police departments and other government agencies like the flu passed one person to the next indiscriminate of rank race or gender like any contagious disease when its proportions became epidemic within the given population measures were taken to eradicate or at least reduce its influence a few scapegoats were found and hung out to dry while the others went more deeply underground throughout the course of his twentyodd years on the force lou boldt had carefully avoided and had never succumbed to even a hint of impropriety which occasionally amounted to a fulltime job he stood sentry at the gate alert and watchful he would not willingly rat out his fellow officer to internal investigations likewise he would not tolerate compromised police work he purposely avoided any social contact with individuals known or even suspected to have ties to organized crime including certain politicians and even a few of his own superiors at spd if even a whiff of a rumor surfaced boldt mentally added the name to his list professionally he could not afford such luxury crimes against personscapersimplicitly required fundamental knowledge of and contact with elements of organized crime whether the chinese triad the russian mafia or any of a number of gangs that in recent years had begun to pick up the crumbsthe street level crimesleft behind by their larger counterparts drugs prostitution auto theft and smalltime gaming while the russian mob controlled the brothels the gangs ran the street hookers while the chinese triad imported the coke and heroin by the boatload the gangs distributed them each group had cut out its own niche and for the most part left the other alone only at the street level the gang level was this not the case where hotheaded loyalties and romantic notions gave way to the occasional street war leaving teenagers and twentyfiveyearolds dead in the streets to receive a request for a meeting with any person known to have association with such organizations could mean the kiss of deathan eitheror offer that might include a threat to ones family or to ones life profession or aspirations there were few police officers who could not be reached given the appropriate pressure point boldt knew that of all his possible vulnerabilities his children presented the biggest target for such people he would never accept money nor improved station but if the health and welfare of miles and sarah were brought into play he knew he would be faced with one of two choicesstrike back or roll over each cop knew his own vulnerabilities boldt whose daughter had once been threatened guarded his carefully a cops home number was never given out never published in the phone books some lied to neighbors about their profession both to protect their families and to avoid being called into petty disagreements the game of dodging compromise of avoiding corruption was neverending and required great vigilance on the part of any police officer boldt included when the call came from mama lu he briefly gave pause it was the day he had feared most of his professional career lamoia was the messenger they had moved to the fifth floors coffee lounge boldt shut the doors and prepared himself a cup of tea so theres this girl i went out with for a while name of peggy wan woman boldt corrected lets hope so anyway we hit if off pretty great not that it lasted not that thats news boldt said but we stayed friends are you interested in this lamoia asked if its going somewhere if its the further adventures of i can do without it this morning your trail is littered with peggy wans john for your sake i hope someone comes along who actually means something to you just cause im altarshy gosh sarge i didnt know you cared boldt hesitated a moment too long to keep things on a joking level yes he said i do care lamoia stiffened while his smile softened and his eyes found a lint ball in the far corner of the room his bottom lip twitched beneath his mustache boldt said so tell me about peggy wan lamoia took a second longer to recover to regain the boyish enthusiasm and cocky independence that were his trademarks so peggy is evidently the niece of mama lualthough asians throw around this aunt and uncle business a little too often if you know what i mean and so maybe that explains why peggygod bless her silky smooth tushwent the way of other lamoia conquests a little too tight around the collar you know what i mean i hang with that piece of work and pretty soon im going to be doing the dance with mama lu herselfam i right and then im jammed but good so peggys name gets a line through it in seattles most famous black book but evidently she does reciprocate the favor the legend lives on boldt said on account i hear from peggy last night she calls my crib right which means she lifted my number off the home phone because i never gave it to her bedside phone no doubt and what does she want but to arrange a meet between you and her aunt me thats what i said to her mama lu exactly oh shit the man cursed uncharacteristically why me boldt protested i cant answer that i imagine she can and will youre coming with me i wasnt invited doesnt matter two of us in the room it changes the approach boldt reconsidered only if youre all right with it no arm twisting here john i dont want to put you into something you know yeah i do know but im cool with it you want me to hang with you ill hang we may both hang boldt warned ominously two sinewy lithe men stood outside the korean grocery smoking nonfilters that smelled like burning tires two men going nowhere they both wore nylon gym pants that whistled as they moved to follow lamoia and boldt through the stores screen door a seagull complained loudly flying overhead trapped by the buildings the international district occupied a fortyblock area south of the downtown core and just north of the industrial wastelands that gave way to boeing field of unremarkable architecture and few tax dollars the districts only color was its energetic people im lamoia the sergeant said turning to greet the welcoming committee this is boldt shes expecting us the mens faces were placid and unresponsive until one of them nodded his neck so stiff that the gesture ended up more of a bow boldt bowed back to the man lamoia mumbled thats only for the japanese sarge these two are chinese the grocery smelled of ginger and hot oil its floor plan violated the fire code with not a spare inch of unused space diapers and paper products kissing the centuryold tin ceiling where a dustencrusted paddle fan spun slowly trailing broken lengths of spider web like bunting they were escorted through the impossibly cramped butcher department where a bonethin grandmother wielded a chinese knife like an axe into a side of beef wizened and otherwise frail looking she had a smile that flooded them with kindness and her eyes flirted i think she likes you lamoia said as they climbed noisy wooden stairs through a dark hallway i hope she does boldt replied unprepared for what he saw next mama lu was the size of orson welles she wore a bright red housedress with gorgeous black hair braided down to her waist surrounded by piles of books and a single black rotary dial telephone she occupied a wingback chair under the floral shade of a standing lamp that fit her more like a commercial hair dryer yellowing roller shades were pulled to block any sun and a persistent air conditioner struggled in the one window that remained free of a covering offering a limited view of elliott bay and the islands beyond mama lu reached into a glass of water with fingers as fast as a frogs tongue and had her teeth in before her guests had introduced themselves when she spoke the windy baritone emanated from somewhere beneath the substantial bosom that hung off her like the continental shelf by the sound of her she had smoked for a long long time maybe still did unless the green oxygen bottle standing in the corner was more than decoration you honor me with this visit she said in passable english it is said boldt began that miss lus family is very large indeed mother to many friend to all you have made substantial contributions to our police athletic league to the firemen and to the hospitals and for this the city and its people are extremely grateful we are all of one family yes i wish more were as thoughtful of the family as you great lady yamoia you are friend to peggy wan yes miss lu she say you honest man this man with you mr both he honest man as honest and as good a man as any man i know that says much yamoia lamoia bowed slightly tell me about investigation mr both she said there was no mention of which investigation chinese immigrants are being treated like dogs shipped here in huge metal boxes like kennels without water without food it is inhuman and it must stop when a person runs from a monster he is prepared to suffer but these people pay for this my grandfather and i rode in the bottom of a freighter without sunshine without fresh air for over a month my grandfather paid much money for this things not so different today my people have been running from the red chinese for many generations now people enter this great country in many ways some legal some not boldt said i am not here to judge that but three women died in that container young women their lives ahead of them everyone involved is going to jail everyone they will end up in metal boxes just like their victims those who cooperate with the police will receive the lightest sentences mama lu did not move did not twitch she sat like a piece of stone in her padded throne all levity all kindness gone from her face yes she said deliberately slowly i agree boldt was surprised by this and spoke what his mind had already prepared to say the young women who survived will not cooperate with us will not share any information with us they scared of you with good reason i might add police at home not like police here but there are others these children their families in both countries will suffer if they cooperate and your family you give me far too much credit mr both she said her accent suddenly lessened her voice softer yet more severe her hard eyes fixed on boldt and not releasing him i have no influence over these children she struggled with a deep breath and said three died yes very sad but tell me this please how many die if they stay behind im only responsible for seattle great lady boldt announced i will make inquiries she said nodding her large head once again let an old lady see what she can find out the ship responsible boldt said the captain would be a good place to start you travel in the dark mr both move slowly the dark holds many unseen dangers the dark eventually gives way to the light not always ask officer tidwell but i will help you in return you will tell me of progress of investigation will keep my good name out of press so tired of the lies were all tired of the lies chinese blood moves in my veins mr both these three were my sisters my children your customers he dared to ask she grinned you bite hand that feeds you when im hungry enough he answered she lifted her soft pudgy hand and held it for a moment as if expecting he might kiss it then she waved dismissing them boldt stood and lamoia along with him lamoia said i thank you miss lu you be nice peggy wan yamoia she my niece directing her attention back to boldt she said move slowly the dark holds many challenges maybe i offer some light thank you you will visit whenever you like whenever you have something to tell me you always welcome boldt caught himself in a bow lifted his head and grinned at her back on the street and well away from the korean grocery lamoia said are you crazy sarge you basically accused her i communicated my suspicions oh you communicated all right if shes smart she gives them up theyll never bring her into it not with her reach they wouldnt last a week in lockup she gives us this operation and she skates what was that about tidwell lamoia warned you remember tidwell organized crime retired retired he went out for a morning jog came back on a stretcher every damn bone broken claimed hed been hit by a car car with four legs is more like it left the department on a medical disability cause he cant walk right mama lu remember that semi with the mexicans in the back dead of fumes word was mama lu had a piece of that trucking company that was tidwells baby until his unfortunate accident are you trying to warn me john she was thats for sure he said emphatically eyes wide the leather soles of his ostrich boots slapped the sidewalk loudly with each long stride he said to boldt im just trying to tell you to listen up either that or id up my blue cross if i was you chapter melissa accepted the digital camera from stevie along with two very small tape cartridges and an extra battery they talked in the corner of kstvs news studio while all around the crew prepared for the live broadcast of news four at five as stevie handed her the camera bag she felt compelled to caution melissa this is not a license to take matters into your own hands i understand dont be so glib about it i understand that you have to say that you have to protect yourself and the station its not that at all its you im trying to protect your nurturing instinct melissa asked youre to clear everything with me ahead of time of course i am im not kidding damn it ms mcneal the floor director called out two minutes stevie dismissed the person with a brutal wave she looked at melissa and saw trouble youve got something going dont you i know that look melissa shook her head what were you saying about the car wash stevie asked nothing but a hunch a pictures worth a thousand words and ive got some good pictures youll see when she persisted at the pay phone i overheard him mention the graveyard melissa whispered stevie suffered a bout of chills who him what graveyard ms mcneal the floor director called out im coming stevie snapped when she turned around melissa was already leaving the studio stevie knew that the thing to do was to go after her to stop her melissa suffered from professional tunnel vision wait she called out sixty seconds the floor director announced ill call you tonight melissa mouthed silently holding her hand to her ear as to a telephone you call me stevie demanded still tempted to abandon the anchor desk and stop her little sister im going to wait up for that call an intern held the double doors open for melissa who looked back one final time and smiled at stevie again she held her hand to her ear she would call thirty seconds places please stevie moved reluctantly toward the anchor desk the pit in her stomach growing ever deeper if she hadnt had the interview with the head of the ins lined up she might have bailed as it was she climbed into her anchor chair and reviewed the script while the soundman wired her she had a sinking feeling about melissa that she couldnt shake it felt more like a farewell than a goodbye the temperature of the studio hovered in the midfifties a concession to the computerized electronics the floor director reading the shooting script was dressed in a cotton cardigan behind the anchor desk things were a little hotter because an intern had delivered stevies latte with a teaspoon of real sugar instead of sugar substitute stevie slid the mug aside combatively and studied her own script one last time no matter how many times this team prepared for a broadcast nerves were always taut news four at fives continuing efforts to keep the number one nielsen rating in the race for local news viewers had a way of turning up the heat stevies male coanchor william cutler was more intent on his appearance in the monitor than on the script billybob as stevie referred to him spent his time at ribboncutting ceremonies and lunchtime speaker appearancesappreciating the fees for these extracurricular activities quite a bit more than the news she checked herself one last time in the monitor at thirtyseven she knew the camera still flattered her her hair was highlighted and cut shoulder length her camisole cut a little low a little bare a little tasteless but just right for the producers and their precious ratings those ratings justified a contract that included a town car and driver to shuttle her to and from her allexpensespaid fivebedroom coop apartment a promotional arrangement with nordstrom provided her with a wardrobe all for a fivesecond credit in the closing scroll the creamy pale skin of her surgically enhanced cleavage and the ease with which she carried herself had won her a description of overtly sexual by newsweek in an article about the decline of standards in local news broadcasts whatever the criticism the ratings remained superb only billybobs libido threatened to bring them down there were rumors of high school girls drugs and allnight parties if billybob didnt keep it zipped n was in trouble fifteen seconds announced the floor director standing between the two robotic cameras headphone wires trailing she held a handscrawled notice to remind both anchors of an insertpage b that was not part of their preprinted scripts hair william cutler shouted as he preened the studio coiffeuse bounded up on stage as the floor director continued the count ten seconds the hairdresser who carried a sheen of perspiration on her upper lip dragged a brush carefully across cutlers lacquered coif and toyed with an escaped lock you idiot what are you a dog groomer give me that cutler stole the brush away from her and laid the lock down nine clear the set eight the floor director droned not the slightest hint of concern in her voice pros every one of them the hairdresser stepped off camera as a snarling cutler inspected himself in the monitor once again he threw the brush off set at the young hairdresser four three two stevies face lit up as she faced the camera she typically lived for this moment hundreds of thousands of viewers hanging on her every word but melissas earlier zealousness negated the usual thrill the prerecorded voice said into her ear and now seattles most watched news team stevie mcneal and william cutler and news four at five stevie read from the scrolling text her smile picture perfect her tone slightly hoarse and sensual her eyes soft and locked onto camera two sadly the news was there to fill the time between the ads a mentor had explained that to her when she had been coming up in new york hoping to make the jump from oncamera reporter to anchor sources close to the illegal alien investigation resulting from a shipping container being fished from puget sound say that detectives from the homicide squad of the seattle police department have now questioned at least one of the detainees who survived the passage the interrogation is said to have revolved around a failed attempt at a plea bargain agreement that left police with few if any leads file footage rolled of the containers recovery and the blanketed women being led to emergency vehicles in related news the preliminary autopsy of the first of three women who died in the crossing is said to suggest that the victim died of natural causes namely malnutrition and dehydration though it appears uncertain these conditions were anything but the result of negligence on the part of the ships captain identifying the ship involved in the transport of that container and the ships captain are believed to now be the target of the ongoing investigation news four at five will carry a live interview with adam talmadge regional director of the immigration and naturalization service later in this broadcast william cutler and his brazen voice took over reporting a homicide in madrona that afternoon some poor kids lights had been dimmed over a parking space dispute they alternated the anchor work on the more gruesome and hopeless stories she tried to leave the outandout bleeders for billybob but when the illegals had washed ashore in a sewageencrusted container abandoned there by some greedy sonofabitch she held on to it all the stations radio and tv were still leading with it the nationals were interested spurred on by the feed of stevies first reporting of the story it was hot she was hot because of it and when something started burning hot you fed the fire with any fuel available if not exactly in execution she and melissa agreed in concept this was one story that had to be told and it had to be kept alive to be told pending a coup by the citys prosecuting attorney who hoped to hold the detainees as material witnesses to a homicide the illegals were rumored to be scheduled for deportation to return to whatever lives theyd fled out of sight was out of mind stevie considered it her job to keep the story current and in front of viewers while melissa sought out the possible connections to the people responsible in the business of reporting corruption disease and death the opportunity to investigate and expose a criminal ring that exploited human beings was a rare opportunity for once her work could count for something more than filling time between ads but for that to happen she had to keep the publics attention riveted to this story she embraced this as a personal challenge following a lead by billybob stevie read six more lines from the telepromptera crack house catching fireand then settled back into her swivel chair as a taped report took over the floor director signaled camera three lifting a hand like a race car flagman that hand dropped and stevie recited from the scrolling script stay with news four at five for an exclusive interview with adam talmadge northwest regional director of the ins based here in seattle as we continue our investigation into the trade in illegal immigrants in high seas high stakes back after this break the tv screen went to ads thirdquarter revenues were up percent stevie knew the numbers clear shouted the floor director stevie living room william camera two in sixty adam talmadge wore a dark suit a white buttondown shirt and a blue tie bearing red eagle heads his wingtips were resoled but well shined he had most of his hair a light gray curly nap cut close to his scalp dramatic black eyebrows and clear blue irises like fresh ice or taxidermy glass his face filled with a reserved but friendly caution as he shook hands with stevie his eyes did not stray to her anatomy for even an instant as some mens did and she ascertained immediately that he was well versed in media performance she had little doubt that by agreeing to the interview talmadge brought his own agenda she had in fact requested that this interview be with coughlie who presently occupied a formedfiberglass seat offcamera but talmadge had accepted for himself all set stevie asked her guest my pleasure he said the floor directors arm prepared to flag her and chopped with authority news four at five is pleased to welcome adam talmadge northwest regional director of the immigration and naturalization service based here in seattle welcome good to be here stevie the ins is the gateway through which every legal immigrant must enter this country she said it also maintains its own independent federal police force at our borders and ports of entry you detain how many individuals a year here in the seattle area talmadges tan spoke of a low golf handicap he said we detained approximately twentytwo hundred individuals in the last calendar yearbut let me just say that says plenty stevie interrupted setting the tone for the interview she would resist allowing talmadge to stray and change the topic the way the media coaches taught and of those approximately how many arrive by container or ship a third to onehalf perhaps he glanced imperceptibly off camera toward brian coughlie she stated so of those detained seven hundred to one thousand illegal immigrantspolitical refugeesenter this city as stowaways or human cargo or slaves political refugees account for only about ten percent of all illegal entries he corrected and what percentage of all illegal entries are in fact detained by your service we have no way to measure that an estimate she asked if we were fifty percent successful wed be pleased less than ten percent of drugs coming into this country are seized she challenged reading from her notes why would your results be significantly higher drugs can be hidden in a ski pole can be left on the bottom of the ocean for a month airdropped into national forest were dealing with human beings he reminded so if your twentytwo hundred is fifty percent there are roughly five thousand illegals entering via the northwest each year and yet the national number is more like three hundred thousand isnt it the majority of whichsome eighty percentcome across our southern border mexico from mexico yes and here asians account for most of the illegal immigration do they not thats correct chinese a large percentage are from mainland china yes vietnam indonesia political refugees she said returning to her earlier point talmadge pursed his lips and cocked his head we screen carefully for those individuals with legitimate claims to political persecution and yet a recent ruling by congress allows detained illegals only nine days to confirm their status as political refugees isnt that right six working days he corrected she attempted to contain the gleam in her eyes from having purposely overstated the waiting period luring him into the correction after which they are deported and returned to their country of originwhatever their fate there that is generally the procedure yes and to qualify as a political refugee these individuals these refugees have to be able to prove they have been tortured tortured is a strong word either physically or mentally abused he corrected or at substantial physical risk if they remained incountry as i understand it she went on select ins agents are receiving special training that has itself come under fire from both capitol hill and the psychiatric community your department employs how many such specially trained interviewers she asked three talmadge replied with another glance to coughlie only a small percentageten percent perhapsof all illegals claim political refugee status then you support the new policies she tested talmadge returned quickly congress has enacted one of the most farreaching sweeping overhauls to the immigration act this century making our borders more welcoming than they have been in over seventy years while reducing paperwork and increasing efficiency on the part of this agency as to those people out there perpetrating these crimes against their fellow human beings all i can say is that such behavior will not be condoned by this administration nor by the immigration and naturalization service we will ferret out those responsible and we will see them in prison for their actions i should add that the seattle police are currently conducting an active homicide investigation into the three deaths aboard that recent container let this serve as notice the black market in human cargo is over immunity will be offered to the first few willing to expose this trade the rest are going to prison stevie then understood talmadges agenda he had used the broadcast to soapbox for informants the floor director signaled stevie who wrapped the interview quickly clear the floor director shouted william camera two two minutes talmadge stood and unclipped his mike he brushed himself off as if hed eaten a meal brian coughlie stepped up to stevie good questions vague answers she replied talmadge winced a smile and headed for the exit he clearly expected coughlie at his side dinner coughlie asked her no thank you she answered an offcamera interview source close to the investigation youre getting warmer she said i can provide more specific stats he offered stevie told him ill call you good he said he reached out and they shook hands coughlie kept hold of hers a moment longer than necessary she didnt like the feeling she wouldnt flirt to get a story she turned and walked toward the anchor desk confident that brian coughlie was watching chapter seven years had passed since boldt had consulted dr byron rutledge at the university of washingtonsthe udubsschool of oceanography rutledge a physical oceanographer who had a long history in the department was a leading authority on the tidal currents of puget sound and had once assisted boldt with a homicide investigation involving a body washed ashore by those currents as north americas largest estuary puget sound experiences unusual but highly predictable tides and currents including some of the fastest surface currents in the western united states rutledge was of medium build and height with his carefully trimmed abraham lincoln beard his ice blue eyes and his smokers pipe he looked the part of salty dog the office was cluttered with paperwork graphs charts and reports occupying most horizontal surfaces its walls were adorned with engravings of squareriggers brigs and whalers as well as a chalkboard and a rack of maps that retracted like window shades you know rutledge said in a smoky voice about a year after we worked together a prosecutor from skagit county asked me up there to work another corpse i had a hell of a good time with it im almost ashamed to say so a womans remains were found in bowmans bay west of deception pass pretty much like the one you had on the beach this one turned out to have been thrown off deception pass bridge by the husband a conviction wasnt it boldt asked recalling the sensational trial rutledges teeth discolored from the pipe smoking looked like a rotting picket fence youre looking at the states expert witness that boy won himself a cell for thirtyone years his people challenged my findings on appeal and lost again the smile was contagious so this time the man said referring to the phone call that had arranged the meeting its a shipping container he nodded you wouldnt believe the number of lost containers drifting out there in open water theyre a primary cause of collision damage at sea ask the insurers boldt said your people had a chance to look over the container rutledge nodded did you bring the stats for me boldt slid a piece of paper across the mans desk weight of the container number of souls inside weight and approximate volume of the bolts of fabric he added the fabric was sealed inside sixmillimeter visquine rutledge peered over the top of reading glasses he had donned you want to be able to trace that container to its mother ship boldt told him we need the ship if were to get to the ships manifest did your inspection tell you anything boldt had arranged for rutledge to visit the container smelling it did rutledge said no portapotty no you imagine living like that for a twoweek pacific crossing boldt repeated anxiously anything at all open water exerts its personality on anyone or anything it contacts the waters of the northern pacific differ greatly from the more brackish estuary water we find in the sound began the professor this can be attributed to the presence of fresh water from the dozens of rivers and tributaries within its seven hundred square miles the rivers empty into the estuary fast enough so the estuary refreshes despite the higher salinecontent ocean water in the outer strait and west of vancouver island for that reason puget sound plays host to several hundred specific floral and fauna indigenous only to estuarine waters microorganisms that wont be found a hundred miles north or forty miles west you remember raising pollywogs in fifth grade science and how fast scum coated the walls of the aquarium the same thing happens in the sound or out in the ocean its real apparent if a vessel is left sitting a long timethe algae and barnacles take over quickly that algae is preceded by bacteria and diatoms that begin affixing themselves within six hours of submersion a puddle a freshwater pond an estuary the ocean it doesnt matter there is a long food chain just waiting in the cafeteria line and that gives marine biologists a trail to follow the same way an entomologist can study a corpse for insects rutledge continued a marine biologist can study microorganisms and algae on the hull of a shipor even a containerand estimate fairly accurately how long that surface material has been immersed and in what kind of water a clock boldt asked apprehensively very much so you gave our arriving students a very valuable field trip followed by equally valuable lab time im grateful for that opportunity and did we learn something boldt said rutledge answered one mans slime is another mans gold mine he hesitated for effect leaving boldt hanging several million small organisms adhering themselves in predictable progression to the immersed sides and bottom of your container what these marine bacteria diatoms and attached larvae tell us is that the container was immersed in brackish watermore precisely the waters of the sounds central basinfor between sixteen and twenty hours no more no less the accumulation of hydrocarbons from the waters surface that adhered to the sides of the container tell us that it was at one pitch for maybe half that timeabout fifteen degreesand then took on additional water sometime around the eighthour mark changing the pitch closer to twentytwo degrees while increasing the depth of its draft by three feet we can use that sixteen hours the presence of diatoms and barnacle larvae attached over the bacterial colonies confirms this yes all the work done by the students has been doublechecked sixteen to twenty hours thats your window of time no more no less boldt repeated while taking notes just maybe youve saved this investigation were not through no rutledge challenged boldt weve looked carefully at those bales of polarfleece fabric and the way that they were sealed and it presents an interesting possibility im listening rutledge answered what if this particular container was never intended to reach a dock but was supposed to be transferred at sea such a transfer is exceptionally dangerous your organizer planned for this bought himself insurance by using those bales as internal flotation in case a container leaked water those bales are effectively huge balloons hed lost one before boldt said noting rutledges expression let me just say that even with enough flotation to keep it from sinking even in calm waters i wouldnt want to have been inside that container if they attempted this in the storm we had the other night he didnt bother completing his thought if they did attempt it during the storm boldt said could you tell me where indicating the paper boldt had provided rutledge said these are the coordinates where it was found the first is approximate noted by the plane that spotted it the second was provided by the coast guard exact time and gps location of the intercept rutledge approached his maps he wore wrinkled khakis and leather deck shoes the same as boldt an expert on the waters of puget sound rutledge pointed to a spot on the surface current map nearly instantly it was first spotted here recovered here he said moving his fingertip an inch west surface area exposure to wind weight and the speed and direction of currents will all have affected its course i cant give you a specific location as we have a fourhour window of time within which to work but what i can do is backtrack its probable drift route for a period of sixteen to twentyfour hours prior to its being spotted to estimate the transfer location we have satellite images of that storm weather station records of surface winds tidal charts and current information for all depths plenty of data so if i get a list of all container ships that docked twenty to fortyeight hours after this one was spotted and you can do that through port authority rutledge suggested boldt followed the reasoning to its logical conclusion if you can give me a probable location where the transfer was attempted then we might be able to predict which of the arriving container ships could have been in that area of the sound during that window of time nodding rutledge informed him since we last worked together weve computerized much of the data do you remember the model in the science center several years earlier boldt had spent an afternoon testing rutledges predictions on a working model of puget sound that accounted for tidal flow and water salinity rutledges work had been proven flawless of course i do gone its all done on computer now and its far more accurate the computer analysis group should be able to give us the exact course that container traveled he indicated a spot on the map of surface currents my guess is the transfer was attempted in here somewhere he turned his attention to a stack of bound volumes by his desk and referencing the map on the wall selected the third in the stack the volume contained pages upon pages of computerized maps marked by time and date and containing curving arrows and numbers that clearly indicated tidal current direction and speed several times rutledge referenced the wall chart before leafing several more pages deeper into the images then drawing a gentle curve with his crooked index finger with its long flat nail and tugging with his lips on the unlit pipe so that it whistled he concluded somewhere in here is my guess he crossed to the wall chart and declared well have the computers work the realtime data so that wind conditions can be considered for greater accuracy he stabbed the chart with authority rutledge was of an era and a mind to not leave everything to computers but whatever ship lost that container whatever fool captain was insane enough to attempt a transfer on that of all nights he did so right in here the man drew a small eyebrow of an arc on the map well away from where boldt might have guessed he said he was a mile or more out of the shipping lanes does that give me anything to work with boldt wondered aloud onboard radar rutledge said suddenly brighter the port authority should have had him on radar but on a night like that the other ship captains certainly did you talk to the watch officers of the transiting vessels theyd have been watching him carefully since the vessel was well outside the shipping lanes that would have aroused curiosity a night like that you remember believe me the bridge officers he paused drawing on the pipe again theyll be able to tell you who or what the hell was out there chapter an allconsuming darkness spread before melissa so that she moved forward with the caution of the blind this had developed into a mission no longer a job so that as she moved through this darkness quietly and slowly a knot gripping the center of her chest drenched in sweat driven to the surface by taut nerves she also experienced a sense of righteousness a gray mouth of a windowlike opening appeared ahead of her and she approached it cautiously inching forward in tiny thoughtful steps the strap of the camera case slung over her neck and shoulder this opening accessed a descending conveyor belt of cracked black rubber that smelled horribly sour and hadnt run in a decade or more she tucked her five feet two pound frame into a ball and slipped through the opening and down the conveyor the unnerving sound of machinery growing ever louder ever closer her fear manifested as a sharp pain at her temples and pricking her searching eyes the fear resulted not only from awareness of her predicament but also from the knowledge that she had directly ignored stevies instructions had failed to call and despite melissas seeming impatience with stevie at the time she trusted her older sisters instincts and experience somewhere not too far down inside her she felt like a child disobeying her parent she now knew she should have at least left stevie a voice mail message to apprise her of her whereabouts and plans this annoying sense of having done wrong continuing to plague her as the sounds of machinery grew ever louder the area inside the conveyor more constricted and the air more foul she attempted to stave off total panic through a series of deep breaths while she pulled out her cellphone only to reconfirm that the signal had dropped off she couldnt call out the far end of the conveyor offered her an elevated view of an enormous room where that roar of machinery became painful laid out below her dozens of womenperhaps a hundred or moretoiled at huge industrial sewing machines she prepared the camera the poor lighting now her biggest concern she recorded some images from that vantage point and was about to move on when it occurred to her to find a place to hide this tape for retrieval on her way out if at any point she was forced to run to abandon the camera and case she would still have one of the two tapes to later collect as proof of the sweatshops existence even as she worked to capture the story below she couldnt entirely dismiss the thought that she could be caught she had amplified that risk substantially by simply coming inside with the cameras viewfinder indicating too little light melissa nonetheless recorded the oppressive conditions belowemaciated women their heads shaved bare towering bales of fabric enclosing them like walls the air clouded with a hazy dust the rooms only light coming from small dim bulbs fixed to the sewing machines the asian women worked furiously some sewing others at cutting tables still others gathering the finished product into bundles two chinese males patrolled the floor carrying what looked like nightsticksgang members probably another wave of fear overcame her the chinese gangs were notoriously ruthless she zoomed in hoping that she could capture the feeling of the place exhausted faces drenched in sweat the frantic pace the tension of the guards presence through the lens she followed a leg chain from where it was bolted to a sewing machine which was in turn bolted to a bloodraw ankle she moved stationtostation womantowoman not all were chained but enough to know the lengths to which the guards went to prevent escapes or ensure discipline like slaves she thought if they shackled their own seamstresses what would they do to an uninvited nosy journalist perhaps she should turn back now she already had some incredible images but she did not yet have the story she wanted oncamera interviews with the illegals pictures of the deplorable living conditions she felt certain she would find with a little more digging she was a journalist not a cameraperson and this was a careerdefining moment she went ahead as planned and removed the cameras tape in order to hide it well enough so that no one would find it before she could come back and get it she then worked her way farther along the catwalk that hung over the huge room finally entering a long passageway that descended by steep metal stairs toward the sound of running water she felt her way to a steel door its handle removed to prevent its use to trap the inhabitants on the other side but as she put her eye to the hole left behind by this missing hardware she understood its other purpose as wellit offered the guards a peephole into a shower room she counted five women in all naked and shaved of all body hair the room might have once been used for storageno drains or faucets just garden hose and plastic showerheads secured to and hanging from the overhead pipes the womengirls reallystood clustered together shivering under the limp stream of water their faint whispers in the foreign tongue barely audible melissa craned to one side and spotted a sixth woman who stood sentry melissas side of the metal door was fastened shut with two oversized dead bolts one eye to the hole in the door melissa waited for her chance to enter she could interview these women thanks to her chinese and then a more devious thought occurred what if she were to become one of them live with them work with them what if she could spend a whole day and a night here who would notice one more chinese woman among the hundreds she grinned a grin of satisfaction her attention no longer on the women showering but on a bar of soap and the pink plastic razor teetering on the ledge directly across from her and the knowledge of what had to be done tuesday august day missing chapter by midnight that tuesday night stevie mcneal began to worry a latenight person she often didnt go to bed until after the start of the new day giving up the reruns and reading herself to sleep melissa by contrast was a morning person and as such went to bed early on all but the rarest occasions melissa had not called the night before as promised she wasnt answering at the apartment nor on her cellphone which led stevie to believe she was out conducting the surveillance just the idea of which made stevie anxious and worried she blamed the womans silence on her own bossy attitude during the meeting with the state auditor and the fact that with the two women knowing each other as well as they did melissa could easily have interpreted stevies attitude as a signal for her to deliver for the past three years she had pushed her little sister to take the job offer she had arranged with the station to take a regular paycheck rather than wallowing in misplaced pride and the unpaid bills of a freelancer but melissa declined the offered hand in part because it came from stevie and in part because of a refusal to compromise her work with a lot of worthless puff pieces ordered by an editor desperate to fill the time between ads stevie secretly admired the womans nobilityin retrospect she had compromised her own career far too quickly by always taking the first job offeredbut it did little to appease her present anxieties at one in the morning she called both numbers again now taking to pacing while she thought this all out another aspect of melissas native pride was her professional secrecy she had once worked on an independent environmental piece for three weeks before finally letting stevie in on its subject mattersalmon poaching by native americansas if by being let in on it stevie would have sent a camera crew out on the story in the week since the auditor had leaked the lso information stevies only real knowledge of what melissa was up to involved the surveillance of gwen klein beyond that and the financial information they had collected on the couple she had few other leads to follow if needed stevie finally fell asleep out of the exhaustion of being consumed in worry when she awakened she immediately called melissas numbers from bed but only to hear that awful sound of endless ringing she skipped the nordic trak skipped the lazy morning routine of four newspaper subscriptions and the audio wallpaper of continuous cnn that typically occupied the first few hours of any day and headed directly to melissas apartment in pioneer square an apartment for which she had cosigned the lease an apartment for which she held a spare set of keys warm in her hand the apartment offered nothing she rang the buzzer on the ground floor then let herself into the building then knocked on the door to b and opened it when melissa failed to answer a modest one bedroom with a small livingdining area it offered a poor view of a side alley and no crossventilation had the windows been open which they werent it was in fact the slightly stale scent of the place that told stevie melissa hadnt been there recently melissa lived for fresh air this contradiction spoke volumes she found fresh food in the refrigerator and a garbage can filled to overflowing it felt dangerous all of a sudden like realizing the noise downstairs is not the dog at all because the dog is lying by the bed this was not merely an empty apartment it was an apartment that had not been visited in recent hours the bed was unmademelissa in her usual hurry a toothbrush stood in the drinking glass on the sink and alarmed stevie almost more than anything else about the empty apartment melissa was obsessed with clean teeth the discovery of the toothbrush meant she had not taken a planned trip her stomach clenched painfully in a combination of remorse and guilt she left the apartment in something of a daze her imagination running wild with possibility at what point did she react publicly to the womans silence at what point did she go to the police or brian coughlie at the ins and seek help at what point did she simply relax and take a deep breath trusting that melissa was on to a hot story and didnt have the opportunity to call she left with that sickening feeling still plaguing her stevie climbed back into the saddle the anchor desk chair bouncing slightly as she sat she scanned the pink pages of script for the n news hour but somehow she couldnt focus and she kept losing her place thirty seconds the floor director called out the daily ritual had grown so familiar to her as to be second nature but on that day it felt entirely unnatural all because of melissas ensuing silence she felt simultaneously angry and worried that call had never come as independently as they both lived their lives neither ever broke the promise of such a call not ever either melissa was making a statement about her chosen lifestyleor she was in trouble of immediate concern to stevie was melissas occasionally impatient ambition she was competitive with stevies success always hoping to ignite the spark that would accelerate her own career from occasionally employed to in demand stevie blamed herself for both encouraging melissa to dig for the story and for handing her that digital camera without a better understanding of what kind of undercover work she had planned if melissa was in fact on to the illegals story stevie didnt necessarily want to raise a red flag with authorities after just one undelivered phone call she attempted to practice her own advice to exercise patience but it didnt come naturally to her she wanted control and melissa had taken that away from her fifteen seconds everyone ms mcneal you with us stevie twisted a professional smile across her face and once again studied the script ten nine stevie would give melissa one more night after that story or no story the police had to be told four threetwo a red light illuminated on top of the camera directly in front of her stevie heard herself speak as she read the lines but she had no idea what she said chapter for the man in the back row of the smut film house time seemed to slow down as the big mexican next to him loudly blew his nose into a napkin and then threw the napkin onto the floor just being here with this man was a risk and hed come only because it had seemed unavoidable so whats so important he asked rodriguez the count is off an escape it wouldnt be the first were long by one long thats what im saying said rodriguez an escape i can handle you know that but this you counted wrong i done this count six times were long rodriguezs voice was rough and scratchy he kept sniffing back snot into his throat in a vulgar disgusting sound well its off its not off rodriguez objected you know what youre saying are they all chinese yes did you strip them of course and theyre shaved every last snatch so the count is off its the only explanation it wasnt off last week i done the count six times so you said just so you know now i know the idea disturbed him but he didnt let rodriguez know this it was his job to worrymost of the time rodriguez simply did as he was told inventory was off it was as simple as that maybe one of the ones in quarantine maybe that threw the numbers off he suggested i got them into the count im telling youlast week we done the count and the numbers was right use your squirrels your snitches see what you can find out got it tell your boys to keep their eyes open done already well do it again he snapped regretting the tone it wouldnt help matters to piss off rodriguez the big man sneezed again this time he forgot the napkin entirely thursday august days missing chapter boldt gripped the white rubber lip of the boston whaler a flatbottomed fiberglass skiff used as a port authority launch as it tossed in the substantial wake of an arriving passenger ferry lamoia didnt react to the movement whatsoever having grown up on the waters of narragansett bay seagulls followed high above the ferrys foaming stern diving into the prop wash after the pretzels and popcorn tossed there by unthinking tourists who were doing the shorebirds more harm than good the captain of the visage had refused to come ashore to be interviewed his ship had been called back to port and he was furious with authorities with the political and legal pingpong match continuing at a fevered pitch boldt instructed port authority to inform visage that a pair of seattle policemen were coming aboard to interview crew members boldt correctly guessed that a shipping captains greatest enemy was not the coast guard or the port authority or a homicide cop but time he would not want to be delayed again from weighing anchor and he would not want to leave any crew behind by combining rutledges data with the port authority docking schedule and interviews with the port authoritys radar station personnel the visage appeared to be the vessel in question it had been well outside the shipping lanes the night of the storm a night every navigator had been glued to his radar scope hoping to make it into port without incident the visage had gone radio dead for more than three hoursinexplicable in such traffic and high seas the port authority radar controller distinctly recalled the ships return to the southern shipping lane on scope but off the air and how predawn it had slipped back into the lane causing all ships behind it to give berth and thereby experience delays forcing them to endure even more of the stormsomething no one forgot boldt and lamoia climbed up a noisy steel ladder suspended from heavy chains a crew member behind them presumably as a backstop should they slip the pungent odors of a ship ripe with a threeweek ocean crossing struck themseaweed diesel fuel and a tangy metallic rust that formed in the back of boldts mouth like the scent of blood at a crime scene he gripped the chain steadied himself and looked back toward shore and the noble city skyline that gave the emerald city its jewels nostalgia tightened his chesthe had devoted his life to service of this city and was now considering plans to abandon it at fortyfour with over twenty years on the force the possibility of a job in the private sector insinuated itself the unspoken evil of lizs cancer treatment was the lingering debt caused not by medical billsall paid for by the banks health carebut by loss of their double income for over a year the bank had paid her full salary for three weeks of vacation and had then reduced her to onequarter pay for her leave of absence but their lifestyle which included day care and a housecleaner had left more going out than was coming in even boldts advancement to lieutenant had not made up the gap he was seriously considering a private security position that paid nearly double his city salary he had an interview scheduled though he had not told liz with the captain of the visage on shore leave and therefore unavailable the crew was all they had a list of fifteen names was provided by the ships first mate an asian with few teeth and a leathery face boldt and lamoia divided their energies boldt was led below deck through cramped hallways the gray steel reminding him of prisons to a game room that contained an oversized projection tv and an enormous video library thirty minutes of frustration left boldts patience brittle and his nerves raw the first two crewmen had not spoken a word of english replying to boldt in some balkansounding tongue the third crewman listed as a deckhand a young man with a stubble head and dark eyes that contained a tinge of fear marched in wearily and like his fellow seamen spoke this same foreign language english boldt instructed knowing that at least someone on this ship spoke the languagethe international language of the sea and a coast guard requirement the young deckhand shook his head and prattled on in his native tongue again it was then that boldts eye landed on the wall of videos and the titles thereall in englishincluded super bowls and nba title games he said to the deckhand michael jordan now there was a player he paused even so sean kemp is a better shooter no way the young man protested boldt did not so much as flinch he said kemps jump shot jordan was the best play the boy caught himself as boldts grin surfaced boldt said do you know that refusal to cooperate with police is a crime here i could have you locked up the boys eyes went wide and he shook his head as if not understanding you think ill tell the others is that it do you think i would say anything how does it benefit me to expose a possible witness i witness nothing the man returned you are a deckhand it says so right here you spent the last three weeks up on deck hong kong hawaii three weeks with that container you know the one im talking about the boys upper lip shone as he said the trip it takes longer to expected the storming boldt understood the malnutrition and dehydration then how much longer than expected normal ten days this crossing two times that the people in the container the boy shook his head i can detain you here in seattle the ship leaves without you there was nothing us people able to do it was shut up locked yes locked but you heard them the young man looked back suspiciously and shook his head again a familiar response we have laws about lying to police we hear them it bad all the crying locked he confirmed he crossed himself food didnt you feed them again the young man shook his head no water another you heard them boldt pressed remembering the shrill cries and haunting pounding and did nothing the mans eyes glassed under a tightly knit brow exaggerated by his nearly shaved head he mumbled the captain yes boldt said seizing upon this the captain the captain who no doubt had taken the bribe the captain who had the connections to make the drop the allimportant captain you were paid extra because of this container the man appeared angry how many times before no not me the others yes not me this my first crossing with visage no food no water boldt hesitated people died three people died you understand a small nod the mans first murder you understand murder terrorstricken eyes moist lips from a nervous tongue a faint nod i arrest you boldt said no the man protested the captain boldt suggested a reluctance in the eyes a stiffening of the spine then the slumped shoulders of resignation the man mumbled the captain not open the container he said the sea plays tricks on the ears its blood money boldt said you understand a nod jail boldt stated a nod the captain he is not talk to you well see about that he not talk no and i i not talk against him jail he shrugged better than to talk against this captain boldt saw crew members lost at sea he saw bodies caught in the oceans midnight swells fading into blackness a hand crying from the waves a crew kept loyal through fear a silent captain he saw a brick wall ahead of him the transfer during the storm something went wrong tell me about it bad seas your people lost the container us people no way the others on the barge that tug captain has brain of a baby not able to handle barge their tower not ours they lost that piece not us their crane boldt asked is that what you mean by tower he gestured to indicate a crane and finally resorted to demonstrating with his pen the deckhand nodded vigorously crane on barge yes of course boldt wondered how many craneandbarge combinations there were available to such people he saw a narrow opportunity for investigation something went wrong with the crane not so much cranes fault seas too high both captains are fools to make try but we try the crane dropped the container no no not crane guy lines snapped he moved his leathery hands in a circle as if shaping a sphere out of clay container spin fall into water and your captain tried to recover them the man did not answer he stared back through hollow eyes he did not try boldt said the man sat stoically the answers were not with him go boldt told him the man appeared stunned by the offer go boldt repeated before i change my mind the young man hurried from the room pulling the steel door shut behind himself with the familiar hollow thunk of a jail cell door boldt knew from earlier discussions with port authority that this investigation had become a question not only of jurisdiction but of whether any crime could be proven the ships manifest was unlikely to list the dumped container and it certainly would not list humans as its cargo even if it could be confirmed that the visage had been carrying the container the captain could claim it had been lost to the storm that its contents had never been known a ship held hundreds of containershundreds of secretsand it was usually the case that their contents were listed but never actually verified by captain or crew customs inspected less than percent of arriving containers even so with confirmation that the container had been aboard the visage boldt had to try for the shipping manifest if paperwork existed for the container it would list the shipper time boldt realized remained his best weapon if he threatened a delay and thus prevented the ship from sailing he might force the captain to cooperate as backup he had the inss authority to impound any vessels involved in the transportation of illegals they did this regularly as did the dea he collected his things and sent for lamoia time was everything boldt was halfway into his explanation to talmadge when the man passed responsibility and the call to deputy director brian coughlie and boldt had to start his explanation all over again it seemed coughlie in charge of field operations investigations and processing the illegals had more direct experience in impounding vessels which was what boldt hoped to set in motion youd like a chat with the captain coughlie summarized and youre willing to play hardball to get it you have authority to impound or even confiscate the ship youve done so before all the time but id need a smoking gun for that how about the testimony of a crew member good but not great the crew always holds some grudge against the captain anything else you could threaten him with impounding boldt encouraged sure i could coughlie agreed and maybe the captain is dumb enough to fall for it you dont think so coughlie said listen we could be more convincing if you guys picked him up on charges thats a kind of pressure we cant apply some of them gamble some of them whore all of them drink if this guy is facing criminal charges of some kind then theres no harassment involved no intimidation international law gets sticky he hesitated on the other end and when boldt failed to respond coughlie said listen we used to cut deals with the detaineesthey talk we cut them some slackbut its such a crapshoot such a waste of time we gave up trying we just ship them back home now return to sender there are too many protections too many complications with international law boldt realized that coughlie knew the details of his own interrogation out at fort nolan the interpreter the detainee herself the idea that coughlie already had the line on one of boldts interrogations disturbed him the feds were never up front about anything coughlie offered let me put the word out on this captain i have plenty of contacts dockside believe me someone has seen him i get word on his location your boys watch him and hope for a miscue if you pounce the only thing i ask is that you share any information you get that works for me but he wasnt sure why he said it chapter stevie mcneal accustomed to more attention than what she received from the seattle police department sat impatiently in an uncomfortable chair in the crimes against persons reception area next to a secretary pool of hispanic asian and africanamerican women busy at computers she remembered lamoia from the raising of the container flippant cocky and a womanizer if she was any judge of character adding to insult she had the sinking feeling she was going to have to reintroduce herself stevie mcneal she reminded him as loath as she was to do so i know he said we met last week you wouldnt remember but i do remember she won him over with that one comment and congratulated herself on knowing how to play him he traveled the length of herhead to toe with a few layoversbefore offering her a chance to sit down across the room a number of heads began turning there were times celebrity had its benefits she said im working with a freelance reporter to assist me in my ongoing series she does the footwork and the footage i do the voiceovers its an investigative expository piece ive lost contact with her i want you to find her to say im a fan would not be fair ms mcneal not always but im familiar with your work ive been taping this series on the illegalsboth to see myself on tv he offered a toothy smile and to pick up any leads you might have to offer her names melissa chow chinese by birth five foot two a hundred and five pounds oval face small nose i have pictures she passed them to him lamoia studied the snapshots shes just a colleague were sisters legally its a long story we grew up together my father brought her over from china when she was little and we adopted her shes family and now shes in the middle of doing this work for me and shes gone missing missing for how long lamoia asked i dont know exactly i last saw her on monday its thursday thank you for that stevie said i loaned her one of the stations digital cameras and sent her off to get a story ive lost touch with her we can put a photograph of her into our radio cars we can get her paperwork going he conceded but most of the investigative work i suspect youve already done contacting coworkers family members friends neighbors if youd gotten anywhere you wouldnt be here and here i am he jotted down a note well check with pawnshops you think she sold the camera she asked incredulous do you have any idea what is going on here melissa stuck her nose into something she shouldnt have and shes gone missing thats it thats all we need to find her and we need to find her fast lets start again he suggested she was working on your series the illegals she was following a lead i got on this illegals story he bowed his head and gave her a telling look i dont know exactly how far she had gotten where she was going with it we need to know exactly what she was working on lamoia prompted there was a man who offered us some information stevie explained cautiously his name lamoia inquired he wished to remain anonymous i honored that we met at a restaurant his name lamoia repeated a pen hovering above paper calculating how much to tell him stevie said if i give you that youll track him down and then well both lose him i dont see how that helps anyone lamoia said and what if your source is actually the one responsible for her disappearance have you thought of that he added listen ms mcneal i see things that even as a reporter you couldnt dream of my job is to find her as quickly as possible i need every scrap every handout i can get stevie placed a file folder onto the desk photos background handwriting samples find my sister goddamn it or i warn you your incompetence will be my next story with that she stood up and walked out one way or another she would get them to help friday august days missing chapter the call came an hour before sunrise while the population at large including lou boldt remained fast asleep with two kids the boldt home looked alternately like a petting zoo or a toy factory its floors and shelves cluttered with stuffed animals pieces of lego sets dolls and action figures liz typically went to bed immediately after the kids her energy sapped once in bed she read from the bible and a book she called her textbook doing her work she no longer spoke of the lymphoma by nameshe referred to it as her challenge relying on her role as gods creation to remain in remission boldt wasnt sure what he thought about any of it but he kept his mouth shut for whatever the reason liz did seem well whether temporarily or permanently no one knew though liz fervently believed it was the latter and as any cop knew it wasnt worth it to fight city hall for now he placed her continuing remission in the win column boldt answered the bedside phone in a groggy voice and continued the call in the kitchen so as not to disturb liz on the other end of the phone dispatch informed him of a floater found face down in the canal on the border of fremont and ballard a onemile stretch of protected waterway where working fishermen of five nations frequented sailor bars the victim was lo wan chang the former captain of the freighter visage within ten minutes of hanging up the phone boldt was in his chevy cavalier heading for the crime scene boldt arrived ahead of the chuck wagonthe medical examiners emerald green panel van that transported cadaversand refilled his plastic tea mug before venturing out to join the two uniformed patrol officers who had responded to the original call and who had correctly established a crime scene perimeter in an effort to protect the scene the sky was brighter now the wharf area where the body had been found was within easy walking distance of a half dozen bars and rooms for rent by the hour it was a decrepit stretch of searotted piers their tops stained white by seagulls the air pungent with seaweed engine oil and the exhaust of a patrol car left running to power headlights aimed onto the ugliness of the captains soggy body stretched out on the cracked and weathered blacktop the patrolman pointed this big guy over here seen the body on his way to his boat says he was floating face down right about here he said walking over and indicating a space between pier and hull side of his head all thumped in like that looks like maybe he slipped theres some blood smeared back here sure enough a footlong streak of something dark brown was adhered to the hull of a wooden fishing boat could be boldt agreed not eager to rule the death an accident nor to accept its timing as coincidental if the captain had talked if hed cut a deal with either boldt or coughlie if hed tried to scapegoat the responsibility for the container and the deaths of the illegals then any number of people might have wanted him dead boldt wondered if his own candor during the shipboard interviews had gotten the captain killed theres a polaroid in my trunk make yourself useful and take a couple pictures boldt said to the patrolman he handed him the car keys canvass the neighborhood see what we can come up with in terms of witnesses people around here talk the young officer questioned sarcastically frustration winning out boldt said just do the job the point wasnt so much the dead body the loss of a possible witness it was the decision behind the death the swiftness with which someone had acted and boldts realization that these people were a step ahead of him knew his intentions outside of his own squad and the ins only mama lu had been told of his intentions to interrogate the ship captain although whoever had hired the man to transport the container would have foreseen the inevitability of his being questioned and might have acted not only to prevent it but to send a signal to future ship captains to keep their mouths shut lamoias earlier mention of tidwell the detective who had retired on disability after investigating an illegals case rang in boldts ears these people played tough he had only to look down at the captains puffy face for a reminder he thought of sarah and miles and liz maybe this case wasnt worth the risk maybe that was the other purpose of this kill maybehewas supposed to seehis ownface lying thereonthe dock forensic sciencesthe responsibility of bernie lofgrins scientific identification division sidhad made so many advancements over the past twenty years that crime scene procedure had been reinvented to accommodate the painstakingly exact collection of evidence including photography and videography as well as the careful preservation of the physical environment on and around the cadaver when coupled with careful documentation thoroughly working a homicide crime scene could and in this case did easily consume two to three hours at the start of the third hour boldt was notified that the entire crew of the visage had been found asleep in quarters aboard ship and was being held by the coast guard for spd questioning he expected they would back up each others perfect alibis but lamoia would interrogate all of them nonetheless if anyone could get a person to talk it was john by seven oclock the local tv stations had cameras and crews on location joining a half dozen other reporters along with the morbidly curious that peopled any homicide crime scene a zoo scene a public spectacle a political nightmare if reporters made the connection to the container and took the spin that police had lost control to organized crime boldt would be hearing about this one for days as if reading his thoughts a voice said from behind i dont know about you but for us this is going to be a public relations nightmare boldt turned and shook hands with brian coughlie once hes connected to the visage it hits the fan boldt said the crew has been rounded up i heard coughlie said letting boldt know he had some impressive contacts lamoia had grabbed the crew in near secrecy its one of the things i wanted to talk to you about weve got the interpretersi thought we might share that work we could handle it for you if youd rather were okay boldt said refusing both offers could be my fault coughlie said allowing the comment to hang in the air i put the word out on him like you asked maybe that was the wrong call the guy delivered it as if hed rehearsed it which bothered boldt the truth was coughlie bothered boldt the feds always had hidden agendas looking down at the black body bag coughlie said maybe he had a name to give us mama lu five years ago maybe now i dont think so no not that she doesnt have serious pull of course she does but control doubtful we watched her closely for two maybe three years your guys too oc he meant organized crime phone taps audits undercover work we ate shit on that one tried twice with a grand jury failed both times we still look in that direction every now and again but not very hard she has made some serious friends downtown i like her for this be careful thats what they say boldt said do me a favor after youve worked the crew let me have a shot at them maybe we get lucky it was a compromise boldt could live with the two men shook hands coughlie avoided the press as he left deftly ducking under the police tape and running quickly to his car driving off as reporters chased him boldt used the distraction to order the body bag into the chuck wagon if the captains death sent any message it was a simple one people involved with this one were going to die he hoped like hell he wasnt on the list himself chapter a little more than twentyfour hours after reporting melissa missing stevie her guilt and fear levels increasing exponentially took matters into her own hands deciding to return to melissas and search more carefully pioneer square on a friday night teemed with a mixture of the college crowd tourists indigents and police a person could buy anything from a microbrewery beer to a persian rug stevie drove her i a dozen blocks and left it in a parking garage during the short walk to the square she allowed herself to wonder why melissa had chosen such a noisy crowded touristy location in which to live they were so different from one another and yet so close for stevie any stroll down the street meant the likelihood of contact with her viewing publicautographseeking strangers who would see her and want to meet her she hated that part of her job in hopes of avoiding recognition she dressed down in jeans and tshirt and wore no makeup she walked with her head down threading her way through the crush of people making her way to melissas apartment she climbed the steps rang the buzzer and let herself in she trudged up flights of stairs unlocked the door and stepped inside the apartment the door locked behind her the only sounds the dull beat of a nearby rock club she took her time feeding the fish anyone here she called out hopelessly again the livedin feel of the apartment got to her the bedroom might have been left that morning the way it lookedclothes tossed around that toothbrush standing sentry in the water glass still hurt her the most and it struck her how odd it was that such a small insignificant item could convey so much the pain in her weighed as a numbness now a sleepdeprived aching a longing to start all over to win a second chance there was no one to hear her appeal just a ringing in her ears and a hollow emptiness in the center of her chest like a bad case of butterflies she roamed the small apartment feverish with anxiety finally resorting to pulling open cabinets and peering behind furniture it was this last effort that won her a reward she saw it piled behind the couch utilizing the wall plugssome of the stations electronic gear it was the svhs setup melissa had used in the van including two waistbelt battery packs stevie unplugged both packs and rummaged through the gear discovering three videotapes the first two marked klein the third car wash just the sight of the handwriting stung stevie with fear at that moment she would have traded a dozen hot news stories for the chance to have melissa back safely she glanced over at the bookshelf and saw a porcelain doll its cheek cracked its eyes staring directly at her her emotions overcame her the afternoon sunlight played off the walls and crown molding blinding the man standing at attention in the oil painting that hung above the fireplace the air in the room smelled of fathers tobacco while outside the sun struggled through dust and automobile exhaust always the same dull wheat straw never brilliant like switzerland the chinese seemed surrounded by dust consumed by it the precocious young girl with the ring curls tied off with red satin ribbon clutched her porcelain doll with determination alone in the lavishly decorated sitting room awaiting introductions stephanie didnt want this other girl living here she wanted susu and father all to herself father had left the room only minutes before accompanied by two of his deputies and an embassy aide leaving the sweet smoke behind as a reminder father seemed always accompanied by someone she heard the front door open susu called her name from the hallway but stephanie did not answer let them find me she thought miss stephanie came another appeal as the door to the room opened susu stood about half the height of father she walked in short little steps and pursed her lips rather than smiled she spoke softly with a thick chinese accent she could speak french as well and read music stephanie had no idea what it was like to have a mother but susu was probably pretty close to the real thing father liked her too he touched her sometimes lightly quickly it made her purse her lips and blush susu had a son of her own this girl was said to be her niece and in need of a home stephanie didnt like the sound of that she wasnt big on sharing the large white door swung open in a lazy arc and there at susus side clutching her silken dress was a tiny girl with jet black hair bowl cut at her shoulders and bangs that hung to the sharp slashes of her eyebrows bright red cheeks and wide eyes of wonder as first she took in the splendid room and then a heartbeat later stephanie herselfher satin bows her dress and doll everything changed in that instant miss stephanie allow me introduce to you my niece mi chow your father say we will call her melissa susu spoke to the little girl in chinese and stephanie understood every word susu was a good teacher she said this is stephanie your big sister the girls face lit up and filled the room with light welcome little sister stephanie said in her best mandarin both girls giggled in unison stevie quickly collected the tapes and eager to view them hurried from the apartment and down into the chaos of pioneer square she had no choice but to join the crowd and it was only moments before she heard hey tina look who it is footsteps approached from behind and a man pulled roughly on her elbow channel four right we watch you every night stopped at a corner she glanced over some heads willing the pedestrian signal to change channel four right the balding man repeated right she said clutching the tapes tightly someone else was there someone watching her she could feel it the light changed stevie fought her way quickly across the streetstraight ahead she checked behind herself paranoia working on her every face seemed as if it were looking directly at her panic rose inside her she reminded herself that she had the tapes presumably they would tell her something the parking garage was two blocks away and closing she picked up her pace with half a block to go she broke into a slow jog again hearing footsteps behind her the same fan someone else she didnt want the answer her car was at a prepay parking lot and the booth had closed at pm thirty minutes earlier the entrance was now chained the exit guarded by a set of outbound springed tire spikes she entered the dimly lit garage at a near run the tapes held firmly under her arm her mouth bitter and dry her heart racing she wanted to be home behind the safety of a doorman two dead bolts and a security system she wanted to be anywhere but in an unattended downtown parking garage the trailing footsteps followed her into the garage and then suddenly went silentor was it only her imagination she dared a single glance backward and nearly gasped at the sight of a silhouette of a man moving quickly toward her a mugging she wondered wait the male voice echoed loudly off the cement walls she reached her car and fumbled with the wireless remote clicking the doors unlocked she fished for the pepper spray she carried in her purse behind her shoes on cement like hands clapping she pulled the driver door open tossed the tapes onto the passenger seat and armed with the spray aimed outward slipped into the front seat ms mcneal closer now suddenly more familiar its john lamoia she looked up into the mans sweating face i was watching the apartment he explained the disappearance is at the top of our list you scared me to death i didnt want to shout your name in those crowds his eyes found the passenger seat and the three tapes in their plastic boxes i didnt see you go into the apartment with those i have a key i feed her fish the fish watch videos do they melissas tapes were hers and hers alone she would view them first and pass them along if pertinent she felt the tapes burning a hole in the seat she pulled the door shut turned the key and lowered the window lamoia spoke softly listen this is strictly off the record but this illegals investigation is getting nasty the ship captain she said we got that right in spite of you itd be safer for everyone if you gave me those videostheyre hers right melissas you dont want to fool around with these people you want the tapes youre going to run smack into the first amendment these are news tapes i had hoped to run smack into cooperation dont we both want the same thing he added to find her nice try he pleaded i need whatevers on those tapes melissa needs me to see those tapes well talk she said she rolled up her window lamoia leaned to speak to her but his words mumbled incoherently through the glass as she drove out of the garage she reached over and touched the tapes she picked them up and dropped them onto the backseat floor behind her there wasnt anywhere safe for those tapes there wasnt anywhere safe at all saturday august days missing chapter bobbie gaynes entered boldts office midsaturday morning without knocking and pulled up a chair while her lieutenant placed a pencil mark in the margin of the report he was reading in order to mark his spot he looked up and saw his sons crayon artwork hung on the glass wall that looked out on the hallway it hung there to add color to relieve the monotony of gray that some interior designer had imposed on the place and to remind him of his priorities liz did not like him working weekends his sons selfportrait fluttered as a pair of detectives hurriedly passed the office door go ahead boldt said knowing in advance that the topic of discussion was crane rentals having lost the visage to a homicide likely to go down as an accident boldt had all but given up that leg of the investigation assigning gaynes to investigate crane rentals and possible links to the barge and tug that had attempted the failed transfer you just dont own a crane okay gaynes advised its not something you keep in your garage you rent them or lease them she referred to her notes there are five outfits between here and tacoma that rent or lease the kind of equipment capable of lifting a container boldt had brought her up to homicide singlehandedly breaking the gender barrier for the first time and landing her into a tough assignment she had rallied behind the challenges required to repeatedly prove herself but never holding a grudge she did some of the best police work on the fifth floor the latest attack on her had her gay and in a relationship with an ousted detective it was an invented story meant to smear her the dust had yet to settle a womans gone missing a reporter no less she eyed him curiously you want to rent one of these cranes you need bonding all sorts of insurance you name it she was investigating something to do with the containers he said the brass is having conniptions its all about how the press will tear us apart if something has happened to her and we dont find her first he added for them that is for us weve got a missing persons who may have busted open this investigation you want this boldt said i need the short form we do or do not have record of a rental the night of that storm the paperwork to prove it no a rental maybe im going to need some manpower if youre pulling for ot youve got it he was not fond of his new role as administrator guidance counselor and disciplinarianall of which were required of a lieutenant he often felt like little more than a file drawer between his captain sheila hill and the sergeants and squads that worked beneath him third place i try a place called geribaldis equipment i make the guy behind the counter real nervous with mention of cash rentals that bypass the paperwork hes sweating bullets by the time im through explaining how aiding and abetting works in the eyes of the law takes me outside for a smoke says how maybe a telescoping crane went out the morning of that storm that he knows for a fact it didnt make it into the books because when he tried to rent out the same crane it didnt happen to exist in the yard his manager blamed the screwup on himbut also told him not to worry about it said maybe the paperwork had been misplaced so theres no proof a crane went out boldt pressed whats the good news ive got the managers name zulia i was thinking maybe we check the guys bank accounts for an extra deposit or two she added id like to sit on his crib the yard monitor his bank transactions i could use a couple guys for surveillance maybe we have a little chat with him in the box okay lets do it first we gotta find him he has taken an unexpected vacation boldt said rental shops are easy targets for theft all that equipment sitting outside protection makes sense gaynes asked mama lu she knew what boldt was thinking when others seldom had a clue boldt said if she wants someone found i imagine its only a matter of time in that case you might mention our missing reporter point taken youre looking for a world of hurt you go opening that door lamoia said interrupting from the doorway he added mcneal lifted some videotapes from our girls apartment last night im thinking they gotta be relevant to my investigation shes not in the mood to share and claims shell hide behind first amendment privileges if we come after them how do we know this gaynes asked boldt didnt answer her instead he said to lamoia we go after the tapes anyway find a judge thats running for reelection let him figure it out waste of time lamoia said boldt conceded okay so we work the cranes mama lus a businesswoman she knows when to cut her losses she doesnt want us dragging in every gang member for questioning that makes her look weak she also cuts throats sarge lamoia warned or at least her soldiers do set up a meeting boldt requested i dont think this is so smart lamoia complained set it up boldt repeated sharply the artwork rustled on lamoias way out surveillance of the rental place is approved boldt told gaynes work it out with special ops chapter mama lu occupied the same wingback throne as she had on his first visit only the dress had changed teal with black embroidery she wore it wrapped around herself like a towel her long black braid fell over her shoulder heavy like a horsetail lamoia had asked to come along but boldt had refused not wanting to give the impression of teaming up on her he kept his opening comment to the point your influence both as a businesswoman and great friend to this city stretches far and wide no dont shake your headwe both know this to be true let us suppose that someone in this business of importing illegals decided not to risk unloading their cargo on shore but instead decided to make the transfer while still out at sea to accomplish this effectively this person would need a tugboat a barge and a crane we the police have identified a company that looks good for this our problem is that the individual we believe responsible for renting that crane has failed to show up at work i own a few humble groceries mr both and four laundromats a movie theater a limousine company a hotel a few investments is all who trusts the banks anymore geribaldi equipment the rental company the manager is named zulia if he were encouraged to cooperate with police as a good citizen she said testing yesout of his generosity of spiritit would certainly save us opening up his or the companys financial records cash flow payments her brow tightened she sat forward however imperceptibly she took hold of her braid with both pudgy hands as if it were a butlers pull boldt said there would be no reason for our forensic accountants to examine any of their records only a fool stabs a dragon thinking he will kill it to kill a dragon one must cut off its head he paused if forced to she grinned her eyes disappearing behind the folds of flesh how sharp is your sword mr both zulia drops a name he goes home he paused everybodys happy not whoevers name is mentioned boldt grinned the room felt suddenly hot to him the three women who died in that container were sick they died of malnutrition and dehydration because the captain refused them food and water storms slowed down the crossing and the captain just let them die in there she said you reap what you sow and boldt added yet another name to his list of possible murder suspects the captain of the visage was not short of enemies she said once on these shores these girls are good for economy maids in hotels waitress in bars sweatshops prostitution he added he sought out the person behind those dark eyes eager to determine her level of involvement but saw nothing revealed she sat there as impassive as the best judges for a moment he felt convinced this woman had not been involved with the deaths when she smiled he lost hold of it like chasing a wet bar of soap they say ignorance is bliss mr both maybe true if hed given them food and water they would have lived there was no reason for them to die that man no longer with us we must forgive him his sins him perhaps but not the others he paused having locked eyes with her do you condone such treatment of your fellow chi nese a topic that bears much discussion he hesitated a moment and told her a chineseamerican has gone missing a television reporter she was investigating the container if they harm her they are fools the power of the media is far greater than a single police department believe me the womans face scrunched up tight if this wasnt news to her she was a good actress you know this as true missing woman he said if a person were to help us locate this missing woman the city would smile upon her he added the media too she grinned and nodded and returned his determined gaze i understand a silence fell between them go carefully mr both accidents happen to the nicest people she added and trust no one not even me she smiled again more widely she had forgotten her teeth he saw them then in a clear glass to her right grinning all on their own monday august days missing chapter on monday morningone week to the day since melissa had last been seenernest zulia the manager of geribaldis equipment made the morning news by exploding into several thousand pieces the shock waves were felt at public safety boldt met with captain sheila hill in her office hill still turned heads at age forty she understood how to dress for her athletic body and wasnt above using her legs as a distraction she came down hard on boldt over zulias death but boldt wouldnt be drawn into it the zulia surveillance was pulled captain boldt complained reminding her of what he had been told only minutes before by his detective we had a crew watching geribaldis equipment and they were removed from duty under orders hill had given that order bobbie gaynes had been told to cancel the surveillance pulling an end run on lamoia and boldt neither of whom had been informed of the decision it wasnt something for which he could out and out blame her but they both knew the score he understood perfectly well that she had called him to her office for damage repair he also knew that although she could invent any number of excuses for her decision she had probably canceled the surveillance out of a combination of budget considerations and politics knowing sheila hill she resented lamoia not consulting her on the original surveillance and so had exercised her authority as a means of proving who was in charge but now she had another dead body on her hands and live newscasts tying this and the ship captain to the containera political hot potato unfortunately boldt thought there was more at play than met the eye lamoia had bedded down hill a year earlier in an act of poor judgment and primitive instincts that had left her calling the shots and nearly destroying the mans career an odd relationship still existed between the twolamoia had suffered the breakup hard hill had eventually sought to reconcile she tended to spoil him he tended to ignore her his captain only boldt knew of the affair though many on the squad suspected when lamoia slipped up boldt as the mans lieutenant heard about itbut lately hill seemed to be using him more as a marriage counselor she wanted lamoia back if there was hell to pay for the investigations woes it was for boldt to sort out at the time of the accident zulia had been in the seat of a propanepowered forklift as he was every morning according to his employees the explosion caused flames to rise three hundred feet in the air and total destruction to onethird of geribaldis inventory and most of its warehouse for the first time since a string of arsons several years earlier there was no physical evidence of the victim found by sid along with firemen they searched the rubble hoping for bone fragments you dont like john running operations without consulting you boldt stated speaking plainly point taken we have to deal with this she reminded glancing at him sternly but not wanting to invite discussion of the relationship she left it up to him to offer some kind of way out of the mishap at last he saw a compromise position he said the missing television news reporter melissa chow is a far more pressing case than someone like zulia once he returned to work we could have picked up zulia anytime go on she encouraged the reporter gets a lead on the illegals and then vanishes not only could any information she have be pertinent to the investigation but theres a young womans life at stake it has been a week so we shifted manpower she stated as if it were fact she liked where he was going with this boldt kept silent hed fed her the bone he didnt need to chew it with her as a sergeant boldt had rarely been privy to such negotiations one more reason he hated his lieutenants shield politics made him nauseous the fieldworkactive investigationswas a much more pure environment boldt offered her disappearance may be tied to the deaths of two key witnesses in this investigation shes of primary importance to us she certainly is hill agreed we moved our resources to this missing persons case i wouldnt mention this out of the house we dont want to put her at any more risk point taken so get on it she said boldt lamoia and gaynes met behind closed doors saturday i tell mama lu wed like to chat up zulia boldt said and look what monday morning brings i wouldnt go there sarge lamoia cautioned its these video tapes mcneal lifted from the womans apartment thats evidenceif we can get a judge to agree good luck gaynes sniped im not going there boldt complained im being led there it was a pro hit gaynes reminded lamoia zulia climbed onto that same forklift every morning they knew exactly what they were doing someone told him it was okay to return to work boldt suggested still focused on mama lus involvement there are plenty of pros who have no association with mama lu lamoia said why are you constantly defending her boldt complained im not defending her lamoia objected im trying not to jump to conclusions the guy i learned from he said meaning boldt stressed the importance of following the evidence of listening to the victim boldt nodded two potential witnesses killed in the last four days theyre cleaning house taking care of loose ends maybe mama lu is too easy and maybe shes good for this but youre right about following the evidence he conceded im listening gaynes said maybe i made too much fuss at geribaldis anybody working there might have known we were interested in talking up zulia so we question the employees boldt said what else the teacher quizzed lamoia answered canvass the neighborhood gaynes said look for moving violations in the area lamoia said and this missing woman boldt answered according to hill shes our top priority lamoia said nothing message received boldt was playing shortstop boldt said lets work mcneal we need her cooperation the hum of homicide continued on the other side of the glass the way traffic noise was a permanent part of the urban backdrop if we find chow while shes still alive boldt said hopefully then maybe we blow the illegals case wide open shes alive gaynes stated leaving a moment of silence for this to sink in or we would have found her body alreadysame as the others these guys arent shy theyre making statements they dont want anyone talking about any of this but if she is alive and they have her and they know what she was up to then god pity her she might wish she was dead im telling you lamoia said we want a look at those videotapes if we cant get a judge then we sweettalk mcneal daffy boldt said matthews could sweettalk a pet viper but we get a look at those videotapes one way or the other chapter stevie viewed the tapes she had taken from melissas apartment the ordeal painful even excruciating at times her fourth time all the way through melissas narration rose with her enthusiasm and sank into cautious whispers despite her seclusion inside the van the early surveillance footage documented the lso and its location melissa had driven the entire block and had shot the building from all four sides where in the back parking lot and for the first time the camera recorded gwen klein leaving worka short stocky woman of average looks klein walked stiffly and without a hint of grace melissa and her camera followed her to the supermarket and to shoreside school a daycare center where she picked up a young boy and slightly older girl with melissas van following they drove to a clapboard home with a postagestamp front lawn and a direct tv satellite installed on the recently shingled roof on the video the time stamp changed hours approaching the hour of seven oclock providing the tapes clock was correct it suggested melissa had killed nearly two hours sitting parked waiting for activity a pickup truck arrived and parkedthe same pickup truck that stevie already knew belonged to the husband and had been bought with cash at nearing eightythirty on the tape the minivan left with gwen klein behind the wheel with each start and stop of the video stevie felt a little more uncomfortable a voyeur a spy the subsequent sequence showed a rundown car wash but no shot of any sign out front any name the vans taillights shined at her like a pair of squinting red eyes kleins foot on the brakes the vehicle remained inside the automatic wash for the full cycle and then drove off returning home melissa followed and captured the van parked at the tape changed to gray fuzz stevie fastforwarded through to the end once again making sure she hadnt missed anything she poured herself a glass of juice loaded the second tape rewound and started it running eavesdropping on melissas monologue with the camera stevie felt as if she were reading from someones private diary melissa would have edited the tapes down to a few brief shots writing copy to accompany itcopy that stevie wished she had copy that might explain the significance or give continuity to the various shots as a journalist melissa had recorded the footage in hopes of editing together a story sometime in the future stevie wanted that story now but instead took away only the occasional grunt or groan from the camerawoman the rare comment thats the husbands truck she wasnt in the grocery store long but i suppose she could have passed someone the counterfeit licenses in there the second videotape showed klein arriving by morning to the lso she carried a coffee in hand as she crossed the parking lot there were shots of the public coming and going first taken from a considerable distance and then more footage with the camera zoomed and concentrating on faces melissa had either been bored and burning footage or had focused on the people coming and going out of a significance stevie did not yet understand tempted to fastforward she nonetheless stuck it out as she had before not knowing if one of the faces might be recognizablethe auditor who had contacted them a politician or public official she wasnt sure who or what she was looking for she only knew that these were the tapes melissa had shot prior to her borrowing the smaller digital camera that these same images had more than likely led melissa to take one step too many convinced that time was working against her stevie needed that connection to her little sister she fastforwarded to the end of tape two and inserted the third and final tape she had liberated from the apartment tape three began with familiar footage again klein left the lso this time amid a late afternoon drizzle strong enough to percussively pelt the top of the van and be picked up on the tape the errands were different only in locationoff to the vets for a large bag of pet food a drugstore stop tied to a dry cleaner next door the same daycare center and retrieval of the kids melissa remained silent throughout all the recording her enthusiasm of a day earlier muted the sound of her breathing strangely present on the tape as background noise like hearing a lover softly snoring she returned to the same small house the pickup truck having beaten her home on this day the screen jerked as melissa moved inside the van to shut the camera off this cut on the tape led into darkness rain falling hard the camera had been switched off and back on again a darkened figure clad in rain gear kleins height hurried to the van and climbed inside melissas voice spoke softly and intimately and stevie could picture her peering into the cameras viewfinder while wrapped around its bulk i thought that might shake you up she said delivering the non sequitur the van started up show time she said the van backed up the screen flickered and went black this scene immediately fed into a location with a view of the same car wash stevie had witnessed on the earlier tape shot from a different angle the tape showed the near side of the automatic washs cement bunker only a single taillight showing overheard through the vans oneway window and the constant scratching of the rain on its roof came the angry honking of a car horn stevie associated the honking with the van though reminding herself there was no way to be sure of that only as kleinor whoever was wearing that hooded rain gear emerged from the cement bunker that taillight still glowing only as that person marched through the rain and the camera followed to focus on a dilapidated construction trailer on the back half of the lot did it occur to stevie that klein had driven to a car wash in the rain hadnt melissa mentioned something about a car wash the figure approached the trailer and beat on the door relentlessly finally raising her voice loud enough to be picked up by the camera inside the van melissa whispered faintly that a girl come on home to mama after battling the rain and the trailers door the figure retreated back to the van and drove away aiming toward and passing immediately in front of the van and the camera stevie stopped the tape and rewound it several times reaching out for her glass of juice only to find she had drained it she finally resorted to advancing the footage frame by frame the approaching van its windshield glinting a reflection of an overhead street light a face behind the wheel just barely glimpsed gwen klein she zeroed the footage countershe wanted to be able to return to that image then she let the tape run melissa had stayed with the trailer in an act of investigative journalism that confirmed her nose for a story according to the videos time stamp twenty minutes passed before that trailer door came open a large figure of a man too dark to see clearly ran through the rain the camera panned down the block passing darkened stores too obscured by the weather and the darkness to identify and there in the corner of the frame appeared melissas profile as she rushed to the window to peer outside and follow the man stevie gasped at the sight a bar melissa said for the benefit of the camera she passed in front of the lens this time moving to the rear of the van the camera still running a moment later another break in the recording was signaled by gray fuzz and waving colorful squiggles a brief shot of that same man running through the rain back to the trailer the time stamp indicating a passage of five minutes another cut the van was moving now the camera aimed out the windshield he boarded a bus melissa said for the benefit of her tape the van swung a full uturn blurring the identifying lights and buildings and annoying stevie as it bounced so violently as to be nothing but blurred and jerky imagery then she identified a city bus up ahead and realized moments later that melissa was in pursuit the chase led out and down a street still too jerky to recognize past an i onramp that stevie felt certain she could find the bus took a series of turns made stops and continued on the camera running tape all the while twenty minutes of this pursuit passed until the citys downtown landmarks were easily identified the bus traveled north on third avenue the van immediately behind melissa jerking the vehicle to the curb at every stop in search of that same figure disembarking from the bus no she said i dont see him the bus started back up the van followed one block passed then another stevie felt the tension in her chest and a bubble stuck in her throat melissas determination palpable even across the videotape at last the bus veered and sank into the bus tunnel with the van following until melissa realized she could not enter she swore aloud and the picture went dark this was the last image on the tape that city bus dropping down into a tunnel reserved for buses only and the camera falling as it briefly caught a shot of a frustrated melissa behind the wheel damn cameras too big she mumbled to herself her last words recorded on tape her request for the digital camera made sense thensomething light and portable easily carried that request had been met on monday perhaps she had intended to follow this same man again perhaps she had even boarded a bus or entered the bus tunnel as a pedestrian perhaps perhaps perhaps stevie caught herself tempted to toss the juice glass across the room but placed it back down and poured a refill as with any good lead the tapes presented as many questions as they offered answers she could look up the locations of car washes in the yellow pages and drive to them one by one she hoped that particular car wash was listed but there was no saying it was she could try any number of wild attempts like that or she could act like a journalist and get down to business suffering under a headache and the pressure of time passing much too quickly aching over melissas disappearance and the tapes implication that she had aggressively gone after the story stevie resorted to what she knew best journalism the story started with gwen klein it was as simple as that the lso was crowded its fiberglass seats filled with a cross section of the citys diverse population she wore a baseball cap and kept her head down not wanting to be recognized as she wandered the enormous room of the seven teller windows four were in use stevie drew glares as she avoided the lines and headed straight to the front where small name plaques identified the tellers in front of the third teller the sign read hello im gwen stevie memorized that face the irish nose the squarecut bangs that cantilevered out in a frosted blonde cascade she went heavy on both the brown lipstick and the pale purple eye shadow klein delivered a selfimportant attitude via a demeaning intolerant impatience she was of average height with slouched shoulders stevie remained in line just long enough to take all this in then feigned discouragement and walked back outside at pm the buildings rear door opened and several employees including klein walked to their cars and drove off this event eerily matched what stevie had seen on melissas tape klein collected her kids from day care and led stevie to th street nw a congested neighborhood of small clapboard houses the van pulled in to mom and the two kids left the car and headed inside the home with news four at five rapidly approaching stevie had no choice but to drive quickly to the studio and perform her oncamera duties but her mind remained on th nw to which she returned immediately following the broadcast at seven oclock running low on patience she left her car and headed to the front door answers could no longer wait stevie hoped that the sharp attack of her knuckles on the front door might telegraph her attitude her intentions to the occupants especially given that both a doorbell and a brass knocker were available to her relief it was gwen klein herself who answered the door klein recognized stevie immediately her face lighting up at firstthe flush of a glimpse of celebrityand then tightened in reaction to the association with news media she stepped back and grabbed the edge of the door please its a personal matter stevie said i have nothing to say to the press the door began to swing shut stevie unleashed her only weapon you shut that door and ill have a camera crew camped on your front lawn for the next two weeks the door stopped partially open a moment later gwen klein stepped outside out of earshot and pulled the door to within an inch of closing she crossed her arms at her waist as if fending off a chill ms klein im not here to make accusations nor can i afford the luxury of wasting time she did not want to mention melissas disappearance not to someone like klein who if involved with supplying counterfeit licenses probably knew little of the overall operation but klein was the place to start stevie felt sure melissa had started with this woman so would she i dont know what you and lets dispense with the protestations of innocence or ignorance i have no time for it we both know exactly why im here and if you play this otherwise ill turn and walk away and youll have lost your chance chance at what blankfaced and suddenly silent gwen klein waited nervously do you follow the news stevie asked met only by that same blank stare are you aware of the ship captain who drowned the ship captain responsible for transporting the container of illegals the mans death was not an accident ms klein she lowered her voice for effect and said you have to come to grips with the fact that he was murdered killed because someone didnt want him questioned by the police the ins whoever are you listening kleins eyes went glassy and distant as if looking right through stevie how long until whoever is paying you for those drivers licenses decides you too are a liability kleins mouth sagged open as her jaw jutted out to speak stevie cut her off i want the whole story the truth start to finish who contacted you what they offered how it worked how long its been going on if she said strongly you are willing to share this with me openly and honestly im willing to forget all about your sad little life and your bad decisions you have children the woman winced im not here to expose your behavior to your children your neighbors your employer but how did you never mind how what matters is the truth its all that matters i need the truth you give me the truth i go away i cant remember your name do you understand what im offering you i can use the first amendment to protect you what do you think they will offer you what do you think they offered the ship captain the womans head snapped up she looked left and right as if afraid of the neighbors or someone else watching her she met eyes with stevie hers were hard and cold as she said not here not now youve got to leave she stepped backward into the house her hand blindly searching out the door i need answers stevie cautioned or ill tear your life open on your front lawn she warned her dont underestimate me not here well talk the door closed further stevie rushed her words we have to talk you have to choose sides me or them the door slammed shut a full minute later gwen klein pulled back a drape and peered out at stevie who remained on the front steps klein would want to discuss stevies offer with her husband stevie thought so she would give her the night one night in the meantime stevie decided to make as if she were leaving she climbed into her car and drove off she came around the block switched off her lights and parked it was going to be a long night chapter i tell you this girl she stupid and she scared the mexican kept his congested voice intentionally low despite the loud groaning of pleasure from the big screen he spoke in a clipped hispanic mix of thick accent and misplaced grammar hed been sick for a while now in the pulsing flicker of light six silhouettes could be seen in the various rows of the theater all sitting well apart from one another and none anywhere near the two men who occupied the center of the back row the reflected light from the screen caught the other mans profile as he unstuck his right sole from whatever glue was down there spilled soda or otherwise he averted his face from both the brightness of the screen and the unspeakable acts portrayed by the two naked women in the grainy film he understood the necessity of choosing such places for their meetingsthe choice had been his after all but it didnt mean he had to like it he kept his voice calm and quiet negating any remote possibility of being overheard i can handle the reporter our friend will settle down he never mentioned names not ever he knew all the tricks available to law enforcement he trusted nobody lets keep cool heads this too shall pass its coming apart on you nothing is coming apart on anyone a few speed bumps is all its to be expected with something this size shit happens its no reason to lose our cool what do you mean you handle reporter the mexican asked not like that lets just keep cool about this okay the other man encouraged i do the girl absolutely not shell be fine i tell you she not fine very upset last week it was the car wash in the middle of rainstorm no brains at all he pointed to the screen this this is the only thing girls do right he felt knots in his jaw muscles form like hard nuts he told himself to settle down admittedly its not a perfect situation she made a poor decision by coming to you thats regrettable but shell stay on schedule with the deliveries you watch when she comes back you tell her that were taking care of the reporter that everythings fine and if she dont come back if she misses the delivery there was no silence in the theater the paleskinned teenagers on the screen filling every moment with either excited panting exaggerated licking or pleasureridden cooing the other man rode out a particularly frantic climax before whispering to the mexican if we have problems with her well go looking to resolve them that sounds better i tell you what in the middle of a goddamn rainstorm but we talk first you and me shes not the only one making poor decisions no more fork lift fires comprendo the mexican pursed his lips the man shaved infrequently bathed infrequently and had the teeth of an old horse speed bumps like for the automobile this kind of speed bump its an expression thats all no i get it speed bumps i get it proud of himself he plunged his meaty hand into the cold popcorn and stuffed his mouth with it he offered the bag to the other speaking through the mouthful he said you stay for next show he glanced to his right the seat was empty brian coughlie was gone tuesday august days missing chapter when ins field operations director brian coughlie was announced by the buildings doorman stevie mcneal was wearing only a terrycloth robe her hair wet and freshly combed out she had dragged herself out of bed an hour later than usual having kept the klein home under surveillance until two in the morning she studied coughlie on the apartments small blackandwhite security monitor he stood talking to the doorman as if they were old friends just the way he carried himself bothered heroverly comfortable chatty casual but with the underhandedness of a card shark coughlie was part actor a large part if she were the judge his unannounced visit bothered her bordered on invasion of privacy or some form of harassmentthe feds muscling their way into the medias business then it occurred to her that if she played this right she might turn the tables and milk him for information to do so she would have to play part actor herselfshe would have to pretend not to be repulsed by him she told the doorman that she would call down for him when she was ready enjoying a renewed sense of control she slipped into a pair of jeans pulled on a camisole top and a white tshirt making sure she wasnt advertising herself she didnt want him getting any ideas a few minutes later coughlie was standing in the middle of her substantial living room enjoying the view she wondered how a public servant on a government paycheck felt surrounded by such opulence how much envy and anger played for his emotions how much of the longestablished discord between the press and law enforcement stemmed not from ideology but paycheck envy she could imagine his attitude the container deaths and melissas safe return meant little or nothing another file to close what drove a person to sign up with the ins in the first place she wondered what kind of person volunteered to be a glorified border guard nice view he said as if expected to compliment the nature of your visit agent coughlie brian he fingered a carved piece of black stone a friend had brought back from egypt he held it upside down and admired its base he offered her a small pamphlet that she accepted you asked adam talmadge about this investigative techniques used in our preliminary interviews i asked him about the training to identify political prisoners and victims of torture political refugee interviews he corrected were not the bad guys ms mcneal youre part of the system brian and the system is part of the problem my trouble with this view he said his inflection implying a question looking down on something is not the same thing as looking it in the eye lessons in perspective he offered how would you and your cameras like to pay a visit to fono our fort nolan detention facility a chance to see our operation firsthand look it in the eye gain a little perspective you got it and what do i offer you in return she asked suspiciously nothing im supposed to buy that does it sound like im selling are you always so skeptical you came here to drop off a pamphlet and offer me access to your detention facility im supposed to accept the santa claus routine we have to be enemies on this tell me why you cant buy cooperation from me she warned a pamphlet and a visit of fort nolan and im supposed to give something back withhold a story supply you with sourceswhat is it your boss is after we could discuss melissa chow they shared that with you a missing persons case believed tied to illegal aliens he asked rhetorically you want spd including us believe me and the fbi and the king county police there is talk of a task force its our job to find this woman a job i suppose so she said mulling this over lets talk about this whistleblower oh okay i get it she said sarcastically terrific do you they couldnt get the name out of me so now its your turn to try you want to find her dont you he didnt deny her accusation we need to question this guy he could help clarify the details give us the specifics youre unable to give us or is it the videos she asked thats it isnt it theyve sent you to try to talk me out of the videos well forget it she immediately regretted mention of the videos because his florid skin and tightened expression informed her that hed never heard of them though he recovered quickly he said the videos are especially important to us i just bet they are she said they show what people buildings the container the ship nice try how much are you willing to gamble he interrupted your friend has disappeared the ship captain has been killed do you want to be next in line are you threatening me just trying to scare you he said listen i do this for a living investigate illegal alien rings the chinese mob the gangs it may be hard to conceive of but just maybe ive had a little more experience at it than you and as for your paranoia i dont operate the way the cops do theres no reason for me to expose your sources or whats on that video i work a network of informants and snitches i probably get ninety percent of my information from them would it make sense for me to expose my sources your sources my guys wouldnt trust me after that think about it do you have any idea what it is youre investigating no you dont they made your friend disappear ms mcneal think about it wheres that leave you you go nosing around ill read the pamphlet thanks for stopping by he was not to be deterred he apparently felt obliged to educate her she wanted him out of there the vast majority of illegals come across the mexican borderand that includes asians and east europeans most arrive owing at least half the fee charged to smuggle them into the countryfive to ten thousand dollars the men are shipped off to migrant labor camps the girls to brothels and sweatshops theyre kept in service until they earn out the balance owed its not pretty was that where melissa was she wondered in some brothel or sweatshop she cringed are you trying to tell me someones turned melissa into a sex slave these container ships go both ways ms mcneal you go poking around you go stirring things up with your looks youd probably end up in syria the property of some prince is that hair natural blondes command a premium youre threatening me she asked astonished what is it with you he asked am i the enemy are you outside the huge plateglass windows a jet sank in the vast expanse of sky it flew behind brian coughlie and out the other side of him like some kind of magic trick she said as a reporter you wonder what kind of person signs up to be an ins agent is that right he said thats funny because as a federal agent you kinda wonder about people who make a business out of sabotaging your investigations and turning them into sound bites no ones sabotaging you you went after adam talmadge like he was the enemy he reminded you seem to forget its our job to save these people save them or deport them i didnt invent the system he pointed out just doing your job she asked sarcastically his face burned red and he looked away angrily he spoke to the back lights of the jet descending toward boeing field a pragmatist says my job is to offer people a chance at a new life a pessimist says that im in the business of wrecking other peoples dreams i live with it same as you the press tears apart more lives than i ever will and wheres all that leave melissa i can help with that she cautioned him again i wont reveal my sources neither would youyou just said so yourself trust me he said she nodded faintly and whispered privately im working on that chapter lou boldt and john lamoia stood over the black open mouth of the cemetery grave looked down inside and took in the sight the victim was an asian femalechinese she was naked her toes breasts and dirtcovered face protruded from the mud and sand that had been washed away by overnight downpours that continued intermittently her head was shaved boldt felt the familiar twinge that any contact with death delivered she had been deposited into a hole in the ground that had been dug for a casket someone had hoped that casket would be lowered down on top of this woman burying her forever in anonymity lamoia won every officers attention as he shouted orders boldt couldnt take his eyes off the woman in the grave where the hell is sid enlarge the perimeter tape to include the entire cemetery i want the statement of the gravedigger who found her i want somebody to get stevie mcneal up here nice and quiet like and i dont want another word of this going out over the radio got it boldt turned to face lamoia and said in a normal voice why is she so pale does she look right to you lamoia called out sharply to a pair of uniforms somebody find a tarp lets get a curtain up that the cameras cant see past anyone not wearing gloves is going to be writing traffic tickets til christmas that sent them scurrying when doc dixon arrived a few minutes later he was helped down into the hole boldt gave him only a matter of seconds before asking how long has she been dead dixons low sullen voice did not transmit well outside give me a minute would you does she look right to you boldt asked dixon wore a windbreaker gray flannels damp from the knees down and a pair of lab walkersleather shoes with overly thick rubber soles they never look right to me give me a minute he repeated shes too pale boldt repeated for his colleagues and her breasts are all black around the nipplewhats that about dixon was rarely terse with boldt but he snapped if you dont mind he let dixon work the victim until he finally called up out of the hole soles of her feet like elephant skin im guessing shes early twenties left ankle shows signs of ligatures daphne matthews arrived the team boldt thought she wore an anklelength trench coat and carried an open umbrella she came and stood alongside boldt and as always he noticed how strikingly handsome she was zoos here a patrolman shouted from the distance warning of the arrival of the media the rain fell harder maintain that crime line lamoia shouted no one crosses except mcneal down in the hole dixon talked into a dictation device held in his meaty right hand to screen the rain lamoia asked boldt quietly whats she doing buried here like this boldt answered hiding he looked up at the sea of headstones daphne picked up on this if theres one there may be others lamoia gasped more of em visitor a patrolman shouted indicating an umbrella approaching mcneal lamoia said daphne complained since when is graveside identification procedure this is hardly fair to her did anyone think about her this was my call boldt said she reminded them the corpse should be cleaned up and presented on the other side of the glass in the morgue that is procedure a body found down in a muddy hole shes a reporter lamoia said she can handle it punish the press is that the idea the idea boldt said is to know what and whom we are dealing with just as quickly as we can daphne hurried to intercept the approaching woman listen she said unable to slow down mcneal we can do this downtown in a couple of hours it doesnt have to be now like this theres a lot of mud the face its not that visible anyway mcneal nodded but kept walking toward the grave youre protecting me stevie asked from what its an awful sight if it is your friend this reporter then ive got to know stevie said she stopped short of the others and crossed her arms thank you stevie whispered to daphne they met eyes and daphne understood she was going to go through with it stevie stepped up to the grave lamoia introduced her to boldt who said sorry for any inconvenience caused by the location stevie glanced at him as yet unable to face the body down in that grave ive heard about you for years she said from under the umbrella not all bad i hope boldt returned she hesitated and said no not all she then inched toward the graves edge her shoes sinking into the mud dirt and gravel she looked straight ahead for a moment her eyes brimming with tears she pinched her eyes shut hung her head and then opened her eyes slowly her expression controlled and impassive its not her she said exhaling in a long sigh she turned and walked away not her she repeated for all to hear chapter brian coughlie answered his office phone annoyed by the interruption until he identified the voice its me stevie mcneal announced into the receiver coughlie felt a boyish flutter in the center of his chest hello he said did i interrupt you no no he lieda way of life for him the police found a jane doe up on hilltop shaved head and eyebrows i thought maybe youd want to know he was shocked by her call he couldnt think what to say stevie said she was meant to be buried underneath the casket maybe melissa had caught on to this burial thing coughlie recalled rodriguezs warning that stevie was a threat to them he didnt want to see her this way a necessary distraction was more like itsomeone he could use to their benefit confirmed by this call we agreed to share she reminded the cops arent giving us anything whatever details you can find out id appreciate it sure thing he had no intention of trading in a vacuum you were going to consider sharing those videos with me if she didnt share them soon then rodriguez was going to have to perform a breakin we might be able to arrange something she said ill get back to you he said ill be waiting chapter although procedure required an investigating officer to attend a victims autopsy this requirement often amounted to cruel and unusual punishment for boldt who understood perfectly well the need to protect the evidences chain of custody it still seemed a waste of the officers time because the surgical procedure could drag on for hours he and his squad like every other homicide squad in the country had found ways around the requirementattending the autopsy but not start to finish leaving the bulk of the cutting and sawing to the people in the white coats but no matter what duration of time was actually spent in the tile room with the me or one of his assistants the assignment required a strong stomachthere was no way of avoiding at least a brief encounter with the pale and naked corpse of the bloated victim whether bludgeoned bulletridden or burned technically it was lamoias investigation and therefore his autopsy but boldt filled in both to free up his sergeant who was busy with an unusual assignment and to gain firsthand knowledge for himself the cadaver lay on the stainless steel table drains beneath her feet and head a hospital band around her ankle the chalky discoloration of her bloodless skin sickening her bald skull and shaved pubis held a dull smudge of growth and reminded boldt of his wife during her chemotherapy the two men in lab coats cleaned up the ligature marks removed most of the mud sand and grass the bugs worms and weeds bagging labeling and indexing all such physical evidence was destined for bernie lofgrins sid forensics lab back at public safety preliminary exterior examination of the cadaver continued for thirty minutes while boldt made phone calls from a wall phone dixon spent equal amounts of time inspecting the cadavers head genitals hands and feet it was ascertained that her chest showed an inflamed skin rash that her extremities showed signs of postmortem frost burnexplaining the darkened skin on her breasts and toes her hands and fingers held lacerations and puncture wounds a few minutes later she looked like something from grays anatomy as dixon used a scalpel to unzip her from collarbone to crotch with a sure and steady hand there were cop stories about medical examiners using poultry scissors and chain saws skilsaws and power drills not all of which were exaggeration the procedure could run anywhere from fortyfive minutes to several hours dry land jumpers floaters and burns occupied the worst of all time list jane doe for all the tragedy of her young death was not too bad in terms of the autopsy dixon opened her up like a frog in biology class tucking one breast under the left armpit the other under the right calling out his observations for the sake of the video that captured the cadaver and the spoken dialogue for use in court if needed he worked his tradehe took a liver plug inspected her heart emptied her stomach contents manipulated her kidneys and finally cut open a lunghe called it looking under the hood and sometimes slipped in other automotive analogies time crawled dixon mentioned bronchial occlusion edema and renal failure an hour and ten minutes later the video recorder was shut off and the two men adjourned to dixons office for the postgame show an assistant was left behind to sew her up and get her back in the cooler despite the use of surgical gloves dixon used a jewelers screwdriver to clean under each fingernail some things never changed on his desk were laid out a number of sealed plastic bags from the autopsy youre an obsessivecompulsive boldt said yeah well catch this dixon flicked a discolored spec toward boldt but missed the gloves rip more often than not a lovely thought i hope you disinfect your floors only when it starts to smell im never bringing the kids down here again autopsy day care dixon said with a smile another boldt concept that never quite caught on boldt asked any surprises in your prelim dixon studied from some of the notes his assistant had kept during the autopsy and then set the papers back down on his desk he began the process of cataloguing the samples laid out before him technically she died as a result of pneumonia caused by pulmonary infection to you she drowned in her own mucusnot unlike what we saw in the three victims from that container okay youve won my attention couple things set her apart one is that shed been violently raped we picked up semen samples vaginally and in the esophagus well run dna the other is a skin irritation ill get back to that of primary importance to you is the unusual hemorrhaging in both the intestines and lungs thats your bridge between the container victims and this woman microscopically the kidneys show inflammatory changes and infectious changes but i keep coming back to the intestines because thats what sets these women apart from other flurelated deaths its the same etiology as your container victims lou in my lingo this cause of death is not unlike the earlier cases we saw right now your best shot would be to make a case for depraved indifference we can connect her to the container victims boldt stated hopefully circumstantially our samples will go to cdc in atlanta who already have similar samples from the container vics two to three weeks minimum thats too long boldt complained ive got the three dead in the container two possible suspects murdered and a journalist missing for over a week now you do or lamoia does im his errand boy uhhuh its his case boldt stated to deaf ears he asked was she in this same container its the same etiology he repeated but unlikely the same container this one had been frozen what we see this often enough with cruise ships someone dies out at sea captain orders her into the deep freeze what he doesnt realize is that the fridge would be a hell of a lot easier on us when you defrost frozen tissue it decomposes quickly the cells actually break as they thaw looks different behaves differently frozen thats what im saying for how long no way to know guesses a couple weeks to a month or more if we took it out past six weeks wed be likely to see more freezer burn than this he added thats only opinion lou that rash boldt asked no not freezer burn its chemical or allergy stay tuned so she was here well ahead of the container boldt said in my opinion yes but died of a similar illness in my opinion yes dixon suggested they could all come from the same village something like that i need that freezer i need the location of wherever that container was headed were thinking sweatshop the fabric inside the container i can support that with two needle marks on this ones fingers not a cruise ship if its a sweatshop lou then its near a wharf the fishing docks something like that why do you say that boldt asked or inside an old cannery dixon continued the canneries all had freezers you found something on her didnt you boldt said expectantly he knew the man well like the labs bernie lofgrin dixon held the best for last what the hells going on dixon not going on dixon corrected coming off her feet were covered with them got to be either a cannery or a ship her feet were covered with what boldt asked dixon searched through the half dozen plastic bags and held one up for boldt to see fish scales he said her feet were covered in fish scales chapter stevie and the mobile news crew entered through the front doors of the greenwood lso cameras rolling lights glaring and parted the sea of those waiting in line she had left the graveyard only hours earlier relieved that the body wasnt melissas but pained and haunted by the sight of that poor girl lying down there in the mud all breath gone from her body such finality drove stevie to take immediate action her grief and terror overtaking her any fate could have befallen melissadeath captivity white slavery it had been over a week a lifetime the combination of the dead body in the grave and melissas sparse but haunting narration of the videos pushed stevie beyond any professional capacity to handle her situation guilt ridden and obsessed with finding the woman she succumbed to her spent emotions and heightened anxiety at first bit by bit this internal decay now crossed a threshold that left her in a constant state of panic typically the public would never tolerate an individual cutting into the line might even respond violently but add the possibility of a tv appearance and smiles appeared on their otherwise impatient faces ms gwen klein stevie shouted out her voice commanding such authority that her target froze behind the teller window it took klein a moment at which point she headed for an employees only door behind the counter ms klein you are kstvs state employee of the week stevie glanced to her left toward the managing supervisors office and the man in the buttondown shirt and tie who occupied the doorway gwen the supervisor shouted he nodded toward her teller window indicating for her to return klein stopped looking first to the supervisor and then to the waiting room with its seventy citizens and mcneal with her team she had a weighty decision to make if the woman ran stevie was prepared to turn her interview hostile she too held her breath lets hear it for ms klein stevie prodded the room broke into applause the supervisor once again indicated the teller window klein distraught and churning offered stevie a meanspirited look and returned to her window where stevie and her crew waited the supervisor licked his fingers and spitcombed a few strands of hair off his shining forehead klein and stevie stepped face to face ms klein stevie began in a voice of seeming adulation for her subject gwen it has come to the attention of this reporter and kstv viewers and staff that you approach your job not only with diligence but with enthusiasm joy and efficiency she paused just long enough for her gallery to sparsely applaud in a world that moves too fast for most of us and a job where the lines move too slowly another pause for the requisite laughter you are an inspiration to all of us kstv would like to present you with she vamped for an appropriatesounding gift since nothing had been arranged dinner for two at the palomino restaurant in city center and two tickets to the musical rent now playing at the fifth avenue theater the crowd lit up with applause here is our iou which you can redeemlater on she emphasized at the kstv studios she slipped a folded threebyfive card across the stone countertop klein made the mistake of opening the card on it was written i know about the car wash klein paled stevie said can you share with our viewers the secret to keeping your customers so satisfied so impressed with you as a person i ahh no no well thank you gwen klein for setting such a fine example kstv hopes you enjoy the gift she signaled the cameraman and the lights faded and the camera went off his shoulder and the small crowd dispersed as people regained their places in line stevie leaned across the counter and whispered through a faked smile ill air this footage unless you meet with me i cant ill be expecting a call stevie stepped away from the window klein glanced once again at the threebyfive card all blood gone from her face the cameraman gathering his gear asked skeptically since when do we feature an employee of the week since now stevie said hurrying toward the door her public gawking from a distance chapter boldt and lamoia walked a couple blocks to the public library and took a seat on a recently added bench out front they took a moment to scan the area around them alert for anyone eavesdropping boldt nodded his okay he felt badly about the need for secrecy about the games within games but lamoia had started this and for the moment boldt did not see a way out lamoia spoke softly looking straight ahead i was tempted to put gaynes on her so we didnt miss anything forget it you know this is suicide if anyone finds out boldt reminded well be chalking tires we can get away with me filling in for you just as long as no one gets wise as to what youre up to she watched a house up on th northwest last night until two am name of klein late morning i follow her from hilltop back to the station she and a film crew take off to an lso on greenwood a half hour later this interesting you yet im not comfortable with any of this it wasnt your idea lamoia reminded maybe thats why im not comfortable with it so i check the name on the house shes watching against state payroll what else connects the two right he said sarcastically shes bringing a film crew in to renew her license i suppose he lost the attitude and said theres an lso employee name of gwendolyn klein the connection has got to be drivers licenses he pointed out illegals need documents if it proves good well have to find some other way to connect the dots boldt reminded if mcneal ever found out we had her under surveillance and that we stole her sources shed not only have us in court but wed lose our suspect you worry too much lamoia said what about a random credit check on a handful of lso workers that just happens to turn up klein she has got to have some unexplained money in her pockets if shes good for this but what made us run the check of lso employees in the first place boldt asked i see what you mean it has to be a believable trail then we never mention mcneal boldt asked what about coughlie maybe his people already have suspicions that theres documentation coming out of the lsos something like that could make the connection for us not a good idea i wouldnt go there he paid her a visit first thing this morning before we found the body at hilltop right was with mcneal for the better part of an hour she has been busy we gotta figure theyre working together somehow information exchange boldt suggested he promises her an exclusive to the story as long as theres a twoway flow of information and theyre cutting us out an exasperated lamoia cried out he added i hate that shit just because he got to her first boldt teased exactly lamoia added but he didnt think to put her under surveillance lets hope not anyway lamoia grimaced what if we asked daphne to try to open her up for us boldt suggested she seeds some doubts about coughlies integrity offers exclusivity with us end run the feds that would be sweet you want me to pull the surveillance is that what im hearing youre hearing me concerned about the police getting caught for having the press under surveillance its dangerous for all concerned john weve been over this mcneal is withholding key information to this case she admitted that to my face if she wasnt press she is press if we want her sources we go to court not surveillance we gonna do this dance again lamoia whined we go to court itll be christmas this missing woman and our case along with it will be long gone were protecting mcneal lamoia reminded her associate went missing with this same information we believe those videotapesand remember i saw her leave the apartment with themare pertinent to the case weve got our bases covered on this sarge weve got klein maybe we should stop while were still ahead but we arent ahead lamoia reminded were still playing catch up well lets play catchup at a distance shall we and lets close the gap as quickly as possible this thing makes me nervous its a way of life for you if you werent worried id be worried boldt said that would be a first they studied the area once more before breaking up and leaving the bench they walked in opposite directions without ever having talked about a plan it seemed symbolic to boldtlamoia two years into his sergeants stripes was increasingly difficult to control chapter stevie was applying the last touches of blush when her name was called over kstvs public address system she called reception as requested one eye fixed on herself in the large mirror surrounded by dazzlingly bright lights that mimicked the brightness of the set her guest was identified as daphne matthewsseattle police the woman from the cemetery who had tried to protect her an intern delivered the woman to makeup without the raincoat and hood matthews came off as quite pretty dark features on olive skin her presence put stevie on guard she was conditioned not to trust the cops daphne had a job to do she lived for the fieldwork the way boldt did and the fact that he had asked her to do this made it all the more important to her to succeed he still had this effect on her this unintentional yet underhanded control that for years she had fought to overcome struggled was more like it she could point her life this way or that redirecting it as far away from him as possibleher onagain offagain engagement to owen adler the most overt example but inevitably her emotions returned to him comfort home she saw in his eyes that these feelings were reciprocated though it went unmentioned between them no hot glances no teasing those days were behind them he with his family and his wife as passionate a father and husband as one could ask for she like a sailboat without its keel pointing strongly into the wind but endlessly sideslipping and losing her course it was some kind of horrific joke the way she tried to throw it away only to have it come boomeranging back at her those emotions for him the desire that wormed hot like an infection deeply within her if she heard his voice she turned to look if his name was spoken she listened inall the while wearing the mask of indifference she understood that she had to move on she believed it but accomplishing it was something altogether different all the education in the world could not explain this to her nothing seemed to help and so when he asked her to see mcneal for him she responded immediately like a child eager to please the teacherand she hated herself for it im on the set in a minute stevie said giving herself a way out this wont take long we met at the cemetery right yes daphne took a seat in one of the two padded swivel chairs that faced the bright mirror but she turned to face stevie who in profile continued working with the blush i wanted to talk about melissa anything you can provide us its all a help to the investigation such as the videotapes evidence is lamoias department im more interested in her habits lifestyle friends relationshipsthat sort of thing youre a shrink a psychologist stevie nodded congratulating herself i didnt have you pegged as a cop this is making a lot more sense to me the thing about a missing persons case ms mcneal is that there are often leads that dont get pursued for one reason or another we know this from hindsight from the cases where they dont come back are never found stevie completed we believe melissa is still alive that shes either in hiding or has been abducted but that shes alive and you base this on the fact that we havent found her body daphne said bluntly stunning the other woman theyre using violence to make statements why would they treat melissa any differently because shes a reporter is that what you think daphne questioned you think its a passport of some sort dont believe it ms mcneal they dont make those kinds of distinctions theyre sending messages the easiest way to send you a message is to deliver melissas body maybe they know me better than that she said leaning back and turning her face to the mirror it would only incite my wrath its not incited already daphne said suspiciously i dont believe that you know what i think i think youre not sleeping not eating well i think youve probably been looking long and hard at a bottle of wine maybe drinking a little more than usual you lie awake thinking about all the what ifs you blame yourself you blame her you blame us and none of it goes away stevie blinked furiously trying to discourage the tears that threatened she took a deep breath trying to contain herself youll excuse me she said i have to be on the set she averted her face while she returned the blush brush to the formica countertop tell me im wrong what is it you want stevie said stopped at the door her back to daphne youll blame yourself even more if you withhold information from us i can help you deal with the grief ms mcneal its what i do you may be convincing yourself otherwise at the momentthe police are incompetent the police dont play fairall the arguments neatly worked out professional ethics or maybe you think the case isnt ours to give away that its the ins only the ins who can help you so you put your eggs in that basket she paused how am i doing you think too much professional liability whatd you have for dinner last night breakfast this morning when was your last glass of wine its red wine isnt it expensive i bet but youre drinking alone and hows that feel not very good i bet were done here she couldnt will her arm to open the door she stood there her back to the woman frozen you find yourself missing peoplenot just melissa but your family your last relationship anyone and everyone whos gotten close who is close stevie shook her head violently daphne continued unrelenting the ins oversees illegal immigrationno question about it but a missing persons investigation thats us would i hand you a sports story and what about the ins if youre the one running illegal aliens into this country into this port whos the first person you need on your payroll the first person you must compromise do you think we missed that do you think were sharing every lead with coughlie and talmadge why should we do that until we know more about them and that takes a while believe me turf wars this is supposed to be news to me you people fight your petty games while the investigation stagnates ive seen it a hundred times from the other side of that anchor desk that adoption ring last yearsame thing happened there right one hand not washing the other same old story not turf wars ms mcneal cautious is all were careful about to whom we go volunteering information are you stevie turned then and faced her ill tell you whatlets just do our jobs you find melissa ill report it as news when you do end of discussion we have a solid lead were pursuing daphne said the woman in the grave in death she told us something as tortured as stevie felt she remained alert hanging on daphnes every word the lack of sleep the loss of appetite she knew too much this woman it felt invasivea violation and yet it also made her feel like someone actually understood what she was going through finally someone who understood tricks it had to be a trick the cops were full of them daphne said our first hard evidence we think weve established a time line that suggests this woman is an earlier victima first victim do you know the significance of a first victim in a crime ms mcneal the first victim is generally the one who is handled carelessly its only later the criminal mind thinks to start making better preparations thinks to plan more carefully this was sloppy hasty this woman was handled poorly thats in our favor what evidence the thing is we can work with you we would like to work with you but it would have to be in an exclusive relationshipwe would have to trust each other to the point that you would not air nor share certain information and that we likewise would not work with other reporters or news agencies until giving you first dibs on what we have and if we work this out stevie inquired wed want to see the videotapesyes of course wed want you to name your sources we in turn would open up the autopsy prelim on jane doe to you wed share ms mcneal wed give melissa the best shot at coming home the way were working nowwell its not working thats just the point a knock came on the door stevie jumped ms mcneal a voice said from the other side youre wanted on the set daphne offered i can help you find sleep i can work with you on the loss of appetite that offer comes without precondition who said i cant sleep stevie barked defensively no strings attached im wanted on the set you cant do this alone she added and the ins cant clear a missing persons case if theyve represented themselves otherwise its unfair to you stevie felt and looked paralyzed the name is matthews daphne reminded the switchboard will put you through my voice mail has my pager number im available to you around the clock daphne placed one of her cards next to the cosmetics im hoping youll call im wanted on the set she repeated she pulled open the door and left but when daphne looked down she noticed her business card was gone wednesday august days missing chapter the seattle aquarium was located out on a pier in the heart of the heavily touristed waterfront a collection of crab and chowder houses and ferry traffic servicing the outlying islands seagulls swarmed fallen crumbs picking the wide sidewalk clean the familiar smell of suntan lotion hung in the air along with the choke of diesel fumes a taste of salt spray and the permanent musty tang of rotting wood indelible and almost sugary on the tongue boldt walked quickly not because he was late but because he was driven by a mounting fear that the investigation itself was late that melissa chow had run out of time nine daysfar too long he did not accept that there was a mortal power greater than that of the seattle police that whoever was behind the container shipments and the recent murders could remain a step ahead could murder their way into silencing the sources that might open up the case but privately his own fear of these people was wearing him down the ruthlessness and daring of killing the potential witnesses and leaving them for police to find reminded everyone involved that no one was safe not even police gwen klein the lso employee appeared to be the most recent statistic she had failed to show up for work she had gone missing right at the moment that lamoias team had found out about her and had decided in a failed attempt to put her under surveillance mcneal had run an employee of the week piece on news four at five that boldt blamed on the womans disappearance the stupidity of the press never ceased to amaze him the pressure on all involved had intensified especially on boldt and lamoia too many dead bodies a reporter missing television news turning the screws and making inroads ahead of police there was talk of creating a task force to include spd and the ins although both sides were resisting for boldt as he quickened his pace yet again all of it took a backseat to locating melissa chow who appeared to be not only a possible victim but also a key witness to find this woman was to simultaneously bring down the people behind both the murders and the importing of human beingshe felt certain of it dr virginia ammond was a tomboy in her midforties with a freckled irish complexion callused hands and a phd in marine sciences she dressed in faded jeans rolled at the cuff and an immodestly tight tshirt that bore the aquariums logo the medical examiners request to identify the fish scales went first to the university but was passed on to me for confirmation boldt visited the aquarium regularly with his kids the floor plan familiar to him ammond walked him down the descending ramp that led deeper underground and into the heart of the facilitya degree viewing room completely surrounded by glass and water where fish circulated freely lending the visitor the feeling of being submerged she led boldt to a door marked employees only and into a room where a stereoscopic microscope awaited them she explained i know its an inconvenience for you to come down here but phone calls just dont do it for me now this first plate is one of the less common fish scales in the sample your people provided our department notice the more pointed area where the scale actually attaches to the fish like shingles on a roof of particular interest to us to you is the more heartlike shape of this scale along with that serrated edge okay ammond switched plates and moved him to a comparison microscope this is a sidebyside comparison she told him look carefully at both scales boldt brought his eyes to the scope okay recognize our friend on the left very good yes and to the right a smoother edge less of a point its clearer this may sound stupid but the one on the right looks newer gold star lieutenant you didnt minor in marine biology did you yes the scale to the right is from a live silver salmon in our back tanks the sample we received from you consisted primarily of scales from both king and silver salmon but not our friend he asked using her term no we found two such scales in the sample theyre from a variety of snake river coho whats of interest is that this particular species has been extinct for over two decades run that by me again boldt said the snake river coho disappeared twentytwo years ago tens of millions of coho used to make the annual journey up the columbia and into idaho the snake river species among them extinct boldt repeated withdrawing his police pad and making a note exactly she grinned the white of her teeth gleamed against the freckled face your explanation over the phone intrigues me you collected these off a dead womans feet you mentioned shipping containers and id have to question that a container in service twentytwo years not likely a ship is more like it a cannery could be yes why not this way ammond said showing boldt out of the lab they walked back into the main galleries she spoke loudly to be heard above the crowd noise have you seen our fisheries display i imagine boldt answered the trawlers she asked pointing an entire wall had been devoted to the history of commercial fishing it traced the earliest native american settlements to the contemporary fivemile gill nets used by the russians and japanese as well as the enormous floating canneries text and illustrations were complimented by cutaway models of the various vessels and it was to one of these that dr ammond led boldt commercial trawler fairly common to pacific fleets for the last twenty to fifty years with few modifications bigger now she pointed out the aft hold the catch is stored here as it comes in the crew then sorts cleans and washes the catch discarding the unwanted or undesirables and the gutted finished product is moved by conveyors to the forward hold she indicated a huge room that occupied most of the front of the ship this hold is one giant freezer these trawlers are able to stay out to sea days weeks or months she took a deep breath the tomboy in her replaced by the expert now given your mention of illegals im inclined to see this trawler in a whole new light maybe the catch isnt so good this year maybe im putting chinese illegals in my forward hull maybe this is quite an old shipa very old shipand despite the regular cleanings the crew gives these holds a few scales remain behind indicating a species of fish we havent seen for over two decades and if its a cannery that works for me the canneries go back further than the processing trawlers this aquarium was a cannery in its former life any number of structures along the shoreline in this city have been or once were associated with commercial fishing from harbor island to interbay salmon bay to lake union youre saying i have my work cut out for me he stated i cant narrow down the old canneries by the fish scales youve identified the university has catalogued the history of commercial fisheries that would include canneries this industry dates back over a hundred and fifty years boldt said twentytwo years is all we care about her face erupted into a smile let me make a few calls chapter lacey delgato had thick calves no waist and a nose that cast a long shadowbehind her back cops called her the sun dial she wore an unfashionably long black skirt zipped too tightly across her seat so that a labyrinth of intersecting folds and seams showed in an unsightly display she had a voice like a squeeze toy a trial attorneys tendency to act out her words and an abrasive laugh that warned of her cynicism her one extravagance was italian shoes her tall heels tapped out her quickened pace against the justice buildings marble corridor this individual has offered to sell the camera back to kstv a digital camera lamoia clarified youre sure about that he asked the assistant prosecuting attorney im only repeating what was said to me delgato replied its your case sergeant you worry about what kind of camera it is do we foresee any problems with our involvement in this he asked there are some issues need clearing up she informed him he struggled to keep up with her possession issues if you monitor the drop for them as theyre asking you to do then who gets the camera little things like that and our position on this is he asked stolen evidence you retain the confiscated property until such time it is no longer needed by us as evidence in a trial no different than any other case she snapped her head in his direction but never broke her stride mind you they have a slightly different interpretation theyll let us keep the camera but theyre claiming that if theres a tape in that camera then they retain the tape for themselves intellectual property laws are sticky ive got to warn you up front about that spd was under tremendous pressure to clear the container case mcneals nightly broadcasts kept the story not only in front of the public but on the political front burner as well election years were always the worst no mention of the missing woman just the camera were clear that the ransom demanded is for the camera alone im just repeating what i was told she offered you heard the asian community is going to march on the mayors office he said thanks i needed to be reminded theyre expecting a big crowd only because the press will be there he said take away the cameras ten people show up she looked at him strangely still at a near run you busy for dinner what dinner he asked i havent had dinner in three days i slept an hour and a half last night we could skip dinner i suppose the corridors long wooden benches were occupied by attorneys witnesses detectives and distraught family members for lamoia it was not so much a courthouse as a processing center the law reduced to a series of appearances negotiations and compromises as a cop he couldnt think about it without growing discouraged or even depressed he didnt see delgato as a woman only as an attorney he didnt know how to break it to her i called robbery figuring they would watch the drop delgato explained the minute i mentioned kstv they put me on to you they said anything to do with the television station went to you i told them i only wanted to do this once im saying the same thing to you she was clearly angry with him for not picking up on her passes she wasnt going to take a third swing at the ball she knocked on the door to a jury room and led him into where police and lawyer work ended and justice began despite hundreds of court appearances lamoia had rarely been inside a deliberation room it smelled of pine disinfectant the long oval tables edge had been victim to jurors nervously doodling he could almost hear the deliberationsangry voices ringing off the walls among the ballpoint graffiti he noticed a hangmans noose he sat down into one of the chairs and ran his fingernail around the cartoon characters neck he said do we know this information is good the station engraves its initials on its gear the caller described that correctly the ransom he started at three thousand the station settled at onethe amount of the deductible on their policy and he went for it apparently thats not a junkie thats a businessman a junkie would have hocked it she said which may be what happened lamoia concurred who knows where this bozo got it from he demanded that anchor stevie mcneal take the drop no way wants a face he can recognize cant do it nonnegotiable the station already accepted the condition thats why they came to us their security firm wanted us aware of it and you on board prime time live i dont think so its nonnegotiable she repeated youre there to protect and serve she continued it gets worse not possible he said they claim anything recovered is theirs youve got to be kidding they ask for our help retrieving stolen property and then make demands on us if we agree i dont think thats exactly how they would put it she said this is not an episode of cops they havent shared the time and place of the drop we could if and when they move without us file obstruction of justice but to be honest with you it would never reach court and wed lose the press is one slippery eel you would never see that tape if there is a tape he muttered lives were decided in this room by grocery clerks housewives and ceos he rarely struggled over his career choice but that hangmans noose carved into the table twisted his gut there are still some unanswered questions she agreed how much do you want to be involved if theres something useful to us on that tapeif there even is a tapei cant have it broadcast to the world theres a woman missing i have a life to protectmaybe hundreds of lives if theres a tape in the camera we can certainly take physical possession until trial if they press for possession theyre likely to win its going to come down to timing but the glovesoff attitude is youll get a look at anything thats there set up the drop he ordered its the right call she encouraged then why dont i feel better about it she walked out seams and folds of fabric and skin in a shifting blur of whistling fabric she stopped at the door im different when the lawyer hat comes off she spared him any reply by hurrying out the door her quickened footsteps reminded him of horses hooves lamoias eye fell back to that hangmans noose the lines of the noose had been gone over repeatedly the ink dark and saturated and leaving little doubt in his mind how the artist had voted chapter the man offering to sell the camera back to kstv chose the wednesday lunch hour and a granite bench alongside the water shower at the old nordstroms terrace for the drop it was a sunny day the last week of august that brought out joggers and tourists panhandlers and skateboarders office workers sought out sunworshipping perches for a peaceful sandwich and a twentyminute tan women hiked their skirts up over their knees men loosened their ties and rolled up their sleeves summertime in the emerald city at the other end of town a group of three hundred asians were gathered to march on city hall fifty offduty officers had been called up mixed into the crowd by the water fountain eleven undercover cops kept their eyes on stevie mcneal who carried a thousand dollars cash a kstv tote bag and a severe expression that contradicted the tv personality mcneal wore a lavaliere microphone clipped to her bra its wire taped down her back lamoia as the command officer the cowore a headset in a refitted steam cleaning van forfeited years earlier in a drug conviction and currently used as mobile communications dispatchor mocom for short he had an unobstructed view of the water shower fountain and bench out a mirrored side window of oneway glass the loud noise of the fountains falling water bothered the audio technician a diminutive man with a silver stud in his left ear who by job definition could remain level and calm through the bloodiest of firestorms that fountain is loud shes wearing a condenser which is a problem were not going to hear her so good well at least theres some justice lamoia said maybe it wont make such good tv the kstv crew occupied an unmarked blue step van in front of gapkids they too were monitoring stevies wireless stand by the tech said addressing all the undercover officers its show time as stevie sat down onto the stone bench she exhaled calmly in an attempt to settle herself the water shower sculpture was a fifteenfoot l that a person could walk through without getting wet curtains of water falling on both sides of its narrow aisle kids loved it squealing with delight as they hurried through downwind of the sculpture a cooling mist prevailed she missed the mans approach he sat down next to her a seattle seahawks bag held by the straps he said you look different on tv so they say he was midforties balding wearing clothes that had been popular a decade earlier and with a nose that begged for rhinoplasty his oily hair shined wetly in the sunlight he smoked a filter cigarette that attached itself to his lower lip wet with spit he engaged in a perpetual squint to avoid the stinging spiral of smoke and the bright sunshine he did not look at her his head up eyes alert a careful man a planner the cops had warned her that any man willing to take such a risk was either dumb greedy or both violent maybe not to be trusted for certain she kept close tabs on him how do you want to do this she asked you hand me the envelope he said looking straight ahead and i leave the bag behind i have to see it first she corrected we can do that he agreed shoving the bag toward her go ahead stevie dragged the bag over to her she carefully unzipped it and peered inside brushed aluminum casing the brand name sony she felt choked she had handed this camera to melissa she hated herself for it worse the cameras tape indicator was blank no tape inside stung with disappointment she reached inside i have to see that its our call letters on it theyre on there he said have a look she turned the camera so that the call letters were visible she said theres no tape he said if theres more you want then we gotta talk you talk she offered ill listen youre interested in what was inside he suggested her heart beat frantically am i you gotta come up with another five large you should have mentioned this he said i didnt realize the thing was loaded until after we had us a deal the demand of five hundred dollars seemed so cheap to her whats on the tape she asked no clue he answered five hundred dollars for a blank tape not my problem you want the tape or not do you have it on you five hundred dollars gets you the tape he said he tossed the cigarette sparks flew and the butt wandered in a lazy arc on the pavers you want it or not i havent got all day we had a deal she persisted i give you a thousand dollars and you give me the camera the tape comes with the camera the tape does not come with the camera he said vehemently you got yourself an atm card he asked im listening stevie answered the man said you give me the thousand now and take the camera then you withdraw the five hun out of the atm and meet me back here in ten minutes we go together she objected no way meet me back here ten minutes youll have the tape on you she said trying to sound definite ten minutes he repeated stevie stared off at the water fountain what are you doing im thinking she answered in the mocom van lamoia debated the offer made by the extortionist the dispatcher awaited his decision knowing better than to press did you get all that he asked boldt copy boldt replied mcneals wire transmissions were carried over a set of walkman headphones he wore he had declined lamoias offer to be in the mocom van as the day shift sergeant who had taken the complaint the missing persons case was lamoias lead despite his own desire to take over boldt understood the necessity of the lead officer having full authority a surveillance could turn in a matter of seconds its your call he reminded boldts chevy cavalier was parked only a few yards away in a towaway zone with his cellphone pressed to his ear he was enjoying a cup of earl grey tea at a seattles best coffee in a plastic lawn chair out front of the westlake center from where he owned a slightly elevated and somewhat distant view of the occupied bench alongside the water shower the sony walkman was actually a policeband radio monitor its yellow allweather headphones still in his ears despite the use of the cellphone lamoia asked what the hells he up to you have to make the call john shes waiting its a go lamoia confirmed to the dispatcher who threw a switch on his console and gave the goahead lamoia leaned back nervously and said i hate this shit not twenty feet away from the granite bench where stevie and her visitor sat a street bum suddenly spilled an entire garbage bag of crushed aluminum cans out onto the pavers her visitor jumped a fresh cigarette bobbing in his lips and spraying embers that he batted off his lap with the man distracted stevie quickly looked over her left shoulder as coached a woman not ten feet awaydetective bobbie gaynes although she didnt remember the namesignaled a thumbsup giving approval for the second ransom gaynes continued on skirting her way past andy milner the undercover cop in the role of the street bum who was busy collecting the spilled cans stevie handed the man on the bench the envelope with the thousand dollars knowing that every serial number on every bill was accounted for okay she said weve got a deal stevie took her time walking to the atm assuming that the police would need every minute to regroup and follow her she recognized a few of the detectivesthough the introductions had been fast and furious during her briefing and she didnt remember a single name she strolled casually up the slight rise of fourth avenue approaching the atm where she thought she recognized one of the detectives the man met eyes with her and quickly indicated his wristwatch the signal was obvious they wanted more time the detective stepped away from the atm she suddenly appreciated the police in a way she never had before the surveillance team was keeping up with her despite the change in plans their presence lent her a feeling of safety nonetheless she stepped up to the atm with adrenaline charging her system she inserted her card and punched in her pin twenty seconds later her money was delivered followed by her card she turned in time to see two punk kids coming directly at her their intentions forecast in their determined eyes shed been set up tape or no tape they were going to mug her for the five hundred in broad daylight stevie stepped back toward the atm machine at that same moment a blur of activity erupted to her right a homeless man collided with a woman and stole her two shopping bags violently shoving her to the sidewalk he sprinted away from her heading directly toward the two youths approaching stevie the downed woman shouted for help two uniformed police charged around the corner of the building shouting at the homeless man and finally tackling him at the sight of cops the two punks scattered one heading down fourth avenue the other east on olive stevie stepped away from the atm and collected herself they were all cops she realizedthe street person the assaulted woman the event staged to scare off the punks guardian angels took on the strangest forms halfway back down the street a hand gripped her elbow firmly walk the man said let go of my arm stevie demanded still holding her the man placed a claim check in her hand the art museum he said she glanced down at the claim check a woman was mugged she said its a dangerous city you think ill give you five hundred dollars for a worthless claim check he answered if you dont youll never know what was on that tape youre not getting the money until i have the tape in hand thats not how this works thats exactly how it works stevie said if you dont want to play the man declared then we got nothing to discuss he pulled her to the side out of the flow of pedestrians just to remind you i have five hundred dollars here that has your name on it gimme the five the man said anxiously lets take a walk she suggested ten minutes and youre five hundred dollars richer that aint the way its gonna work he said then its not going to work she declared she reached into the bag and offered the claim check wondering if he noticed her trembling fingers keep it just give me the money he pleaded lets take a walk she said cheerily retaining the claim check she walked away from him realizing he had no choice but to follow she counted to herselfone thousand one one thousand twoher anticipation mounting as she reached the pedestrian crossing where the light changed instantly she crossed with the light i aint got no time for this the mans voice complained over her left shoulder sure you do she replied looking straight ahead this is the easiest five hundred youve ever made she kept walking not knowing if he was following or not but never so much as checking her stride the woman has got nerve lamoia remarked in back of the van his cellphone clutched to his ear whatdoya say we pop the lid on this thing you farting in here or what he asked the dispatcher no sir the dispatcher got up and slowly cranked open the vans skylight smells like a dog let loose in here lamoia commented fanning the air im going on foot boldt announced into the phone we got her covered lamoia said somewhat arrogantly just the same im going on foot lamoia said well relocate the team to the museum we got four on foot theyre your backup boldt said if he puts another hand on her john if he gets an idea to liberate that five hundred were all over him understood he added we screw this up hell itll make brokaw outside the art museum there stood on enormously tall steel plate sculpture of a man pounding an equally huge hammer to stevie it looked russian a holdover of stalinism a dedication to the might of the worker her escort grew increasingly nervous with their approach perhaps sensing the trap that was laid for him her own anxiety increased with each step and she worried that the police didnt have anyone in place yet a group of japanese tourists had collected in the courtyard awaiting their tour guide she felt several of the men staring others shot pictures of the russian worker you dont need me for this the man complained to her i dont trust you she said spinning and confronting you take picture us a japanese man asked stevie extending his camera toward her and indicating his smiling friends stevie hesitantly accepted the camera i dont have time for this her escort objected again settle down she whispered focusing the camera she spun the zoom by mistake behind the group of grinning tourists she saw the steamcleaning van turn left cross traffic and pull to the side of the street she clicked the shutter capturing only the tourists heads the cavalry had arrived boldt approached the museums sunken courtyard wishing mcneal would lower the camera and get a look at him he slowed but did not stop passing within a yard or two of the man at her side detective mulgrave appeared to his left and entered the museum ahead of him it would all move quickly now even if it felt like slow motion he paused at the museums glass doors and studied the reflection as mcneal handed the camera back to the japanese tourist as she turned toward the entrance he wondered if she would recognize him from the back deciding that she probably would stevie mcneal didnt seem like she missed much in the back of the van lamoia spoke into the radio handset if this goes south if our boy makes tracks mulgrave stays on him mocom will follow lynch you put your body in front of mcneal if needed roger that lynch confirmed if we have to move on him i want it down and dirty he ordered we got civilians in there copy the radio sparked with several distinct pops as undercover detectives tripped their radios this told lamoia plenty his operatives were in place no one could speak it was going down stevie stepped up to the coat check and handed the colored tag to the asian behind the counter she wondered if this woman had once been an illegal and realized she had a stereotype to overcome her escort had stopped ten feet back in the midst of museum foot traffic coming and going reminding her of a dog poised on a street curb considering crossing traffic his face florid and feverish he had broken into a sweat out in the courtyard she too was sweating it seemed her chance to save melissaif there still was a chancecame down to these next few minutes and the tape promised boldt stepped up to the counter alongside of her and spoke clearly to one of the coat check attendants what if i lost my claim check he asked he was buying time the girl had turned to face the array of cubbyholes looking for the match to stevies claim check you gotta have your tag the other man informed boldt boldt patted his pockets but if i dont he asked stevies confidence gained with his being so close the girl plunked down the camera bag in front of stevie her heart fluttered she had handed this bag to melissa the last time shed seen her stevie turned the man said okay were outta here not yet bullshit he hissed leaning in close with his tobacco breath this suckers done gimme the five she wanted to confirm the existence of the tape before surrendering the cash a fist tightened around her upper arm outside the man ordered were done here his sideburns leaked pearls of sweat stevie hesitated briefly her fingers hovering on the camera bags zipper she moved toward the wall a water fountain forcing him to release her he let go and pursued her to the wall her arm tingled with relief she pulled the zipper realizing that despite her intentions to stay calm her anticipation had won the moment her heart felt ready to explode she opened the bag and peered inside a pair of black slippers with red roses embroidered on the toes her throat tightened they were melissas she moved them aside the small tape was there as well she didnt understand the next few seconds when blood chemistry and emotions overcame all rational thought when memories of melissa and those slippers were all that mattered tears erupting from her eyes she took the man by his sport coat pulled her face to his and shook him crying where is she what have you done to her the stunned man plunged his hand into the shopping bag and came out with her wallet the money he said his head lifting his dark eyes flashing as he saw one of the detectives reaching for a weapon the man pocketed the wallet turned stevie and shoved her into boldt he dodged across the entrance lobby weaving through tourists using them as protection stevie stumbled into boldts arms he stood her up and took off at a run detective mulgrave shouted loudly police everyone stay where you are the englishspeaking visitors dove to the carpet the japanese smiled and took a moment longer to react shouts and cries followed a uniformed museum guard stepped forward to block one of the exit doors boldt and mulgrave ran toward the entrance as the suspect dropped his shoulder into the guard driving him through the glass door the guard went down hard the suspect fled outside boldt and mulgrave immediately behind boldt shouted at the suspect mulgrave called into his handheld for backup the man crossed through traffic stopped at the light and ran hard heading south on first avenue boldt caught a glimpse of lamoia and a uniform out of the corner of his eye and at the same time a cameraman trailing black wires as he leaped out of kstvs large blue panel truck which was stopped in traffic the cameraman hit the sidewalk running lamoia and the uniform hit the cameramans wires and all three went down boldt dodged through the traffic and took off after the suspect mulgrave still shouting orders into his radio the suspect ran left at the next corner and disappeared from view his lungs burning his right knee tightening boldt lost ground to mulgrave and called out backup on route the detective answered they needed this man in custody to lose the suspect was not an option both cops turned left at the corner mulgrave already breaking across the street the suspect nowhere in sight sirens approached the street rose up a hill no suspect mulgrave headed across the street and down an alley boldt stopped and spun in a circle their boy had either entered one of the buildings or had gone down that alley faced with a tough decisionawait the radio cars and the uniforms so that they sealed off any chance of the suspect sneaking past or pick one of the buildings to search before the suspect had time to escapeboldt studied the wall of brick buildings that lined the northern side of the street his eyes darting window to window one building to the next it appeared first as a shadow then an image a woman in a thirdfloor window one hand spread open on the glass descending a stairway she had clearly stepped aside for someone it was that spread hand that convinced himthe fear it implied boldt took the chance his police shield displayed in his coats breast pocket boldt took two stairs at a time passing the middleaged woman on the second floors landing she pointed up boldt kept moving never breaking stride he had the advantage of surprise now he had to move fast before he lost it by the fourth floor he was severely winded but still climbing the movement came from his right as he turned left toward the final flight of stairs it came as a change of color of lighting as if someone had dropped a curtain or waved a flag it came as a flash of heat up his spine his right arm climbing instinctively but opening him to the blow to his ribs his momentum moved him away from the blow rather than into it he was thrown off balance careening into a chair that sat alongside a standing ashtray he grabbed hold of a leg of that chair and hurled it in the general direction of his assailant simultaneously reaching for his gun the chairs four metal feet screeched like fingers on a blackboard then traveled toward the stairs and as if planned as if calculated flew off the top edge rebounded off the far wall and headed end over end as if aimed at the unfortunate soul in its path the suspect after shoving boldt and then starting back down the stairs never saw that chair it came after him as if it were tethered to him jumping and springing into the air and crashing only to lift again gaining velocity boldt was back to his feet by the time the chair impacted not only tripping up the man but sending him down the subsequent flight of stairs following the same route the chair had traveled a tumbler a circus act gone awry the dull snapping of bone on stone despite the fall the man clamored to his feet but then sagged under the pain and boldt was upon him a handcuff snapped around the wrist in a ritual all too familiar to both men boldt patted him down for weapons while reciting the miranda like a man talking in his sleep he arrested the suspect on charges of trafficking in stolen goods and assaulting a police officer i didnt steal nothing he complained as he was led down the stairs youve got some thinking to do between here and downtown boldt cautioned the man if youve got half a brain in there youll trade a walk for the talk yeah yeah but im telling you i didnt steal nothing if youre smart youll lose the broken record boldt advised then again he reconsidered if you were smart we wouldnt be here would we chapter gaylord riley dragged his fingers against his sweating cheek as if rubbing a lantern for good luck stoically proud of his refusal to talk to police and patiently awaiting his attorney his stained polyester shirt stuck to him like cellophane so that his chest hairs rose like tree roots struggling up through old asphalt the box had warmed behind lamoias mounting frustration to where both men were panting and in need of a glass of water the thing a prick like you doesnt understand riley is that this is the wrong time to lawyerup as if theres ever a right time as far as youre concerned i got a pa outside who will repeat to you everything ive been saying youre a known fence fraud has you on file never been convicted of nothing you give up whoever laid this gear on you and you walk out of here no harm no foul thats bullshit and we both know it that big guy he said assaulting an officer he fell down is alla shoelace or something i didnt assault no officer you want me to get him in here hang on a second lamoia went to the door boldt who had been looking on through the oneway glass was already at the door by the time lamoia opened it boldt stepped inside old times he and lamoia working a suspect all they needed was daphne in the room for the picture to be complete boldt said you talk you walk i told you that id rather hear it from a lawyer the suspect said by which time you wont hear it boldt answered lamoia sat back down in the chair facing the man stupid is one thing you were stupid to get into thisto call the station set up the meet but dont be dumb dont be an asshole who thinks he knows more about how this works than we do weve got jails filled with those numbnuts im telling you you lawyerup you start things in motion that were helpless to stop you bring in the college boys and you me and the lieutenant are in chairs over in the corner watching the suits do the dance is that what you want honestly he felt he was getting through to the guy gaylord riley looked ready to pop a blood vessel all we want is to start a dialogue here boldt encouraged get some words going back and forth work through the attitude down to the truth if we do that in a timely fashion theres no reason lawyers have to be any part of this your little ransom attempt never happened i didnt ransom nothing thats what im saying boldt agreed it never happened lamoia cautioned we got you on videotape audiotape and stills we got maybe a dozen witnesses to this thing pallaw enforcement officers every one of them what do you think you and your lawyer are going to use against that the man looked back and forth between the two detectives the epitome of a scared little boy lamoia loved every minute of it he didnt have the degrees for it but he thought maybe he should be a hostage negotiator some guy who looks the bomber in the eye and dares the slob to push the button he felt good all over like after sex the suspect said he was chinese twentyone twentytwo strong small never seen him before not since didnt know what he hadthought it was a camcorder gang kid boldt asked wiping any surprise off his face business as usual inside he was reeling with excitement he knew better than to ask if hed given a name are there any that arent he quipped no clue he speak english lamoia asked pidgin shit the man answered marble mouth tattoos marks boldt asked just a kid looking to cash in a little scared of the whole thing you know scared of making the deal lamoia clarified right so you thought it was hot boldt said of course it was hot the man declared do i look like a buyer for macys he called it a camcorder lamoia repeated yeah right didnt know shit about it im telling you he came in wanted some money for it i give him two bills and he books whole thing maybe a minute or two two bills for a twelvethousanddollar camera lamoia said hey the stations call letters are engraved on the bottom what can i tell you he musta never seen it didnt know how expensive this digital shit is im telling you he didnt know what he had that kid and the way he was nervous and all he was either a junkie or worried about making the deal somehow that kind of build that strength im not thinking he was a junkie more like a kid who stole his own mothers car stereo he found it boldt said to lamoia he found it or he took it from her but he didnt tell no one lamoia completed who the suspect asked i didnt take nothing from nobody shut up lamoia barked were talking here boldt said he found it and figured hed make himself a couple extra bucks so he hocks it with this bozo lamoia said boldt informed the man were going to ask you to look at photo arrays mug shots right the lieutenant said you point him out you walk out of here hey that werent no part of the deal thats bullshit lamoia stood abruptly startling the man he leaned across the table dont interrupt the lieutenant asshole the mans talking to you boldt repeated youll look at the photos you point him out you walk out of here tonight you dont find him you do a night in lockup for the assault and you look at more photos tomorrow you give us a face we give you a passport this is bullshit this is your way out of here lamoia corrected or would you rather we call the attorneys and tell them you wont cooperate but i did cooperate he protested lamoia turned to boldt do you think hes cooperating sarge i think hes making up stories boldt said im telling you the way it went down the man shouted and hes yelling at us lamoia observed boldt said you give us a face that checks out and you walk lamoia cautioned if youre making this shit up youre toast he was just some kid some chinese kid how am i supposed to know the difference they all look alike lamoia challenged in a threatening tone dont go there pal he lied to pressure the man you dont want to get within a few miles of that given that the lieutenant here is married to a lovely chinese woman and has five little daughters to prove it the suspect looked as if hed swallowed an ice cube or was choking on unchewed meat boldt had to turn to the door so the man wouldnt catch his grin lets get it started he said to his sergeant wondering where lamoia came up with such stuff chapter as a reporter stevie had perfected the art of using people and though her last several years as a news anchor had clearly dulled those talents they were not altogether lost she understood the powerful effect that her body and looks had upon men as well as the envy they incited in womenhow to harness and exploit those attributes as needed she needed them now brian coughlie had access to spd that she did not she had picked the best restaurant in the city she wore a low scooped teal dress that turned heads she was ready her body ached with fatigue and exhaustion after the police sting but she wasnt going to surrender to it until she made it through the dinner and had accomplished what she had come to accomplish judge milton abrams was blocking kstvs viewing of the videotape that she had personally recovered boldt abrams and others had burned her and her only chance to return the favor lay with the man who now sat across the table from her campagne was indeed one of the citys finest restaurants brian coughlie there at her invitation looked slightly out of place but she didnt let that bother her her celebrity had created a buzz in the restaurant the moment shed arrived she played it up hoping to intimidate coughlie who was nothing but a government worker bee with a bad tailor it was an odd alliance at best and she intended to milk him for everything she could get she would stop short of sleeping with him but he certainly didnt know that a hint of sexual suggestion an occasional compliment a welltimed wiggle in her chairshe had the full arsenal at her disposal ready indeed coughlie was not about to turn down an invitation from this one hed been trying to think of a way to get her alone to find out as much about her missing friend as possible one mans ceiling was another mans floor as a media source she had contacts and resources that he did not following her late afternoon piece that police had allegedly confiscated evidence belonging to the station her invitation to dinner had come as a godsend she needed himthe beginning of any negotiation if he got laid in the process so much the better judging by the look of her it would make for an unforgettable evening the way she kept moving her butt in the chair was making him excited but his interest in her was for what she knew not what kind of ride she was spd was stonewalling the ins and vice versabusiness as usual he stuck to the food and wine women loved to talk if you gave them half the chance the way she was hitting the wine shed be giving a goddamn keynote address in a few minutes not to be outdone he took a sip himself decent stuff archery something a yuppie winepeanut noir was what hed nicknamed it hed take a chablis any day at sixty bucks a bottle he thought she was trying to impress him nice try he said to himself it took more than a chest and an attitude to fix his game why does a person join the ins she asked meeting eyes with him why does a person put her face in front of a million people every afternoon its four hundred thousand she corrected and its not a fair comparison the public image of the ins is gatekeepers border guards flattery will get you everywhere tell me im wrong power hungry exfootball players he asked stabbing a piece of thin ham off the appetizer plate that had some kind of italian name cheap bastards cutting it that thin we have our fair share of those its a fair shot to take and you if id wanted to be a hero id have been a fireman she laughed at the comment he continued i suppose you start out thinking youre part of the group that gives people a shot at this country its freedom its opportunity thats the underlying charter dont forget you find a lot of patriots in the service and in the job interviews thats what they play up the opportunity youre giving these people the power that comes with it sure racism probably right some of the guys who sign up want nothing more than to smack some mexican across the face with a nightstick ive seen it but theyre ferreted out pretty quickly those guys believe me no one wants them around the flip side is that we also protect whats left of this country for those who have a legal right to it illegals dilute the status quo they sponge off social programs that theyve never paid into you dont charge at the gate you go broke but theres paying and then theres paying what about the detainees she asked three or four weeks in a container with dead bodies how badly do they want it havent they paid a high enough price for their freedom we both know where those women were headed he reminded sweatshops brothels is that the dream youre selling i need a favor she stated bluntly reaching for the wine bottle and pouring them both more should i be surprised a dinner like this and i thought it was because you found me so irresistible the cops used me welcome aboard confiscated evidence i saw the piece you watch the broadcast every day he answered im flattered what the broadcast didnt tell you they recovered a tape not vhs but digital footage she shot after i gave her that camera he took this all in along with another sip of wine and said you want me to get the digital tape for you they doublecrossed me that tape is rightfully mine lets just say that the idea interests me if the tape contains anything it has to do with the illegalsthat was the story we were working melissa wanted the digital camera because it was small and easy to carry as in surveillance judging by the vhs tapes she shot before i got her the digital im thinking she boarded a bus maybe a car wash im not sure but whatever she shot it has to do with illegals and thats your turf he felt like the wind had been knocked out of him car wash where the hell had that come from time to give rodriguez a call and close it down he felt like bailing on dinner and making the call immediately he said so i press for the right to view this digital tape lets say they grant me that what then i give you a book report the dress was a pleasure to look at she knew about packaging this one she knew how to move to distract a mans attention yes exactly you tell me what you saw she answered and in return i show you the vhs tapes the first three tapes that melissa shot quid pro quo this car wash he tested he had to know the extent of what she knew if she knew too much then he had some tough decisions to make she teased ill show you mine if youll show me yours he couldnt stop himself from grinning she was good this one extremely good youre okay he said im a hell of a lot better than okay brian you just have to trust me im working on that he said echoing her words of their last meeting he boldly winked at her and won a wide smile he loved the dance more than anything and this one knew how to dance thursday august days missing chapter boldt elected to view the contents of the digital videotape against the recommendations of every attorney consulted chows disappearance mandated action as did the larger implication of her possible connection to the dead illegals the two murdered witnesses and kleins having vanished he had no choice in the matter if a court eventually ruled against him throwing out whatever the tape might reveal and whatever case they had built along with it he would need a different way to that same evidence something he would have to workout when needed he wasnt going to allow attorneys to set his agenda why the suit lamoia asked you going to a funeral lot boldt answered lot was king countys tomb of the unknown victima fiveacre piece of forest land where all the jane and john does were put to rest the doe family now numbered over two hundred the women from the container seriously lamoia answered id rather we hold on to them if i want to wear a suit ill wear a suit youre making up that shit about lot yes he didnt tell him the real reason despite their friendship rumor spread too quickly on the fifth floor both men moved quickly down the stairs boldt feeling more agile than he had in years lizs illness had cost him twentyfive pounds in what dixon called a grief diet the pounds had not come back and he was glad for it what do you make of the camera and slippers i dont like it me neither a woman without her shoes is kinda like a car without its tires know what i mean no sure you do shes dead boldt asked im leaning that way dont based on just dont boldt said i want her alive it has been like ten days since anyones seen her sarge im a lieutenant now youve got to stop calling me that i call you lieu and everyones gonna think im using your first name i gotta call you sarge otherwise its lieutenant and thats just way too long you know get used to it look whos talking boldt stopped on a landing and looked lamoia in the eye both men knew he was going to say something but he didnt lofgrin called lamoia stated referring to the head of the forensics lab said he picked up fish scales on the bottom of those slippers wants me to stop by when were done with tech services although the discovery of the fish scales intrigued boldt for their apparent connection to jane doe boldt felt a stab of envy and misgiving he wanted sid calling him not his sergeants but given his advancement to lieutenant it wasnt going to be that way the lab and the mes office notified the lead officer first and a lieutenant was rarely if ever a lead officer supervisor yes consultant yes but not lead boldt wasnt sure why this mattered so much to him but it did he didnt want to be the second to know he didnt want to be the bridesmaid he wanted it to be his pager to go offeven though he hated the things his phone to ring his decision when a case went bad he was now called to the office rather than the crime scene it just wasnt right this in part explained the suit he was wearing he had a job interview lined up for later in the day not even liz knew about it he was in turmoil over the decision to take the interview much less the job if it were offered they stopped at the fire door to the basement floor it had been painted with so many coats that it had a leathery look if anything decent comes out of this video boldt cautioned we need to be thinking about how else we might obtain it in case some judge shuts us down lamoias resources were legendary he had friends who had friends who had access to the most sensitive and privately guarded informationfinancial and otherwise some said it was all those past girlfriends others claimed hed once been military intelligence he never said a word about it extending the legend and keeping his sources protected you got it he said boldt told him its a job interview but i dont want anyone to know that sobered lamoia yeah well i hope for all our sakes it goes really bad he hesitated a moment and then added warmly thanks lieutenant boldt pulled open the door the geek in tech services said something about dubbing the digital down to an svhs master and handed lamoia the remote wandyet another sign of who was lead officerand told him to summon him if they needed anything or when they were through he left the two men by themselves in a small darkened room in front of a twentyseveninch color television a private showing lamoia said starting the tape rolling whos buying the popcorn boldt wasnt in a joking mood the sound and picture were of a city street by day the camera held about waist height the video title stamp was set incorrectly to january the time was pm boldt didnt trust that either the two discernible background conversations were of a couple discussing a native american festival and another two or three men all complaining about their jobs the cameras concealed boldt said softly in a briefcase maybe agreed the scenery suddenly blurred and a city bus was seen approaching its a bus stop lamoia said yup that make sense to you lets watch boldt suggested the air brakes hissed and the bus pulled to a stop shot from the hip as the video was the scene played out from a childs height and perspective boldt thought about his own kids miles and sarah and worried that he wasnt seeing enough of them he was barely seeing liz either for that matterunless he counted the hours she was sleeping with his insomnia back in full swing he saw a lot of liz while she slept he lay there and worriedit didnt seem to matter about what his kind of worry was a world unto itself they caught their first glimpse of melissa in a shiny piece of steel or aluminum or maybe even a mirror inside the bus it happened so quickly that it was hard to tell but there she wastwentysomething almost pretty blue jeans and a wazoo sweatshirtclimbing the stairs of the bus there was too much noise to pick out any particular conversation but the camera seemed intent on the left side of the bus it was obvious that she had worked at maintaining that angle as long as she did given that she was walking the center aisle the whole time what do you think lamoia asked i dont know boldt answered he didnt like the man interrupting every few seconds he wanted to watch the video to get inside the images not be constantly yanked back into the viewing room with his sergeant someone on the left side interests her lets just watch it one time through you think yeah sure melissa took a seat about twothirds of the way down the bus across from the vehicles rear door but the lens remained aimed on the same side of the bus images streamed by outside the windows lamoia said immediately she wants to be able to leave in a hurry boldt said nothing lead by example he was thinking after only a few more seconds there was an abrupt jerk in the image and the time stamp advanced eleven minutes she had stopped and then restarted the recording boldt made note in the dark of the elevenminute break you trying to intimidate me sarge should i be taking notes ill take the notes boldt said the bus turned and lumbered up a downtown street the change in architecture said as much it was noticeably darker outside twilight the nose of the bus lowered all the passengers thrown slightly forward in their seats third avenue bus tunnel lamoia said yup shes following someone what do you want to bet lets watch lamoia snorted excited by what he saw and disappointed in boldts stubborn silence the bus pulled to a stop inside the tunnel and a dozen passengers stood to disembark the camera continued to record as one waist and torso after another passed by it then swung and melissa carried it off the bus and into the bus stop where some passengers headed for exits and others awaited connections for the first time the camera clearly singled out one man in particular there he is lamoia said anxiously whoever he is the man grew increasingly larger as the camera approached for an instant he was held in profile but an overhead ceiling lamp burned a bright white hole into the image and erased the mans face damn lamoia gasped we had him she had him boldt corrected the question that has to be asked did he have her you think he made her we know he made her john boldt reminded we just dont know when this shit gets on my nerves i can tell film im talking about yes boldt said she stopped at a city map turned and sat down presumably on a bench the camera turned ever so slightly and held the mans back in frame shes good at this you know a good aim the image jumped in the lower righthand corner seven minutes had elapsed the mans back was still on the screen he wore an old mothholed sweatshirt with a hood black jeans and wafflesoled boots the mans black wavy hair and build suggested ethnic blooda big hispanic or south pacific man it meant nothing without a better look why this guy lamoia spoke aloud thats the relevant question boldt agreed klein did she connect the missing skirt with this frito bandito thats a racial slur john youre a sergeant now this rice and beans gentleman he said correcting himself tommy taco way to go thank you a bus pulled to a stop passengers disembarked the suspect boarded followed a moment later by the camera and the woman carrying it the image didnt last long she established the mans location on the bus another cut elapsed time seventeen minutes boldt was thinking about timing specific bus routes he wondered how many they would have to deal with exit tommy stage right lamoia said as if directing the film the broadshouldered sweatshirt descended the steps the camera moved toward the door but then abruptly stopped only the sweatshirt disembarked melissa had apparently thought better than to join him out on a darkened stretch of sidewalk in the middle of nowhere well shes not completely stupid lamoia said picking up on the obvious recognize the area the location you kidding those doors were open for maybe five seconds lamoia complained rewind boldt instructed imitating a sports announcer lamoia said our buscam will now perform instant replay as the star of our show descends the rear steps he was as nervous outside as boldt was on the inside the missing woman had followed a mana big man a laborer perhaps maybe not caucasian she had followed him for the better part of an hour at night on two different buses while carrying a briefcase concealing a camera they made three successive attempts to identify any landmark or piece of skyline when the bus doors opened but to no avail the next cut was equally as abrupt as the others were a day later boldt observed that last shot rewind yes see the camera panned left to right small white lights glowed in the darkness as the aperture adjusted both men rocked forward at the same moment dozens of chinese womenall with shaved heads all wearing jeans and tshirtssat behind large industrial sewing machines frantic with work others manned cutting tables busy with razor knives and scissors chained to the tables melissas rapid breathing mixed with the roar of machinery and played loudly from the televisions stereo speakers jesus lamoia muttered the screen zoomed and the lighting improved as a few of the women seamstresses were captured in closeup they appeared bruised and beaten oh my god melissa remarked in a dry whisper the next shot was of a chained ankle blood raw she gasped as the camera focused then another shackled ankle and another the graveyard the womans voice whispered hoarsely hilltop lamoia asked boldt shot him a look had melissa made a connection to their jane doe how when another edit jump the screen stole his attention the ominous groan of machinery continued throughout grating and annoying the camera closed in on a black surface where there suddenly appeared a small hole the size of a silver dollar the lens approached that hole and then focused automatically it was a small room poorly lit by a construction light the sound of running water naked womentheir heads and genitals shavedhose water running down over them they whispered amongst themselves it sounded chinese for once lamoia knew to keep his quickwitted adolescent comments to himself another edit a womanmelissa stood in a dark bathroom working a razor on her scalp the scene was only seconds long she turned to face the camera and smiled she said in a whisper this is melissa chow for kstv news im going undercover now i will join the sweatshops general population this is where i become one of them oh shit lamoia said the woman reached out and turned off the camera the screen flashed black the sound is so hollow boldt remarked his musicians ears ever sensitive the sounds were of womens voices speaking chinese the camera faded in from black to an extreme closeup of a womans face she was bald she spoke in whispered chinese the interview lasted close to a minute the camera cropped at the crown of her head and the peak of her chin the closeup dramatizing her words even without a translator her message was of horrid conditions and fear the tears told that much another fade to black and then faded back in at yet another closeup of a different woman there were three interviews in all all done in whisper all in chinese not a word of english spoken the third was interrupted by a womans voice speaking harshly a warning perhaps the camera aimed down to show a dormitory of woven mats and polarfleece blankets several women slept most of the mats went empty the screen went black and then fuzzy lamoia and boldt sat watching a gray sparkled screen lamoia turned down the sound he fastforwarded the tape making sure they missed nothing you feel sick to your stomach he asked did you ever play with chinese handcuffs when you were a kid boldt asked the woven tubes you stuck your fingers inside sure i remember those what about them the tube constricted you could slip your fingers in but you couldnt pull them back out those were chains on those ankles sarge its what happened to her boldt said she got herself inside but she couldnt get back out like chinese handcuffs boldt nodded he felt better than he had in days the good news is she can speak the language and with her head shaved she looks like everyone else youre thinking shes still alive lamoia said his troubled voice barely rising above a whisper the tape had set a mood had captured them i think she is yes boldt said equally softly the camera surfacing challenges that i know but the reason we havent found her he asked rhetorically is because they havent found her either he turned to lamoia in the dark his silhouette captured by the light from the sparkling gray screen making him look sickly and pallid who knows boldt said they may not even know shes in there chapter can get you nice suit cheap mama lu told boldt she occupied most of the doorway of a building marked only in chinese characters she wore a red cotton tent dress and leather sandals and she carried a rubbertipped bamboo cane that didnt look right on her in the daylight out of her dim lair boldt saw her as much younger midfifties perhaps you dont like this one boldt complained it okay a little big on you i think bad color too dark for skin tone i have cousin skin tone he had bought the suit on sale too many years ago to remember her comments made him selfconscious he worried about how his suit might play in his later appointment she struck boldt as something of a chinese winston churchill the way she held the cane and faintly bowed to him as he spoke boldt had sandwiched the stop between the conclusion of the video session with lamoia and his upcoming job interview intending to work the woman for information on the location of sweatshops but she had other ideas sensing his impatience and urgency mama lu demanded they meet at a location of her choosing a nondescript building on a busy street in the heart of the international district i have an appointment he continued this not take long she told him mama lu set her own pace her own tempo in the world of jazz she was a ballad not bebop you will be so kind she said indicating the door boldt opened the door for her stepping close enough to smell a faint trace of jasmine and was reminded of her gender something easily forgotten when enveloped by her commanding presence as she passed he said softly another woman was found dead another chinese head shaved bad shape he caught himself slipping into her clipped mode of speech chinese or chineseamerican you see to us there is much difference mr both i show you she led boldt down a short red hallway and through a bright pink door into a large open room filled with fifty or more asian children they sat at low tables in groups of five or six finger paintings hung from the fabriccovered walls a handdrawn english alphabet was draped above the blackboard like a banner there were beanbags dollhouses plastic forts and a wall of books it was busy but not loud xylophones hammered out halftone chinese melodies boldt read a modest plastic sign mounted to the wall and understood immediately that she was playing politics beneath the prominent chinese characters on the sign were the words hongyang lu child center and womans shelter mama lu was sole proprietor as if on cueand he had to wonder about thatseveral adorable children ran to greet the great lady clutching to her tent dress and jumping for her arms little dolls boldt thought of his own sarah and how quickly her childhood was slipping away he was working long hours again a pattern he had broken during lizs illness and though there were a million justifications for it he suddenly wondered if he was working or running from something daphne had put these thoughts in him and he couldnt get away from them mama lu interrupted his thoughts these my children american citizens they born here live here grow up make money pay taxes she spoke in chinese to the half dozen children crowding her and they ran back to their stations older girls upstairs she said pointing to the ceiling different problems boldt counted ten young adult women supervisors far more per child than at his own childrens day care one of these young women approached and spoke softly and cordially welcoming them unless a wellconceived act mama lu was no stranger here the woman shook boldts hand and asked if the police would ever consider coming and talking to the students he offered to do so himself mama lu glowed with his offer the woman headed back to her kids and mama lu said to boldt this girl once part of shelter now teacher give back to community this free day care anyone welcome youre a very generous woman not point pay attention children american no illegal born here means american citizens whether or not their parents were or are legals yes i understand the way the laws work the laws not work she countered pay attention these children are alive mr both they grow up pay taxes american citizens i understand boldt replied in a menacing tone she hissed you understand nothing boldt told her we have evidence a videotape other evidence as well theres a sweatshop the people doing this will be caught and punished he allowed that to hang in the air along with the clanging xylophones and the joyous squeals those who cooperate with us boldt told her are treated differently in the eyes of the law law does not have eyes law is blind law does not see parents only children she swept her pudgy hand across the room lady justice is blind boldt corrected she squinted up at him like a person looking into the sun why you make so much trouble these people did nothing to help these women when they became sick you dont need laws to tell you that is a crime if one of these children became sick with the flu would you simply allow the child to die you not sure of this she tested oh yes were sure he leaned in closely to her and whispered faintly the woman in the graveyardburied without a casket without a service dumped into the mudhad been violently raped he added reluctantly every cavity this news clearly struck her redhot anger flashed behind her dark eyes starved to death raped and buried boldt repeated before leaning farther away they froze her bodywere not sure for how long or why we know she was a part of a sweatshop her fingers mama lu stood leaning on the cane in stunned silence the gleeful sounds of children swirling about them a sweatshop could not operate in this city without your knowledge boldt said boldly im not suggesting your participation only your awareness he added can you continue to condone such behavior help me stop them great lady you will be a hero a great friend to this city people arrive from overseas she said equally softly they have no place find work government no allow them work much need this work mr both what to do make lady favors this kind of work die of disease this not fair very much not fair they starved her and they raped her boldt was struck by the severity of their discussion especially when contrasted to the gleeful enthusiasm that surrounded them this is fair horrible the lady gasped your visit much appreciated no no no boldt corrected we believe this sweatshop is in a canneryan old cannery perhaps we have evidence to support this many canneries once upon a time big city big area exactly he said help me great lady we find the sweatshop we stop looking he suggested this won her attention he nodded his insistence if we dont find the right sweatshop were going to be conducting a lot of raids bottom line the people who did this are going down for it and these children she asked their mothers once made the clothing you speak of this is how they survived what of them four women are dead medical examiner says three had given birth their children have no mothers is that what you want you have two children she said surprising boldt with her knowledge one boy miles daughter sara she mispronounced you love your daughter mr both he didnt answer he glared at her his heart racing suddenly wishing hed never met her he swallowed hard recalling the time sarah had been kidnapped he understood that hell firsthand he relived it almost every night the unspoken source of his insomnia you see child she asked pointing out a small girl no older than two her mother give birth this child yes in chinaone child only if boy he grow up keep family home take care parents girl moves away with husband girl child no good many daughters born but left in street never seen again yes boldt could think only of sarah and miles why had she mentioned them how had she known many daughter sent to cousins in america here seattle yes mother pay much money for this mother come later in bottom of ship in container yes american government say she not political refugee has no right live in america you mr both you refuse her chance to be with own daughter she work hard many years no papers earn much money find green card citizen now she added with a faint smile this america everything for sale boldt held his tongue still thinking about sarah and the idea of daughters abandoned at birth or shipped away to a distant land he felt cold sick to his stomach we dont know her name he finally said the woman we found in the grave raped starved no name she wont be buying her freedom she wont be buying anything he tried once again to get his point across there are people who say theres no way a sweatshop can operate in this city without your knowledge she craned forward ominously you believe such things a woman is missing i must find her i must stop these people who treat these women this way its going to stop great lady with or without you i would be most grateful for any guidance you could give me in where to look for this sweatshop believe me no one need ever know my source for such information leave this alone mr both she said this dangerous everyone involved yourself too you help me very much coming here tell me these things i didnt come here to help you i came here to ask you to help me she pointed to the door of course i help you no problem but you must listen yes this woman who make the news on the tv she make wrong people mad your name too get mentioned you make her listenno make so much trouble bad for everyone she warned ominously you watch for shadows mr bothshadows not cast by you wrong people make mad boldt felt his throat go dry as he restated our evidence is growing we will find the people responsible we will put them out of business he caught himself reducing his sentences to clipped english pandering to her in ways he did with few others for all he knew she spoke fluent english they and anyone associated with them are going to prison she said go home your children your wife mr both it doesnt work like that boldt objected lady justice may be blind great lady the police are not we are the law no one else not you not anyone else we both idealists yes when she grinned her dentures showed as perfect as a picket fence those teeth didnt belong in such a face they robbed her of character too bad for both of us chapter boldt waited ten minutes outside the offices of boeings vice president of human resources alone with his battered briefcase his tenyearold suit and a stomach churning with raw nerves he was always in the role of the one doing the questioning never the object of it the idea of some corporate executive with a title so long that it couldnt possibly fit on a business card quizzing him about his life his family his dreams struck him as deeply disturbing how did he explain that he didnt want the job only that he needed the added income how did he explain that if sheila hill confined him to a desk hed just as soon the desk be across town for twice the pay that sitting at that desk while others were at the game was a cruel form of torture how did he tell another human being that in a way not morbid at all he lived for the fieldwork the dead bodies if only because they kept his mind alive his imagination active and his raison detre intact the thick glass of the coffee table was littered with aviation and golf magazines across the fairly antiseptic reception room a matronly secretary stayed busy at her phone and computer though she didnt appear too absorbed by the work finding enough time to repeatedly sneak glimpses of boldt and his nervous demeanor he brushed the shoulders of the dark suit clean inspected the hang of his tie his hand darted into his crotch quickly to ensure his fly was up the secretary caught that movement and taking it for a signal lifted her head slightly peered above a set of half glasses and said shouldnt be much longer melissa chow hadnt been seen in ten days this was the only clock running in his head no it shouldnt boldt agreed forcing a moment of paralysis onto her otherwise expressionless face he checked his watch instead of seeing the minute or hour hand again he saw the date ten days the rule book would say she was dead boldt had the videohe believed otherwise with the sweatshop now a matter of record he had evidence to follow he glanced at the aviation magazines his head reeling lamoia who continued to keep mcneal under surveillance despite the risks would keep gaynes on researching polarfleece imports and manufacture others would canvas discount houses retail outlets and street vendors supplying lofgrin and the lab with samples of every blue polarfleece garment available in king county they needed a list of every vacant structure in the county from canneries to former schools to airplane hangars they needed that sweatshop the work seemed endless suddenly the idea of babysitting a fortune corporation and spying on its employees lost its shine even sitting there waiting for the vice president of human resources to get off the phone seemed a futile act he glanced up at a blackandwhite photo on the wall and saw three grave mounds only to realize it was in fact the gray curving roofs of airplane hangars not freshly dug graves but the image served to remind him of the digital tape and melissas mention of the graveyard were there other women buried at hilltop cemetery had they missed that he grabbed the phone and dialed his own pager number ten seconds after he hung up the pager sounded loudly glancing at it he stood and took hold of his old ratty briefcase somethings come up he informed the secretary ive got to get back to the office hell be done with the call any minute she pleaded boldt sensed it was her job to hold him her problem to fix its urgent the woman nodded seemingly relieved official police business would let her off the hook may i reschedule ill call we can do it now ive got his daytimer right here she flipped some pages mines back at the office he said hell be terribly disappointed to have missed you she glanced toward the phone clearly hoping to see the phones line light extinguished she resolved to stall him no one would walk out on conversation theres a good buzz about you a buzz he said im glad he cringed he didnt want to be the topic of buzzing her index finger with its halfinch plastic nail roamed the mans schedule hows your golf game boldt returned a puzzled look and glanced down at the coffee table magazines he had tried the game in another life back when liz had been whole and the kids only an idea discussed at the end of lovemaking they need a fourth on friday she said keeping her voice low she informed him all the big deals are done out there i imagine youll be seeing quite a bit of the golf course a bit rusty he said the closest he had come in recent years was minigolf with miles i can pencil you in i dont think so no i really had better check my schedule he broke with etiquette and headed for the doors youll call she fired off somewhat desperately he winced he wouldnt call not for some time first he would run things by liz in order to include her in the decision she planned to return to fulltime work by thanksgiving she would interpret this job change of his as a stubborn refusal to see her as healed as his way of financially protecting his future his days of running the family alone running things without her were over they had been over for several months though he was loath to accept it in a strange way he had become dependent on her illness had adjusted his life to meet it head on had focused on nothing but that for the last sixteen months had learned well the role of single father orphaned husband and head of household had become dependent on her dependence on him her return to the family was difficult to take his decisions were challenged again his monarchy once more a democracy at the elevators he caught a glimpse of himself in a wall mirror mama lus offer of a better suit teased him more than a bad fit its mood was wrong lamoia was right he only wore a suit at funerals and award dinners if he returned for the job interview he was wearing khakis and a blazer but he wasnt coming back not any time soon he knew lizs vote before ever hearing it he wondered if he could get used to that kind of participation again and if not what he was supposed to do about it chapter boldt arrived alone at hilltop cemetery struck immediately by the finality of death melissa had mentioned the graveyard on the digital tape it was time to review that evidence hence the visit as a homicide cop he was surrounded by death but not quite like this the granite and marble headstones rising out of the lush green lawn names rubbed illegible by decades of salt air so that the stones were nothing more than anonymous testimonies to death itself the solitude overwhelmed him he expected either lamoia or daphne to join him having left voice mail for both and he hoped it might be sooner than later visiting a graveyard seemed too close to home he couldnt get lizs illness out of his thoughts and suddenly grief and fear overcame him he stepped forward and leaned his weight against someone named lillian grace rogers who had been in residence in that spongy earth some seventythree years do you believe in god it was daphne standing incredibly close just behind him hed called her and asked her to meet him he thought he had found the missing link but would need support within the department he didnt turn around because of his tears but daphne always seemed able to read his mind yes of course he answered do you have faith in god she asked maybe not he admitted not after twenty years in this job a light rain a mist began falling boldt pulled himself off lillian grace rogers and stood erect liz has faith in god daphne said a deep penetrating trust a reliance im not qualifying that its foreign to me too but until you understand the difference between your belief and her faith until you bridge that gapyou cant possibly hope to understand her i have to understand her he said into the light rain yes you do so its incumbent on me to do this she didnt answer you think shes not the one struggling lou a jet passed overhead its lights flashing its turbines grinding the air seemed to shake boldt hoped it was the air and not him daphne asked whats with the suit i interviewed with boeing he said to him it felt like a confession daphne of all people should have heard ahead of time actually i didnt but i was scheduled to i see she added whose idea liz doesnt know okay you think im running from work or from liz i didnt say anything i dont understand her spirituality her reliance upon it okay but youve tried she said questioningly he turned around she had been smart enough to wear a goretex jacket it was green and complemented her eyes how does a person get there how does a person cross that bridge you dont have to cross a bridge you simply have to acknowledge the other side allow the other side to exist as equally valid as your own but its not equally valid so you have your work cut out for you im supposed to start reading the bible or something he said sarcastically maybe just talk to her about it daphne suggested thats the best bridge of all she tugged on the hood and a rivulet of water streamed down to her shoulder and cascaded off her elbow why are we here anyway im beginning to wonder boldt admitted i thought i came here to find more graves more bodies he added maybe it was just to find whats buried more bodies if they buried one why not others im sitting there in a waiting room at boeing and im seeing graves in photos of airplane hangars and im thinking jane doe wasnt alone up here isnt it pretty tricky to exhume extremely difficult especially given we dont know where to look but if there are other women buried up here they may hold information we need this missing reporter mentions the graveyard on her video im thinking thats the connection were missing she followed someone here daphne suggested followed someone from here the gravedigger maybe someone who could tell them when a fresh grave came available they keep the women frozen until they have an opening melissa made the connection maybe but if the gravedigger was on the take hed have to have a way to contact them she said completing his thought my job is to find melissa before she ends up here the rain slackened off and daphne drew the hood away she fluffed her hair and shook her head side to side she said has it occurred to you how complex an operation this is the ships the containers the cargo the rendezvous transportation fake ids graveyards brothels sweatshops at thirty thousand dollars a passenger the margins are pretty good but who could pull off something like this and with the ins out there how long could they get away with it big players he said has to be on that end the chinese triad would know about it or control it on this end people like mama lu thats why im so interested in her youre right its huge its no momandpop affair thats for sure but to get away with it she said coming back to her original thought my job in all this is to come up with a psych profile a personality sketch of our suspect i built a model closest thing i could come up with was a beehive lots of worker bees following orders they handle the daytoday the gangs exactly then come the drones they can give orders but they take orders too you work your way up this succession of power and the thing i kept coming back to the bee in my bonnetif you willis that in the upper ranks up near the very top it requires even necessitates someone in a position of strength not power not physical might i dont mean that but strength connections knowledge insight she added no matter what model you use they dont get away with this without someone in that position luck only lasts so long the way you win in a game this big is not to rely on luck at all stack the deck boldt said yes stack the deck theyve bought someone off boldt said thats what youre saying i dont like it either it started raining again daphne jerked the hood up over her head boldt stood in the rain imaging systems what i saw it on the discover channel with miles archeologist using technologies developed by oil companies they found dinosaur bones without digging dinosaurs so why not humans he asked looking up and indicating all the headstones friday august days missing chapter with police refusing to share the video and no word from brian coughlie with it being a friday and another long long weekend looming before her stevie elected to turn to viewers for help knowing full well it would entail an enormous risk now in the eleventh day of melissas disappearance she felt she had no choice she had never experienced the bright burning glare of the studio lights quite like thisthey felt more like those used in interrogations in old blackandwhite films blinding and intimidating meant to extract the truth with her own words spread out on the news desk before her and echoed on the teleprompters with these words hers and not some news writers as they typically were she found the anchor desk the wireless microphones and the penetrating stare of the clear glass camera lenses suddenly terrifying jimmy corwin looked on from behind the thick glass of the control booth his agitated expression a mixture of stunned amazement twisting curiosity and deep concern it wasnt every friday morning that stevie mcneal showed up at the station at am demanding a twominute segment on the wakeup news and another oneminute piece on the seattle today cutaways that frequented the national morning show he had negotiated such appearances by her as part of their deal when he gave stevie the container assignment but he had never expected her to deliver an eerie silence enveloped the set the morning crew were on pins and needles because they didnt have down the peculiarities of how to manage the afternoon talent or so stevie surmised that along with her tired appearance and her lack of makeup she wore only some lipstick she had sent both the hair girl and powder boy packingthere would be no touchups between shots she wore a dark cotton turtleneck that did not emphasize her curves in fact all of this along with having her hair pulled back meant that there was nothing suggestive about her whatsoever the sexploitation of the news would have to wait for the next fresh face to come along she was done with it now as the floor directors fingers rhythmically counted down five four three stevie turned inside herself searching for that sense of calm that she knew had always been there when she most needed it the cameras were aimed on her she reminded herself the lights aimed on her the hundreds of thousands of viewers hanging on her every phrase every syllable every nuance nothing compared with live television she was not thinking of the container series she was not aiming to impress new york or atlanta she was making an effort to save a friend a sister her little sister mi chow she had been called back then for the name melissa had not yet been given to her stephanie didnt recall exactly how old they had been at the time but she did remember that theyd been small enough that she had needed to stand to see out the side window of the chauffeurdriven chrysler as it passed an openair market the craggy faces of the chinese women and men hiding beneath the enormous straw hats worn as protection against the unbearably hot sun mi had occupied the center of the backseat flanked by father and a beautiful english woman that stevie had seen at fathers parties stevie could still see this womans hat and black veil her bright lipstick and dark blue dress shiny blue leather shoes with spike heels stephanie saw bicycles and dust heard the sound of chickens and smelled a noodle shop this ride thrilled her to her core for there was much whispering much secrecy surrounding it though this was something stephanie only sensed her aunt susu was crying softly from the passenger side of the front seat one hand stretched back but not quite touching mi chow tears ran down her cheeks not to cry susu stephanie said but she cried all the harder with that she glanced back at father whose enormous height white skin golden hair and broad brown mustache had once frightened mi chow to the point of hiding the openair market passed in a blur of activity bamboo crates and brilliant green vegetables the lucky ones wore sandals the rest went barefoot the olive tunics were the same that everyone wore everyone everywhere only in the gigantic posters of the great and beloved leader and in the city did people dress differently father wore a pinstriped suit a white shirt gold cufflinks and a broad red necktie bearing golden crowns he wore wirerimmed glasses and smoked a cigarette he had a low commanding voice as he warned stephanie to hold on tight the buildings streamed by in a colorful blur with the speed of the car stephanie let go of trying to fix to any particular imageshanties corner markets the bicyclists flowing like water around the car susus soft cries occupied her every thoughtsomething was terribly wrong father spoke aloud and all at once susu spun leaned over the seat and took hold of mi chows hands she whispered in chinese and stephanie heard her say that mi was not to be afraid that susu and steph and uncle patrick loved her very much and that uncle patrick was a great man and that mi should listen and obey this english woman who was to accompany her father was too busy looking out the car window to take in any of this he shouted frantically at the driver who constantly checked with him in the rearview mirror all at once the car swerved sharply and nearly struck a man on a bicycle the tires ground to a stop enveloping them in a cloud of swirling brown dust the english woman lifted mi to her lap as father threw open the back door and climbed out together the three of them mi clutching tightly to father disappeared into the dust caused by a second car that had pulled up behind them this car had been the source of fathers earlier distraction there was much shouting and confusion susu called out to her niece be brave child steffie and uncle patrick will be with you later tonight a car door shut loudly the dust swirling around father who suddenly stood alone among the curious peasants i will see little sister tonight stephanie asked susu in chinese youtake long trip she replied a long long trip across the ocean and you stephanie asked the woman already in tears broke down and hid her face my child she said my child stevie thought of television cameras as the most powerful weapons in the worldthey affected far more people than any bomb it had taken her thirteen years to fully understand and take advantage of that power she believed fervently that with just two minutes of the right air time a person could change the world for her there were to be no more tedious interviews with ins directors shipping company executives and politicians melissas early surveillance footage was both potent and incriminating coughlie had encouraged her to use the power at her disposal and he was right klein had gone into hiding leads were running out if she teased the police while calling on the public to help she felt she could bring the police back to the bargaining table she wanted that digital tape she wanted melissa back the floor director signaled her the cameras red light illuminated she was live good morning eleven days ago a reporter from this station melissa chow went missing this is a clip of her shot two months ago that some of you may recall on the screen melissa stood high on a bluff the sounds green waters in the background her jet black hair tossed by the wind a white passenger ferry slid into view as she said into the camera the states passenger ferry system has never carried more people more miles than it has over the past twelve months but what of postponed maintenance schedules hiring practices rumors of embezzlement and drunken pilots the television screens across the state returned to a picture of stevie at the anchor desk that is melissa chow she is twentysix years old she is chinese by birth she speaks english with little or no accent she stands five feet two inches and is approximately one hundred and five pounds she is believed to have been investigating illegal immigrants at the time of her disappearance and is feared to be in grave danger on the screen you are now seeing images she recorded prior to her disappearance the first is of a licensing service office worker gwen klein who is presently wanted by police for questioning this next shot is of an unknown male in whom melissa was clearly interested prior to her going missing the dire circumstances of her disappearance speak for themselves police have few if any clues anyone having any information leading to her recovery will be rewarded ten thousand dollars cash by this station jimmy corwin jumped out of his chair on the other side of the soundproof glass and threw his arms in the air waving frantically he then pulled at what little hair he had left and mouthed a series of shouted orders at his team stevie hoped they werent cutting her off and going to ad any such information will be treated confidentially by the police your coming forward will never be made public not ever whether an innocent observer who happened to see something or one of the very people responsible for melissas disappearance we want her back you the people of washington state are the finest anywhere we at kstv have lost one of our own we appeal to you our community for informationany informationthat may help us bring melissa home safely the number on your television screen is a tollfree number that connects you directly to the police it can be called from any phone anywhere twentyfour hours a day please help us find our friend thank you for your concern clear the floor director shouted the hush that followed stevies announcement was shattered by corwin hollering over the intercom his voice booming into the room who the hell authorized that that script wasnt in the booth mcneal my office this minute for the benefit of the microphone still clipped to her turtleneck stevie said calmly if the moneys a problem jimmy dont worry im prepared to pay the reward myself and if you want to talk to me it will be in my office but youll have to get in line i have a hunch my phone is about to start ringing chapter boldt had just stepped out of the shower when he heard his pagers annoying beep the bedside phone rang nearly simultaneously and boldt knew immediately there was either a dead body or trouble he felt leashed to these devices no longer ever truly alone the idea of public service taken to a level of absurdity that left him without a private momentnot even a few minutes in the shower liz climbed out of bed naked and boldt winced to acknowledge that the body that had once sparked so much desire in him was now mostly a reminder of his wifes battle with cancer her ribs showed she answered the phone hello yes it is captain hes in the shower she listened carefully before signing off by saying yes ill be sure to tell him im turning the tv on for you she announced that was sheila hill you know i really resent having to call her by her rank why does it bother me so much that my husband reports to a woman with half his experience half his brains and more than half again his paycheck she wants you tuned in to channel four right away youre supposed to be interested boldt entered the living room dripping wet with a towel wrapped around his waist ten minutes later he was creating his own lane and passing traffic behind the incessant strobe of the dashmountedbubble gum light while talking on the cellular were going to be flooded with calls boldt warned lamoia we burned her and she burned us back she just sank us and the investigation options a groggy lamoia asked we move ahead of the tidal wave thats certain to come if we dont itll trap us and drown us call coughlie over at ins we want a list of any and every possible sweatshop location in the city thats all i tell him tell him were going to start kicking some doors in and that we wantno we needhis foot to lead the way that ought to get a rise out of him chapter vacant structures were a scourge to any city because they ended up crack houses gang lairs and arson targets it was their designation within this last category that made them of interest to the seattle fire department sfd tracked all structures vacant more than one calendar year boldt knew this from his involvement with an arson investigation two years earlier within half an hour of his request boldt had on his desk a tenpage list of every known vacant structure in king county he faxed this to dr virginia ammond who had been compiling her own list of former canneries for him crossreferencing this list against her own ammond pinpointed two possible structuresboth vacant both former canneries when brian coughlie called and offered a federal search warrant to help speed up the process boldt accepted without any formal mention of it they had formed a task force and although their superiorshill and talmadge respectivelymight fight over the concept boldt and coughlie were determined to get down to business the only glimpse of the structures interior came as a huge garage door lifted to admit a ford minivan so new that it still carried a dealers paper permit taped to its rear window one of boldts squad pulled the permit number using a pair of binoculars and called it downtown in order to run it boldt sat in the passenger seat of coughlies buick a considerable step up from his own chevy this video you guys got hold of you thinking about sharing that coughlie asked that could probably be arranged the pas office might have a thing or two to say about it im not asking the pas office coughlie said you probably should boldt said he didnt fully trust coughlie for the same reasons daphne had cited other than mama lu coughlie had been the only one outside of spd to whom boldt had mentioned the freighters ship captain a few hours later the captain had been found dead his frustration with the ins his suspicions of coughlie and talmadge in particular had started then regardless of how farfetched it had seemed at the time millions of dollars were at stake and no one could be counted out if coughlie hadnt produced the search and seizure warrant as he had he wouldnt have been part of this operation law enforcement made for strange bedfellows when the temporary dealer permit came back stolen boldt asked coughlie can you give me any reason a sweatshop would need a hot minivan to transport their workers the ins man stated matteroffactly i cant think of a vehicular bust weve made in the last three years that didnt involve either a stolen vehicle or stolen plates the thing about what we do he asked rhetorically none of these people exist can you imagine they dont exist there is no paperwork on them no birth certificates credit information tax recordsno nothing thats what were up against phantoms we pull em over they scatter into the streets and we have nothing to follow because they are nothing a confirmed stolen vehicle in terms of probable cause this bust just got a whole lot easier agreed boldt said have you been shot at lately only by my captain boldt said causing coughlie to laugh im from the george patton school coughlie told him reaching into the backseat for a kevlar vest i dont believe in sending my guys into any battle that i dont engage in myself you dont have kids boldt observed no kids no family no no one coughlie replied dryly he strapped on a throatmounted microphone that straddled his voice box and he then inserted an earpiece the device allowed handsfree conversation between team members he toyed with a small black box that he then clipped to his belt you guys with me he spoke for the benefit of his team yeah were going in the bulletresistant vest was not physically heavy but its presence was it meant battle it meant risk for boldt a vest was a symbol of youth it had been well over a year since he had worn one ironically as he approached the hangars north door at a run behind his own four heavily armored emergency response team ert personnel he caught himself worrying about his hands not his life he didnt want to smash up his piano hands in some close quarters skirmish one of his few selfish pleasures in life was the pianohis evening practice and the occasional happy hour performance at jokes on you to break a finger or a wrist was to dislocate more than bone and ligament it was to sever him from personal expression unlike a typical spd covert operation boldt had no way to monitor communications his own ert officers were outfitted with handsfree radios but they were short sets for both lamoia and boldt who were to rely on hand signals absurdly in the name of government secrecy the feds used their own protected radio frequencies meaning that even though they wanted to the two teams ins and ert could not hear the others radio traffic hand signals were used to communicate between the two digitally equipped units well aware that they had thrown this together a little too quickly perhaps hastily and that he was relying on men hed never met boldt kept pace with the ert operative in front of him eyes ever vigilant for the hand signals that controlled his movement and thought process when that hand reached up fingers open and then closed firmly cementing into a fist boldt stopped and squatted down when it made numbersfour and fourboldt paired up with another of the ert operatives and stepped to the left of the door the eight men crouched the door was knocked in with a ram and they streamed into the building the line dividing in two boldt followed the yellow letters police printed onto the black nylon vest in front of him it was a chop shop not a sweatshop the enormous area littered with automotive parts and vehicles in various stages of disassembly the air reeking of welding torch and burning paint boldts team took shelter behind the disembodied shell of a gutted pickup truck coughlies team ducked behind a pile of automobile doors the first shot to ring out came from the far side of the room men scattered in all directions once provoked law enforcement returned fire some of their targets dove to the floor arms spread the rest fled like rats a few hand signals and the weapons went quiet gray smoke lofting into the air two of the opposition were down but squirming alive but wounded in all nine men were cuffed and read their rights spd officers caught two more suspects fleeing on foot the remainder escaped within the hour the scene began to sort itself out the suspects having been transported downtown and run through booking a computer was seized a thorough inventory began bernie lofgrins sid technicians went to workphotographing cataloguing developing prints accounting for the wounded attempting to ensure that the charges would stick surfaces were swept evidence bagged and collected finding a free moment boldt stepped aside and called liz just to hear her voice if it hadnt been early in the alphabet we might not have caught it for a couple weeks the robbery detective chuck bandelli explained to boldt from the other side of boldts desk back at public safety bandelli had a crude look to him like a horse left out in the rain but as it is two of us got given the job of notifying all them people whose vehicles were chopped and we divided up the list by threes you know a through c d through f this kinda thingto make things faster so im the one got stuck with the cs and when i seen that girls name right there on the list i figured i better clue you in chow m vin ce ave c sosea boldt stared at that line on the computer printout for the longest time a world of confusion her carit was a vanhad been stolen and gutted for export boldt did not want to believe that she had met a similar fate but the cop in him had his doubts listen bandelli boldt said id appreciate it if this didnt get around the house the press gets a whiff of this and were going to be in the middle of a big stink sure thing lieutenant boldt knew it would leak the question was when chapter the gravedigger was not the man boldt expected others had interviewed him the first time around and so his slight frame his aged gaunt face and hollow iceblue eyes came as a surprise boldt had envisioned a thick burly man with dirt under his nails and a cold distance in his eyes the one major requirement of the job as it turned out was to operate a backhoe boldt stood on the far side of the observation glass hoping that this man might connect them to whoever had buried jane doe melissas mention of the graveyard and boldts subsequent visit to hilltop had sparked a thought they had been intentionally misled it was lamoias interrogation friday afternoon everyone wanted to get home the detective kicked his twothousanddollar boots up onto the formica table and leaned his head back you know why youre here more questions his voice was as thin as he was youre right about that lamoia waited a moment what do you think we want to ask you about that girl which one the one i found that chinese girl thats something we need to clear up lamoia informed him thats a good place to start whats that were thinking it wasnt you who found her of course it was i called the police you people must have recorded yeah you called the police and you played it out real well but someone else found that body isnt that right mr caldwell someone visiting hilltop early that morning an old lady maybe an old man this person reported it to you and you made the call to us i mean if you make the call why should we look at you very hard and of course thats what happened caldwell blinked rapidly jutted out his jaw and said thats not true which part isnt true lamoia asked and i should warn you that you want to be careful here this is an incredibly important moment for you mr caldwell you cooperate with me and i can see the possibility of your walking out of this building a free man but if you try blowing smoke up my ass youre going to be wearing denim courtesy of the state for a few years got it so id think my answers through if i was you and i wouldnt go making nothing up on account you dont know what i know and that puts you at a distinct disadvantage the man furrowed his brow and blinked some more so lets try it again lamoia said you knew that body was there all along the old man shook his head faintly i knew something was in there lamoia glanced over his shoulder at the oneway glass and boldt on the other side it was a gesture meant to compliment boldt on his suspicions did you bury that woman no he barked sharply but you knew there was a body there because youd done this before a little side money to help with the rent cash i imagine he waited now is not a good time to be inventing the truth a mexican big guy offered me five hundred bucks if id dig the graves the night before instead of the morning of like i usually do melissas video had showed a big guy on the bus mexican maybe lamoia compartmentalized this you called him paged him what no nothing like that i only seen him that once the first time after that i start digging at night thats all a couple times theres an envelope in the tool box the next morning thats all how many times a couple how many twice thats all a thousand bucks all together right the old man said this mexican can you describe him he shook his thin head again it was raining didnt get a very good look at him he was wearing this the man stroked his chest apron sort of thing rubber black rubber like a fisherman i dont know no fisherman a big sonofabitch thats all i remember about him meanlooking you know like that who found the body lamoia asked an old lady a dingy old bird said someone had stolen a casket and left the body she didnt get it i told her id handle it he looked up at lamoia i called you guys cause i wasnt sure what shed do about it he added and maybe cause i wasnt feeling so right about it anyway dont try to sell me the good citizen thing lamoia cautioned quit while youre ahead im telling you i wasnt feeling right about it we want you to look at some photographs for us mug shots like that yeah youll do that for us do i need me a lawyer lamoia glanced over his shoulder again toward the glass he hesitated a moment and said no youre gonna walk out of here today but were gonna want you to stick around and no more night graves someplace i can take a piss down the hall ill get the photos ready chapter at pm friday night under the glare of halogen floodlights powered by a noisy and smelly generator a woman researcher from the universitys archeology department gestured toward boldt unheard and unseen radio waves penetrated the earth and returned signals to her computers via a pair of antennae atop small boxes this was the third grave site she had tested red and black wires ran from the antennae back to an aluminum table hosting the array of computer gear boldt took the signal and walked the boxes two feet apart he looked up awaiting his next command lamoia nudged boldt and said in a whisper were losing the world to geeks you realize that think about it the geeks run the computers and the computers run everything from long distance phones to icbm missiles im telling ya were not safe no more with these people behind the dials we cant exhume without evidence of an unexplained body thats the way the warrant reads i understand that lamoia complained im just saying anyone who knows how this shit works especially a woman i mean anyone who could think this stuff up who wants them in charge youve been watching too much tv in all my free time lamoia quipped the woman called out to boldt okay lieutenant lets try four feet boldt approached the two boxes and moved them farther apart lamoia following him like a trained dog boldt said her name is heidi mack she was recommended by necrosearch out of denver boldt moved the two antennae a few feet apart and looked up mack lifted onto tiptoes to see over the computer gear and gave boldt another thumbsup shes cute lamoia said keep it on the job sergeant after several more sets boldt led lamoia over to the woman he was right of course lamoia could spot the goodlooking women from any distance in a heartbeat he could love them and leave them just about as quickly heidi mack had warm dark eyes a strong face and a runners body boldt found her eyes and mouth captivating to where he caught himself staring he averted his attention looking at the equipment instead on the computer screen he saw a color image that vaguely resembled a sonogram the stuff in jurassic park she said in a voice smooth and sensual the movie im talking about not the book it cant be done not yet anyway maybe one of these days in the meantime this is the best weve got she worked the computer mouse sharpening the image we call it forensic tomography ground penetrating radar is a geophysical method which is an outgrowth of technologies developed for the petroleum industry we can determine depth of ground disturbance but actual contents is way trickier and were lucky were up here on a hill because any salinesaturated soil wreaks havoc on gpr this program were using is in beta phase its all in the software okay sure its experimental but its also cutting edge whatd i tell you lamoia whispered to boldt nudging him boldt pointed to the screen this good eye detective yes my wife had sonograms with both children are you married lamoia asked her both mack and boldt looked over at him at the same time mack replied i have a girl six and a boy three why dont you call sid sergeant boldt ordered will we be digging he bluntly asked heidi mack lamoia stood his ground mack pointed to the screen where squiggles and loops of different colors were grouped in three distinct lumps they reminded boldt of sarahs crayon drawings back on his office wall weve got a good read a good look at all three grave sites you indicated her finger directed them to a rough yellow green at the bottom of the middle of the three this area is deeper and badly disturbed especially when compared to these other two it could possibly be explained by hand diggingshoveling rather than a backhoe you see how these other two are less busy the backhoe doesnt disturb the walls nearly as much as hand shoveling bones boldt asked necrosearch has been burying pigs for years pigs lamoia blurted out pigs she answered and working on imaging systems to identify bone mass theyre still a long way off from anything close to perfect about the best we can do is make educated guesses based on some of these trial experiments she waited for another lamoia exclamation but he withheld his comments she continued typically bodies are buried about two feet down and thats the depth of the experiments this is much trickiersix to eight feet in depth but these shadings here and these returns here she said fingertip to the screen are your best bets the coffin registers here this sharp straight line and these unexplained returns are most certainly below that line theyre not rock sticks maybe bone maybe am i picking up reservations boldt asked lamoia fired off you dont need reservations to book this room the joke fell flat heidi mack answered boldt yes i suppose you are definite reservations my problem is this ive seen dozens maybe hundreds of gpr returns on all sorts of experimental burials you learn to spot the anomalies again she indicated the screen the problem here the problem youve got weve got way too many returns and theyre layered you see this one two maybe three different strata three boldt whispered what the hells going on lamoia blurted out boldt turned to him and said ms mack if im right heidi mack explained to lamoia you dont have one you have three other bodies buried down there we have indications the tissue has been frozen doc dixon called up from the bottom of the open grave am saturday morning day twelve another bank of halogens to combat the multiple shadows so deep heidi mack had stuck around at boldts invitationevery piece of data collected would be added to the necrosearch database in denver moderate decomposition when was this grave dug five weeks ago lamoia answered that fits the bottom of their feet boldt asked what feet theres little to nothing left dixon replied sid will have to sift this soil for debris youre hoping for fish scales be nice to find boldt admitted fish scales mack asked you didnt hear that boldt told her having warned her that some of what they would discover would be offlimits for a while she nodded can we have someone dig at this end mack said pointing on her screen to the area that lay away from the headstone into that dirt wall there whats up boldt asked her another anomaly id like to verify for the sake of the software could be anything dixie you mind working a shovel for a minute its not in the job description the medical examiner complained from the bottom of the hole boldt handed him down a shovel where dixon asked mack returned to her equipment walked over to the open hole and pointed out an area in the very corner it should only be a few inches lower than the grade where youre standing a foot at most dixon planted the shovel into the mud and began digging he stuck something on his second attempt youre good he called up to mack his gloved hand reaching down and extricating the treasure its a rope he called out check that he said studying it more closely its a chain he knocked off some of the dirt and held it up for all to see but boldt didnt need to look hed seen it already in the digital videotapea chain used to bind an ankle to a sewing machine might have been attached to the bottommost victim dixon hollered up fighting the roar of the generator know what i think what boldt called down excitement pulsing through him with the find the three bodies were most certainly linked to both jane doe and the importation of illegals coughlie would have to be notified sid were already on their way i think we were wrong before wrong boldt shouted back down dixon looked up still holding the chain id say we have a new candidate for our first victim saturday august days missing chapter ms mcneal a womans trembling voice inquired stevie recognized that voice immediately ms klein i saw you on tv the reward and all klein sounded nervous stevie took that to be in her favor i didnt have anything to do with a woman going missing i want you to know that but what i was wondering about that reward if i could help you out where would that leave me in terms of that reward if you klein interrupted youre gonna get me killed you understand those people would kill me in a heartbeat she added so we gotta work this out you and me ive tried to work this out i know i know my husband says im gonna bring a world of hurt down on this family and my familys everything to me absolutely everything and if theres ten thousand dollars in it for me then maybe im better off talking to you on account im already involved with these people and all and theyve got me scared half to death stevie felt as if shed swallowed a bubble of air or eaten ice cream too fast she spoke a little too quickly for the professional she was trying to be my sources are protected by the first amendment better you talk to me than call the police we can work this out i think we should talk ms klein why dont you start at the beginning and tell me everything you know im standing at a pay phone in a mobile home park you want to talk you gotta come to me on account i dont want to be seen in my car who is it youre afraid of give me a name ms gwen i need something anything in order to know youre telling the truth you understand you could be setting a trap she was thinking forget it im not doing this over the phone then where stevie asked tell me where you are klein described a mobile home park east of avondale she would be waiting just before cradling the receiver stevie heard a click on the line at the time she thought it was nothing more than klein hanging up one of the sports teams had played the traffic was bumpertobumper at a complete standstill stevie took the floating bridge to bellevue a fifteenminute drive that took fortyfive she drove north toward redmond home of the microsoft campus still caught in traffic well over an hour since klein had called residential communities had popped up everywhere in an area once predominantly secondgrowth forest condominiums coops singlefamily homesculdesac neighborhoods where dinner conversations centered around bandwidth and port speed she drove through the surviving forest on avondale road twilight glimpses of bear creek to her right consternation mounting as she became suspicious of the constant stream of headlights behind her an hour and a half any of these cars might have been following her she pushed against her own paranoia and stuck to the job at hand the key witness in the case had just agreed to talk an hour fortyfive with less than a mile to go stevie turned right and finally lost all the headlights blood drumming in her ears from excitement she licked her lips and spoke a few words to clear her throat she rechecked her note to be sure she wanted number seven where lights burned she climbed out conflicting television shows battled their laugh tracks across the asphalt past the propane tanks and the mildewed laundry lines a telephone rang down a ways and a womans voice cried out ill get it the aluminum screen door on number seven had been hung incorrectly it was pocked and blackened with corrosion she banged on the frame and called out hello the trailers redwood steps were slick and treacherous the air smelled loamy wet and dark with rot this was a place that did not know sunlight she caught a whiff of propane gas coming from the trailer itself she pressed her nose closer and confirmed this the blinds were pulled but the smell leaked from the slatted windows as well her heart lodged in her throat still on tiptoe she leaned heavily to her right and pushed her eye to a crack between the interior blinds two legs a woman sitting perhaps she knocked again checked back those legs had not moved the surge of adrenaline seemed to start in her toes and race up toward her face which became hot with panic she tested the door locked pounded on the door in frustration she jumped off the steps and hurried around the trailer leaping to steal looks inside on the far side of the trailer another smaller door also locked she pushed against the door creating a gap between the cheap molding and the door itself she used a credit card to open the latch the door swung into the trailer unleashing a sickening stink of propane her stomach wretched as she leaned away and gulped for fresh air hurry she pleaded with herself she charged inside aware that the slightest spark would ignite the gas the quarters were small and cramped her eyes stung her lungs ached klein sat in a chair head slumped eyes shut her swollen tongue a blackviolet rage stevie wretched bile coughed and staggered her head swooned she took hold of the womans body and pulled her violently from the chair the body thumped onto the floor she weighed several tons stevie shoved the woman out the door got caught up with her and somersaulted down the steps buried under the dead weight stevie grunted heaved and thrust the corpse off her that bloated tongue aimed at her cheek as if asking for a kiss stevie vomited again frantically extracting herself from the mud the cold the ooze she struggled for her cellphone and dialed chapter lamoia found it difficult to fit his tall frame into the front seat of her i all that money and so little room the car was running its heater going the windows fogged lamoia opened his window a crack you stuck around he said we appreciate that i ive never touched one before you know all my reporting you just look you never touch them you said she had something to tell you she said she had something to tell me stevie corrected she was claiming the reward trying to yes you told her youd protect her as a source he guessed of course who else did you tell about it no one an editor a cameraman no one coincidental timing he asked boldt wont like that no i wont boldt said he carried a hot tea handed them each a coffee apologizing if it wasnt still hot but it was after a few needed sips lamoia switched places with his lieutenant boldt rolled up the window and lamoia headed back to the crime scene she panicked and killed herself boldt said you believe that no she knew theyd get her said as much if i hadnt gotten stuck in traffic if id come right here instead who else did you tell no one she paused and blurted out you dont believe me her lips found the edge of the styrofoam cup doesnt matter it does to me it isnt relevant he said it is to me youve been sharing information with agent coughlie he answered her dumbfounded expression we hear things i didnt share this you sure you suspect coughlie she blurted out i didnt say that you didnt have to when theres a lot of money at stake we suspect everyone the ins my god coast guard our own people the list is pretty long im afraid youre wrong about coughlie she warned i didnt say anything about coughlie its just that his attorneysthe federal prosecutors officetried to get hold of that video today and since id heard youd seen him i thought maybe well you thought wrong how can i help if i dont know whats going on boldt asked you stole that tape from me i made a bad decision boldt said lets say id be willing to reverse that decision in return for a look at the videos you took from her apartment he cautioned and dont tell me you didnt being a reporter doesnt allow you to lie to a cop im cold she complained knowing when to cut bait well get you home he offered our officers will see you home she said so if it wasnt coincidence someone knew i was coming here is that so impossible do you use a walkaround phone by any chance not at the office she called me at the office cellphone it was my office phone no one in the room no other calls cancel a dinner something like that nothing so maybe it was coincidence boldt said he added but it wasnt suicide wasnt even a good try at it he informed her broken blood vessels in the eyesmanual strangulation we think he may have raped her if he did it was postmortem she sat paralyzed behind the wheel youre trying to scare me into cooperating not at all im just reporting funny isnt it im reporting youre here investigating its not funny at all we can protect witnesses he said theyre not coming after me lieutenant i got here too late but she contacted you boldt reminded they may know that how often do they sweep the station for surveillance devices thats ridiculous im willing to trade tapes ms mcneal boldt repeated hand on the door handle offer stands the offer of protection stands as well someone to drive me home would be nice ill take you up on that well thats a start he said you think about the rest chapter stevie arrived at her apartment exhausted and afraid melissa had gone missing klein had been found dead and the link between them was obvious and worse a link that stevie herself had pursued despite warnings she locked her apartments front door behind her and armed the security system she drank armagnac from a snifter the bottle clutched under an arm as she first locked and checked her bedroom door then the door to the bathroom suite before finally running bath water and undressing the drink did nothing to quell the image of kleins body slumped in the chair she could still feel the woman atop her in the mud lukewarm and stiff her own sense of helplessness trapped beneath itnot a person not any longer she had known this woman she had spoken to her it was no longer an image but something warm and visceral she stayed in the tub for a long long time running the warm water continuously and allowing it to spill out the overflow drain she scrubbed and soaked but never felt clean the alcohol as warm inside her as the water on her skin she refilled the snifter with slippery fingers hoping to purge her demons but each time she closed her eyes she felt klein on top of her she caught herself wishing that she lived with somebody wishing for a roommate or lover or husband some companion to pamper or comfort her her aloneness caught up to her and caused an ache that nothing could reach nothing could numb at last she dragged herself out and toweled off surrounding herself in a sumptuous terrycloth robe wondering why she allowed herself to feel so vulnerable and threatened she let herself out of her sanctuary to where she had a commanding view of the sound and the citys night skyline she could tell it was the weekend by the number of small boats out there she longed to be tired but this was not a night for granted wishes she thought of all that shipping traffic coming and going of all the thousands of containers en route from one place to another the body bags hauled out of the recovered container the families of the victims the chain of events begun by that discovery she wanted them all back she didnt give a damn about the power or impact of the story she wanted melissa safe and warm and sharing this view she ached for her return she cried about it cried hard finishing up the contents of the snifter and looking around for the bottle that she had left by the tub she heard voices and wondered if they were in her head or far below on the street she cried some more feeling chilled she checked to see if shed left any windows open walking around the darkened apartment in a state of shock and remorse the night air that blew off the sound was her favorite part of the apartment though on this night she sought warmth she found nothing open except the front of the robe she tied the robe shut checked the lock on the balconysomething she never bothered to do being she was the penthouseand headed to bed she saw a shadow out there and jumped only to realize it was one of her tropical plants in the sea breeze the walk back to the bedroom seemed to take too long and included a stop at the front door just to make sure she wished she had something more than a keyed entry dead bolt or not but the building regulations specifically prohibited any such extravagance the buildings oldtimers claimed this resulted from a lawsuit brought by the family of a man who had died of a heart attack though he had called he had left his apartment door chained from the inside delaying the response time of the emergency service the hallway to the master bedroom stretched impossibly long past a coat closet a linen closet a guest suite and a half bath never before had it seemed so far away she locked her bedroom door slipped out of the robe and into a pair of cotton pajamas the pajamas held their own significance for hershe usually slept with no clothes on she refilled the snifter and took it to bed with her knowing she must be drunk or close to it but not feeling anything this she also took as a signal because armagnac typically flattened her afraid to make the room dark she watched tv surfing from one channel to the next in what turned out to be an endless parade of commercials in the black screen pulses and pauses between her switching channels she saw only kleins discolored face and swollen tongue she saw death time seemed to be both moving slowly and running out at the same time she caught her heart racing and thought maybe the booze was having some effect she drank some more and decided it was not the phone became her enemy for it teased her taunted her anyone she called would respondshe felt certain of itfrom friends who lived nearby to half the seattle police force but she wouldnt pick it up she wouldnt admit to her own fear much less speak it to another she could imagine the resulting laughter behind her back the jokes that would circulate in the industry there was no way she was going to subject herself to that boldt had given her his cardshe could invent something she had remembered from kleins she could drag him into a hopelessly long visit until his presence convinced her she was safe or the booze finally wore her down as it happened she simply fell asleep the television remote cupped in her hand one of the independent stations airing a colorized film she slept half sitting up her neck bent awkwardly her head arched as if falling she slept with the snifter half empty and her mind half full the bedside light ablaze the televisions volume mutedfor a string of ads during which she had passed outa cotton blanket pulled up to her waist the bedside clock counting the passing minutes she slept half in half out of consciousness a deadly combination of visions of klein and an alcoholinduced coma the dreams vivid and dangerous leaving her only partially asleep and very much in the grips of an endless nightmare held down by the wine she awoke to the vague but distinctive rumble of the buildings elevator believing it at first to be the growl of a ships horn and wondering why either would awaken her the clock a small light indicating am she shook her head gently awake her penthouse was on a controlled floor the elevator required an electronic key to access the floor and only she and the buildings doorman or night watchman had access not even maintenance but why would edwardo the night watchman come up unannounced at this hour it seemed inconceivable to her unexplainable the digital display switched to and to her it was as if someone had winked at her slowly her mind came into focus the sounds sharpening it was just plain wrong the wrong hour the wrong flooreverything wrong her ears pricked suddenly able to hear everything the ventilation the city hum her own breathing her heart pounding in her chest she found herself out of bed and moving wraithlike across the floor a specter of fluid pajama and flailing limb dimly lit by ambient light that slipped in through shuttered blinds her fingers deftly turned and unlocked the dead bolt to the bedroom door no thought to the added security this extra door provided if that corridor had seemed long before it seemed twice as long now extending from her toward the front of the apartment like a tunnel her bare feet captured the raised nap of the carpet she remembered fighting the decorator over this carpetthe station didnt want to go the extra nine dollars a yard but the decorators job was to please her she scoffed at such notionsselfserving importance the struggle for absolute control what did any of it matterthe quality of the carpet includedas she hurried down the hallway fearing for her safety other thoughts entered her head the telephone which was now an equal distance from her in either direction the handgun which resided in the drawer of her bedside table but which she had left the room without her father melissa gwen kleins swollen tongue a parade of thoughts and images that came down main street and walked right over her trampled her stealing her from her singleminded intention to determine what the hell was going on out in the hall and then she was the yoyo at the bottom of the string stuck between climbing back up that tether or lying down and giving inin her case giving upfor the next thing she heard was a key attempting to open her lock the sound paralyzed her froze her claimed her at first because it was so utterly impossible a notion than anyone should try to break into her apartment and then only fractions of a second later from the realization and understanding that that was exactly what was going on mixed into her confusion images of that swollen tongue flashed before her eyes and she knew beyond a doubt what fate lay in store for her rape strangulation the ovens gas turned on high it was the wrong story to pursue a story that consumed anyone and everyone involved she felt like shouting okay i quit as if she could stop the momentum that had brought this visitor to her door but he wasnt a decision maker only the messenger what drove her feet toward that door she did not know only that she found herself immediately on the other side of this persons efforts separated by a twoinchthick slab of wood she dragged over a straightbackedchair and wedged it under the doorknob as shed seen done in films it seemed so pathetically fragile cocked at an angle like that her eyes found the small security monitor a fiveinch tv screen that alternated shots between the entrance lobby the inside of the elevator and the hallway outside her door the lobby appeared empty at two in the morning edwardo should have been at the desk the only possible excuse a cigarette or bathroom break or was it him on the other side of the door did she dare call out was this some kind of a mixup did he believe she was in trouble was he coming to help had she pressed the wrong button in setting the security device edwardo possessed the only other key to her elevator it made sense in the way any reasonable explanation satisfies panic for that instant she felt reliefa mixup was all the tension that held her nearly paralyzed subsided she could move again the next image that appeared on the small security monitor was of the empty elevator this made sense as well edwardo had ridden the elevator up to her floor the scratching sound continued on the other side of the door at which point her theory went all to hell edwardo knew which key to use the next video image showed the back of a man standing at her door the man was big he wore a hooded sweatshirt it was not edwardo the lock opened the alarm sounded and the chair buckled stevie ran down the hallway it stretched away from her growing longer with each stride the station had run a piece on home security alarms stevie knew much more than she wanted to know about them average police response time was twenty to thirty minutes first the alarm signaled the security company of a breach then the security company telephoned the resident to check if it was a false alarm or to verify its authenticity then the company dispatched its own security officers to the scene and if needed it was only then the police were summoned in her case because of the stalking any breach was to be treated as a home invasionthe police were to be called immediately this change reportedly would cut at least ten minutes off the response time but that would hardly help her the alarm was meant as a deterrent something to send a lowlife burglar running it would do nothing to discourage a determined rapist or killer the hallway stretched on the chair creaked and made popping sounds as its joints gave way her feet would not carry her fast enough the door at the end of the hall seemed to grow no bigger to draw no closeran unkind illusion born of panic when the chair broke and splintered it sounded like gunshots she did not look back did not waste a single movement until she made it through that door and turned to slam it and to lock it she looked back he was a big sonofabitch the sweatshirt hood obscuring his face he ran like a water buffalo head down and charging she bumped the door shut and pushed the button locking it as he hit the door running the entire frame jamb and all popped out of the wall as the plasterboard cracked giving way stevie dove for the bedside phone trying for the gun in the drawer at the same time she attempted to dial the phone was dead she squeezed off a round it went through the ceiling above the door another it shot out her tv screen eight feet from the door where she thought she had aimed she heard another shotthis one from the far side of the door and threw her gun down instinctively tossing it away as if it did not belong to her she looked at it then and wondering what the hell she was doing fell to her knees and lunged for it from the other side of the door came sounds of a fight stevie huddled by the door one hand on the weapon the other preparing to unlock the bedroom door driven by an innate curiosity and an instinct that she was needed when she heard one of the plateglass windows break she turned the doorknob someone was out there defending her the button popped out the sounds of breaking furniture and the dull wet slap of flesh grew louder and more easily distinguished the alarm deafening she hurried down the hallway the gun extended the big man with the hood crawled across the carpet in an attempt to reach the apartments open door blood ran from his nose and marked his progress along the carpet another man tall and lean struggled across the carpet and delivered what was left of her sixthousanddollar hondel lamp over the back of the first mans head the victim erupted turning and kicking this other man in the face throwing him off to the side and stealing the lamp himself but his target rolled and kicked sharply catching the man in the shoulder she saw the blue glint of steela gun on the kitchen floorand this inspired her to aim her own gun overhead and pull the trigger the blast shot a hole through the ceiling and rained down grains of sheetrock briefly winning the attention of the two in that millisecond the hooded man lunged for the other caught him by the jacket stood and put him between stevie and himself then he spun the man threw him across the living room and ran for the apartment doorall before stevie understood any of what was happening the thrown man struck yet another plateglass window and it shattered the sound deafening he staggered and collapsed into the debris out on the balcony the intruder fled out the door so fast as to be only a blur of size and color stevie stood there the gun gripped in both hands trembling bonenumbing cold she took two steps to her right aimed at the alarms ceiling siren from just a few feet below and shot it out silencing the room not knowing herself in the resulting stillness she heard the fire door at the end of the hallway thump shut the heavy winded breathing of the stranger who had gone out the plateglass window the panic of blood pounding in her ears not a single siren anywhere to be heard who are you she asked keeping the gun in front of her defensively stepping forward but stopping short of the broken glass ill shoot she warned youll miss he groaned the man raised his head it was john lamoia chapter on the flickering screen two naked women without tan lines showed acute dexterity with their tongues brian coughlie watched them go at each other for the better part of a minute it wasnt lovemaking it wasnt even sex it was a series of savage desperate acts meant to justify the tendollar ticket he felt sick to his stomach his mouth was dry and tasteless clearly these girls had not even reached age twenty they were korean and not eating well their lives were over theyd be statistics in a year or two rodriguez held the paper cup of soda and ice to his right eye he was a cop you dont know that he got there way too fast he wasnt a cop a friend of hers maybe coughlie had grown to hate even these brief encounters with rodriguez having busted him for illegal entry he had later found out the man was wanted by mexican authorities for a variety of crimes including assault and murder they had struck an uncomfortable alliance that had grown increasingly worse the man was obviously into some hard drugs and coughlie had watched him degenerate it was only a matter of time until something would have to be done what where and by whom coughlie wasnt sure for a long time coughlie had been the one with all the leverage threatened deportation or incarceration for the crimes committed but now if anything the roles were reversed rodriguez had been part of it nearly from the start he knew too much guy can take a punch i tell you what he complained youll live we got to handle her no she trouble dis lady i said no scare was all get the tapes and as badly as you handled it id say you accomplished at least that much he was a cop im tell you rodriguez pointed to the screen watch dis you see dat can you believe dey show dat damn forget her you got it shes handled you think she saw klein count on it she got plenty of nerve that one too bad i didnt get to enough he didnt want any association with rodriguez whenever he met with him their conversations deteriorated into monosyllabic thug speak coughlie reminded himself he needed to keep his distance forget her he repeated you give the word everyone forget her nothing on your own coughlie reminded beginning to warm under the collar both out of anger and because his eye kept straying to the screen no more like that forklift that was stupid we stay on track for the next delivery no choice or ill be the one having an unexplained accident got it weve got a break after this next one i can use that time to get us through this nothing more from you unless it comes from me coughlie resorted to the one anesthetic he knew would work at least temporarily he slipped the man a twohundreddollar bonus for the attack at the apartment he knew rodriguez would use it to selfmedicate if coughlie was lucky it would get him through the weekend chapter i dont remember all that much it happened so quickly stevie mcneal wore a tshirt over her pajamas the tshirt promoted a fivemile run to benefit cancer with kstv as a sponsor teams of police had been inside her apartment for nearly two hours the sunday morning sun was trying to steal the night from the sky the apartment still smelled of weapons fire detective bobbie gaynes looking as tired as the rest nodded sympathetically lamoia cupping a disposable blue ice pack to the side of his face directed traffic in the living room where sid shot photographs and dusted for prints she thought that the police were worse than the press when it came to turning a place into a zoo lou boldt sat in a chair facing the news anchor he looked older when youre dressed boldt informed her well move you to a hotel detective gaynes will stay in your room with you if thats okay well post a uniform in the hall outside a room next door a room that will be empty what about edwardo she asked to blank expressions the night watchman emergency room concussion boldt answered well question him in the morning i didnt mean that stevie said they knew what they were doing gaynes explained clubbed him took his keys killed the buildings phone system removed the security video without you weve got nothing ive provided you as much detail as i can im sure you have boldt said patiently though he was clearly disappointed so it was professional she asked them both tentatively gaynes looked to boldt and then back to mcneal they he knew what to do knew the building your location the elevator pass were assuming it wasnt blind luck that got him up here and it certainly was not a random act was not stevie clarified needing to hear the words again theyd scouted the building boldt stated thats how it looks to us stevie knew she should say something but she couldnt think what she couldnt think hardly at all so they meant to we dont know what they had in mind boldt corrected intentionally interrupting and preventing the words from being spoken maybe he was superstitious about that klein we dont know that gaynes echoed her lieutenant boldt retreated to an earlier subject wed just as soon get you out of here ms mcneal when youre ready when youre up to it are you going to show me photos she asked maybe i can recognize the guy we can try thatlater today or monday morningif you like boldt said but it was clear he didnt believe shed make identification a hotel stevie muttered when youre up to it i hate this yes boldt agreed wed like to work with you he added reminding her of his earlier offer about the sergeant she said nodding toward the bedrooms open door how the hell did he respond so quickly we were lucky this time boldt answered that doesnt answer my question stevie said boldt remained impassive he wasnt going to answer the question was he following me she asked indignantly do you have me under surveillance boldt noticed the three gray boxes by her television set and was drawn to them he said are these the tapes those are private property who knew about these tapes we did yes but who else a producer an editor no one thinking aloud he stated weve been assuming whoever broke in here was coming after you but what if were mistaken or maybe it was supposed to be a twoforone look like a robbery gone bad a vcr some jewels these tapes youre killed or injured in the process stevie paled hesitated a long time looked directly at boldt and finally offered i mentioned the tapes to brian coughlie both the vhs and the digital i asked him for help with the digital tape you should have allowed me to view that tape when was this wednesday night the meeting you knew about dinner coughlie knew i had the vhs tapes up here the first ones she shot i as much as told him so she waited for some reaction from him you dont think i heard you he snapped the dull drone of city traffic filled the room barely audible competing with the gentle hush of the ventilation system a ships horn far in the distance followed by a police siren like a wounded cat these sounds were as much a part of this city as its weather she objected but it doesnt necessarily mean that coughlie no it doesnt boldt said interrupting her he looked around closed the bedroom door firmly and said okay now lets start all over monday august days missing chapter she signed off the same way each day this is stevie mcneal for william cutler and all of the news four at five team have a good evening thanks for joining us stay safe by the end of any broadcast studio as initial chill was tempered by the heat thrown from the dozens of overhead lights and the staggering assemblage of sophisticated electronics the weather in the fake skyline behind the anchor desk never changed nor did the time of day suspending viewers in the rare seattle sunset that sustained thirty miles visibility the news repeated itself the ds death disease disaster on that day the lead story concerned kleins deathher questionable suicide as told by stevie mcneal who had witnessed the incident firsthand billybob cutler with his upright eagle scout look covered a scandal at the convention center concerning catering overcharges two weeks since shed seen melissa alive clear the floor director called out sharply were black in five four three were out thank you everyone two weeks in some ways it felt like yesterday it felt like years billybob jumped up from his chair like a quarterback breaking from the huddle he removed his audio gear and headed straight for the exitfor a beer with his publicpats on the back on his way out stevie could have removed her mike herself but in no hurry to go anywhere she waited for the soundman two weeks where why she hadnt left the studio all day in part out of a concern for security in part because of the endless meetings managementhoping to protect their investment no doubtwanted two bodyguards assigned stevie wanted her independence arguing that the breakin had been coincidental and was unrelated to kleins death and the events surrounding her investigation arguments that fell on deaf ears a compromise was struck because she had already moved to the four seasons under a different name hotel security would be provided the police had called off the hallway guard the station would beef up its security something already built into the business plan so that while she was inside kstv she and everyone in the facility would be well protected she was free to come and go of her own choosingthey encouraged use of the town caras long as she notified security of her movements she would carry a small gps transmitter in her purse to identify her location at all times in the unlikely event anything should happen to her they would at the very least have a way to track her down these negotiations complete the broadcast over an entire day exhausted she briefly settled into her office intent to be out of there as quickly as possible and to a much needed sleep she reviewed email and phone messages her world crumbling she looked around and wondered how long all this could last how long her thirtysevenyearold face would hold how long her public and the station would want her it was a vicious business careers were canceled with overnight ratings another new face was always waiting and whereas men would work broadcasts well into their fifties and sixties women rarely stayed in front of the camera past forty when she caught sight of brian coughlie in the control room talking to corwin her heart fluttered and her first childish instinct was to hide so that he couldnt find her next terror struck her following her questioning by boldt she suspected coughlies involvement either with the importation of illegals or even possibly the deaths and melissas disappearance it had not occurred to her that with his credentials he could gain access to the station without question she didnt want him here she wanted nothing to do with him a moment later he stepped into her office coughlie arrived at the unscheduled meeting with mcneal hoping either to scare her into seclusion and force her to withdraw from her story or to convince her to share the vhs videotapes that melissa had shot from the van her disappearance or murder would bring the national media spotlight onto the case and he couldnt bear up under that kind of scrutiny he would be discovered he hoped at the very least to reinforce his authority and stay on top of her and of what she knew as directed he sat down onto a colorful chintz couch while she lightly sponged off her cosmetics in a brightly lit mirror i heard about the breakin he said i dont appreciate unannounced visitors at my apartment or here at the station im not here as a visitor im here as a federal agent he announced im here to warn you who youre playing with to warn me first klein then my own apartment and youre going to warn me she asked incredulously offering the reward was a mistake maybe you meant to punish the police by flooding them with callsyou were upset over this digital tape but instead you put yourself at the center of it the gloves are off i hear the first officer on the scene was lamoia he said restructuring his line of attack let me ask you this how does a sergeant end up the first cop on the scene at that hour of the night meaning he should have been home in bed or downtown writing up paperwork on klein the police have you under surveillance what else explains a sergeant being the first officer she processed all this and felt a sickening twist to her stomach but she recovered quickly and maintained the offensive she lied convincingly of course they did following klein i requested twentyfourhour protection in a minute youre going to tell me that youve been following me as welland tapping my phones and bugging my apartment he tried to remain calm through this but she took his blinking eyes as an indication of strained nerves its all one big conspiracy right the chinese mob or whoevers behind this has paid off everyone in law enforcement and only the press is in the way of all this quietly disappearing from the public conscience is that about right you shouldnt joke about such things he cautioned these people play tough firsthand knowledge absolutely not handson knowledge i hope youre still joking are you aware of the size of the rock youre attempting to roll over ill roll over any rock that i think is on top of melissa its too bad you dont work for these people because if you did id tell you to pass along to them to simply return melissa give her back to me she shows up alive on my doorstep and this story will tank so fast you wouldnt believe it it seemed to her like a valid bargaining chip one that he might even mistakenly believe did they tell you about the raid on the chop shop he asked she stumbled of course she lied again working too long on her face her voice broke as she asked does that mean what i think it means on the surface it means her van was stolen and recovered thats all in this city that would normally not constitute any kind of event but given the rest of what we know it holds all sorts of significance i led that raid the arrests were oursfederal chinese gang members every last one connected to the illegals not that well ever prove but why did a gangrun chop shop have your friends van any guesses she couldnt catch her breath she tried brushing the spray out of her hair to cover her moment of paralysis two weeks we wont get squat out of any of themguaranteed in their world you rat you die inside or out it doesnt matter rules are rules she swiveled in her chair and faced him suggestions we need to join forces he suggested not answering her spd cant help you with an illegals investigation have you figured that out yet this chop shop that was ours they couldnt get a warrant fast enough thats my point we can move way faster than they can we can and do take all sorts of liberties they cant you want to tap a pay phone thats us take them weeks to get a warrant like that you want to raid a sweatshop where do you think theyll turn right here he said weve got the probable cause and they dont night and day im telling you you know what i think he asked not allowing her a reply i think you and me should go into business together we start with these videotapes and we work backward i know that you probably think youve already done that but we do this for a living you want your friend back we start there thats where we start now she was without her usual stage makeup and she felt that she looked much older her grim expression wedded with her exhaustion and grief to paint a picture of pain and impatience she tore off the paper bib that protected her dress and crunched it into a ball that she held on to so that her fist was tight and bloodless he announced i think you should turn the vhs tapes over to me and take a vacation ill push to gain access to the digital tapes as well you leave town for a while long enough for us to make it safe for you around here this she decided was an intentional emphasis he was threatening her he too had taken the gloves off and if i stay after what youve been through he asked who can protect someone that well you dont know these people like i do these gang members are worthless excuses for human beings ask boldt lamoia theyll tell you the same thing one mistake a bullet through the back of the head pop he clapped his hands loudly jangling her nerves thats all no explanation no remorse you want to challenge those kind of people comes with the turf you challenge them on a daily basis right you look healthy to me she met eyes with him and would not let him go hows that work they smoke a federal agent and theyll never sleep a reporter your friend melissa knows how they feel about reporters so why not use me as bait she suggested it isnt done youre a civilian we dont put civilians at risk not ever do you think shes dead she asked bluntly if it was you running things for instance would you have killed her by now what would you do with her me he blurted out hypothetically she acknowledged unflinchingly he stared back at her trying to read in her face what she knew she said if anything has kept her alive its that they havent found the second digital tape without it firmly in hand theyd be stupid to kill her shes the only one who knows where it is if theres anything they want from her theyll simply torture her and get it he said flatly these people do not play fairly not taking her eyes off him but they dont know her do they dont they her parents were great heroes in china they survived seven months of torture by the mao regime seven months of it theyre legends melissas family honor is at stake do you understand to the chinese family honor is everything she wont talk and then theyll have to make a decision kill her and risk never finding that tape or wait her out what do you think i know all about the chinese and their families he said a little too defensively so if she doesnt talk stevie asked you should take a vacation a leave of absence the only thing they would want from you is silence id think about that if i were you coughlie dragged himself forward to the edge of the couch if you stay youre making a mistake he warned if they let her go then thats the end of it she repeated you need to tell them not me he said you have sources she pressed connections you said so you told me you did he stood and paused at the door it doesnt work like that he told her she spun back around to catch his reflection in the mirror help me she pleaded ill keep my word on this if that breakin taught you anything it should have been that its too late to negotiate just ask klein he paused there at the door you take care of yourself he advised turning his back on her and walking away when the receptionist rang almost immediately stevie was convinced that coughlie wanted another chance at her the announcement that boldt was in the lobby surprised her she asked that he be shown back to the set because she wanted to meet him on her turf for a change a minute later her head still spinning he entered the enormous studio taking in every detail as if a student did you cross paths with him stevie asked boldt who boldt asked brian coughlie he came to tell me i should leave town did he boldt pondered this not the worst advice we can hardly arrest him for that i offered my silence for melissas safe return she kept boldt standing because she didnt want him to stay long they talked between two of the large robotic cameras facing the backdrop of the seattle sunrise that needed a few thousand watts to look realistic he said when a victim lives through what you went through we call her a material witness is melissa dead lieutenant the only question that mattered the one that haunted her we need to work together to trust each other you need it for the sake of your safety i need it if were to find melissa i have reason to believe that they may not have found her yet but you found her van she said flatly surprising him with her knowledge why the hell didnt i hear about that coughlie he asked wondering about her source she fumed i should have been told boldt shook his head not without ground rules laid hes playing us against each other you see that i need to know everything you two have shared we could be way off base with him she studied him i can go along with that she added so what is it you want from me lieutenant why the visit he met eyes with her police pressure isnt always the most effective the press has powers that we dont you see you hate us until you need us are you so different he asked you ask around about lou boldt she said and you get back this guy larger than life as a reporter you dont trust those myths those guys dont exist anymore they lived in another era white walls and wide lapels and if you ask around about stevie mcneal he said you hear that shes much more than a pretty face that shes one of the few anchors in this town whos capable of reporting a story not just reading into a camera what is it i have to do she asked you have to use that anchor chair to force someones hand she debated this long and hard she looked at him curiously cocking her head as if getting a better view ill do whatever it takes boldt reached into his pocket and pulled out the digital tape confiscated in the sting lets get to work he said chapter this is out of order boldt pointed to the screen they had reviewed all the tapes together they were taking their second look at the digital tape mcneals expression was grave her reaction time delayed like a person working off a translator from his experience when his own sarah had been abducted boldt knew this horror firsthand the hollow resonance of peoples voices as they spoke to you the way the clock hand refused to creep forward the insomnia i beg your pardon stevie said finally responding to him youre the reporter heredont get me wrong but the outside of the bus on the vhs looks dirty to me like it has been raining whereas the bus on the digital tape the one she boards is clean we get just a glimpse of it but its not the same bus believe me and if thats right then there may be as much as a day or two between the vhs and this digital tape being shot if thats true as thorough as she is in her reporting then maybe theres another tape maybe theres one still missing and if there is who knows whats on it maybe thats the tape that establishes the location of the sweatshopor even the people responsible she studied the two screensone showing the back of the dirty bus as it descended into the bus tunnel the other the opening shot on the digital tape she said i told brian coughlie there was a tape missing but at the time i was just making it uptrying to buy melissa some time i just assumed the remaining tape i gave her was blank but youre right about the dirt so she may have shot yet another tape its possible her voice was fragile and did not carry she may have simply had nothing to shoot for a day it happens you know surveillance work he proposed lets assume that when the camera was confiscated it contained the second of the two digital tapes not the first lets say the first had already been shot and put aside and whoever got the camera only got the second tape she said hoarsely so maybe there is a second tape we have to explain that camera showing up if whoevers behind this found it would they hock it not likely destroy it yes but hock it we have rileys statementthe man you met at the water shower fountainthat it was a gang kid who brought the camera to him in the first place so maybe this kid simply found the camera or stole it or maybe she hid it that would make it a random discovery he doesnt tell anyone about ithe simply hocks it to cash in on his discovery but conversely maybe she used it to buy this kids silence or to help her to escape and if that was all she had to trade what happens next time they come looking or maybe someone in the sweatshopone of the leaderstook it traded it used it it doesnt mean theyve found her he reminded i aired her photo stevie whispered theyve identified her we cant confirm that thepapersran it the other stations youd have to live in a vacuum to have missed that photo equally softly she said i screwed this up she added all because you bastards were moving too slowly hed been waiting for that blame followed on angers coattails boldt allowed a moment for the air to clear and held to the high ground well pull a picture of the car wash and distribute it to every radio car on patrol someone will recognize it you you have two assignments one is to go back over this digital tape and translate i dont mean the spoken languagewhat the women are sayingweve already had that done she gets their histories the conditions aboard ship i speak mandarin she reminded weve seen the tape twice what i needwe needis to be inside melissas head her thoughts emotions why is it she dwells so much on the ships conditions when were assuming all they saw was the inside of that container she mentions the ship over and over we need all that subtext the second i need you to craft a smear piece i need you make someone look pretty damn bad i dont know how i can get by putting something on the air thats pure fantasy he hesitated needing her and said nothing libelous but bad enough that shell squirm he asked how long does something like that take she considered all this her face a mixture of curiosity and concern she answered reluctantly anywhere from a couple of hours to a couple of days depends on who the subject is what kind of existing footage we have it doesnt have to be long just powerful youre sounding more like a producer than a cop she tried to smile but her face only found a grimace you know a woman called mama lu boldt asked she arched her back opened her eyes and said sarcastically the crime lord you really do want me killed former crime lord he corrected more of a politician these days shes the one she has the answers shes behind the disappearance stevie asked shes who coughlies protecting we dont know anything for certain my gut says mama lu has the answers some of the answers all of the answers i dont know but ill never get any of them without some way to open her up shes getting older she wants acceptance in the community thats her pressure point let me check the clip files stevie said committing to helping him how soon do you need it tuesday september days missing chapter mama lus empire included the largest asian food distributorship in king county and partial ownership in asian restaurants in the city one of which was the unmarked noodle shop where boldt found her engaged with a bowl of brown broth shrimp green onion and ginger the smell of which encouraged him to accept her offer of a bowl for himself though he made it clear he was required to pay for this out of pocket a condition she tolerated dressed in a blue cavalcade of cotton her flesh inflated from joint to joint wrist to elbow so that if he reached out and touched her the skin would feel taut and ready to burst when she smiled her eyes fell into shadow elongating to thin black slivers like chips of coal in the face of a snowman her lips too grew long and thin stretched like a rubber band across her false teeth the soup was delicious how is your wifes health mr both boldt considered the number of times hed been asked this question over the past eighteen months and the hundreds of variations and forms it took from sympathetic expressions to probing curiosity but from the mouth of this woman the inquiry sent a chill through him do the chinese have any sayings about coincidence boldt asked attempting to change the subject i not confucius mr both humble businesswoman you no want talk of wife how about the children its not a social visit im afraid he answered his skin prickling he would not put his family at risk he had been through that had learned the hard way but he thought back to her daycare center and his children as something they had in common my children are the light of my life there is so much wonder through their eyes so much is new i learn something from them every day children are windows to past and future much to learn and your children he asked the ones i met yes she said sipping grotesquely from the chinese spoon and spreading her smile onto the table they ate in silence then for boldt could not salvage any more common ground between them they ate like lovers talking only with their eyes by the end of the brief meal boldt felt oddly confident she pushed the bowl aside with her forearm dabbed her large mouth with a paper napkin and burped softly good enough to savor twice she said boldt finished and placed his bowl aside as well perceiving correctly that so placed the bowls could no longer capture the words spoken between them and thus business could now be discussed she supported this notion with her inquiry now what accounts for your visit she asked collecting his thoughts he bowed his head wethe police that isinvestigate the ships captain and he drowns we inquire after the manager of the equipment rental and his forklift explodes we hear of a government worker selling counterfeit drivers licenses and she sucks oven gasall convenient coincidences to whoever is profiting from the transportation of illegals she said only trouble comes in threes it doesnt require a great leap of faith to suspect that someone with inside knowledge is remaining one step ahead of us change begins in our own house she said she touched her enormous chest inside ourselves we the police that is have shared each step of our investigation with immigration and naturalization her eyes became darker if that were possible and only them he continued you have shared much with me as well she offered testing to see where his suspicions lay the government does not pay its workers well he said one can easily imagine a dissatisfaction with the system an openness to the persuasion of corrupting influences he continued cautiously you great lady might have heard of such a government employee and whereas i would understand even respect your reluctance to mention any names i thought perhaps were i to speak the names you might be able to show some indication make some sign to me that might prevent me from wasting my time you overestimate me mr both i humble businesswoman a few investments here and there with the carrot failing he decided to try the stick a certain television station intends to run a series on power and influence within the international district and the asian community and its relationship to the flow of illegal immigrants into the city boldt pulled the vcr cassette from his coat pocket and set it on the table you may want to see some of the footage they intend to use arrests that didnt need to happen courtroom trials that ended in hung juries he met eyes with her and said its so unfair the way the press can air our dirty laundry trials that have long since been forgotten by most you have influence with this station she suggested calmly influence might be too strong a word they are as hard on the police as they are on the innocent businesswoman in their search for the guilty they stop at nothing the rules are so different for the police mama lu kept quiet mulling over what boldt had told her when she spoke she sounded happy as if not bothered by any of it do you take any pride in a knowledge of astrology mr both as ignorant as a babe he confessed do you pay any attention to the calendar professionally personally only in terms of pay days he smiled at this mountain whose features began to melt like wax too close to the fire you see the chinese pay particular attention to the calendar take the phases of the moon for instance important to crops the cycle of the woman the seas extremely important in warfare no the darkness of the new moon is every generals ally her emphasis was not missed on him he searched her eyes im listening she frowned not wanting to be so direct these people delivering the new citizens they consider themselves at war with the government no do not forget mr both the storm they call mary caused much delay at sea you said so yourself run out of food and water then boldt saw it the arrival of the visage had been targeted to coincide with a new moon when the resulting darkness would help hide the transfer between the crane and the barge it was at once both simple and convincing a time schedule the cop suggested optimistically there you have it she agreed opening her huge rubber hand as if offering its invisible contents the new moon i believe you find it upon us shortly she said she rummaged in a purse at her feet and withdrew a complex wheel of chinese characters numbers and windows she spun the various elements of the wheel to the desired setting and said thursday two days from now he glanced at his watch every passing minute carried weight just like that he asked surprised by her cooperation or was she intentionally misleading him anticipating his suspicions she said no want tv story true but more than that mr both a womans body is gods treasure its magic makes children bears milk delivers life to violate this to enter a woman unwanted is the most unforgivable sin in all gods creation i would rather be killed than succumb to this fate you tell me on last visit about violation of woman found buried ifind out what you tell me is true no food water even illness is regrettable but understandable conditions of any such a war this other violation unforgivable must stop he suggested two days is not much time ship sail from hong kong in time to reach seattle on new moon how many ship can there be she stared at him like a disapproving teacher police make much trouble about rental of crane she observed intriguing him your doing mr both if no crane rented what option left boldt digested her message the container will have to make shore you good listener boldt pulled out five dollars to leave for the soup she waved him off but he left it anyway she said i make exception watch television news tonight she shoved the video back toward him the past have no place in present keep the past where it belongs ill see what i can do boldt said he caught himself as he bowed slightly and as to that other matter you raised mr both she called out after him stopping him you have good instincts the chinese never trust anyone in government he hurried feeling crushed by time another shipment of illegals was due what that meant for melissa was anybodys guess chapter had boldt not requested stevie to repeatedly review melissas digital tape perhaps she would not have done so too upset at those darkened images of the sweatshop and the horrid conditions described in the closeup interviews but his suggestion that melissa might be not only alive but undiscovered by the enemy charged her with a renewed hope that sputtered and flickered inside her giving off light like a lamp with a bad wire she attempted to deal with her mood swings for the dryness in her throat and the stinging in her eyes she could not recall her last meal she found it impossible to sleep the hotel room offering her no feeling of safety despite the presence of hotel security nor did she understand why it was so difficult for her to remain focused she constantly caught herself stuck in some memory of melissa her vision clouded by it her senses stolen from her she had been robbed of her existence denied it she needed out of thisno longer simply for melissas sake but for her own if she failed she would fail completely would crumble unable to work unable to live she felt absolutely certain of this in one of her wanderings her immediate task dissolving behind this curtain of regret and anger her eye fell onto the frozen image of a city bus on the video not the bus in particular but its route number posted electronically on its side the route number glimpsed briefly as melissa boarded the bus in her attempt to follow the big man wearing the hooded sweatshirt mexican chinese she couldnt be sure but that route number the mans destination was somewhere along that bus route a quick review of the other video confirmed that he had changed buses at least once melissa had followed him into the bus on her second try had he transferred to the same route both times what if hed ridden the bus to the sweatshop what if she compared that particular bus route to the list of vacant structures that boldt had confirmed the police were investigating what if they could follow the rat to the nest she trembled with excitement suddenly feeling fully awake and invigorated it seemed so obvious to her so overlooked what could it hurt if she checked it out on her own what damage could be done by a simple bus ride around town what if she could bring boldt the location of the sweatshop she clicked off the monitors removed the tapes and hurried to lock them in her office despite the fact they were only copiesthe originals safe with boldt she had a bus to ride chapter fall was a time of dying the annual ritual of transition from summers lush wealth to winters bleak bankruptcy volunteer park sat poised behind an affluent neighborhoods threestory colonial homes the park housed the asian art museum and a stone water tower at night it played host to hardcore drug use all walks of society appreciated a good view boldt met his wife in the museums parking lot from where the hill spilled down and away from them toward the intrusion of highrises and the graygreen wash of the sound late afternoon the first day of september it was busy with inline skaters and baby strollers boldt smelled fall in the air it brought a pang of anxiety he didnt need any more change right now lizs invitation to meet away from downtown implied trouble she knew it was more difficult for him especially midday everything okay he asked she made every effort to return the weight savaged by the chemotherapy but all these months later she still looked the samea piece of dried fruit the juice of life sucked out he loved her appreciated her and yet did not accept her as fully healthy in part because of her appearance in part a resistance to the idea of sharing management of the family with her her sickness had put boldt in charge of the kids the schedule even the meals and menus and though he welcomed the relief from his duties he also felt a bit like a dictator unwilling to recognize the democracy where are you she asked accusingly im here you were off somewhere else im right here liz youre slipping back into it you know the twelvehour days the leaving before theyre up and coming home after theyre asleep she had brought him to volunteer park to lecture him on old habits dying hard im working on stuff he confessed trying to work things out living with my being healthy she stated its hard for you im working stuff out he repeated she took his hand hers was icy there was never any warmth in any of her extremities as if shed just gone for a swim in a cold lake dr woods office called she said boldt swooned the world seemed to slow to a stop all sound replaced by a whining in his ears his vision shrinking he managed only a guttural what the tests my annual theres evidently a newer more sensitive test they can run they want me to book an appointment youre a part of that decision i appreciate that he said she stared out at the water its not that i dont respect your faith its that i dont understand it she explained they say they want me in for an early flu shot they say theyre worried about me getting the flu but i know katherine its about the tests which is it flu shots or the tests something teased his thoughts the container victims had been exposed to a flu could he use that now they mentioned both the excuse to get me in there is the flu shots its your decision liz you want to skip the tests he said im with you but he wasnt with her he felt distracted she offered you have to be fully behind this i need my faith she smiled i dont expect miracles chapter boldt caught dixon in the middle of an autopsy an eightyfiveyearold widow had fallen off a ladder while changing a light bulb and had broken her neck the law required dixon to cut her up and take his samples and though typically an assistant would have handled such a case the late summer vacation schedule put the burden on the boss he went about it with all the enthusiasm of a parking lot cashier the room smelled foul despite the ventilation system boldt hated the taste it left in his mouth flu shots dixon asked boldt said what if the illegals arent the only ones sick these hilltop women were rapedthats close contact what if the skin irritation on jane doe was from industrial detergent as in a car wash clearly impressed dixon said not so farfetched close physical contact boldt repeated you said yourself it was highly contagious what if it spread what if a couple guys are real sick what if the evening news happened to report that a flu shot and an antibiotic had just come available that both were specific to what authorities were calling the container flu the antibiotic wouldnt be specific to the flu dixon advised so they issue a retraction the point being that we could use it as bait weve seen guards on the videos people have been around these women close contact someone has buried them handled them the doctors gloved hands made sucking noises inside the cadaver he said this is no ebola or somethingits a very bad flu its treatable but if the news plays it up if theres a treatment available at a clinic if our people are at that clinic and if it requires them to fill out a form that includes an exposure date thats completely unnecessary but they dont know that the average guy doesnt know that i wouldnt know that jill doe was in the ground weeks ahead of jane doe jane doe was dead before the container the point being that if we can trick someone into naming a date ahead of the containers arrival then that person will have to explain his exposure no one would ever run such a story its medically unsound they fact check you know your only hope is with the tabloids believe me my hope is that this office will issue a press release boldt stated bluntly dixons hands stopped submerged in the corpse well then you just lost all hope he said firmly i understand what youre going for lou in a warped kind of way it even makes sense its a pretty good idea but i cannot put this department in the position youre asking me to if we lose integrity and trust if the public believes were willing to manipulate the truth for the good of spd it just doesnt work were a team of medical professionals believe me we have image problems enough without this kind of thing secondrate doctors surgeons whose only patients are dead cant do it lou but it might work boldt suggested looking for encouragement id give it a qualified yesa highly qualified yes he repeated but it doesnt matter youll never get anyone to run the story boldt said i wouldnt be so sure about that chapter between the chauffeurdriven town cars and her own i stevie realized she had not ridden a seattle city bus until then surprised by the diversity of its riders and the unexpected neighborliness of its passengers she had thought the bus system a place for poor people the homeless and indigent the unseen minority as they had been called in a feature piece on n instead on that tuesday afternoon she found teenagers college kids moms and children even a businessman or two they read books newspapers knitted listened to walkmans shared a conversation or stared out the windows which was what stevie did ever alert for landmarks that might signal the location where melissas subject had disembarked in her right hand stevie carried a printout from the digital video for comparison the bus stops came and went people switched seats the doors hissed shut the bell line buzzed the driver she marked a tourist map as she went indicating the running time of the trip with the video timestamped it seemed one possible way to identify the bus stop this man had taken the bus route dragged on her broadcast nearing after ten more minutes as they approached the fremont bridge she realized the bus trip would have to wait she had a meeting scheduled with boldt to determine if they should air the clips of mama lu frustrated with the idea of giving up she nonetheless disembarked crossed the street and rode another bus back into town as it turned out boldt was waiting for her chapter brian coughlie felt obsessed with her aware that following the botched attack in her apartment the police or the other security were more than likely to keep her under protection coughlie nonetheless assigned two of his own ins agents to also watch her from a distance to report not only her every movement but who else was keeping tabs when his people reported her boarding a city bus coughlie became perplexed try as he did he couldnt make sense of her riding public transportation out to fremont bridge and then back into the city again was it something she had gleaned from one of the videos a tip from an informer from the hotline what worse how did he stop her he had gone without sleep compensating for this additional fatigue through a liberal dose of amphetamines and as much espresso as he could force down he lived broadcast to broadcast terrified at what she might come up with next debating his options and not liking any of them to watch her broadcasts felt to him like professional leprosy watching the slow rotting of his own career as bits and chunks sloughed off two days more his focus remained this last shipment of illegals yet to arrive although he felt plagued by the polices recent discovery of three more buried bodies in hilltop cemetery and what those cadavers might reveal to the experts rodriguez was a liabilityhis solutions only created additional problems more terrifying to him personally was that his request for police to share this hilltop information had gone without any acknowledgment or reciprocity lamoia hadnt even returned the call what was that about he couldnt pick up and run even if hed wanted to it wasnt the police he was worried about but the chinese businessmen who owned him a person didnt run from such people not ever you stood and faced the music you implicated others in the failure you framed people if necessary the more he thought about it all the sharper the pain behind his eyes the drier his tongue he had work to do if he got this next shipment in without incidence he felt reasonably confident he could wrestle control back from spd and contain the damage the success of the next shipment was everything chapter stevie mcneal sat up straight in her anchor chair facing the three robotic cameras a barrage of lights pouring color and heat down onto her at boldts request she prepared herself to lie to use her anchor chair for her own good to willfully manipulate her trusting public in an effort to rescue her little sister it was professional suicide if it ever came out but she felt bound to pursue anything that increased melissas chances anything she would break from the prepared text of the news hour and read from her own cards there would be hell to pay especially if the station managers ever found out she had known in advance that the information was inaccurate a construct of a police department desperate for a break in the next few seconds she was going to put her entire career on the line she wouldnt find work in a fourthtier city if this ever came out her directors voice came through the earpiece she wore you okay stevie she raised her hand to signal him though she did not open her eyes her full concentration on melissa and putting her needs first surprisingly she thought of her father alone and unloved in some veterans hospital courtesy of the federal government melissa had mentioned his poor health stevie blamed her father for her years in new york for feeding her to a skirtchasing producer whose idea of educating the fresh recruits was getting their clothes off she hadnt spoken to her father since her departure from new yorkher ending the affair had also ended her network career but faced with compromising her career she suddenly thought of him and how she would be letting him down would be damaging the mcneal name and she realized he still held power over her even off wherever he was battling whatever it was she could break the communication but not the connection five four three two she opened her eyes the floor directors finger pointed ominously at her she felt cold despite the glare of lights good evening youre live with news four at five im stevie mcneal she broke from the prepared text local health authorities announced just moments ago that the flulike virus that may have been responsible for the deaths of several illegal aliens including three found dead in a shipping container last month is a far more serious threat to local health than previously imagined corwin stood up from behind the console in the soundproofed booth and waved frantically at her pointing to the thin pink sheet of text he held in his hand the yellow copy of which lay before her on the anchor desk and the text to which scrolled on the prompting screen below the camera lens she saw him only peripherally her attention primarily directed to the cards but divided between the cards and the camera with the red light his angry voice carrying through her fleshcolored earpiece and attempting to distract her as she continued to read her cards but stevie mcneal was a pro she never broke her cadence news four at five has learned that this contagion which produces flulike symptoms of high fever congestion and can result in bronchial infection stomach cramps and diarrhea is also believed responsible for the deaths of the jane doe and three other corpses found improperly buried at hilltop cemetery in the past week there are unconfirmed rumors that the virus is spreading rapidly through the detainee population at the ins facility at fort nolan health officials responding to the publics needs have established a free inoculation program at new care health clinic across from harborview medical center any persons having confirmed direct contact with anyone known to be carrying this virus are strongly encouraged to seek immunization andor a series of specially created antibiotics at new care between the hours of twelve and one pm and eight and ten pm daily until further notice or the limited supply runs out health care officials stress the severity of the problem the systemic nature of the contagion and the importance of this preventive treatment program for further information interested viewers can call this tollfree number twentyfour hours a day she read the number that boldt had provided her a number that ran directly to the fifth floor of the public safety building and had both callerid and trapandtrace functions enabled in other news she returned to the top of the prepared broadcast as she read from her sheet the teleprompter scrolled backward and caught up with her corwin would have to edit during the first break and cut a story or shorten weather or sports to accommodate stevies unexpected announcement he would never drop an adthe station had its priorities set an amazing sense of relief pulsed through her any effort to save melissa was worth the price boldts trap was properly set she had joined forces with the police and they with her and she thought that if anything this was a lesson for both sides she wondered if she had a year to keep her anchor chair or a week or a day truthfully she didnt care if melissa came home because of this one sixtysecond manipulation of the truth then in what she considered a moment of brilliance as she finished reading the lead story and the camera bearing the red light switched to billybob cutler she stood from her anchor chair stripped off the microphone and earpiece distracting but not interrupting her coanchor and marched off the set when she turned not toward her dressing room and the bathroom there but toward the studio exit the floor director rushed away from the set and caught up ms mcneal she hissed stopping stevie and turning her anything wrong jimmy corwins lean frame appeared through the door to the control booth and froze understanding her intentions from the expression on her face surprisingly he spoke calmly if this story is sound then why not include it in the script corwin was a newsman corwin knew before making a single phone call whos your contact on this stevie met eyes with him billybob will have to take my remaining segments hell do fine mr cutler the whole broadcast the floor director inquired corwin said tell me this story is going to check out what the hell is going on here she liked corwin she hated to do this to himto the station she took a deep breath and said i have a bus to catch chapter i need you pronto she split the station early im in trouble here coughlie had paged rodriguez to call him back taking a huge risk by using his cellphone but seeing no way around it the call had been returned nearly instantly he heard the barroom noise in the background and knew that rodriguez was in some happy hour haunt watching news four at five they both had made a regular diet of it he followed the bmw toward downtown wondering what she was up to first the story about a flu vaccine then the sudden departure he knew how rodriguez would react to that lead story he had to involve the man in mcneals surveillance in order to keep him from going to that health clinic coming from her mouth as it had the story had sounded plausible even legitimate but for a variety of reasons coughlie was deeply suspicious the ins would have been told if fort nolans population was at any kind of health risk it was a glitch in her story that he couldnt see past fearing some kind of trap some kind of sting he needed to keep rodriguez clear of the clinic the guy had been pretty damn sick for the last several weeks had buried women who had died with similar symptoms and had repeatedly complained about his health coughlie feared that the man would take the bait if rodriguez had any love it was for any kind of medication rodriguez said forget it no can do got me an appointment the big man sniffled snot back into the back of his throat it sounded grotesque this health clinic forget about it its a trap im busy its a trap the cops tricked her into this listen im following her right at this very moment coughlie said i need help with this busy listen to me rodriguez interrupted try me later the line clicked hello coughlie said into the receiver astonished the man would hang up on him a first hey he shouted he held out the cellphone and stared at it placed it back to his ear and repeated hey nothing mcneal parked the bmw coughlie pulled over fearing he might have to follow her on foot mcneal approached a bus stop and stood there waiting a bus stop she had mentioned to him that one of melissas surveillance videos had shown a bus rodriguez regularly used the bus to reach the sweatshop brian coughlie went numb with the thought he tried the pager again but this time his cellphone never rang with the return call a city bus pulled to a stop people shoved for position stevie mcneal climbed aboard chapter as stevie sat across from the rear door of the city bus watching the landscape parade past she reminded herself of the big man with the hooded sweatshirt consulting a color printouta freezeframe from the video she tracked the exact second the bus arrived and departed each of its stops looking for an elapsed time of twentytwo minutes and seventeen seconds as recorded on the digital video believing she was onto something she wanted to test her theory before taking up spds time with it adding to her excitement was the realization that she might have lost her tailas unintentional as it wasby leaving the station through a back exit during a time she was anticipated to be onair she assumed quite rightly that if there was any time her guards ran for a bite to eat or took a break it was during the twohour period that n typically occupied as much as she appreciated the reassurance of their presence she preferred her independence especially on the eve of what she believed was to be a major discovery this way she could savor the moment of delivering news of her discovery to boldt or lamoiaor better yet both at the same time if she found the sweatshop or even the general neighborhood where the man had left the bus route she would be doing something positive to help melissa not just sitting back and being a target of these people playing the victim was not her idea of taking part her eye constantly referenced the printout she held in her lap the eerie dark image of the big man a blur at the bus door but the stairstep pattern of the skyline seen through the bus windows distinct if not distinctive looking outside again she intentionally blurred her eyes to recapture the vague image on the printout still nothing the background offered not a hint of the footage melissa had shot melissa needed her and she was not delivering the bus pulled to yet another stop fremont bridgethe same place she had turned around her last time out she checked the printout and glanced up her eyes stinging her head ringing with defeat and grief if only melissa knew how much she cared how much she loved her if only she had taken the time to be with her to involve her in her lifemaybe even then things would be different she would feel differently somehow but she had not done these things she deeply regretted it now stevie had little time to think about such things she looked up as brian coughlie climbed onto the bus he moved down the aisle deliberately selfconfident and strong looking directly at her and never taking his eyes off her and for an instant a spike of fear raced through her where the hell had he come from what the hell did he want the seat next to her was vacant she would have gladly had it occupied by the smelliest street person at that moment although the determination in coughlies eyes indicated nothing would stop him from taking that seat the bus rolling coughlie sat down next to her and looked straight ahead i caught your act he said still looking toward the front of the bus a watchman he explained nifty little gadget i keep one with me everywhere i go now addicted to the news i guess you could say what a coincidence stevie said both of us on the same bus and all in your dreams he replied spd dropped the ball when you took off from the station not my boys no sir right there is the difference between local and federal im telling you be glad were on your side youve been following me she said with disgust hell youve so many people watching your ass you might as well be leading a parade youre a regular majorette his arrogance disturbed hera different man from the one previously seeking partnership the bus bounced all the passengers heads rose and fell in unison stevies teeth chattered but that had nothing to do with the buss jerky movements tell me about that little stunt of yours stunt her legs shook she was so nervous your idea or boldts this flu thing its a simple enough question he waited for her but she couldnt find a defendable answer couldnt find her voice at all you reported this flu was spreading out at fonofort nolan who gave you that whos your source on that or did you make it up does the news simply make things up this is my turf were talking about here his crimson face took on a greenish purple under the tube lights ill catch hell for this you know that health inspectors aclu you buried us with that piece he pursed his lips and edged forward on the seat this story is bullshit the cdc issued oh thats bullshit wed have seen it before anyone else dont you get it its our detention facility were talking about wed have been the first notified our population would have been the first immunized did they use you he asked incredulously or are you part of it they met eyes his were bloodshot and halfblind with anger she wanted off that bus it stopped but she didnt look up whatever it takes to save her she said it was boldts idea coughlie said im telling you the cdc issued a health bulletin and im telling you its not possible they used you he looked around and whats this about you dont mind me saying so you and a city bus have got nothing in common is it the videos the police found a bus ticket she lied it was worth a gamble if theyd found a bus ticket it would be them riding the bus not you whats going on with you why are you lying to me why are you having me followed protection from what from whom or do you want me to do your work for you a federal agency keeping a reporter under surveillance a witness no brian not me you want to deal with all this or are you going to call off your people youre making a mistakea big mistake its mine to make she said yes it is he answered his smile turned her stomach so have it your way but remember some mistakes are costly the bus pulled to another stop coughlie stood and disembarked he didnt look back chapter a woman detective from vice named laura stowle was dressed in nursing whites to play the role of clinic receptionist lamoia commented on how a tightly packed white uniform had irresistible effects upon him and how based on this rare opportunity to see stowles darkly handsome face and wellrounded personality in such a tantalizing costume he needed to ask her out boldt told him to keep it in his pants the clinic had gone along with the substitution because the receptionist required no medical training and until a doctor or paramedic became involved in the process there was no legal expectation of privacy the only problem with stowle in this assignment sarge is that even with her hair pulled back shes a little too cute a little too much like a soap opera star instead of the minimum wage ethnic receptionist weve all come to expect one of these days that mouth of yours is going to get you into more trouble than it can talk itself back out of boldt warned this mouth of mine ought to be registered as a weapon what it can do to a woman youre not scoring any points john go inside and take a chair you want to stare at stowle permission granted at least i wont have to listen to you lamoia occupied the chair in the far corner for two hours wondering why it was that waiting rooms offered only grossly outofdate magazines and wall clocks the size of pizzas he was bothered by how young the people using the free clinic were and how much of its traffic seemed involved one way or another with drugs and addiction only seven people had arrived as a result of stevie mcneals broadcast each of the seven times stowle had signaled all four of the undercover cops inside and boldt in the control van the lavaliere microphone was hidden in her dark hair its wire running down the back neck of her dress seven different people all seeking the rh flu shotall health care workers or dockhands who had been on the scene of the container recovery the eighth time laura stowle signaled lamoia it was for a tall hispanic male wearing a dark sweatshirt with a hood lamoia buried his face into a sixweekold copy of people the janitor with the bucket and mop kneeled down to work a piece of gum from the stone floor a wirylooking woman in hot pants and platform shoes pulled out her lipstick and used the mirror of her compact to get a good look at the door behind her a woman in civilian clothes typing at a station behind stowle took her fingers off the keyboard and took hold of her weapon beneath the table the big man was told to wait he took a seat two chairs away from lamoia who had the audacity to turn to the man and say how ya doing feel like shit man the other said his nose running his voice rough i hear that lamoia said returning to his magazine after five minutes the hispanic male was handed a form to fill out he looked at it with contempt standing in front of him stowle explained in a bored voice we need your name place of employment if any and relevant phone numbers for notification of followup theyre very important if you need the spanish form yeah he grunted she returned with a different clipboard and spoke spanish you can skip the insurance part because the treatment youve requested is free fourth line date of exposure is extremely important because it will determine the extent of treatment you receive and therefore the effectiveness of that treatment repeated exposures dont matter to the physician its the initial exposure that is critical to proper diagnosis and subsequent treatment if theres anything i can help you with you could speed things up a little lamoia said interrupting in english or maybe a drink after youre through here stowle glared at him the hispanic sniffled coughed and scribbled his name onto the top of the form in crude but legible handwriting guermo rodriguez stowle returned to her place behind the counter lamoia was called a few minutes later under the name romanello bout time he said placing the magazine down good luck man he said to the other youll be a couple years older by the time they call you rodriguez stood simultaneously and returned the clipboard and form to the receptionist who passed it on to the officer at the keyboard station behind her the womans loaded weapon still available on the shelf by her knees lamoia passed into the back and took up a position in the examination room adjacent to the room where rodriguez would be examined effectively blocking any use of the buildings back exit they had him cornered now lamoia waited impatiently for information back from downtown the keyboard operators input of the outpatient form was not headed for the clinics medical records but instead was connected by modem to the departments criminal records bureau the name guermo rodriguez came back negative no criminal arrests or convictions the system also failed to kick a drivers license or a registered vehicle guermo rodriguez did not exist he was however a man who might ride the city buses rodriguez had more than likely listed a bogus address on the clinics form as well as a bogus phone number rodriguez was probably himself an illegal a connection that could easily put him into service for a corrupt ins official hes gotta be our guy boldt announced over the radio the sweatshirt matches what we saw on the videos we go with it a few minutes later rodriguez was given an injection of a placebo told to take aspirin and drink plenty of water and released by the time guermo rodriguez left the clinic spd had fifteen officers in ten vehicles assigned to his surveillancethe largest surveillance operation conducted by the department in the past eleven months chapter with spd monitoring his every footstep nearly his every breath rodriguez was carefully followed first to an allnight pharmacy where he bought a bottle of aspirin some cough syrup and a head cold decongestant and subsequently to a place on military road in federal way as lamoia explained to boldt who had returned to the office to oversee and direct the surveillance from the situation room he climbs up into an eighteenwheeler caba flatbedand takes a twohour nap i got a hunch that trucks his home for the time being but then he fires it up and drives off whats that say to you sarge mama lu was right about the new moon boldt answered theres a shipment coming in tomorrow the next day soon the truck was intended to move a container so then he drives a couple miles parks it and takes a lawyers lunch at a greasy spoononly its after midnight hes in no sign of being in any hurry we know for certain hes in there boldt pressed cranshaw is getting his fill of cherry pie and coffee we got a visual waiting for a meet boldt proposed that or a call got to be you want i should bring him in for a chat negative boldt stated the evidence they had against rodriguez was entirely circumstantial i could try for a trapandtrace on the diners pay phone now theres a long shot never get it boldt admitted lets hope this guys girlfriend doesnt have a thing for the inside of truck cabs or something i hope to hell were not wasting our time here is sex the only thing you think about boldt asked no way lamoia answered without missing a beat im pretty fond of money too at am wednesday morning the flatbed semi with rodriguez behind the wheel finally left the diners gravel lot boldt was awakened from a nap in a storage room where a bunk bed offered detectives a chance to lie down surveillance was tricky at that hour and with boldts request for a phone warrant denied all the police could do was guess at the call rodriguez had been seen making from the diner and to follow him at a comfortable distance thirty minutes later he used a bolt cutter to enter the gates of a naval storage depot that proved to have been part of the base closures that had caused a brief downward blip in king countys otherwise stellar economy rodriguez pulled the flatbed down to a dock area where a pair of towering cranes pointed up toward the night sky it was those cranes that caught everyones attention fifteen minutes later as lamoia and two other detectives made their move to get a better vantage point rodriguez was spotted crossing through the navy yards side gates on foot a moment later he dragged a motorcycle out of the weeds and took off without lights catching the surveillance team by surprise and lamoia in the midst of cutting a chained gate accessing a dark spit of land that looked directly across a small thumb of water at the navy yard detectives pursued in unmarked cars but rodriguez took the cycle offroad and disappeared eluded boldt roared into the phone we screwed up sarge and then some boldt said didnt expect the bike dont try for sympathy from me you lost our prime suspect we still have the flatbed lamoia reminded attempting to salvage something from his loss and the two cranes gaynes is still on coughlie he paid a visit to kstv he took a brief ride on a city bus you got that sarge a city bus he added cautiously this navy yard has got to be the place its perfect the cranes for christs sake im gonna issue a be on lookout for rodriguez well set up out here if were right about this drop sarge we had better be prepared for an allout war im thinking mulwright and special ops ive got to report it to hill john i understand hang in there right as the sun crawled into a slate gray sky looking like a bug light held behind a curtain three men pushed a step van out onto their surveillance point to avoid having to run the vans motor and risk its being overheard lamoia and two technicians climbed into the back of that van dogtired hungry and humiliated they took turns with twentyminute catnaps but nothing helped lamoia failure was the worst kind of fatigue the barren spit of land with its rough gravel and broken glass was littered with the skeletons of commercial fishing equipment buoys engine parts booms cranks winches and miles of coiled and damaged fishing net wound onto enormous spools water slapped against a sea wall of boulders chunks of former roadway and the rusting carcasses of dead automobiles and railroad boxcars the seawater a murky green moved like mercury a light but steady breeze colored the air with a salty ocean spray at am that wednesday morning lamoia received word over the radio that they had trouble at the gate he slipped out the back of the van wondering when the trouble would stop every time he turned around there was a screwup or a problem the problem this time was a rentacop with a company called collier security he wore a grayblue uniform with a can of pepper spray where on a cop the gun would have been the collier logo on the arm patch tried too hard to look like spds the name badge pinned over the right pocket read stilwill mr stilwill whats the problem an exhausted and agitated lamoia inquired what im telling the officer here is that i got me a job to do lieutenant sergeant lamoia corrected cops or not you cant be here on this property without the owners knowing about it we will handle notification lamoia assured him for the time being it would be whole lot better for everyone if you just continued your rounds forget about us we arent here that would save us all a trip downtown and a lot of lawyering yeah but like you cant be in here see its private property and the equipment on it is private property you got a warrant ive got probable cause this is an active investigation lamoia said dryly his patience running thin you have a clear choice here stilwill its your call to make right or wrong detective heiman crossed the road from an unmarked car and hurried over to lamoia out of breath he spoke a little too loudly for the situation port authority has six freighters scheduled for arrival over the next twentyfour hours three of them listing hong kong last port of call give me a minute here detective lamoia said well aware the security man had overheard stilwill looked out over the water and clearly took note of the cranes that container thing he asked youre on that container thing its an undercover surveillance operation mr stilwill lamoia explained avoiding a direct answer you want me to say good things about you youll just pick up and move on cause otherwise im gonna rain down shit on your parade so deep youll drown in it stilwill glanced around nervously outnumbered what you need to do lamoia repeated is move on and forget about this are you listening mr stilwill i hear ya he said his attention remaining on the view of the naval yard that over there has been deserted for years aint never seen nothing over there whered that flatbed come from anyway you need to think about our little situation here what situation stilwill asked intentionally naive offering lamoia a shiteating grin thats better lamoia said but inside he didnt trust the man wednesday september days missing chapter early wednesday morning live second in ratings to channel four news led off its morning report quoting a reliable source that police are involved in a massive surveillance operation directly linked to the illegals investigation the report infuriated everyone from sheila hill upset over the apparent leak to jimmy corwin annoyed that kstv had been scooped by the competition adam talmadge complained vehemently through legal channels that the ins had not been informed of nor included in any such surveillance by that morning the trailing network affiliate identified security guard clarence stilwill as the source of the information on the advice of attorneys stilwill was in hiding and unavailable for comment kvow public radio reported not only that a possible suspect had been lost during the surveillance but that the king county medical examiners preliminary autopsy report on the most recent hilltop cemetery cadaver jill doe was due out that same day and was said to contain additional information pertaining to the illegals investigation political shock waves ran through the system as denial upon denial was issued nocomment upon nocomment echoed through the media and filtered down to coffee shops and the office copy room melissa chows disappearance and possible abduction had become an emotionally charged issue stumped by wouldbe politicians running for office in november and as word spread that police were possibly closing in on the people behind it the radio talk shows buzzed with various leaks boldt and lamoia felt this pressure on both professional and personal levels they were told to stop the leaks and solve the case sheila hill summed it up for them both get us something in time for the six oclock news that will make both the mayor and the pa look good something to feed the beast and satiate it if you cant come up with something im going to feed them your reassignments gentlemen so dont take this lightly their pagers sounding boldt and lamoia left hills office and headed directly to the mes basement offices in the harborview medical clinic the bear of a man led them with huge hurried strides into his office and closed the doors i dont know where that leak came from he apologized but if ifind out that person will never work again not ever not anywhere not a man to lose his temper this particular ronald dixon was a rare sight i thought you said it was the leaks you wanted to talk to us about boldt complained although lamoia was scheduled to return to the naval yard surveillance there had been no activity at the location since rodriguezs escape as you can imagine john and i are a little busy this morning dixie no not leaks like that dixon corrected losing his anger to a smile leeks he said the kind you eat leeks lamoia repeated exactly said the medical examiner exactly what boldt asked jill doe dixon answered its always the first victim he ruminated the mistakes the haste what mistakes boldt answered pointing to boldt dixon said to lamoia take lessons from him hes the best there is knows when to interrupt and what to ask knows when to keep his mouth shut and let a man talk he looked at boldt so let me talk he moved to behind the security of his large gunmetal gray desk they froze her same as jane but they had more time they froze her hard solid and im guessing they forgot to take that chain off ahead of time so that by the time they realized if they realized it was still attached they had little choice but to leave it there they then buried her over ten feet deep in relatively cool soil a week maybe even two or three ahead of jane doe you see where im going with this she stayed frozen boldt guessed gold star for a while yes and that helped not only preserve her but severely retard her decomposition she stayed frozen down there lamoia asked are you listening no she didnt but she was in fortydegree soil her extremities thawed first followed by the epidermis in general the heat moved from both ends toward the center like defrosting a leg of lamb but you know how long that takes you put a twentypound turkey or a sixpound leg of lamb on a seventydegree kitchen counter and it takes all daysometimes longerto defrost try putting it inside a fortydegree refrigerator you pull it out the next day the thing has barely begun to thaw now try it with a hundredandseventeen pound human being pass lamoia said do we learn anything from all this fascinating detail he quipped dixon said sadly in other ways youre more like him every day the cliff notes dixie boldt said stomach contents relatively intact plenty of organic matter to work with boldt wondered if hed wasted his morning dixon continued did it occur to either of you brilliant investigators that if these people have a hundred women locked up sewing polarfleece pullovers for a dime a day they still need some way to feed them he grinned widely ah ha i can see it did not no you overlooked the obvious did you not so locked like me into the deadthe dead evidence the dead witnesses the dead ends that you never extrapolated the situation out to the obvious these women have to eat and this woman jill doe did eat not only did she eat but she ate a tuberous root an edible bulb similar to our own leek she also apparently consumed brown rice but its this leek that interests you this leek thats the best evidence youve had in this case asian and not sold in your typical safeway if the few phone calls weve made are any indication we cant find one for comparison asian groceries boldt muttered stung by this information lamoia followed suit mama lu is the asian grocery queen what do you want to bet that she has the contract to provide the food for these people thats how she knows so much about it and yet isnt directly involved to where she has to fear us a humble businesswoman boldt repeated at a whisper she kept flaunting it right under my nose chapter ms mcneal its roy a familiar but unidentifiable voice said over her cellphone stevie was more interested in the ice cream she had ordered from room service than the phone call roy traffic the man inquired identifying himself chopper roy they called him drivetime traffic reports for both the morning news and n once she made the connection the voice was all the more recognizable yes roy station gave me your cell number hope you dont mind i thought youd want to hear this hear what she sat forward on the couch and pushed the ice cream aside her heart beginning to beat more strongly in her chest what was the traffic guy calling about friend of mine sam haber works over to the fbo handles sevens skycam channel seven he meant the competition she didnt like this already their chopper yeah sam does their maintenance also does their outfitting calls about canceling a mariners game we had planned on account seven has him outfitting their bird with some hightech infrared shit that has something to do with hunting down a ship tonight were talking about he overhears one of the guys with the gear saying theyre going to scoop us on our story on account the cops have been asking all sorts of questions at port authority thought you ought to know a ship she repeated scribbling down notes on a white linen napkin our own story scooping our own story yeah know anything about this gear only that its not standard issue ultrasensitive infrared sam said some professor type from the university was the one installing it they had to black out the hangar to even pull the lens cap and test the gearits that sensitive daylight will fry the thing guy blew up at sam over opening a door because of the light pissed sam off ill tell you what if he hadnt maybe sam wouldnt have told me sams kinda like that doesnt like someone shouting at him you know theyre hunting down a container ship she stated is there any way we can mess them up on this does the pope shit in the woods the helicopter pilot replied get the bird ready shes being refueled as we speak as stevie was about to hang up she was trying to think of some way to lose her various guards and surveillance roy she asked are there any downtown buildings where you can land on the roof can you get over to columbia seafirst give me a number where i can reach you she said ill call from there chapter lamoia was not above circumventing existing law to get what he needed but he did so only by working with detectives willing to forgo overtime pay and to keep silent about their actions chief among these was bobbie gaynes so fiercely loyal to boldt that she had no problem with the assignment to place a federal agent under roundtheclock surveillance despite the fact that any such surveillance required special notification it was nothing new for lamoiacoming up through the ranks his nickname had been stretch for how he dealt with the law everyone wanted what lamoia could get for them snitches bank accounts tax recordsbut not one of them wanted to know the details it was okay with him it helped perpetuate the myth and the myth was now what defined him the myth it controlled him as well dictating his actions and he knew that couldnt last forever he moved through women like a drunk through boozein part to maintain that image he drove fast and lived that way too but the wax melting from both ends shrank ever smaller and john lamoia identified with it more clearly every day lamoia had no physical evidence against brian coughlie only a deeprooted suspicion prompted by a number of unexplained coincidences without evidence he had no case to build but as a point of law it was not explicitly illegal for any person to follow or watch any other person so long as the person being watched did not feel threatened or have his or her expectation of privacy violated washington state did have a tough stalker law in place but it required certain criteria to be met that gaynes and lamoia avoided without any effort whatsoever gaynes called from a pay phone in order to avoid the open airwaves of cellular telephones and the lurid intentions of police radioband scanners lamoia and gaynes maintained a relationship of respectatadistance his womanizing so legendary that she skillfully avoided him her investigative abilities and position in boldts inner circle crucial to his squads allimportant high clearance rate they rarely played politics with each other and never socialized go ahead lamoia acknowledged having moved into the passenger seat of the surveillance van still parked with a view of the naval yard despite the media blitz earlier in the day as far as lamoia and others could determine the press had yet to cotton on to the actual physical location of the naval yard surveillance i think i lost him lost him thats what i said she fired back angrily he parked it and went into city hall she reported city hall thats what i said she repeated its been half an hour im thinking he burned me must have gone out a different door left his car you tell sarge youre lead she reminded lamoia didnt feel like the lead detective he wasnt sure he ever would and he didnt know if that was because of boldt or his own personality he had followed in the mans footsteps for too long to give it up only that past year when boldt had worked intelligence had lamoia felt like his own man but now the two reunited at crimes against persons title or not rank or not the sarge ran the show and no one was complaining least of all lamoia never heavyhanded about it boldt simply had an instinct to lead a nose for the next avenue to pursue the man owned an eightyeighta tenyear clearance rate that seemed likely to stand for all time lamoia was a sixtyfour and proud of it there were guys down in the midforties gaynes was a seventy though she didnt flaunt it as the one and only woman wearing a gold badge on the fifth floor she was smart enough not to flaunt any of her assets she dressed to hide her body had a tongue on her that could keep up with anyone and could drink as much beer as the next dick lamoia liked her though he hoped it didnt show when it came to investigations he didnt always feel like the lead but in terms of his squad he was the sergeant the one in charge in command in this regard he was unflinching thinking aloud he said half an hour in city hall is nothing those drones he could easily still be in there could be could also be that he took this mornings news to mean we might have him under surveillance could be guilt working him making him take precautions you want me to look around nah dont move keep an eye on his wheels ill be there in a few well double ill check inside whats your location she told him lamoia sneaked out of the surveillance van and was on his way back into town lamoia started with vital statistics thinking death certificates offered the most direct route to forge a new identity and that perhaps coughlie was hoping to reinvent himself and get the hell out of dodge the description of the man failed to register with the asian woman behind the desk and only then upon hearing her thickly laced accent did it occur to him that any one of these minimum wagers could be in cahoots with an ins agent he tried state property tax records next only because it was the next door down the hall one door to another the workers behind the counters asian hispanic black not many whites lamoia had no problem with the melting pot so long as everyone working city hall spoke english drove fiftyfive and paid their taxes same as him he didnt support the concept of welfare and frowned at food stampstoo much corruption for anything like that to work you took your shovel or your pen and you went to work same as the next joe that was the america he wore his badge for a trip down the halls of city government could shake a person up coughlie was nowhere to be seen the next floor held five more doorsall the same thing too much paperwork too many stamps of approval too many hands under the table grabbing for the same cash it depressed him another flight up the polished marble stairs who the hell could afford marble anyway permits the idea did not jump out at him he heard no trumpets or voices guiding him the door to permits was blocked only by a rubber wedge a matronly black woman who knitted her own sweaters and chose not to color her vaguely gray hair stood behind the long counter she had the cheerful air of a first grade teacher or public librarian police he introduced himself displaying his badge he began his description of brian coughlie only to be interrupted the ins agent who was just here she said yes coughlie had made his ins identity known to the woman lamoia took this as a bad sign for it supported the mans innocence he wanted coughlie definedon or off his list of suspectshe didnt want to keep guessing his interest here lamoia asked building permits she said must have spent a half hour going over them current past current said that construction sites often employed illegals illegal immigrants you know for the manual labor the grunt jobs i think he called them said construction permits were a great resource for the ins this made sense lamoia sank a little lower his suspicions dashed then youd seen him before he inquired thinking to ask me oh no never once not ever youre new to this department arent you the one for compliments she said eighteen years ive worked here behind this counter other ins agents here never not so as they identified themselves anyway lamoia considered all this carefully as he asked to be shown the same material coughlie had viewed lamoia spent twenty minutes reviewing the exact same construction permits as had brian coughlie but failed to connect any importance to his case he considered every angle location of the sites any possible connection to mama lu he found nothing he asked a dozen questions including if coughlie had focused on any particular permit if he had asked for any specific qualification the woman couldnt help him he could feel the connection staring back at him but could not see it he decided to let it go hoping it might make sense to him later the way that sometimes happened where to from here gaynes asked i gotta get back to the surveillance lamoia replied from the passenger seat of her chevy he didnt see the point in wheels like this no style nothing to offer hed brought her a cup of mocha coffee and she had seemed touched that he knew the way she took it me she asked try his crib try his office make up some bullshit if you have to try to find him keep me up to speed if you strike out when you get back to ps check with the lab the doc said he passed the jill doe evidence on to lofgrin wheres it at how come we dont have it the sarge hes doing the dance with mama lu he may have something providing we ever see him again dont joke around like that she chastised him that shit bothers me whos joking lamoia replied taking one last noisy sip from the cups plastic lid before venturing back outside chapter were working together right mcneal asked boldt from the other end of a cellular call far as im concerned his mind was on mama luthe location of that sweatshop if the great lady wouldnt cooperate then as far as he was concerned their one and only chance of finding melissa of busting the sweatshop came down to the shipment expected that same night stevie mcneal and her world of problems was far from his thoughts together as in whatever i have you have and vice versa as in boldt confirmed his attention still drifting this surveillance that was reported she said waking him up some what are your chances of making this bust until they reported it our chances were pretty good i think and now not so good he answered theres something going down she stated a container shipment his mind sprang fully awake where had she gotten that its possible he admitted we dont know exactly when although any time around the new moon makes strategic sense for them he added we thought the drop was going to be at a naval yardthat is until things leaked this morning that hurt us now quite honestly were not so sure your plan his mind briefly prevented him from discussing itdo not share this with the press but his tongue overruled had been to intercept the drop fully cloaked and to follow the shipment wherever it led we believed that would include not only the sweatshop and those people responsible but quite possibly ms chow as well and now that it has leaked she inquired one step forward two steps back were still watching our location but im guessing weve been sandbagged by the leak so youre tracking all arriving freighters she stated reporters and cops thought the same way freighters tankers trawlers he hesitated any ship making port in the next thirtysix hours of special interest are any that made port in hong kong ill be down at port authority well be tracking every ship closely he confirmed though his jaw was tight and his voice sounded foreign even to him three in particular due in later tonight all made port in kowloon that matches with the visage none due in from hong kong scheduled for tomorrow or friday so were leaning on tonight we play the highpercentage hunches so do i and my hunch is youre about to be sandbagged again she warned she explained what she had found out about channel sevens skycam crew boldt remained silent trying to clear his thoughts suddenly a tangle of confusion and outright anger the press no longer reported cases they intervened and destroyed them we havent much time she warned im listening his throat dry and scratchy his temper flaring no onenot you not the mayorcan stop a news crew from reporting believe me im aware of that he said competition is a wonderful thing the infrared technology has its limits it doesnt like light if wemy team im talking aboutwere to aim enough light toward that infrared camera wed blind the equipment wed piss them off surebut we wouldnt be breaking any laws just one news crew out to scoop the other you see how this works youre going to sabotage a live news feed the open line hissed with static im going to improve melissas chances she said they expose this freighter and who knows what happens when people panic they make poor choices agreed if youre going to be at port authority then that helps i need you to provide me the exact locations of these three freighters she suggested maybe we can mislead sevens chopper boldt paused his mind whirring she asked youve got to trust me on this a week earlier he might not have but they were two pieces of the same puzzle now boldt said let me have your number again ill call you from port authority chapter lamoia pulled up to a red light a dozen ways existed that he might have made the connection between coughlie and the purpose behind the mans stop at city hall he might have used a detectives cunning or logic or some complex strategy born of his years of experience instead it was simply that red light the camaro idled alongside a highrise construction site lamoia ever on the lookout for a nice set of legs or a chest to fix his eyes upon noticed a construction crane in the process of hoisting a pallet of steel beams the light changed he pulled to the side of the street set his flashers to blinking and thought it through what if they were right about coughlie being involved what if the man suspected the reported police surveillance was on his drop point the naval yard with only hours to go before the arrival of the container ships a new container of illegals with crane rentals being carefully watched by spdinformation to which coughlie was privyhow would he select a backup location the answer was now obvious to him look for a waterfront construction site that had a permit to operate a crane and therefore a crane onsite he popped open his cellphone and dialed they could have surveillance in place on any such sites in a matter of minutes chapter light rain struck the traffic helicopters plastic bubble sounding like pebbles on tin heard even over the ferocious roar of the choppers blades stevie mcneal could not get used to the empty space of the clear plastic beneath her feet she floated high above the white chop of the water and the wickedly fast gray wisps of cloud that raced past underfoot half nauseous half adrenaline rush boldt stood over the port authority radar its circular black scope fully refreshed every seventeen seconds returning images of any vessel with a deck taller than six feet above the waterline or carrying a radar reflector as most pleasure craft did radar installations rimmed puget sounds coastline all feeding data into this one facility two miles south of downtown there were four such scopes in all covering every shipping lane from the strait of juan de fuca to the elliott bay waterfront the six men and women in this darkened room tracked the movement of commercial ships into the port of seattle twentyfour seven twentyfour hours a day seven days a week as they enter the system the man with the military haircut explained to boldt they identify themselves and we tag them much the same way airtraffic control would with an aircraft the only difference herethese ships move a lot slower he said trying but failing to evoke a response from the lieutenant but being as theyre tens of thousands of tons set in motion tens of thousands of tons that take anywhere from one to three miles to come to a complete stop they bear our attention most if not all have contracts with tugs to be picked up and moved into port we track where and when that is to happen to remove any possibility of collision or bottlenecking on top of the commercial shipping lanes we have over two dozen commercial ferries on regular schedules through these waters an impossible number of cruise ships military craft coast guard and tens of thousands of registered pleasure craft it keeps us busy the ss hana zeffer and danske boldt quoted cocking his notepad to catch some of the limited light in the windowless and blackened room theyre all in the system the reason im here the military cut nodded yes the ss hana is reporting equipment failure and has requested to leave the lanes and hold closer to shore is that common it happens sure but its not common boldt pressed listen with you guys breathing down our necks we take everything just a little more seriously okay anything you can name it has happened out there fires explosions collisions you name it if an equipment failure threatens to slow down traffic or bottle us up were only too happy to get that ship out of traffic the hana stopped in hong kong boldt verified all three hana zeffer and danske just as we reported to you he pointed to a small blip on the screen below which was a sixdigit number hana was the first of the three into the system shes number six thousand four hundred and twelve this year shes done everything by the book and weve got no complaints against her some of these captains can be real assholes believe me doublehulled egos im telling you she wants out of the lane shes got it shes a container ship thats correct and once shes out what then boldt asked to be honest our concern is with the lanes keep the traffic moving on a typical night wed pay little or no attention to her once shes down in speed and picked up by a tug and out of our way but shes on your screen boldt reminded of course shes on the screen but all im saying is out of sight out of mind you know and if she made an unscheduled stop would you guys spot that why the hell would she make an unscheduled stop the man asked i need an exact location a gps fix if youve got it you learn quick the man said clearly impressed he grabbed a piece of paper and scribbled down a string of numbers like a bat he was used to working in the dark boldt couldnt see a thing when the dim but visible lights of ss hana appeared off the choppers port side as a faint cluster of pale color in an otherwise blackened backdrop the pilot banked the chopper left rendering his passengers briefly weightless contact he said with confidence channel sevens skycam heard occasionally over the airtraffic control radio became visible for the first timea set of blinking lights pointed out by the pilot he deftly brought the tail around to give him a better view and then sideslipped his craft through the rain down and to the right a kite lost to the wind falling falling falling will they see us she asked into her headset the freighter mustnt see us we mustnt spook them the kstv technician who had crowded the choppers backseat with gear reported ive got their feed he passed stevie a small color screen the size of a paperback book a single wire running from it on the tiny monitor stevie saw the ships shape as a collage of iridescent colorsa yelloworange wake spilling away from the stern of the ship like a paper fan set afire she couldnt look at the screen very long without added nausea below her the freighter grew in size from a childs toy to something large and menacing as the rain fell harder and the collapsing ceiling of thick clouds swirled like water headed down a drain fully loaded the ss hana carried twelve hundred containers the size of railroad boxcars stacked five high on deck a few hundred of these were secured by chain with links as wide as a mans leg and leveraged turnbuckles that required two strong men to set or remove them with containers rising fifty feet from its deck the ship looked ready to capsize the technician warned theyre getting ready to go live or they wouldnt be transmitting images stevie asked the pilot can we get between them and the ship and still avoid being seen not with our lights on he said flipping a switch and making them dark no strobes whatsoever is this legal she asked hell no could you lose your license hell yes is it safe the helicopter dove so quickly that stevie reached out for a grip depends the pilot answered talking loudly into the headset on what she asked nervously on what they do he answered indicating the neighboring helicopter as they passed below it stand by the technician said i think theyre going to broadcast get between them stevie instructed she could not have seven revealing the ship and spoiling boldts efforts melissa she thought oh my god she hollered hurry the screen in her lap showed the water as a dark green the ships outline boldly as black its wake a flaming orange roil its onboard lights pale yellow and tiny she asked her technician whats that red blob at the stern im thinking engine room he answered those engines will be cooking the bright yellow dots are probably some of the crew out on deck same with the darker yellow just forward of thatmost likely the pilothouse and this she asked indicating another much larger mass of pale yellow slightly forward of midship thats coming from a container he confirmed as in people inside a container she asked warmth he answered the source we dont know he touched his headset hang on theyve gone live listen up he threw a switch and stevies headphones filled with a reporters introduction on the screen the ship appeared against the blackness of the water a large rectangular shape of unexplained color sparkles filled the screen that interference is us the technician said proudly blind them stevie ordered the pilot the helicopter slowly turned to the right and aimed up toward the flashing strobe lights just below the layer of clouds both helicopters remained to the stern of the ss hana less likely to be heard or spotted by the crew the reporter said onair without infrared you can barely see the stacked containers aboard this ship but in a moment well show you what the eye cannot see it is this reporters contention that the heat inside a forward container represents body heat from illegal immigrants what you will see next is an infrared image of this same ship with yellow and red representing heat sources it is lives intention over the next hour to follow this ship to port the video screen switched to the infrared color images now stevie shouted the pilot brought the choppers nose up he tripped a bright spotlight that flooded the other helicopter white on the screen this appeared as a blinding bolt of fireengine red that interrupted the view of the ship direct hit shouted the technician youre brilliant stevie said pun intended the image on the screen appeared to burn and melt from the edges until completely white the fraught and anxious voice of the news reporter complained like some old lady with her garden torn up by a neighbors dog channel seven had caught a few seconds of the infrared image and it reappeared on their live broadcast the reporter delivered a voiceover narrating the events below stevie asked the pilot if it was possible to contact the other helicopter by radio he warned her it would have to be quick threw a switch on the console and indicated for her to depress a button when she wished to speak and to release to listen now she asked he nodded julia stevie spoke naming the channel seven reporter its stevie mcneal do you realize what youve just done what youre doing there are human lives involved here an active police investigation do you understand the consequences of these images was that you who just fried our gear you competitive bitch you cant stay on the radio the pilot warned as airtraffic control began to call out to the aircraft the reporter screamed into the radio well sue you the pilot mumbled theyll ground me stevie moved her hand away from the talk button rather reluctantly check it out the technician shouted handing a set of nightvision binoculars forward to stevie i think theyve made us through the binoculars stevie watched in the eerie greenandblack environment of night vision as the crew ran forward toward the stacked containers theyre working the chains below a half dozen deckhands looked like ants as they hurried to free that top container the technician announced theyre going to dump it overboard the winch jammed with only forty feet of cable deployed as crewmen worked furiously to fix it nothing on hana worked anymore it was amazing that she even floated a crew of four sprang into action carrying a fifteenfoot twelveinchthick plank atop their shoulders as they climbed the adjacent stack of containers and then shoved the plank beneath the topmost container and hung their weight from it in an attempt to leverage the container up and over the side at the first considerable tilt of the container the ship rocked and the loosened boxcar swiveled cantilevered over the dark water below one of the planks snapped and men fell forty feet to the steel deck the ship rocked to port and the container miraculously pivoted most of the way back one lone figure scrambled up the stack and went at the huge door with a bolt cutter as the rain fell harder hes letting em out the technician exclaimed weve got to do something stevie cried helplessly whats done is done the pilot said far below the huge container doors swung open massive bundles of fabric sealed in plastic cascaded down to the ships deck dark figures fled from that container the first two falling forty feet to the deck below a woman jumped into the dark water follow her stevie said call the coast guard goddamn it if only they hadnt she caught herself about to chastise the press as she and her team had so often been chastised that mirror was not one she wanted to look into several more illegals scurried down the walls of the containers wild with their escape frightened terrified the outnumbered crew was helpless to stop them the live chopper dove toward the black water and hovered over the ship stevie and her crew remained behind staying with the woman who had gone overboard the radio came alive with requests for the coast guard the hana would never make port would never lead the police anywhere not to the sweatshop not to melissa the press had ruined everything chapter reports from the covert surveillance teams established at both construction sites identified by lamoias visit to city hall had already suggested that delancy avenue wharf was the container deliverys backup location for the last hour three cars of asian males had been observed driving the area circling like hungry buzzards fifteen minutes earlier two of those men had jumped the fence at the site and had hotwired and fired up the crane breaking any number of laws in the process boldt allowed himself the faint hope that his team still had a chance boldt had been inside the port authority radar facility when lamoia had called with word of the live news story and how the illegals had fled the container not only was the idea of following the ss hana a bust but there had been not a twitch of action at the naval yard despite these glaring setbacks delancy avenue wharf seemed their best bet to stay with the importersthe coyotes one final chance for boldt and his team boldt ordered lamoia to abandon the naval yard and to head downtown get hold of someone at the ins he instructed call talmadge at home if you have to tell him were making arrests at delancy avenue and that wed like someone from the ins present at the interrogations so theres no perceived conflict of interest where boldt repeated the location and said this isnt an invitation coughlie lamoia asked you cant fish without bait boldt said you dont expect talmadge to come downtown this time of night do you you never know lamoia said and if coughlie shows up stay glued to him john as he drove the chevy toward delancy avenue boldt remained in radio contact with detectives heiman and brown sometime in his years of service he had come to visualize the radio traffiche actually saw the operation in his minds eye as officers spoke back and forth heiman was watching the construction site crane brown was a loose tail on one of the three suspect vehicles when brown reported his mark had just executed a uturn boldt understood intuitively that these guys had been tipped to the live news report with his car five blocks and closing to delancy avenue boldt issued the order to arrest while driving at breakneck speeds to join them as backup the two guys who had hotwired the crane topped his list of desirable arrests and he made this clear to heiman these two had trespassed and compromised machinery a laundry list of possible criminal charges filled boldts head with delight cop work there was nothing quite like it he wanted those two in an interrogation room despite the fact that asian gang members were notorious for refusing to talk if they were faced with the threat of multiple murder charges that carried the death penalty boldt believed tongues might wag the radio traffic won back boldts attention as browns mark sped back toward delancy avenue heiman reported the two crane operators abandoning the machinery and heading for the fence at the same time a radio car recruited as further backup reported itself engaged in a highspeed chase and in need of assistance the gang members had been smart enough to disperse in different directions weakening the police a block from delancy avenue wharf as boldt rounded the last corner a dark figure blurred through his headlights and he reacted instinctively by slamming on the brakes and yanking the key from the ignition out of the corner of his eye he saw heiman on foot heading the opposite direction he heard the slowing siren of the remaining patrol car and the distinctive pop of gunfire he hated that sound boldt jumped out of the chevy and took off after that blur the kid ran fast turning down an alley into which boldt followed behind him a patrol car had pinned one of the vehicles its officers engaged in a firefight the adrenaline rush warped his sense of time his gun was out carried in his right hand that blur up ahead just rounding another corner was all that mattered sirens wailed in the distance as additional backup made its way into the area boldt didnt have legs or lungs only adrenalineinduced purpose he shouted a warning it echoed off the brick and asphalt the kid rounded another corner boldt heard his own shoes slap the wet asphalt more claps of gunfire from far behind him he rounded that same corner and came to an immediate stop a dead end brick on both sides concrete wall of a building at the far end a dumpster and some junked furniture to his left a pile of black trash bags and debris to his right the alley was perhaps twenty yards long the wrought iron fire escape was empty sirens still approaching boldt understood he was going to have to do this alone he thought of miles and sarah and how much time he owed them how many years they all had yet to go he thought of how much he and liz had been through together how far theyd come he moved quickly to his left until his shoulder brushed the cool brick wall his right hand ready with his weapon he smelled urine and stale beer and garbage and oil he heard the firefight in the distance like a neighbors tv through the wall police he announced sharply very much aware that calling out made him a target standing at the open end of the alley as he was the air was suddenly incredibly still the distant sirens formed an uneasy curtain behind him all else was silence and the beating of his own heart sweat prickled his scalp his mouth was dry hed spent his life in this city he had no intention of dying here he saw the open graves at hilltop they seemed to call to him all the petty politics suddenly seemed just that this was the real police work this was the moment and nothing else the steady ticking off of seconds each worth a lifetime it was raw visceral terror weve got two options boldt announced not wanting anything to do with a firefight one is you stand up with your arms high and walk out of here the other is you come out feet first in a body bag theres nothing in between you hear those sirens you think a couple hotheaded young uniforms just dying to try out their weapons are going to improve your situation any listen to me im the best chance youll ever have of walking out of here alive silence had it been a few grunts a few complaints there would have been a dialogue started he took a series of deep breaths he was guessing behind the dumpster or hidden in the pile of bags and debris to his right he crept forward eyes shifting dumpster debris dumpster debris every darkened shadow filled with an imaginary shape he wanted none of this he wanted to turn and walk away the kid could be anywhere most likely in the one place boldt had not yet considered he wanted to talk the kid out he feared it wasnt going to happen his hand sweated against the guns knurled stock the sound of blood pumping clouded his ears it was too damn dark in this alley he reached the dumpster and wedged himself into the corner against the wall he was in a full sweat he hadnt heard the kid jump into the dumpster but couldnt discount the possibility he glanced toward the mouth of the alley ten yards behind him thirty feet most of it unprotected do you have any brothers he called out sisters a mother anyone who matters to you that same sickening silence you dont show yourself make yourself known to me im likely to shoot you you understand that i dont want to do that but i will youre not coming out of there youre not getting past me bullshit fast footsteps a dark blur from the pile of trash bags he ran low and incredibly fast boldt had only one chance to intercept that blur he lowered his shoulder judged the distance and charged behind a loud scream meant to distract the kid they made contact on the far side of the alley boldt just getting a small piece of the kid they both spun like pinwheels and crashed down several feet apart the kid came to his knees boldt lunged toward him and swatted the kid went down a second time boldt scrambled forward catching a gray glint of a metal blade he fired a warning shot as he rolled out of the way and the blade came down where his chest had been boldt kicked out the kid fell back the slash of a flashlight beam painted the opposite brick wall backup was close the kid stood quickly and cocked his arm back intending to throw the knife boldt fired once and missed fired again missed that blade tumbled through the air endoverend and clattered into the brick somewhere in the narrow space between boldts shoulder and head the kid ran five paces saw those flashlight beams paint him with their light and threw himself prostrate into the alleys urinesoaked litter hands and legs outstretched youre under arrest boldt called out making himself known to his own people i not do nothing the kid called out boldt checked his right ear to make sure it was still attached to his head as he reached for the handcuffs this collar was his no one elses chapter whoever had designed the ventilation system for the interrogation rooms had either flunked engineering or had it in for detectives and suspects the box as the largest of the rooms was referred to smelled vaguely of tobacco smoke and strongly of the acrid bitter body odor that accompanied panic and a persons last vestiges of freedom the room was small nonetheless impressively bland and home to a cigarettescarred table bolted to the floor and on that night three black formedfiberglass chairs one occupied by the shackled suspect the other two by daphne matthews and boldt boldt understood the time pressures with police closing in with the ss hana in custody of the coast guard and under investigation by the ins with gang members in lockup the sweatshop would be shut down as soon as physically possible boldt had a call into mama lu lamoia had detectives attempting to make contact with the asian food distribution warehouse owned by one of the great ladys companies but ultimately it came down to a bird in the hand his best chance to locate the sweatshop remained with this one interrogation lamoia had contacted talmadge at home as ordered by boldt to everyones surprise and disappointment it was talmadge himself not coughlie who had come down to public safety to view the interrogation talmadge looked pale and visibly shaken though he said nothing to explain his condition lamoia stood with the man on the other side of the oneway glass watching boldt and matthews work their magic but lamoia wasnt watching the interrogation his eyes were on the shaky adam talmadge for boldt and matthews teaming up on a suspect was like two singers joining in on a duet they had done this enough times to communicate with only body language and voice inflection as a psychologist matthews tended to humanize the event while boldt used the existence of physical evidence to maintain pressure youre in some kind of trouble boldt said to the kid he was a chinese youth in his late teens early twenties with a neck like a water buffalo and pinprick eyes his teeth were bad and hed been in too many fights angry scars beaded from the edge of his lips the turn of his nose and the slant of his eyes he attempted a game face but the shine on his upper lip and the tinge of scarlet below his ears gave away his anxiety daphne said youre alone in this room and youll be alone in a jail cell but we know youre not alone in this i no do nothing bitch boldt shifted in his chair as if to smack the guy a fine performance daphne reached out and blocked him good cop bad cop sweet and sour as they called it boldt ran off a list of offenses including assault and attempted murder of a police officer the last of which set the suspect to a vigorous blinking a kind of tic that continued to manifest itself well into the interrogation boldt said your priors occupy two and a half pages your name appears on a roster compiled by our gang squad you are in violation of your parole any judge gets one look at these charges and youre gone for good so lets just see about that the kid said you got the sheet butch he said to boldt how much hard time i done he grinned butch and bitch what a pair you are you think you can duck this you think anyone gives a rats ass about stepping in and standing up for you boldt said the kid smirked boldt dropped the bomb early so that daphne could get to work on him were turning you over to the feds my friend transportation of illegals three counts of murderdepraved indifference to life two counts of rape numerous rico racketeering charges this isnt staying in state courts the kids face gave away his surprise perhaps coughlie or someone like him had shielded the gang from prosecution in the past with some money spread around to bigname attorneys or even under the table to the local judges they ducked the heavy sentences and the hard time that wasnt going to happen this time boldt had taken great pains to ensure spd kept this one for themselves after the federal trial after youve been sentenced to who knows how many consecutive life terms boldt continued then youll be remanded to state custody and tried well away from king county on the assault and attempted murder of a police officer daphne cut in like a limber dancer tapping boldt on the shoulder the latter of which carries the death penalty lethal injection boldt said although theres a lot of talk about bringing back hanging the kids shiny black eyes tracked between them like a spectator at a tennis match no way you do this yes way boldt replied you see that mirror theres a federal agent on the other side of it federal prosecutors are on their way over this is political you see nothing worse to get screwed up in than a political case im telling younothing worse everybodys got to look good and the only way that happens is if someone pays the big price and right now that someone is you mr tan what were offering daphne interrupted is to work with you on this you didnt attack the lieutenant in that alley you ran thats in your favor here i ran the kid pointed out to boldt who remained impassive daphne said you did produce a knife and you did throw that knife but maybe you were off balance to begin with maybe that knife just kind of fell out of your hand on the way down you see where im going he didnt see much while mr tan listened to daphne he concentrated on boldt well aware of where the trouble was coming from i dropped the knife he spurted out a welltrained mynah bird off balance she said which may indeed explain a lot and its conceivable might help you present a defense but it wont touch the federal charges and thats really where your problems lie you and mr wong are our only two suspects at the moment one of you was the leader one the follower once we determine where that responsibility lies then the breakingandentering the trespassing charges will be filed along with the rest all of which unfortunately suggest you intended to smuggle illegals into this country we just playing around with a crane man he pleaded to boldt boldt manipulated the truth as was permitted him by the courts police had this one shot at a suspect who waived his right to an attorneythe interrogation after that it was lawyers courts and plea bargains both tan and wong had seen the courtappointed attorney side of the justice system enough times to believe they stood a better chance controlling their own destiny with the cops boldt advised him we seized the ship out in the bay the captain gave up the delancy avenue marina thats a gun aimed at your head pal you or mr wong were not sure who its him man its him whats him daphne said those untrusting eyes tried again searching the two for whom to try the container he said im the crane operator but thats all im telling you i dont know shit about whats inside boldt felt a wave of relief at the mans mention of the container it connected a purpose to the operation of the crane he needed the sweatshops location he needed coughlies involvement but just the mention of that word opened doors previously shut what we need is cooperation daphne said we need the particulars mr tan if youre just the crane operator if youre just a hired hand then its mr wong we need to talk to unfortunately if you cant help us out you wont be buying yourself much of a break does that make sense to you no it dont the way it works the one with the most information for us gets the most breaks boldt said we need to know where that container was headed once it landed and we need to know whos been protecting you she said answering his expression she continued oh yes we know all about it we have someone here with us tonight who is very interested in thata federal agent well bring him on the suspect said lets talk turkey he leaned back and kicked his feet up onto the table in a bold and arrogant gesture boldt was about to reprimand him for the act when he noticed the bottom of the mans boots clinging to the rubber between heel and worndown sole was a small but unmistakable clot of fish scales chapter stevie mcneals final chance to find melissa literally spilled out of her purse as she wrestled for her cellphone in the helicopters tight confines and a city bus map fell out onto the clear plastic floor beneath her feet wait a minute shed instructed the pilot retrieving the map can you fly this route for me were low on fuel as much as we have time for then she said this area in particular she pointed out the area where coughlie had climbed aboard distracting her were looking for old canneries along here salmon bay once upon a time mostly restaurants and boathouses now lets take a look the helicopter veered north turning to the technician stevie asked these binoculars they can see heat you bet body heat thats the idea he answered through a wall no way a window a warm room would mean warm glass which would produce some degree of green instead of blackso sure but it depends but people crowded into a room she suggested big machinery people sweating the kid answered wed get some kind of read on that i suppose listen id rather have that camera that seven has but we may have toasted that thing all we can do is try at the edge of lake union they slowed passing fremont bridge and moving west along the ship canal and into salmon bay hundreds if not thousands of boats of every kind crowded marinas along this stretch some of the boats glowed faintly green through the binoculars holding out hope for stevie she trained the lenses onto the roofs and darkened windows of the buildings that lined the south shore of the waterway the technician used another set of binoculars to view the north shore as they passed over a cluster of brick buildings in bad shape stevie asked the pilot to make a loop she was studying those buildings as the kid said from the back heres something interesting but it isnt a warehouse he directed her up about a quarter mile your side check out the water next to that ship dozens of dark shapes perhaps forty or fifty boats all tied together haphazardly sidetoside bow to stern unlike any of the marinas they had flown over she spotted it thenclear out in the groupa glow of electronic green in the water the binoculars picking up warmth the helicopter hovered thats a lot of heat from below deck the kid said where are we what is that stevie asked pointing out the enormous cluster of shops and boats all tied together the pilot informed her theyre the ones confiscated in drug busts and shit like that the feds auction them off a couple times a year a lot of em never sell they end up rusting out there half of em are sinking confiscated stevie asked her skin tingling as in the feds ins the pilot said dea ins fbi those boats are never going anywhere they call it the graveyard stevie shouted so loudly that both men grabbed for their headphones get me down get me back to the station right now chapter i gotta tell ya lamoia said to boldt as both men hurried down the fire stairs at public safety two at a time im a little pissed at lofgrin for taking so long with that chain seems to me he coulda had something for us this afternoon the chain takes a backseat to these fish scales a winded boldt said carrying the evidence bag containing the gang kids shoe in his left hand while guiding himself with the banister in his right lamoia was suddenly leaping three stairs at a time youth bernies a perfectionist he isnt going to speculate its not in his nature if hes taking more time with the chain then maybe thats in our favor maybe hes got something wouldnt count on it in a perfect choreography lamoia beat boldt to the landing and held the door open boldt ran through without missing a step gentlemen bernie lofgrin said looking up from the middle of his twomilliondollar playground two assistants worked at a bench nearby lofgrins thick glasses leant him the nickname magoo he looked extraterrestrial with those eyes and the white lab jacket boldt passed him the evidence bag need to know if were talking the same fish scales bernie weve got a live one up in the box a match lamoia advised would put him with jill and jane doe i get the idea sergeant lofgrin replied detectives tried to influence the labs findings by guiding and indicating where they wanted the evidence to lead lofgrin rarely played that game though detectives never stopped trying they gave him the room to work and they kept their mouths shut with boldt twice reaching out to stop lamoia from making any comment lofgrin always took his sweet time about it to rush him was to get him talking to get him talking was to suffer exasperatingly long explanations on a variety of subjects he prepared two fish scales onto a glass slideone from the earlier evidence and one from the shoe just delivered he began speaking before the slide was fully inserted into the microscope was just about to return your call sergeant he said to lamoia though his attention remained on his equipment the reason we took so long on that chain that dixie sent over was that we lifted a substance from a full third of the links ran a gas chromatograph on itpetroleum basebut couldnt establish a product identification for you knew youd want it oil lamoia asked it has the viscosity of old oil to be sure nothing automotive the graph was a mess of chemicals couldnt get a clean enough sample for a good read because of its age maybe we must have tried a dozen times or more which accounted for the extra manhours he leaned his head into the microscope and made adjustments on the focus bingo he said stepping aside have a look lamoia moved to the microscope he worked the focus nobodys eyes focused the same as lofgrins thats a match he said excitedly the fish scales tied their suspect to the hilltop homicides i concur lofgrin said the oil boldt encouraged he knew the man well enough to know the importance of this evidencebernie lofgrin always dragged out the really good stuff lofgrin smiled at his old friend letting boldt know he was on the right track grease actually extremely heavy grease used in winches lifts the substance that threw us off was nothing more than sea salt contaminated the hell out of our graphs sea salt boldt repeated grease he mumbled and the only place we can confirm the use of those chains was in the sweatshop ergo lofgrin said in his usual contemptuous tone that sweatshop isnt in any cannery its on some ship a trawler boldt exclaimed an old trawler lofgrin added if were going to explain these fish scales it had to be in operation over twentyfive years ago boldt turned quickly on his heels and faced lamoia call in for backup two cars four uniforms have em waiting for us in the garage where we going lamoia asked the two men already on their way out of the lab youre welcome shouted an annoyed lofgrin he lived for compliments out in the hallway at a full run boldt informed his sergeant were going to do the one thing we should have done a long time ago were going to bluff chapter as stevie agonized in bumpertobumper traffic caused by a series of weatherrelated accidents she left a long voice mail for boldt having no idea if he would ever get it i think ive found the graveyard melissa mentioned on the videos its complicated we need to talk leave a way on my voice mail for me to reach you if i dont hear from you youll hear from me im going to get you the evidence you need she hung up back at the kstv studios she collected a camcorder lightweight and easy to use she was on her way back down the hall when the night watchman caught her with a shout ms mcneal she stopped and turned impatient to her core damn glad to see you security people be looking everywhere for you police and feds been calling every fifteen minutes they lost track of you you had better stay put til i can hook you up with them again theyre all pissed off sure thing stevie said you make the call the man waved and turned into an office stevie took off at a run with absolute certainty that she had found the sweatshop it all began to add up for her the darkness of melissas video that echoing reverberating sound a ship the drive to salmon bay took less than ten minutes but occupied a lifetime she accepted the danger she knew she faced as penance for involving melissa in the first place it seemed only right that she should have to relive melissas hell in order to get boldt the evidence he needed no flashes of her life passing by no nostalgia she had a job to do she was in her element she parked in the back lot of a marine supply store a hundred yards east of the impound area and went off on foot staying away from the waters edge and electing to thread her way through two rows of boat storage that housed skiffs and rowboats and sailboats stacked five high on steel shelving and covered by a tin roof the property included two warehousesone for dry storage the other a repair workshop its northern boundary fenced off from the government impound by a rusted tenfoot chainlink fence that bore ancient no trespassing signs stevie moved carefully shadow to shadow alert for night watchmen or sentries alert for any sign of activity that might confirm the existence of the sweatshop at last she came to the end of the storage and tucked herself beneath the hull of a ski boat from where she had a view of the impound facility dozens of rusting boats and ships all tied one to the other in an unplanned confusion algaegreen lines drooped and sagged toward the water like awkward smiles a graveyard indeed the ships were old ruins of rust and corrosionfishing trawlers small freighters power cruisers sailboats tugsall put into illegal service at some point drug running guns human beingsa harsh and mechanical landscape overcome by decay and neglect she saw no hint of life no evidence of the sweatshop to film a wooden gangway lay on the asphalt next to a barge the only indication of a way up to the flotilla but it would require at least a couple men to move it into place the assortment of boats and ships was secured to pylons where seagulls slept with their heads tucked into their wings see no evil she thought past these any semblance of order was lost the boats tied together at random one to the other in a patchwork of fiberglass and metal and inflatable bumpers most crippled and listing however improbable however unlikely there was a sweatshop hiding among the carnage brian coughlie had chosen wellthe last place on earth one would expect the sweatshop and a place under his professional control the sweatshop melissa reenvisioning what she had seen from the helicopter she tried to locate the vessel rimmed in the electronic lime green of the binoculars somewhere in the middle of the pack she decided resigned to getting out there but in fact the aerial view did not translate well to a fivefootseveninch woman standing thirty yards away from the flotillas perimeter the first obstacle to which was a chainlink fence in junior high maybe when gymnastics had been a regular part of each afternoon but suddenly the tenfoothigh rusted wire fence looked insurmountable crouched beneath that ski boat she heard a steady electrical hum this hum meant electricityelectricity power lines the story slowly pieced together her eyes found and followed a thick black cable that ran down a power pole at the farthest corner of the compound the cable had been stuffed into the overgrowth to hide it but it finally broke out of the bushes where it was tied to one of the massive rope lines that held the ships to the pilings wrapped around the line like a fat snake stevie was no stranger to power cables but as thick as her wrist this one was clearly no simple shiptoshore extension cord this was some kind of major power supplythousands of volts like the one that fed kstvs control room big enough for a sweatshop she thought big enough to follow the camcorder strapped to her she considered her choices the barge was the lowest of all the waterfront boats clearly the more easily scaled but it also offered the most exposure the tanker to the left on the other hand although harder to scale offered good cover and the loading net that hung from its side appeared scalable if not precarious she ran to the chainlink fence exposed and vulnerable the camcorder hanging at her back crossing that fence offered a finality for her once on the other side she was fully committed but there was no moment of pause her fingers webbed tightly through the rusting wire and she pulled herself up higher with each grasp the fence wobbled and threatened to throw her off she reached the top edge a row of twisted wire spikes twice she tried to throw her right leg up and over on her second attempt the cellphone spilled from her coat pocket and clapped loudly down onto the asphalt mistaking it for a gunshot she vaulted the fence effortlessly clawing her way down the other side and jumping the final four feet the camera slapped her back as she landed she froze her knees throbbing ears ringing her cellphone lay broken in pieces on the other side so much for the cavalry but there was no turning back she hurried across the open wharf and into shadows thrown by the docked ships lightheaded almost giddy she felt like a teenager sneaking out of the house a wharf rat the size of a house cat skittered along the very edge where she stood heading directly for her she didnt scream but her body locked seized by fright and she couldnt so much as take a step the rodent saw stevie and slithered out of sight but the experience stung her susu would have said the rat was good luck guiding her that the rat had come to her as a teacher not a threat it was this flicker of remembrance of her former governess that supported stevies decision to do this reminded her of her fathers efforts to smuggle melissa out of china alive and it was there standing on that deserted wharf that for the first time stevie confronted the small glances and occasional touches exchanged between susu and her father there as an adult she suddenly reinterpreted those glimpses of intimate contact realization charged through her father had been in china nearly a year before summoning stevie from the school in switzerland the dread of truth crept into her those looks between susu and her father the occasional tears the reality of the nickname susu had given mi chow the risks father had taken to get mi chow to america the legal adoption melissa was no political prisoner born to parents killed during the cultural revolution all fiction for a necessary illusion melissa was in fact just as susu called her from the very beginning little sister true or not at that moment stevie accepted it embraced it the depth of her feelings for the girl making so much more sense no matter what she believeda necessity perhaps born of the moment no matter suddenly there was no courage no fear no question about any of it she felt bulletproof righteous the power cable climbed up the line toward the ships bow she climbed the net on the tankers side pulling herself higher and higher above the wharf finally reaching the upper deck and the lip of slimy steel she peered over this edge thinking there was no landscape as eerie as something manmade left abandoned the lines creaked and sighed water slapped lazily all around her the electric hum grew perceptibly louder she pulled herself under the rail and down onto the cold damp deck and crawled into the shadow she crouched and hurried toward the bow past ladders and winches railing and line the air thick with rust and algae she reached the power cable and followed it to starboard to where it spilled over the side and down to an abandoned river ferry listing badly to port its stern also low in the water the ferrys deck was a good fifteen to twenty feet below her the heavy cable passing across it and on to the next ship elevated on the tanker she took a moment to look around at the graveyard deck rail stacks and bridges gray decaying steel rust the color of dried blood to her right she saw a steady path of gangways ladders and planks leading one deck to the next out to the center of the graveyard and a large fishing trawler where it stopped below and to her left the black cable ran straight for that trawler looking like a piece of thread dropped from the sky she could see melissa herecould recall the videos excitement stole through her little sister in the distance she heard the air brakes of a bus or truck there was no mistaking that sound she crossed back around to the other side of the tanker in time to see a figure scramble down a steep path through the vegetation to the only gate in the chainlink fence a big man a man wearing a sweatshirt and a hood stevie ducked out of sight chapter mama lu looked like a prizefighter dressed as she was in a powder blue silk robe embroidered in yellow and orange with scenes of peasants tilling the rice paddies her rich black hair was hoisted into a bun and secured with what looked to boldt like an orphaned enameled chopstick and her false teeth shined with the brilliance of having been recently dipped and cleaned there were acres of cloth in that robe and years of wisdom in those agate eyes and she could tell both from boldts solemn expression and his timing that they had problems come sit down my legs tired the apartment above the small grocery was three or four times the size that boldt had originally believed the first room where she chose to receive guests and take her meals was simple and spare for the benefit of appearances but as she led boldt into the inner sanctum of room after room of stunning asian antiques and artwork of jade and scrolls and intricately carved ivory he grabbed a glimpse of the real woman with whom he came to cut a deal you are bothered mr both she observed please to sit he took a velvetpadded captains chair with mahogany arms of lions paws she seemed to occupy the entire love seat where she sat it fit her like a throne you like tea dont you she rang a small glass bell summoning a young woman of twenty dressed in a simple black silk dress and rubber slaps tea she instructed he takes halfandhalf and sugar in his she said surprising him is there anything you dont know he asked we shall see she said allowing a smile he nodded she had such an uncanny way of coming directly to the point without ever seeming direct at all i know about the helicopter she informed him and yes even the arrests on delancy avenue i know that you do not visit an old woman late at night looking the way you do without much on your mind so what is it mr both its bad he said she bowed her formidable head slightly whatever is is she said unexpectedly it is neither bad nor good it exists for the reasons it exists to qualify it is to contain it to limit its undermining potential let us not judge too quickly mr both boldt bit back his temptation to speak too quickly she sighed are you here to arrest me i hope not he conceded the patrol cars she said explaining how she guessed this the press on its way most impolite the tea was delivered silently and artfully a graceful dance of arms and hands and goldrimmed cups of bone china the young woman was beautiful and smelled of lilac when she left the room her dress whispered them quiet again boldt sipped softly and drank a tea as rich as any he had tasted hoping she might say something he finally said i can connect your import company to the polarfleece recovered in that first container if i have to ill use it a customs violation a federal charge this is not your business mr both he said nothing what do you need she added what do you come for the grocery deliveries i am not only person with groceries mr both i know what i know great lady but im powerless to do much of anything with it our system is weak its flawed its corrupt but its all i have its my only tool he added its a ship she twitched we know this you know this i need the locationnow tonight right now ill arrest you embarrass you if im forced to im out of bullets she smiled shocking him my problem is your problem she said if i am the source of this information if that should ever come out i will make an early grave that does not interest me i can get coughlie he said but it has to be tonight it has to be now before he can move his operations you know much she said and if you dont tell me he asked feeling her resistance to actually speak the information he needed if i figure it out myself selfknowledge only true knowledge she smiled again those teeth were perfect a ship he said a trawler an old trawler what does police do with cars belonging drug runners forfeited assets boldt said trying to follow we impound them the court collects any property he caught himself her eyes sparkled forfeited assets are auctioned off he said not if no one wants to buy she corrected my god he gasped another wide grin boldt was dialing dispatch before he even reached the stairs chapter rodriguez waited on the wharf while stevie watched through the camcorders telephoto lens as two men hurried along the improvised path of ladders and wooden ramps connecting the various boats finally reaching the barge these two secured a gangway for rodriguez to use and the three of them then hurried toward the trawler their urgency and tension evident from the shouting they were too far away and it was too dark for her to record their faces or anything they said but she recorded them anyway their route was unexpectedly long and involved the path between the ships anything but a straight line one finger on the cameras trigger another pressed tightly to block the red light that showed while recording she followed the three to the trawler where they disappeared around its far side she zipped the camera away in its case and worked herself down an accommodation ladder that led off the tankers starboard side to the heavily listing ferry below reaching the deck she faced a gap of six to eight feet to the next boat with the stern submerged she saw no other way off this next boat carried one of the planks a steppingstone in the improvised path forged between the shore and the trawler that next deck would put her on the route to the sweatshop she saw no choice but to jump a few feet into flight a fraction of a second into the air she knew she wasnt going to make it she slammed into the adjacent hull reached out and grabbed hold of a stanchion her face took the brunt of the miss her left eye banged up and swelling the black water below invited her to fall she managed to pull her other arm up swung herself like a pendulum and hooked her heel on the edge of the deck she pulled herself aboard the camera following splayed out on the deck struggling to find her breath she took a moment to recover testing the tender flesh around her eye she hurried to the stern and onto the manmade path three vessels later she descended a ladder to an old rusted cabin cruiser she stopped she wasnt alone she smelled the cigarette smoke too late realizing all of a sudden that this funky old cabin cruiser was being used as a gatehouse along the route yo a mans voice called out she had literally rocked the boat when stepping down onto it and the sentry called out accordingly in a catlike motion she leapt from the deck up over the wheelhouse as the sentry made a lazy effort to identify his visitor she backed up facing the stern but completely exposed as first the sentrys head and then his incredibly wide shoulders appeared in the cabin hatch not five feet away from her to moveeven to breathewould give her away she stood absolutely still her lungs filled to capacity her breath held and burning in her chest the blackhaired head pivoted left to right and left again another inch or two and hed pick her up in his peripheral vision yo he called out a second time though more softly kai timmy no answer she prepared to kick him in the face if he glanced back cocking her right leg back in preparation hed never know what hit him again he looked to his left then he climbed back down the steep stairs and into the cabin she listened intently not daring to move a minute passed two she felt the boat move and feared his coming topside again but instead she heard him urinating she crept slowly and quietly to the steep ladder leading off the boats far side and climbed her skin prickling she moved much more slowly boat to boat carefully assessing her situation planks and gangways ladders and crudely fashioned steps the shore grew increasingly distant she encountered a set of six garden hoses taped together water gurgling inside that mechanical hum grew ever louder a snoring beast she marveled at melissas resourcefulness the woman had the footage to prove she had made it inside no small feat the scavenged trawler loomed in front of her now huge by comparison with the other boats around it rising up out of the wreckage of ship decks cabins and stacksa rusting mass of iron and steel out of proportion with its neighbors its joints frozen with rust and corrosion consumed by decades of salt and storm sun and wind a skeleton of its former self huge sections missing scavenged for resale or sold off as scrap its profile a twisted torment of bent metal and ragged cuts she crossed the decks of the remaining two ships staying low and in shadow her full attention on that towering trawler the hum developed different tones no longer so indistinguishable but split into a high whine a tremendous metallic clatter and a low guttural growl she thought her heart might explode in her chest melissa had been caught this fact remained foremost in her mind the big mans arrival spoke volumes to stevie with all that had happened would they move to close down shop she resolved to get some footage drive to public safety and make her case providing boldt the necessary probable cause to involve the fbi behind her on shore an eighteenwheel truck arrived a figure climbed out she crouched and ran toward the trawler she would have to hurry the driver had left the truck running chapter what the hell does that mean boldt thundered unable to believe what he was hearing its a federal impound federal property it is beyond our jurisdiction lacey delgato the deputy prosecuting attorney with whom lamoia had met had a voice that could scratch glass she was plump and wore her clothes too tight she talked behind an ironic grin that leant her an imperial arrogance its an ins impound lieutenant if anyones going to bust in there its them but thats just the point right thats exactly why we want in there ourselves he had checked his voice mail only moments before suddenly mcneals oblique message made more sense she realized the graveyard was under coughlies jurisdictional control i understand that but it isnt going to happen you crash those gates and you lose anything and everything you discover so i have to go back to talmadge right and if hes in on it she shrugged chalk one up for the bad guys unacceptable suggestions other fed agencies do they have access delgato pursed her lips and gave her next words considerable thought us attorney would have to be brought in if you gave him enough evidence enough probable cause he might work the bureau for the raid she added the bureau could invite you along for the ride nothing preventing that yeah it could work i suppose put it in motion he said im going to get a surveillance team in place tomorrow im talking about delgato complained no way this is going down tonight make the calls boldt ordered its late now ill wake him up you want a hundred lives on your hands you want this whole thing to come down to your refusal to make a call to wake someone up fine he said ill make a note of it you had better be right about this she threatened amen boldt said chapter the constant coming and going had worn a trail through the rust and corrosion on the trawlers deck beating a path around to the far side where any opening of a hatch or door was fully blocked from view of land even from across salmon bay because of the trawlers angle in the graveyard there was no chance of anyone being seen using this entrance coughlie had found himself the perfect hideaway the ships deck vibrated underfoot like a kitchen appliance she left the worn route and found her way along the determined shadow on the port side moving incredibly slowly every pore in her body alert every hair at attention she passed one door after another having no idea where she was or which to use and it was only her reporters eye that finally spotted the fresh litter of cigarette butts accumulated around one particular door at her feet causing her to stop and press her ear to this door a confusing rumble filled her head the clatter louder but distant she looked up to see the tractor trailer truck backing down between two rows in the boatyard the trailer stopped just on the other side of the chainlink gate and the air brakes hissed she eased down on the levered handle and it moved and she pulled the door open no more than it took to aim her eye inside the pitchblack foreground was accompanied by a warm yellow light to her left she gathered her courage and slipped quickly inside pressing her back to the cold metal and holding her breath for the benefit of her hearing blood pulsed so loudly in her ears that she heard nothing else she stayed flat against the wall while her eyes adjusted to the limited light and her ears to the distant sounds although at first she thought she was in a room she was in fact in some kind of hallway the yellow light came from yet another passageway at the end she gathered her courage and slowly walked toward that light each footfall feeling like a lifetime her mind cluttered with memory and thought to the point of confusion she fought to clear her head but won little ground conscious thought subverted by whatever process demands reflection at such moments she saw her father melissa susu she saw the studio set at the end of the long passageway she came across a narrow stairway leading down into the guts of the ship an aluminum work light hung from an orange extension cord strung through the overhead metal beam at the bottom of the stairs stevie stood there reluctant to descend to risk putting herself into that light but at last there seemed no choice in the matter she knew enough about ships to know that they were comprised of companionways passageways cabins staterooms holds heads and galleys but to her the trawler was a labyrinth of poorly lit gray steel corridors and steep ladder stairways one leading to the other leading to the next lined with pipes and filled with the occasionally deafening groan of industry the way they all connected seemed somebodys joke for the most part she followed the string of lightscrudely fashioned extension cords and bare bulbs strung at random stretching shadows along the walls and turning a simple hallway into something at once both terrifying and mysterious the farther she ventured the less likely it seemed to her she would ever find her way out and if those lights were to fail when theres nowhere else to go try moving forward susu had once advised she trusted that stevie placed her foot onto the step like a swimmer testing the water then the next step the third down she went into that light a shadow stretching behind her she assumed they would kill her if they caught her or maybe not because of her celebrityshe wasnt sure on reflection brian coughlie had had ample opportunity to kill her to make her disappear so why not because he had missed on his first try the hard metal walls amplified both her breathing and the grind of machinery and thankfully covered her footfalls she reached the bottom where the passageway turned sharply back on itself and she crept along one hand touching the wall to give her reassurance the smells were more caustic here the salty tang of human toil and sea urine and sweat and a bitter taste like plastic in her mouth the air grew hazy and that haze grew thicker to her right where another passageway fed off this one this new hallway was darker and it led to a partially open door that was clearly the source of that sound she felt drawn to it unable to stop herself from entering the darker passageway and approaching that cacophony step by precious step she continued checking both behind her and in front of her expecting someone to jump out and grab her at any second beyond that partially open door was more darkness but the lockerroom smell of women grew more intense and that soundhow could she describe that sound ever louder without being fully aware of her actions her hands sought out the zipper on the camera case and blindly ran it down and around the corners to where the lid lifted open and the camera itself found its way into her hands the lens cap came off the switch went on stevie stepped up to the metal hatch and peered through she jumped at the sound of her own gasp shed never seen anything like it this hatch led to a catwalk landing that hung like an observation balcony out over the enormous hold and in turn accessed a steel grate stairway that turned back and forth on itself descending through yet another landing before reaching the floor she stood looking out over the forward hold of the ship once intended to store tens of tons of fish forty feet deep forty wide and perhaps sixty feet long its floor converted to an industrial plant where dozens of womena hundred or morewith their heads shaved bare bowed over poorly lit sewing machines that echoed off the steel walls into a deafening noise the machinery was crowded tightly in rows the scraps of discarded fabric like a patchworkquilt carpet on the floor the lone asian guard patrolling the aisles with what appeared to be a stun stick in his hand the size of the operation overwhelmed her as did the dusty air and the putrid stink she raised the camera to her eye and began to shoot mesmerized by it all determined to capture it painfully aware that as her eye took to the camera she lost all peripheral sense of her surroundings she moved behind that steel hatch door using it as a shield so she couldnt be seen from the hallway it required both hands and a heavy pull to open it slightly farther in order to screen her from the stairway as well she pushed herself more tightly into the far corner of the tiny landing comfortable with her hiding spot and able to see and film the activities below this location gave her a momentary sense of protection despite the fact that the catwalk balcony on which she stood allowed her to be seen from most anywhere on the floor she reminded herself that she appeared as small to them as they appeared to her and that if she remained perfectly still it would take a good deal of concentration to pick her out up there the recorder counted off its footage in time thirty seconds forty fifty she didnt need much she could make her case by simply matching the images that melissa had shot for hers would look nearly identical and the realization that she was standing in the exact spot where her little sister had stood before disappearing gave her a shudder of fear the cameras low light warning troubled her sometimes a camcorder did fine in such light despite the warning but sometimes it recorded nothing but black she could stop the recording rewind and review her footage to make sure she had captured her proof she was just about to do so when a bell rang out and all motion in the giant room stopped on cue directly below her by some forty feet a man entered the room and spoke sharply in fluent mandarin stop your work line up the women obeyed like terrified soldiers hurrying to form two long lines in a scuffling of bare feet and bowed heads they stood at attention as the rooms lone guard moved from station to station freeing the few women chained to their machines what footage stevies eye remained glued to the camera she panned from face to face hoping to see melissa excitement and anticipation pounding sharply in her chest she wanted so desperately to confirm her among them we are leaving ship at once the man announced groups of six no more no less you will go orderly and quietly or you will get the stick he said hoisting the cattle prod the women mumbled amongst themselves silence this man roared groups of six begin the first six shuffled out of the hold in fast little steps as if practiced in boot camp we are leaving ship at once did they know someone had sneaked aboard had the sentry in the cabin cruiser raised the alarm or was this simply the plan the reason for the semi truck stevie heard the clap of quickened footsteps approaching from down the hallway behind her rodriguezs thickly hispanic voice not twenty feet away and closing spoke with a chilling authority three of them charges go forward two in the back we flood both them holds set the trip on the starboard door you got that only the starboard door thats important he stepped out onto the balcony not three feet away from herso close she could have reached out and touched hima huge man with wide shoulders and a sour smell she cowered on the far side of the steel hatch as he leaned over the rail to watch the work progressing below she knew that smell it was the same man who had invaded her apartment the temperature in the hold was in the low nineties stevie mcneal shuddered he said only the starboard door make sure them others are sealed tight as a tenyearold as he spoke great gushes of water began to pour into the hold from all four corners the cold seawater rushed toward the feet of the women who stood at attention without saying a word that power cord she had followed was strung along the floor like a snake its electricity wouldnt mix well with water rodriguez said with them holds flooded shell go down fast our guyll be the first aboard when they get herehell make certain it trips get em in that truck fast hurry the machines a guttural asian voice objected what about the machines hidden by the door this man went unseen by her he said lose em rodriguez replied it dont look right otherwise with the mud down there itll be a mess we buy ourselves a day at least maybe a week or more thats all that matters he thunk it through im telling ya its sweet expensive not your worry not mine his decision hell live with it maybe not that oriental voice replied rodriguez coughed out an uptight laugh you got that right he turned and ducked through the hatch she heard their footsteps fade down the hallway she exhaled and grabbed for air soaked in sweat huge conveyors hung suspended overhead and attached to the wall apparently to lift the dead fish to the processing area where they would have been cleaned before being frozen while still out at sea a metal wall ladder ran up to them an enormous hatch half the size of a tennis court occupied the center of the ceilingthe deck hatch through which the catch was initially deposited a catwalk ran alongside this hatch as well maintenance access perhaps she could make out only two other doors to the giant holdsteel hatchesboth directly below her one on the ground level through which the women now passed in groups of six and another that suddenly swung open at the middle landing seawater continued to flood the chamber with the hatches left open the entire ship would flood she heard a sound below and looked down to see rodriguez step out onto the middle balcony directly below her again leaning his head over to inspect the progress he was a man charged with a particular task and she could feel his impatience to see it through standing alongside him was an asian with hands the size of oven mitts the plan was a simple one she thought evacuate the illegals protect the investmentand then later let coughlie raid the ship himself acting as an ins agent if she had it right coughlie intended to scuttle the ship while he was aboardanother ploy intended to buy him both support and sympathy and to mislead any subsequent investigations she looked down at her right hand all this time the camcorder had been recording she hadnt realized it too caught up in rodriguezs proximity but his voice had been recorded on tape as he issued his instructions this camcorder had the man dead to rights but it was all worthless if she didnt get to boldt immediately she had to move fast she stepped toward the hatch door but in the process the strap to the camera case snagged behind her on a metal spur and tilted the case over dumping its contents before she could react a power cable a blank tape and a spare battery spilled out noisily onto the steel landing sounding like a drawer of kitchen utensils hitting the floor stevie who reached to catch the contents of the case a moment too late found herself looking straight down through the slats under her feet and into the eyes of rodriguez directly below as the contents banged off the lower landing and rained down to the floor of the hold every eye lifted up to look at her for a moment stevies heart simply seemed to stop she was the center of attentionthe very place she had made the focus of her professional lifeand she suddenly wanted anonymity everything everyone stood still she couldnt breathe the pain was so great in her chest rodriguez too seemed frozen by the discovery of her but then he moved to climb the stairs taking them two at a time and stevie understood she was a dead woman the one thought that flashed before her was that rodriguez controlled these women with fear he and his men were grossly outnumbered to disrupt that controlregardless of what happened to her and her tapewas all she had left rodriguez could offer them only fear she had a far stronger weapon he had twenty or more feet to climb as stevie stepped up to the rail and shouted in her best mandarin little sisters i am with the american press the police are on their way you are free for a thousandth of a second there was absolute silence rodriguez stopped his climb and looked down below but then their cheer arosea unified cry of salvationso loud as to be deafening so exuberant as to bring tears to stevies eyes the women broke ranks and charged the one guard there was a great male scream from within them and the distinctive sound of bones breaking like tree limbs in a storm as a group they made for the one door but as the crowd bunched others jumped onto the same metal stairs that ended at stevies landing and they climbed as quickly as spreading fire rodriguez turned the corner to her now only a few short stairsteps below stevie rounded the hatch jumped through into the hallway and pulled with all her strength the camcorder dangling from the strap around her right forearm the damn door was far heavier than she had expected she knew that to seal that door was to seal rodriguezs fate at the hands of his captives she pulled and pulled one eye cast through the slowly shrinking crack as the huge man grew ever larger with his approach he bounded the final steps the screams of the excited women filled the ship now shrill and electric they came from every corner their feet shook the steel with a growing rumble she heard two claps of gunfire but then no more that guard overwhelmed as well rodriguez had let loose the water but stevie had let loose the tide her final tug pulled the door to closing but it bumped and wouldnt catch and it wasnt until she looked down that she saw the four stubby fingersall broken and at odd angles caught in the steel jambthat she understood the impediment those fingers clenched and pulled despite their pain and then four more appeared in the crack along with a pair of thumbs and he overpowered her with his strength and slowly increased the gap forcing the door back open stevie held on tight and then let go the door all at once rodriguez unprepared for this flew back off balance and stevie stepped forward and kicked him in the face feeling the bone and gristle of his nose give way blood poured out rodriguez skidded face down along the metal stairs his head rising and falling with each step he was caught there by his own captives three stepped over him and rushed for the hatch but the next several stopped and took out their anger on him a woman lifted herself up by the rail and came down fully on his head then used his back as a trampoline the others joined in the fallen man glanced up the stairs at stevie and they met eyes as the blows continued as the blood flowed as the defeat registered dont kill him stevie shouted desperately in mandarin she looked down into those yellowed eyes where is she she holleredscreamed where but the tide was not to be turned back blood was in the air three of the women continued to kick his jaw hung off his face like a broken lampshade he crawled blindly his eyes bloodied and swollen crawled too close to the edge one of the women shoved then another they launched him over the side to the steel floor below where he landed with the final authority of deaths brutal calling chapter boldts initial surveillance team arrived as illegals scattered from the trawler some diving into the water some jumping ship to ship a carnival of terror as only those incarcerated against their will can impart for their reckless run to freedom and their mass hysteria overcomes any and all reason thought or plan the moment those women left the graveyard they also left federal property meaning that detectives heiman and ringwold possessed the necessary authority to detain these women for questioning but it wasnt until heiman thought to discharge his weaponfiring into the air over the water that they gained any semblance of control and by that time as a few dozen of the women lay down flat on the wharf in response to the gunfire far too many had escaped leaving spd the coast guard and the ins coordinating their teams in the largest manhunt in city history the public relations nightmare that arose over the course of the next few hours would eventually bring every member of the brass down to public safety for emergency meetings for his part boldt entered the graveyard as a guest of an agent prins a us customs officer put onto the case by the us attorney at the time of his arrival prins was in possession of a federal warrant entitling him to search and seizure for improperly imported goods the product of quick thinking by the us attorney whose reasoning was that a sweatshop required sewing machines and fabric one or both of which had probably entered the country illegally furthermore customs had its own highly trained heavily armed strike forceto conduct raids at warehouses airports and aboard ships prins and his team including a canine unit followed in behind the chaos of the mass exodus of illegals in a militarylike operation that left two chinese gang members under arrest and two others wounded by gunfire the dogs uncovered explosives in the hull of the ship based on information provided by mcneal an fbi bomb squad was dispatched to assist ambulances fire trucks and every news team and crime reporter the city had to offer descended on the area requiring overtime radio units for crowd control when the third news helicopter appeared overhead and images began broadcasting live over cnn a coast guard chopper was dispatched to disburse them and then to light the ship and the surrounding waters from where illegals were still being rescued people living along salmon bay and the shore of the canal turned out onto their front porches in their pajamas to watch the spectacle despite the early hour in an act of entrepreneurial ingenuity an ice cream truck showed up and toured the streets of ballard selling peach sticks and ice cream sandwiches at one oclock in the morning in police vernacular the raid on the graveyard turned into a zoo scene by the time coughlie and his ins rapid response team arrived a thorough search of the trawler was already under way making for a heated argument between prins and coughlie when boldt walked into the captains cabin where this discussion was taking place coughlie stopped talking midsentence you coughlie said me boldt answered this doesnt have to do with customs sure it does its a sham its a crime scene prins offered for me to tag along and im supposed to buy that im not selling boldt advised him shots were fired federal property or not its within the county its ours that may be but the detention of the illegals their captors and the ship itself are mine sensing a knockdowndragout and briefed in advance by boldt on what to do when coughlies team arrived prins excused himself from the room pulling the door shut why the end run lieutenant coughlie asked what end run why the end run coughlie returned neither man would play according to the others agenda he held up one finger at a time illegals a sweatshop a federal impound if you had a lead you should have called our house not customs not fibi es im telling youim here at the invitation of customs youre here because they had access to federal property and you didnt theyre here because you wanted them to be no matter how you two act it out but im here now and thats all that matters its our scene thank you very much for all youve contributed thats not my call to make boldt said sorry spd is here to investigate shots fired we have two deaths and several wounded my team will do the search its not my call youll have to take that up with prins he showed me a warrant what the hell is going on lieutenant just doing my job agent coughlie mcneal did i hear she was involved we havent interviewed her yet havent interviewed anyone it smells coughlie said it stinks boldt replied on this they struck their first moment of agreement there was a knock on the metal door followed by prins he was an athletic man in his midthirties a sharp nose vivid blue eyes lookie what the boys found he said holding up a callused hand he held a small tape in his handa tape from a digital video camera thing was sewed into the collar of one of the polarfleece vests you believe that shit we might have never found it coughlie coughed his first uncontrolled unchecked moment boldt accepted the object from prins and spun it around in the bad light its a digital tape he held it up for both to see and said this could make our entire case prins said with astonishment we could have looked for this thing for weeks and never found it think of that coughlie held out his hand ill take it thank you tension hung in the air as boldt retained the tape coughlies hand remained outstretched lieutenant he said boldt asked prins about the chain of custody and the customs man confirmed that since his boys had found it it would have to go through their system ridiculous coughlie hollered stepping forward addressing prins he said the lieutenant and i have just established between us that this is in fact an ins operation any evidenceall evidence will go in under our umbrella boldt corrected him we established that it was for you and agent prins and the us attorneys office to work out spds only concern is the shootings and the homicides then shut up coughlie said inappropriately and let me work this out with agent prins he tried to forge a smile onto his face but it wouldnt take resulting instead in a snarl the person who deserves this boldt told prins is mcneal shes been after this tape for two weeks and in all honesty the way it worked out for us in terms of the courts was that although the camera was ours the intellectual propertythe imagesbelong to the station the sooner we get this to mcneal the sooner we all find out whats on there so i sign it off to mcneal to make a copy for us prins said anybody have any problem with that he directed to coughlie who held his tongue we schedule a meeting for tomorrow morning when well all view it togetherall of us in one room at the same time that way nobody gets bent out of shape right okay with everyone coughlies brow knitted angrily his face looked the color of ash he couldnt argue this boldt said fine makes sense to me its ins evidence coughlie objected one more time anything and everything in this ship you want to do the dance well do the dance prins said but tonight right now this is mine im with boldt i say it goes to mcneal so at least we get a copy that we can view on a vcr you want to battle me on this you want to freeze this thing in some property room until the courts sort it out you can do so in the morning but tonight its mine and thats how its playing out well see about that coughlie challenged the search warrant has my signature on it agent coughlie this tape was found inside a ship that is listed on the warrant as a target of that search all of this went through the us attorneys office which isi might remind youis the same office to which you will make your appeal were on the same side we both want the bad guys dont fight me on this coughlies paste complexion went scarlet well see he stormed out past boldt his frustration following behind him like a vapor trail chapter stevie mcneal stared at the image on the video monitor in kstvs control room through the soundproofed glass she looked out on the news set where she had spent the last few years of her life it was relatively dark out there on the set a few overhead room lights throwing out just enough light to keep one from tripping on cords and wires it looked foreign to her this place she wasnt sure she would ever sit in that chair again on the monitor was an image of the equally dark sweatshopthe sweatship as the local news radio station had immediately dubbed it a name that seemed likely to stick darkness pervaded her consciousness as well she felt heavy with grief and burdened with guilt and thought that the station was a lonely even somewhat frightening place at three in the morning a night watchman patrolled the building checking up on stevie about every half hour but it did little to assuage her fears she wouldnt have done any better at the hotel not knowing what she and boldt had worked out sleep wasnt an option melissa was still missing she had not been found among the recaptured population when the clock read exactly am she reluctantly placed the call to coughlies pager and dialed in the control rooms direct line when the phone rang a few minutes later its ringing jarred her and she actually lifted out of her chair despite the fact she was expecting the return call mcneal she answered ive been calling your cellphone for the last two hours brian coughlie said its broken youre at the station i tried the main line a machine picks up we need to talk brian despite her efforts her voice sounded filled with defeat and sadness steady breathing on the other end of the line coughlie said nothing she said we need to talk about this tonight before tomorrow morning before the meeting i agree he said west side of the building there are fire doors that lead into the studio knock but not too loudly theres a night watchman on duty if you use the main entrance your visit will be logged into the computer i think wed both rather avoid that am i right west side fire doors he said the guard makes his rounds every half hour if you get here at thirtyfive after weve got twenty minutes or so in the clear can you make it twentyfive of he said ill be there the twentysome minutes passed interminably she was not only emotionally drained but physically exhausted she checked all the equipment for the third or fourth timeshed lost count every monitor in the studio carried the freezeframe image of the sweatshop floor with the sixty or seventy bareheaded women leaned over their sewing machinesoverhead monitors the huge sony on the wall the countertop monitors used by the anchors the effect was overwhelming magnifying the power of that image manyfold the guard passed through right on time offered her a little wave walked the studio and left by the door through which he had come her head ached dull and heavy a result of fatigue and her battered eye but her heart beat quickly with a combination of anticipation and adrenaline everything she had worked for since melissas disappearance came down to these next ten or twenty minutes and it was this compression of time that rattled her that and the fact that every time she thought it was almost over it came to life again like something beaten but not killed she found it difficult to concentrate to hold a single thought in her head when the knock came it split her head open like an axe she hurried out of the control room down the three steps to the studio floor level and across to the fire doors he knocked again though she didnt immediately open the doors for it took her longer than she thought to find her composure and collect herself she exhaled slowly and pushed the doors panic bar aptly named she thought privately brian coughlie stepped inside even given the dim light she saw that his eyes were bloodshot and frantic as he caught sight of the overhead monitors and the image of the sweatshop he fell into a kind of trance i have to hear your side of this she whispered he snapped his attention away from the monitors to look at her though it drew him back as she reached to pull the fire doors closed she walked past him and toward the control room saying nothing knowing he would follow relieved just the same when she heard his footsteps a moment later he closed the control room door and took a seat in one of the producers chairs he gripped the arms of the chair like a person expecting an earthquake my side he inquired im willing to believe theres an explanation she wouldnt look at him her attention riveted to the monitor and the image there she wouldnt allow him to work on her with his controlled expressions explanation i could tell you what were going to see on these videos tomorrow morning or you could tell me why were going to see it and you can bullshit me or notthats your decision but its late and im exhausted brian she carried that swollen eye like a badge of honor so maybe you just cut the shit and tell me whats going on here im on the video he guessed his lip and forehead shined with perspiration stevie wore a cardigan as the control room was kept in the middle to low sixties do i accept these images or not she asked maybe we had better watch and see he suggested no no no thats just the point i cant afford that i cant have you adjusting your version of the truth to what you see on the tape its not a matter of me adjusting anything until tonight it was a matter of need to know not even adam talmadge knew about the operation i couldnt tell anyone he glanced to ensure the control room door was tightly shut i accepted my first bribe a year and a half ago i laundered their cash and mine through the car wash i documented every meeting every bribe the idea was for me to remain undercover until i had hard evidence against the people actually running things not just the streetlevel thugs it went much longer than i expected adam would have never approved it i still dont have enough to convict it blew up on me tonight that happens but the way itll look now the way itll look if people see me on that video without knowing what was really going on you see if this tape gets out then its a year and a half of my life down the drain my career melissa the count was off i had a tough choice to make i could blow the whole operation and save your friend or i could stay in character and see her as a threat you may not understand this right now but i didnt have any choice i had to weigh the benefits of one against the good of many you killed her listen to me the system does not work you can color it you can spin it i dont care its busted and its never going to be fixed not ever its corrupt its rigged its supply and demand thats all these people will do anything risk everything to live here thats the demand its endless it goes on at every border every crossing every port every airport twentyfour hours a day seven days a week they want in and theyll do anything to get it if we catch them again we slap their hands and send them home within the week they try again new contacts more money another go and if we catch them we slap their hands and send them back he checked the door again the point is we had to chase this thing higher up the ladder i took that upon myself ive risked everything here she said softly you let those women die in that container not true he objected i didnt run this thing i protected it or i pretended to they paid me to he kept eyeing the equipment trying to figure out what device drove the freezeframe image of the darkened sweatshop the captain of the visage she asked he glanced around the small room nervously as if he expected someone else the sweat had returned to his forehead he whispered to her hoarsely if i didnt pass information along then theyd have found me out you told them the police were going to question the captain you know what its like undercover for that long you know what happens to you what happened to melissa i changed the whole operation he told her avoiding an answer when i came in there was no way out for these women no one ever intended to give them their freedom they paid for a new freedom what they got was slavery it was me who got klein involved me who pointed out there was just as much profit in selling them a drivers license as there was reselling them into prostitution he was red in the face and practically coming out of his chair pointed out to whom she asked angrily i thought you hadnt made the connection to the higherups coughlie cocked his head at her like a puzzled dog you know what i think brian i think youve made it all up i dont know if you fooled yourself at first into thinking you were running an undercover operation but i doubt it i think that was your fallback plan all alongto come up with some cockamamie story about a oneman sting i think you slipped you saw an agency swallowed by bureaucracy and a tide of humanity that was never going to be checked you saw all that money and all that opportunityall the corruption around youand you ive documented everything he protested every cent and it doesnt mean a thing if it wasnt okayed by talmadge and if talmadge is on the take how could i risk that youve got it all figured dont you getting people killed accepting bribes you can justify it all she added am i supposed to erase the video for you erase it and forget all about melissa she infiltrated the operation i didnt even know about it until you confirmed it youre going to blame me you bastard she dove at him the chair went over and she clawed his face drawing blood coughlie dumped her and smacked her across the jaw and jumped to his feet he grabbed hold of the cable running into the tv monitor and followed it to the console and began tearing equipment off the shelves frantically ejecting cassettes and tearing the tape from them where is it he roared it doesnt exist she hollered back him freezing him he turned wildeyed there is no tape she said he drew his weapon i want it now holding her hands out in front of her to ward him off she sat up slowly and reached for the console her palm held down a square button okay she said her voice echoing through overhead loudspeakers she pointed into the studio a dazed brian coughlie still holding his weapon on her an exhausted lou boldt stood on the other side of that glass first one then a second uniformed officer stepped out from behind the huge black curtains that surrounded the studios walls all held handguns trained on coughlie she said the tape you saw on the ship a blank boldt arranged to have it delivered it was the psychologists ideamatthews she said your ego would allow you to believe you could convince me to destroy it i was undercover he shouted through the glass i can prove it wheres melissa what have you done with her drop your weapon boldts muted voice shouted back stevie tripped another button on the console i taped your visit brian the whole confession hows that for irony ill probably win that emmy melissa promised after all she stepped up to him where the hell is she chapter in brothel by airport the womans deep voice said on the other end of boldts receiver he knew that womans voice but he didnt bother to identify it by name she gave him the address and said she in room on second floor she not in good shape but she alive best i could do so sorry boldt took mcneal with him and a radio car as backup the drive to the airport was typically about twenty minutes they made it in twelve she just calls up and tells you this stevie said thats it boldt caught himself grinding his teeth and let his jaw hang slack to try to relax no explanation she pressured them into keeping her alive its the only thing that makes sense she has that kind of control and then some he answered and waits until coughlie is indicted to tell us if he hadnt been indicted wed have never gotten the call shes not an angel shes a politician shes buying herself a future break and shell get it but coughlie could have used melissa to plea bargain how stupid can you get boldt said depends on whats left of her how much coughlie knows a jury might not be too sympathetic torture they wanted that tape badly i imagine thats what kept her alive until our friend stepped in these people are not human beings thats the way they think thats where it all starts she nodded shes alive she gasped they drove past neighborhoods where the houses all looked the same and the cars were the same big groups of sameness he felt bothered and anxious another example of the wonderful cooperation between media and law enforcement she laughed out loud you win no one wins he said not ever he pulled the car to a stop a patrol vehicle parking alongside of him the sign said nude girls the twostory building was painted cape cod gray and had enough parking for a convention center are you prepared for thisfor what we might find no she admitted are you gloves boldt said handing her a pair im not wearing gloves stevie replied handing them back hurrying from the car come on boldt produced the warrant but the uniforms led the way inside it smelled foul a combination of air freshener and human hell she had a shaved head when she came in boldt told the obese manager a sweaty man who couldnt or wouldnt get up out of the worn red couch he was drinking a dark cocktail on the rocks he smoked a thin foul cigar with a white plastic tip mcneal took off up the stairs boldt indicated for a uniform to follow her he turned and climbed the stairs himself leaving another uniform by the door no one goes anywhere he told the kid he remembered being that youngremembered the feel of the gun on his belt and the smell of the leather he climbed the stairs heavily stevie opened one door after anotherbare buttocks sweating flesh a salesmans suit carefully arranged on a chair the smell of pot and booze and familiarity the uniform lingered a little too long at each door stevie moved faster and faster nine doors no melissa her movements became frantic she felt tears in her eyes and tension in every limb an ache so deep inside heran ache only a woman understood another flight of stairs she ran now out of breath nearly out of life the uniform lumbered up behind her but she turned to see it was boldt easy he said we dont want to scare her scare her she barked back at him incredulous just go easy he repeated he fired down to the uniform where the hell are the emts get on the horn emts stevie whined now slowing as she reached the third floor boldt handed her the gloves again his arm outstretched be smart he said she accepted them limply oh god they both paused by the only door that was locked boldt whispered she mustnt see anything but joy in your face you understand how important that is tears spilled down from her swollen eye freedom is a fragile thing he said she nodded faintly are you ready he said his shoulder against the door she struggled with the gloves sniffled and drew in a deep breath but the tears would not abate her shoulders shook her throat tightened she nodded im ready she said boldt broke open the door thank god stevie mcneal whimpered running inside and falling to her knees chapter the late october sun played low and soft on the horizon reminding stevie mcneal of the yellow headlights on cars in paris she had thought about traveling but it wasnt right yet for either of them you see the sailboat melissa didnt answer she didnt rock the rocker she just sat there staring out blankly corwin had been good enough to loan them the cabin indefinitely marsh grass fluttered in the strong breeze that accompanied every sunset a sturdy stand of cedar stood at waters edge like a wall she gave melissa a bath every evening before bed like a mother with her child she soaped the skin where theyd used cigarettes to burn her she cleaned the loins they had soiled with their filth but she couldnt reach the womans thoughts couldnt clean there they were trying a combination of massage acupuncture and therapy a woman psychiatrist recommended by matthews made the ferry ride to the island twice a week she said she was encouraged but stevie wasnt buying it for all she could tell there had been no change whatsoever melissa ate though precious little stevie supplemented her diet with one of those chocolate drinks intended for the elderly they slept together in the same bed because the nightmares and sweats could be horrible and stevie wanted to be right there when she was needed the night before melissa had crept across the bed in her sleep and had snuggled up to stevie and had cried for the better part of an hour though stevie didnt think shed ever been awake maybe it was an improvement she intended to tell the shrink about it the word was that she would come back slowly maybe the crying was a step forward maybe a step back stevie wasnt leaving anytime soon she brought her a cardigan sweater and helped it around her bonethin shoulders and stroked her cheek with the back of her hand and said i love you little sister as she did so many times each day love was what would heal stevie knew this she trusted it youre safe here she said a knot in her throat melissa reached up took her hand and pulled it into her lap stevie dropped to her knees tears coming now for this was the first time anything like this had happened it wasnt much granted but to stevie it meant the world she whispered to the woman in the rocker every journey begins with but a single step no reaction nothing stevie started the rocker gently rocking she thought melissa liked that she wasnt sure she kneeled uncomfortably but kept her hand there in her sisters lap the grip weak but intentional she wasnt going to move she could barely breathe the sun became a yellow eye and then winked them into dusk stevies legs went numb with the kneeling and her arm fell asleep to where it was a bundle of needles but she didnt move didnt speak the darkness played out on the western sky and the first stars appeared the first stars are the strongest stevie said nothing no reaction whatsoever as long as it takes she whispered still nothing the moon rose behind them and threw shadows into the trees a satellite crossed the sky stevie watched as melissas dark eyes followed it higher and then she noticed the rocker was still moving and realized that she was not the one driving it ill get dinner going she said reluctantly pulling her hand free there would be other chances to hold hands she would make sure of that she stood her tingling legs barely able to support her the rocker continued to move she backed up slowly across the porch supporting herself against the shingled wall unable to take her eyes off that slowly moving chair a month earlier a rocking chair moving like that wouldnt have meant anything to her she was learning chapter boldt slipped into bed believing her asleep he felt absolutely exhausted and yet his mind was spinning he wasnt sure hed find sleep himself she said theres nothing there where he asked his eyes still not accustomed to the dark the tests they came back negative boldt switched on the bedside light both he and liz squinted he switched it back off you took the tests we can exist in separate beliefs she said theres nothing wrong with that a leap of faith he whispered remembering what daphne had said she rolled away from him but backed up to where her skin met his and together they made warmth he slipped his arm over her and held her close she fell asleep first her breathing stretching out her ribs rising and falling against his arm her body twitched several times and then she was still again her steady breathing the only sound boldt dozed off after a while pulled down by a weighty fatigue the darkness claimed him and he found a few hours peace
