the lamp of the wicked the fifth book in the merrily watkins series a novel by phil rickman the light of the righteous rejoiceth but the lamp of the wicked shall be put out proverbs october just about every door on the top landing of that threestorey house had a hole bored in it for crouching at and watching holes and watching watching through holes it would always start like that you still doing it he realized hed shouted it down the valley which was wide and shallow and ambered under the late afternoon sun it was a lovely place it ought to be grim and stark with scrubby grass and dead trees the reality the actual beauty the total serenity of the scene he couldnt cope with that didnt want any kind of balm on the memories that had brought him out here oh aye a lovely place to be buried beneath the wide sky and within sight of the church tower but not the way the two women had been buried chopped like meat and stowed in vertical holes not for gods sake like that and now he had to turn away with the weary knowledge of how futile this was because there was still too much hate in him what had happened what had started him off was spotting one of those neat holes that appeared sometimes in the clouds as if the sun had burned through like a cigarette through paper and then vanished hed at once imagined a bright little bulging eye on the other side of it and that was when hed down the valley this great madbull roar you still screamed doing it you still watching now he was looking all around in case someone had heard but there was nobody only his own car in this pullin area right by the field gate near the fingerpost after which the field was named one of the signs on the fingerpost was light brown with white lettering signifying a site of historic interest and pointing up a narrow road to his left towards a church that was not visible the one that you could see looking down the field must be the village church where the ashes of the monster had been scattered they shouldve been flushed down the bloody toilet he shut his eyes in anguish get a grip the county boundary apparently ran through the field but he didnt know exactly where shouldve brought an os map but he wasnt really sure what he was looking for didnt really know why hed come except for the usual problem of not being able to settle not being able to stop anywhere for long before it all caught up with him again hed be walking in and out of his house driving to places and coming home without remembering where the hell hed been and then going into his own church and walking out of it again uncomforted and fearful for his faith and still wanting confrontation it was anger that brought him here and hed have to be rid of that before he could make any kind of start if you were dealing with something that had been human no matter how low how depraved it was incumbent upon you to operate in a spirit of consideration and sympathy and love oh bugger that he punched his own thigh in fury thinking about old comrades survivors and relatives of the war dead who had made pilgrimages to battlefields aglow with poppies how much love had they been able to summon for the bloody killers not that this was really like that the pity and the waste oh aye but the evil here had been slow systematic intimate and concentrated some of it ending in this field with the hacking and the dripping of blood and offal into the holes the horror had been intensely squalid and the hatred well there didnt seem to have been any particular hatred that in some ways was the worst thing of all no hatred except his own hed left his car and climbed over the gate near two black rubberized tanks there was a mature oak tree on his right thered been references in the statements to an oak tree but was this one too near the road now he kept his eyes shut listening it was said that no birds sang at dachau but the little buggers were singing away here hed never been able to identify types of birdsong though only the mewling of the buzzards in the rough country where he lived where he lived the countryside was scarred by hikers and by soldiers training not so very long ago this field had been lacerated by police with spades but it had healed now was already back to being a beautiful place was that so bad only for me he found himself patting his pocket in case it had fallen out he knew the words ought to after all this time but there was also a notebook in his pocket with it all written down in case he got resistance something bent on wiping it from his head and he had to read it from the page shouting it out into some dark wind but there was no wind it wasnt even cold he wanted challenge he wanted resistance he wanted to see the gloating in those little glittering eyes feel the watching experience the demonic it didnt matter what else hed become at the bottom of it he was a man and he couldnt cope with it any other way finally in his desperate need for discomfort he actually sat down by the hedge letting the dampness soak through his pants which was daft and childish but it sent him spinning back into the pain it did that at least and it started the memory like a silent film black and white ratchet clickclicking in the projector no stopping it now here he is raging into julias bedroom throwing himself down sobbing both hands on the bedclothes either side of where shes lying feeling the still waxy atmosphere in the bedroom and smelling the perfumed air she obviously sprayed perfume around first to make it less unpleasant for whoever found her if her body betrayed her relaxing into death typical that he feels dampness the dampness by the side of her what must have happened she swallowed a couple of handfuls of the pills and then maybe half asleep thought not enough and took some more another handful she was likely so far gone by then that the glass simply fell from her hand spilling the rest of the water on the quilt and rolling away into the corner of the room where he finds it and then his gaze is tracking slowly around the bedroom with its midblue walls and its paul klee prints noting in the well of the pine dressing table the vellum envelope picking up the glass first though and laying it on the bedside table a few inches from julias hair she mustve combed it first you can tell oh christ oh christ turning away moving slowly towards the envelope until he can read his own name written on the front inside on the creamy notepaper she always used her one constant luxury she never could abide cheap notepaper it says in big looping handwriting that soon becomes blurred ill keep it short shep im so so sorry about this but i do believe there is somewhere else you showed me that and that donna needs me there now she so needs someone to comfort her i feel this very strongly im so very sorry because i love you so much shep you know i do and its only thinking of you and sensing your arms around me thats going to give me the last bit of strength i need for this so please dont take your arms away and please please forgive me and please go on praying for us im so sorry hed no idea how long hed been there when the farmer found him sitting with his back to the hedge staring down the valley at the sunlight over the church tower sitting there up against the hedge like a bloody old tramp with his eyes wet and his wet pants sticking to his arse conceding afterwards that perhaps it was just as well the farmer did find him for now anyroad part one be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour the first epistle of peter foul water it was a crime what he was doing this roddy lodge with his wraparound dark glasses and his whippedcream smile the stories had kept filtering through like foul water out of sludge and gomer parry had felt ashamed to be part of the same profession plant hire was the poorer for shoddy operators like roddy wide boys duckers and divers and twisters and exploiters of innocent people rich and poor mostly incomers to the county that didnt know no better too many blind eyes had been turned this was it too many people even socalled public servants some of them looking the other way saying whats it matter if a few londoners gets taken down the road they got money to burn bad attitude sneering at the incomers ripping them off they were still people the incomers people with dreams and there was nothing wrong with dreams mostly what about gomer parry though would he have backed off like the rest or looked the other way if hed had any suspicion of how deep it went what about gomer just a little bloke with wild white hair and wirerimmed glasses and a sense of what was right and honourable the planthire code digger chivalry no point in even asking the question because the way it started this was just a drainage issue just a matter of pipes and shit it had seemed odd sometimes to gomer that his and roddys trenches had never crossed even allowing for the fact that they operated from different ends of the county plant hire big machinery in a small world but it was happening now no avoiding it on this damp and windy sunday a weary old day to be leaving your fireside and if minnie had still been alive likely gomer wouldve put it off but the old fireside wasnt the same no more and shed sounded neardesperate this lady and only up here weekends anyway a londoner as youd expect londoners were always looking further and further west in the mad rush to get country air down their lungs like it was some kind of new drug rural properties in herefordshire never stayed long on the market nowadays especially the ones that really looked like rural properties even if there were clear drawbacks take this one classic example see what you had was this lovely old farmhouse with a couple of acres on the a between hereford and ross built in the rusty stone you got in these parts and from the front there were good long open views over flat fields to the black mountains but before that there was the a itself gomer put a match to an inch of ciggy october rain sluicing down on his cap as another five cars and a big van came whizzing past and this was a sunday all right fair play he spent his own days bouncing around on big growling diggers but no way gomer could live so close to a main road like this with fast cars and all the groundshaking fumebelching brake screeching juggernauts heading for the m and the midlands yet for this mrs pawson in her tight white jeans it was some type of peace after london oh wed had enough of it mr parry or at least i had we couldnt hear ourselves think any more and i was convinced gus had the beginnings of asthma i told my husband that if we didnt get out now we never would not this side of retirement we desperately needed peace above all somewhere to walk walk pretty soon in gomers view youd give up going for walks being as how there was a good two hundred yards of nopavement between you and the nearest public footpath for half the price the pawsons couldve got theirselves a modern place with no maintenance headaches up some quiet lane but modern places werent part of the dream this was the dream eighteenthcentury a bit lopsided no dampproof course dodgy wiring and private drainage the for sale sign lay in the damp gravel at the side of the driveway gomer reckoned itd be back up in the hedge within the year theyd get their money back no problem at all the way hereford prices were going these days theyd likely get it back twice over even allowing for what it was going to cost them to put this drainage to rights after what roddy lodge had done to it gomer tramped back up the drive past his bottlegreen van it had gomer parry plant hire on the sides and across both back doors in white nevs idea this was you gotter advertise gomer gotter put it about see your ole clients is dyin off faster n you can dig their graves the other side of the van gomer could see the top of the installation poking out of the grass not two yards from the property efflapure stateoftheart sewerage gomer had never even heard of an efflapure before nev was likely right about him losing touch he was well out of touch with the kind of ripoff junk getting unloaded on city folk who thought all they had to do was flush the lavvy and the council did the rest as for where lodge had put it unbloodybelievable mr lodge showed us several brochures mrs pawson had told him earlier and gave us the telephone numbers of two other people whod had these particular models installed phone em did you mrs pawson hadnt even looked embarrassed oh we had far too much to think about woulder made no difference anyway gomer conceded both be stooges see friends of his telling you you couldnt get no finer system anywhere in the country load of ole wallop he started scratting about in the fallen leaves uncovering a meterthing under an aluminium shield with another one like it inside the house to tell you where the shit level in the processing tank was at waste of time and money folk had got along happily for centuries without knowing where their shit level was at presently out she came again under a big red and yellow golfing umbrella so whats the actual verdict mr parry attractivelooking lady mind in her sharpfaced way fortyish and a few inches taller than gomer but werent they all you wannit straight gomer took out his ciggy mrs pawson was looking at it like hed got a bonfire going with piles of old tyres she took a step back its the reason we came to you mr parry our surveyor said that you of all people would indeed give it to us straight gomer nodded this surveyor darren booth he was a reputable boy hed said these pawsons could be looking at trouble and he wasnt wrong gomer looked over at the efflapure blinking through his rainblobbed glasses all your grounds to the far side of the house ennit that orchard we did try to acquire some more but and how fars he from the house gomer nodded at the efflapure four foot five foot buggerall distance ennit you dont do that see mrs p shouldve been set back that thing well bloody back likely lodge done it this way to save a few yards o pipe and having to go into the old orchard mess with roots and stuff but you never digs it in that close to a house specially we specifically mrs pawson all but stamped her nice clean trainer in the mud we specifically told him that cost was not an issue ah gomer waved a hand some folk theyd cut corners for the sake of it dont reckon hedve passed on no savings to you mind so er holding back a bit because this wasnt good what exackly did young darren say could happen he didnt mrs pawson shivered under her umbrella he just said it could become a problem and advised us to get a second opinion and he suggested you as as the most honest contractor he knew for heavens sake mr parry what does it mean staring at him all wildeyed she was up here on her own this weekend husband still in london kiddie with the nanny and she was finding out in the mud and the rain and the wind how country life wasnt always a bowl of cherries she looked thin and lost under the big brolly in her white jeans and her clean trainers and gomer felt sorry for her he sighed nobody liked jobs like this where you had to clean up after another outfit but this time it was roddy lodge and roddy lodge had it coming to him he went over to the house wall no way you could be entirely sure see but see this bit of a crack in the stonework is that new sure tbe what hes done see is dug isself a nice pit for this article eight nine feet down right up against the ole foundations youre saying her jaw trembling it could cause the house to collapse gomer thought about this pushing back his cap well he said not all the house they agreed it needed moving this efflapure to a safer location if you accepted that such an object was actually needed at all see i wouldntve advised you to get one o them fancy things gomer said wasteo money my view of it you got a nice gentle slope to the ground there needs a simpler tank and a soakaway like there was before primitive mabbe but he works and he goes on workin no problems no fancy meters to keep checking low maintenance no renewable parts get him emptied every year or two then forget all about him tried and tested see mrs p tried and tested a gust of wind snatched at the brolly mrs pawson huffed and stuttered so what on earth are we supposed to do with the efflapure get your mr lodge to take the whole kit back id say tell him what your surveyor said hell know darren booth see know how he puts isself around the county talks to the right people so if you and your husband puts it over to lodge tackfullike that it wouldnt look so good if it got out hed been cutting corners to save isself a few quid youd have most of your money back off him pretty quick id say gomer nodded seriously figuring this was good advice at least let lodge know there were a few folk onto his games who was it told you to go to the feller in the first place you dont mind me askin he she brought out some folded paper from a back pocket of her jeans and handed it to gomer somebody pushed this leaflet through the letter box gomer opened it out there was a drawing on the front of a rosesroundthedoor tudor cottage cartoon man in a doubletthing with a ruffle round his neck and a cartoon woman in a long frock and an oldfashioned headdress they both had big clothespegs on their noses underneath the drawing it said in days of olde days before efflapure gomer tried not to wince mrs pawson said in a panicky voice it was a local firm we thought gomer shook his head not what id call a firm exackly lodge he operates out of a yard back of rossonwye what ive yeard with a coupler parttimers on sickness benefit but hes an authorized agent for for efflapure agent for more dodgy outfits than you can shake a stick at gomer said so you you know him well i knows of him seen him around roddy with his baseball cap and his wraparound dark glasses roddy and his big whippedcream smile can you mrs pawson gripped the shaft of the umbrella with both hands knuckles white can you take it away me you could probably make some money out of it couldnt you well gomer scratched his cheek there are places one o these might be suitable working farm light industrial mabbe we could likely come to an arrangement but i gotter say youd be better off going back to this lodge and no her whole body aquiver now i dont want that i dont want him here again traffic swished past all mixed in with the wind there was a sudden thump in the leaves near their feet gomer saw that a big ripe bramley had tumbled from one of the trees but mrs pawson jumped and looked behind her like it could be something a deal bigger than that now she was actually clutching his arm the umbrella all over the place mr parry how soon could you do it you sure you dont wanner talk this over with your husband how soon well you wont be yere will you less its a weekend it doesnt matter whether were here or not could you do it tomorrow tomorrow gomer was more than doubtful id have to put it to nev my nephew my partner in the business look mrs pawson said teeth gritted shivering seriously now i just want it out of the way were new to the area and we made a mistake it was a mistake and were paying for it i want it out and i dont want him doing it do you understand likely this was when gomer should have spotted something the look on her face this kind of well fear really no getting round that the upanddown of it was that he was sorry for this london woman alone in her farmhouse with no farm attached husband likely bored with it already smartlooking educated woman washed up here marooned in the flat fields with the traffic blasting past after what happened hed often think what else he might have said how else he couldve handled it like stalling a while taking advice checking roddy out a bit more but what was to check out what else was there to know about an operator a wide boy a conman a ducker and diver a bit of a poser please mrs pawson said gomer wished he knew what else was bothering her but he figured she was never going to tell him he nodded all right then what else could he say tuesday what about tuesday it didnt feel right even then pressure sometimes you just wanted to shake her you wanted to get her into a corner and scream why dont you just get on with it you are a mature woman you are unmarried like being a priest is supposed to condition your hormonal responses or something its the only life youve got for christs sake whatever else you might think jane was leaning forward across the kitchen table making no secret about trying to listen it was getting dark now in the big beamed kitchen and mum was partly in shadow standing in the corner by the door taking the call on the cordless she looked very small but quite ghostly in her grey alb her expression hadnt changed normally when she picked up the phone and found out who was on the line shed react like smile in relief look curious or maybe grimace like shed instinctively make a face if it was say the bishop or worse uncle ted the fact that there was no reaction at all this time meant that she was working seriously hard at concealing something she didnt want jane to know about most of the time mum was an open book and it wasnt by proust or joyce or anybody difficult so it was jane who made the face like was this ridiculous or what ok fine lets leave it at that mum said and stubbed out the line she put the cordless on the dresser and stood looking at it for a fraction too long before turning back to look into the room in the lamplight her face was soft and in the long linen alb she looked for a moment like a little girl waiting to go to bed just needed the teddy cold call jane raised both eyebrows emma from everest stacey from staybright mum came back to the table she did look tired well it had to be getting her down this bobbing and weaving covering her tracks you dont have to do this you know mum not with me what now an expression wariness im on your side i like lol i mean in other circumstances like not involving my ageing parent the twentysomething age gap between him and me would be as nothing but you know if i cant have him what im saying is if you want to arrange a little tryst you have my blessing and er jabbing a thumb towards the ceiling his too id guess hes not inhuman presumably jane sat back arms folded for a moment mum was almost smiling then she said brusquely dont you have homework done it double free period this afternoon however if thats code for you want me to leave the room so you can call back exchange a few steamy intimacies id be happy to dont push it flower mum said mildly push it jesus if anybody ever needed a good push jane subsided into her chair drumming her fingers on the refectory table this was not the time look at the time mum closed her eyes the childlike bit dropping away she was thirtyseven now no getting around that heading for the rapid slide into cronehood with her prospect of happiness which had seemed so close receding again parish meeting at halfseven and we havent eaten yet not a problem jane stood up why dont i go down the chippy i thought you were boycotting the chippy theyre now claiming theyve stopped using animal fat i can live with that would you mum looked grateful dragging her bag from the dresser pulling out her purse you want mushy peas too jane asked after the kid had left merrily went into the sculleryoffice closed the door switched on the anglepoise and sat down pulling her black woolly cardigan over her alb she thought about calling lol back but then parish meeting income cash flow pressure phoned huw owen instead you know everything she said what line do i take on a mobilephone mast in the spire huw said cold over there is it not by your criteria huws rectory was well up in the brecon beacons above the snowline where spring and autumn would wave to each other from either side of july i were only thinking about you earlier he said you and your rock star serious is it or just a fling rock star a touch of irony there she didnt rise to it were permitted flings now merrily huw said these are the days of sexchange clergy transvestite clergy bondage clergy cocaine clergy id say as long as it doesnt involve alsatian dogs whats bernie dunmores view up to the individual conscience between the individual and god nice you can tell why he made bishop and whats god say he says to get on with it or janell be back with the chips she pictured huw slumped shoeless and shaggyhaired in front of his fire of coal and logs the uncurtained window a cold blue square in the whitewashed wall from the edge of his sheepshaven lawn you could see the site of the cottage where huw had been born a bastard as he liked to phrase it two years before his mother took him off with her to sheffield to grow up a yorkshireman with a weight of welsh on his back huw owen the mongrel come home to the hills merrilys deliverancetutor her spiritual director aye go on then he said mobilephone masts the tips of the devils horns crossing the market place in the damp dusk jane looked back once through the heavy dripping autumn trees the lights of ledwardine vicarage were blurred as though seen through tears and she was wondering about mum and lol and how it could possibly be going wrong so soon all through the late summer mum had seemed brilliantly light and girlish maybe for the first time since shed been ordained twice shed actually worn this provocatively lowcut top jane had brought back from a summer sale in hereford as kind of a joke jane had imagined the skimpy thing lying on the floor of lols loft and was entirely cool about the notion mum had been a widow for over six years now and although the crash that had killed dad on the m had been a drastic kind of reprieve from a marriage gone bad it was time to dump the guilt for ever it had to be guilt didnt it mum had always been good at guilt on any level during the summer lol had written this song the cure of souls about the problem women priests might have loving god while also loving a man which was only a problem if you believed that god was a man if you believed that god was anything and if this thing this faith in something unknowable unprovable and very possibly bollocks was likely to screw it up for mum and lol there was no way jane could live with that like even if she had to stand out here in the square and publicly burn bibles on the cobbles the violence of the thought disturbed her a little pulling her beret down over her headphones she switched on the super furries rings around the world to blow it all away crossing now into church street with its lamplit black and white façades moving under the dimly lit windows of the former cassidys country kitchen at least the cassidys had tried to serve traditional local produce whereas now the place was charging an arm and a leg for two bits of squidge cradled in a red lettuce leaf gourmets were said to travel from three counties to eat here but local people only ever came once probably calling at the chippy on the way home this was typical of the way the village was going with another overpriced antique shop and poor lucy devenishs old ledwardine lore turned into some ripoff designertrivia emporium pretentiously called ledwardine fine art it was close to becoming unbearably chic with coachloads of french and japanese tourists like in the cotswolds at least the chippy was still in business jane slipped into old barn lane where its single window gleamed greaseyellow in the drizzle this year autumn had come down hard and fast like some dank grey roller blind no indian summer no golden october days and too late for all that now she bought cod and chips twice she and mum didnt eat meat at all any more but occasionally relapsed into eating fish after all jesus had eaten fish hadnt he jesus in the right mood would double your catch jane stepped down from the shop doorway holding the chip package away from her fleece jane tell your mother not to be late tonight wont you uncle ted clowes stood there merging with the greyness bulky and stupidly sinister in his widebrimmed mafia hat until his retirement uncle ted had been a solicitor and you still couldnt trust the old bastard he didnt like mum being deliverance consultant because it regularly took her out of the parish out from under his thumb which was probably the only truly worthwhile aspect of the whole crazy deliverance thing jane looked up whats the problem ted in the light from the steamy window his wide face looked like ridged sandstone he hated it when she talked to him like an equal she grinned not the great commercializationofthehouse ofgod storm its a contentious issue ted said heavily and it needs to be resolved before it starts to split the village your mother knows that meaning he didnt want it dividing the everdiminishing percentage of villagers who actually went to church not much of an issue at all then jane converted the grin into a sweet and sympathetic smile ill get her bulletproof vest out of the airing cupboard one day jane said uncle ted youll learn to take some things seriously and the day after that theyll bury me jane refixed the headset better split or the chipsll be cold get a life ted she walked back through the village its windows like christmas lanterns so far this year it had been featured in three nationalnewspaper holiday supplements among the cars parked on the square and taking up enough space for two was this great long blue and cream cadillac ridiculous really soon it was going to be like living in one of those pottery villages that ledwardine fine art was too upmarket ever to sell maybe each pottery village should have its own bijou pottery lady vicar so much more tourist appeal than a crumpled old priest with a frayed dog collar and breath that smelled of communion wine once upon a time huw said wistfully folk believed the world were surrounded by angels wingtip to wingtip interesting concept eh everybody under the protection of vast angelic wings like newborn chicks bit claustrophobic though when you think about it merrily said also the ultimate communication system safe reliable ah right i see where youre coming from but where do they go now the angels no room left up there for the poor buggers with all them signals clogging up the atmosphere radio waves satellite tv daft sods in supermarkets ringing home half a mile away huw put on a whiny home counties drawl darling im at the cheese counter now do we want emmental or smoked cheddar so its fair to say youre against masts then merrily wondered if huw ever visited a supermarket the way she often wondered why no woman appeared to have shared his life hed mentioned one once in passing just the once but shed sensed there was sadness attached its easy money lass he said lot of space doing nowt inside church spires no maintenance costs ten grand a year or more in the parish coffers environmentally friendly too on one level saves putting up them unsightly steel things on the hills but on another level it could be causing cancer damaging peoples brains et cetera a lot of evidence piling up there aye however were likely to get a mast anyway some farmer or others going to give permission sooner or later for one of your unsightly steel things so thats still bad health all round and a spoiled view youd be reluctantly in favour then huw said well no im instinctively against it but we could use the money and uncle teds smart he knows that if he backs down on mobile phones itll be much harder for me to resist his plans for putting a gift shop in the vestry im in a corner huw and the meeting starts in about forty minutes merrily glanced at the scullery window where the climbing rose used to knock against the glass in the night wind although shed pruned it last spring she half expected it to have grown back tock tock tock and the hereford times is hovering because the mobile phone company looks like its one of those about to start transmitting soft porn to newgeneration handsets i dont want to wind up in the papers again stay out of it huw said let the parish council take the decision but make sure you nobble a few of them first politics i hate all that merrily gazed into the anglepoise circle of light enclosing the bible her sermon pad and a volume of the alternative service book in his presence it said on the front erm would there be a deliverance angle on mobile phones transmissions signals all that i suppose thats why im ringing really she heard footsteps on the kitchen flags the chips had come spirits in the air huw said something like that or you could say the spire which should be pointing to heaven would be acting instead as a conductor for all kinds of shit thrown up from the earth you put these things so elegantly merrily said stuff the parish council say no to it lass right something ancient being lost i mean lets face it nobody comes to church just to hear me preach it had just slipped out and now they were all staring at her as though shed blasphemed in public or something whatever you said always sounded more strident in the parish hall the one building in mellow timberframed ledwardine without a soul the hall had been built in its pink bricks and white tiling put you in mind of a disused abattoir its caged mauvish ceiling lights made faces gleam like raw meat what i meant merrily almost squirmed in her plastic chair is that ive never really thought of myself as much of an orator im not always entirely comfortable in the pulpit like who am i to step up there and lay down the law now shed made it worse she looked quickly around the table from face to face aware that she was blushing because it could have been taken as a reference to her private life she wondered if any of them knew about her and lol maybe they all did maybe it was all over the parish harlot well since you ask mrs watkins the chairman james bulldavies looked halfamused my understanding of the situation was that for this short period every sunday the vicar was supposed to be some sort of mouthpiece for the almighty suffused with the holy spirit or have i got that wrong merrily felt in need of a cigarette she also felt like laying her head on the table and covering it with her arms thats a little unfair mr davies the soft mildly irish voice of mrs jenny box drifted like scented smoke from the far corner mrs watkins was displaying simple humility and if that isnt part of gods core agenda for us all then i dont know what is oh gord james bulldavies leaned back abruptly to vague splintering sounds from his carved wooden chair shut your damn mouth james he waved a hand in exasperation anyone object if we drag this discussion back to our agenda or else well be here till the pubsve closed james was chairing the meeting on military lines eight tables arranged into a square you felt that there should be sand trays and little model tanks but it was good merrily had reflected to have him back hed been out of village life for over a year gathering his private affairs into some kind of order now he and alison were breeding horses professionally and upper hall farmhouse was getting its leaking roof retiled in the semifeudal past it had been understood that the bull family fortune should also maintain the fabric of the parish church nowadays it was accepted that the odd crumpled tenner in the collection was going to be jamess limit the church was on its own now it needed more income short and long term sorry merrily said my fault in a roundabout way shed been attempting to make the point that while incorporating a gift shop could be a good idea the parish church should also be available simply as a quiet sacred place that it wasnt only about hymns and preaching it wasnt only about sunday look im not uncle ted clowes raised himself up he looked irritated im not entirely getting this how does running a small shop in the church prevent it being a place of sanctuary no ones suggesting the proposed outlet should be open for business all day and every day no merrily said but the church itself should be within reason but what im really saying is and then she lost the thread the problem was she was still in two minds about this she was all for the church becoming more open less formal hadnt she fought teds plan to lock the doors nightly at six pm hadnt she held out against parish purists outraged when shed let rex rossers sheepdog alice lie on a back pew next to rex the harsh lights hurt merrilys eyes thered been no mention yet of the mobilephone mast maybe ted was thinking that if he could push the shop through without a struggle then he could slip the mast in near the end or save it for a future meeting one even more poorly attended than this with its handful of delegates from local societies the womens institute the young farmers club the tourism association a couple of shop owners had shown up to voice mild fears about competition if the church went into the giftware business but nothing serious nothing likely to cause undue worry for ted clowes and the pro faction i think the point is mr chairman again it was jenny box née driscoll one of the few with no obvious reason to be here who came to merrilys aid the real point is that commercial enterprise would surely conflict with the sanctity and peace that the church must be allowed to provide at all times if i want to go in and say a prayer i may not wish to do so in front of a coachload of holidaymakers choosing picture postcards and jenny box did go into the church and pray alone merrily had seen her several times and walked delicately past with a quiet smile making herself casually available in case this woman needed help no particular response so far and she didnt want to be thought of as courting the newest ledwardine celeb the truth was that while much of the village especially the growing retired faction recognized mrs box from daytime lifestyle tv or had shopped at vestalia merrily had never even seen daytime tv except by accident and couldnt afford vestalia she was faintly embarrassed because the face of jenny box from the start had meant nothing to her but ted was looking pained if you look at hereford cathedral its had a sizeable shop for years virtually next to the nave but not in the nave merrily said and the cathedrals just a tiny bit bigger than ledwardine church and if you do want to pray there you can always find a quiet corner somewhere or an empty chantry well if james bulldavies pushed fingers through his thinning hair if youre talking about a quiet place theres always the bull chapel isnt there merrily said nothing even she had found it hard to pray in the bull chapel again mrs box dealt with it i accept its your familys traditional resting place mr chairman but i dont think im alone in finding that chapel just a tiny bit sinister with that forbidding old tomb and the effigy of the man whose eyes seem to follow you around sorry i suppose thats silly of me james gazed at jenny box as he had several times tonight because although hed probably never seen her on tv either mrs box was magnetic her beauty soft and blurred under redblonde hair just short of shoulderlength there was very little makeup on her pale regretful face but even the livid lighting couldnt insult her skin she lived in a narrow threestorey house on the edge of the village near the river alone it seemed although there was said to be an estranged husband somewhere right ok james conceded surprisingly point taken we require a degree of separation so i think we have to come back to teds suggestion of the vestry reasonable enough size not as if were going to be selling country clothes or picnic hampers or what have you well its a possibility merrily had already thought about it she didnt use the vestry much any more not since the night it had been broken into now she kept all her clerical gear at the vicarage and there was a cupboard in the body of the church for communion wine and stuff i mean i suppose i could spare it but i cant speak for a future minister not our problem james snapped future chap can sort himself out or herself be many years anyway before you think of moving on i trust vicar nothing to stop us sticking a couple of counters and a till in the vestry meantime is there itd need better lighting for a start james and some structural alteration id guess costly but its an option said james at last we have an option thank gord for that well get it costed out report back yes he looked at merrily she shrugged when they came out half an hour later without anyone having raised the possibility of installing a mobilephone mast in the spire merrily wasnt entirely surprised to find jenny box in a brown barbour and a white scarf waiting for her on the cindered forecourt look thanks for merrily gestured vaguely at the hall behind them she felt short and inelegant in the old navyblue school duffel coat that jane had rejected as seriously uncool i get a little flustered in there sometimes i think its the lighting but if i turned up in sunglasses somebodyd be putting it around that id been beaten up jenny box didnt smile uncle ted clowes came over and put a patronizing hand on merrilys shoulder i think youll find it makes a good deal of sense my dear tourisms going to be very much the future of ledwardine we all have to accept that not the whole of the future i hope ted well there is another possibility he glanced warily at jenny box but well talk about that again goodnight ladies ted put on his hat and strolled away a walkover then merrily was aware that jenny boxs expression had stiffened for the first time tonight in the thin light from the tinshaded bulb over the doors of the village hall she looked her probable age fortythree fortyfour crass auld fool an unexpected venom thickened her accent sell his own grandmother merrily said nothing the two of them walked away from the hall into church street and up towards the square the air glistened with moisture and the deserted village centre looked filmset romantic under a mistringed threequarter moon so how much are you thinking youd need mrs boxs voice had softened again without losing any of its insistence for the church well i cant really merrily hesitated it was the first time shed spoken more than superficially to this woman per year say how much per year to maintain the church without the need of this tourist shop it was a serious question and there was no walking away from it merrily shook her head i dont really know what a shop would turn over in a year mrs box stopped on the edge of the deserted square tell me have you asked god sorry for the money for the resources have you asked god erm jenny box smiled faintly indicating that she wouldnt pursue it now directly in front of them the small medieval building known as the market hall squatted on its stocky oak pillars mrs box stood with her back to it hands thrust deep into the pockets of her barbour a firmer tougher proposition than shed been in the hall you were absolutely right of course she said women as a rule arent terribly good at preaching listening is what we do best thats why women priests are so important women listen and so women receive im not talking feminist nonsense but the times come dont you feel that i think we can all receive women and men merrily said carefully they were alone on the square lit by bracket lamps projecting from gable ends mrs box glanced over her shoulder that man clowes what he said about us all having to accept that tourisms the future it makes me feel quite ill look at this place its getting like the cotswolds most of the people here born elsewhere virtually all the businesses owned by outsiders merrily said nothing across the square the lighted panes in the leaded windows of the black swan seemed as comfortably irregular as the moonwashed cobbles she used to think of ledwardine as an indestructible organism that ate and gradually digested change oh i know im part of the invasion jenny box said i cant help that but when i see them trying to make this lovely old church into just another arm of the tourist industry and i watch men like clowes who must be at least half local just sitting there on their fat complacent behinds and inviting it in for shortterm gain i see something ancient being lost and something insidious and inherently filthy creeping in i want to go up in the tower and ring the bells and scream a warning dont you i dont know merrily said honestly in one way i do want to get lots more people into church i like the idea of these villages in parts of italy and places where the church is the natural centre of everything people wandering in and out hens laying under the pews and yet she looked up at the woman she vaguely recalled as a fashion model in the s pale and waiflike then and a little damaged looking like an orphan taken in by vivienne westwood jane had said that once when she was off school with flu shed seen jenny driscoll newly arrived in the village then and a talking point on some daytime chat show discussing fame how shallow it all was on the other hand as jane had pointed out there were few aspects of modern life more shallow than daytime telly i suppose you think im just some bored neurotic looking for a cause to get noticed just say if thats what you think oh everybody here gets noticed the real trick is to be anonymous merrily smiled tiredly normally she was invigorated by this kind of searching approach by an actual parishioner she just didnt feel up to it tonight im sorry i should have got to know you better by now i admit i havent spent as much time in the parish as i should have due to one thing and another like being an exorcist jenny box said all whispery sibilance deliverance consultant is the preferred term these days well i prefer the old word how often are you called on to exorcize people i never have never well ive only had the job for just over a year ive never encountered a confirmable case of demonic possession but you believe it can happen of course merrily wasnt used to this if local people ever talked about what she did outside the parish it was never to her face what about houses you exorcize houses do you occasionally and would you agree jenny box asked that whole communities are sometimes in need of it whole establishments situations whole milieux im not sure what you mean merrily was thinking of last winter and the fundamentalist father nicholas ellis whod exorcize anything you could shake a cross at cleansing the expulsion of evil you probably know that the business i was in when i was modelling all thats pretty damn repellent to me these days and though im well out of it all now its like when you give up some bad habit smoking you cant bear to be near smokers any more you can smell them a mile off and its unbearably obnoxious all the worse because its tinged with this foul desire right merrily was instinctively feeling the outside of her coat pocket the familiar bulge made by her mobile phone and the packet of silk cut and the zippo so coming out here was like going into detox for me but why would i come here youre asking to this particular village to be cleansed no i wouldnt ask that i try not to be nosy all right then why are you here oh i ask that all the time mrs box laughed lightly vicar tell me have you ever had what you might call a visionary experience merrily stared at her jenny box raised both hands i know i know it depends on how youd define visionary oh the clergy youre so cautious these days even the women especially the women we still feel were on probation jenny box regarded her solemnly but youre the future you must know that look id like to discuss this and some other things with you sometime if you have an hour or so to spare i mean not now i can see youre anxious to be off well its just that my daughter no husband though mrs box threw in quickly he died some years ago a young widow remarried to the church it was what people often said and it was irritating it began to rain again which is a wonderful thing jenny box said you were saved she smiled its hard to avoid the old clichés isnt it merrily heard a voice calling from somewhere down church street im learning all about that because im writing a book mrs box said about some things that happened to me oh no big surprise jenny box the heartache i left behind serialized in one of the sunday papers a womens magazine if it was sensational enough if there were revelations mum merrily turned saw the kid running up the street im sorry thats jane my daughter jenny box took a step back and merrily had a sudden powerful sense of something around this woman making small anxious flurries in the air disorientation loneliness id like to hear about your book sometime it isnt finished yet it isnt over you see what the books about those things arent over those things have hardly begun jenny box shook her head and began to move away then she stopped beside one of the pillars of the market hall turning her face to merrily you said we could all receive yes well that she looked at jane stumbling to a stop shook her head with finality goodnight mrs watkins pulling her scarf over her head jenny box walked quickly away across the cobbles into the shadows behind the hanging lamps and here was jane the kids face shining with rain and sweat oh god mum ive run all the way down to the sodding hall tried to call you on the mobile it was switched off didnt want it going off in the middle of the meeting whats the problem flower jane said gomer merrily felt her stomach tighten whats happened shed been half expecting gomer at the meeting the only parishioner you could always count on for support against the village establishment its awf the kid was still struggling for breath awful what remembering the night last january when minnie had had her heart attack the hospital vigil with gomer the final silence of the side ward he came banging on the door didnt know where else to go hed been in the pub and hed had a few pints and he didnt think he was safe to drive so he was hoping you where the rain was coming down harder jane had no coat she mustve gone rushing out in panic drive where hed just got back from the swan ok and when he gets in the phones ringing and ringing the policed been trying to get him for like ages he was hoping you could take him but now hes gone for his van and hes probably way over the limit police its his yard in the radnor valley his big shed mum its on fire the shed with the diggers and the bulldozer its just all on fire gomer parry plant hire burning up oh god hes gone like really manic you know how he gets even if he was sober he wouldnt be safe when was this just a few minutes ago he went tearing back for his van ok hell have to pass this way the village was silent no vehicle sounds merrily pulled out her mobile and switched it on go back home flower ill call you ill come too no you wont ill call you just go home and get dry ok ill call merrily pocketed the phone put both hands on the kids shoulders and pointed her at the vicarage go she watched jane walking across the empty street and into the vicarage drive where the kid stopped and looked back and bar jane bar the door ok merrily stepped into the road and waited a good name sorry she muttered thorny branches in the hedge were scoring the side of the van sorry the problem was that although she could reach the pedals just about the drivers seat was sunken with wear and the heavy old van was hard to control on bends and steep hills when you couldnt fully see over the bonnet especially at night in the intermittent rain on these greasy country roads leading down to the welsh border shouldve gone back for your own car vicar gomer murmured round his ciggy idve waited no she said you wouldnt he said nothing hadnt he nearly run her down before hed spotted the dog collar in the headlights and braked so hard hed stalled the engine gomer parry stalling an engine unheard of hed been as close then as shed ever seen him to coming apart the night minnie died his anguish had flared publicly just once in a twilit street near hereford county hospital before hed subsided into bleak acceptance tonight however there was no sign of him coming down from whatever emotional ledge he was clinging to and the ciggy was glowing red and dangerous between his lips he wore his cap and his old tweed jacket and underneath that a green sweatshirt with gomer parry plant hire on it in white this had been his nephew and business partner nevs idea gomer had had two extra ones printed a serious honour for jane and for merrily whose churchyard hedges he cut whose ditches he cleared and not a penny charged for any of it he even came to church maybe every other sunday but plant hire was gomer parrys religion they dont know how it started had she asked him this before there were only so many things you could say en route to the ruins of a mans whole identity if they knowed they wasnt sayin you know what cops is like plus nobody seen it at all till the whole shed was well alight four fire engines called out that big poor gomer hunched gnomelike on the edge of the passenger seat his wirerimmed bottle glasses opaque in the dimness of the van merrily guessed that what gomer and nev did probably didnt even qualify as plant hire in the strictest sense mostly they dug field drains and soakaways for septic tanks they had two tractors a lorry a bulldozer and a couple of diggers gwynneth and muriel stored in a former aircraft shed twenty minutes away near a longdisused airstrip just across the welsh border where the fire was happening what about insurance gomer oh were insured sure tbe but that ent the point is it vicar no i guess not a couple of years ago gomer had been pressed by minnie into semiretirement and hed let nev more or less take over the business but after minnies death hed gone grimly back fulltime plant hire now it was all he had left ent the point at all gomer said sadly they were held up by temporary traffic lights at roadworks on the edge of kington town centre does nev know ah hell still be out on the bloody piss apologies vicar nobody knowed which pub the bugger was in unlike his nephew gomer didnt drink much at all these days but earlier tonight it seemed hed arranged to see a certain bloke in the black swan about some job or other and this particular bloke was a big boozer and gomer had felt obliged to keep up with him mabbe four pints vicar hed confessed surrendering the wheel tonight of all bloody nights when jane had run up to merrily on the square and said its gomer her first thought had been that hed had a stroke or a heart attack like minnie who would have loved to mind the souvenir shop in the church nobody better except possibly miss lucy devenish whod kept ledwardine lore both of them dead now all the things that might have been everything changing before you were ready like pages of a favourite book ripped out to reveal a different story and new characters you were supposed to relate to instantly the old ones suddenly gone for ever the traffic lights changed at last and merrily drove through the damp and empty small town and out of england most of the leaves around here must have come down in last weeks high winds between the stripped trees you could see blue lights turning in the radnor valley below beating at the mist as though the night itself was strobing no visible flames only these gaseous blue lights and the offwhite misshapen moon bobbing in the mist over the border hills take a left by yere vicar at the sight of the emergency beacons gomers voice had gone flat and keep slow merrily turned into a minor road a fenced field on one side stoical sheepeyes in the headlights and what looked like a quarry on the other she drove on in low gear for about two hundred yards before the headlamps found a high wire fence and two metal wiremeshed gates both hanging open a police car engine running blue beacon revolving was blocking the entrance when merrily wound down her window there was the throb of other motors a haze of headlights and a smell that filled up the van like poison gas acrid hostile a policeman walked over gomer and then he saw it was a woman behind the wheel oh gomer was shouldering open the passenger door couldnt bring that torch from under the dash could you vicar your side the policeman said youve brought the vicar little vicar brought me robbie the policeman sniffed the air around gomer and nodded getting the message gomer would know most of the coppers around here and their dads and grandads too merrily found the torch and climbed out of the van her legs felt weak shed never been to gomers depot before looking around for the famous former aircraft shed she saw only the harsh headlights of fire appliances and some other vehicles and puddles swirling with beacon blue a couple of firefighters were moving slowly around with hoses amid eddies of smoke they seemed to be spraying the earth as if they were trying to stimulate growth and she realized shocked that this was because much of the building must have fallen in around its contents no flames were left anywhere the firemen were just damping down to make sure it didnt reignite she saw the husk of a tractor or maybe a bulldozer its windows all gone gomer spat his cigarette into a pool of rainbowed water and walked away from the policeman towards a pyramid of twisted galvanized roofpanels about ten feet high and wreathed in stinking smoke merrily started to follow him then gagged on a mouthful of the searing air no autumnbonfire scents here this was chemical astringent she doubled up coughing gomer looked back she waved him on pulling out some tissues to mop her flooded eyes when she was over it she could see him talking to two coppers and a seniorlooking fireman inside a steamy mesh of headlamp beams there were other people around another blue light she straightened up began to move towards them and another fireman bawled at her stay back ok putting up her hands backing off the threequarter moon gleamed off the flank of a digger lying tragically askew like a great shire horse with a broken neck gwynneth or muriel merrily felt close to tears she saw the policemen leading gomer back towards the van the senior fireman following them snapping questions oil tanks diesel tank was inside gomer said locked up just the one ar locked up good locks who else had keys gomer an older policeman grey moustache and sergeants stripes nobody else had bloody keys cliff me and nev just me and nev you saying some bastard let isself in cause youd need a bloody oxyacetylene torch to break in yere take it from me fars i can gather gomer there was no sign of a breakin when the fire brigade got here no doors hanging open nothing like that nothing obvious however when was this cliff two hours ago round about it was well away by then cause if you boys reckons this was done deliberate gomer turned to the older policeman a forefinger waving then i can give you a name straight off gomer listen we ent saying nothing like that at this stage a bloody good name cliff merrily blinked confused how could he possibly give them a name was there something she didnt know about something gomer hadnt told her it went quieter suddenly and she realized the hoses had been turned off gomer listen to me cliff said quietly before you start throwing accusations around you seen nev tonight eh nev i never sees nev at night gomer calmed himself down bringing out his cigarette tin all right to smoke is it rather you didnt the fireman said the younger copper robbie put a hand over gomers tin because we cant find him see he lives at presteigne lot of pubs in presteigne you go round the bloody pubs youll find him all right we know all that robbie said we know nevs been drinking heavy lately including tonight depends what you means by heavy gomer said guardedly the thing the sergeant cliff hesitated the thing is gomer nev got hisself thrown out of the royal oak earlier on been on the beer gets into a barney with clem morriss boy jordan on account of jordan thinks nevs after his girlfriend something and nothing as usual but it all gets overheated and we get sent along to calm things down and we strongly suggested to nev that he oughter go home directly and sleep it off stupid fat bastard gomer said only we know nev didnt go home see or he didnt stay home because when we goes to his flat over the paper shop after the fire was reported nev ent there what you saying gomer snapped a glance over his shoulder towards the pyramid of smoking debris his fists clenching merrily saw that behind the collapsed shed a small building was still standing probably because it was made of concrete blocks in the distance below the moon she could see a conifered hillside the view of which the aircraft shed must once have concealed what we want to ask you gomer cliff said gently enough to make merrily very worried is where might nevve gone a mates a girlfriends what you saying gomer turned slowly the blue light flaring in his glasses what you bloody saying cliff morgan some more people were gathering around firemen with their helmets off like a sign of respect gomer suddenly spun away and pushed through them disappearing into a hollow of darkness beyond the milky confluence of vehicle lights merrily found him standing outside the concrete building the air smelled of oil and charred wood she felt slightly sick from behind she heard cliff saying wearily dont let the little bugger go in for christs sake lend me the torch vicar but it was only holding tight to the heavy rubberized flashlight that kept merrilys hands from shaking drawing a long breath she shone the light inside the building to where the water was still an inch deep from the dampingdown and then the beam was all over the place as she pushed her sleeve into her face because of what the breath had brought in with it she started to cough again amid the diesel vapour and the wet woodash was an odour you could taste the torch beam found its own way down scorched plasterboard walls over a dented grey metal desk a wooden chair that now looked like it was made of hollow columns of ash the remains of a wooden partition hung in grotesquely ornate strands like the rood screen in some abandoned church biting down on her lip merrily shone the light back onto gomer standing there with his cap gone and his white hair springing up an unlit rollup between his teeth as she watched he seemed to sag as if what she saw was just his clothes and the living essence of gomer was deflating inside them she let the beam follow his gaze to what had been a mattress reduced now to lumps of scorched fabric and exposed springs and oh god oh sweet jesus like a prayer opening up was that what she was supposed to do at this moment offer up a prayer for what lay on the mattress for the soul that had vacated the blistered split skin the flesh cooked in blue denim and left to congeal the legs burned back to the bone the feet fused into the doc martens by their melted rubber soles merrilys stomach lurched hands gripped her shoulders gomer was alive again and turning her around snatching the torch from her but even when she was away from the smell standing in a puddle letting the cold water seep into her shoes she was still seeing the spindle of an arm thrown protectively across the swollen football face so that all you could make out underneath was the grimace of teeth she heard gomer saying hoarsely to cliff you want that name you want the name now boy denial of the obvious it was raining again the moon hidden cliff morgan said i know how hard this is so if youre not one hundred per cent certain then you should say so his grey moustache covered most of his lips and his eyes suggested that he was more than ready for retirement and frankly gomer i dont see how you can be certain im sorry i think this is going to be a dentist job he offered them shelter in the police car holding open one of the back doors but gomer stood defiantly in the rain rubbing hard at his glasses without taking them off you bloody write this down he was insisting as if he hadnt heard anything cliff had said to him you get it wrote down official boy i wannit in the report black and white i ent writing anything down just now gomer i think youre very much in shock cliff looked at merrily mrs watkins right she nodded she didnt think shed seen him before but he seemed to recognize her dyfedpowys police maybe one of the cops involved in the old hindwell conflict last winter gomer been with you all night has he merrily was startled whats that mean im just preempting other peoples questions mrs watkins people who dont know him as well as i know him right she said of course sorry when a building on its own in the middle of the countryside got burned down at night police inquiries were always going to start with the owner at this moment its a suspicious death reverend cid have been informed the pathologist sent for the sceneofcrime people we dont yet know whether weve got a crime but procedures are stricter now infantrymen like us were not allowed to touch anything any more were not clever enough see all the same youve obviously seen this kind of thing before do you think i mean do you think he was dead before the fire she swallowed she was still feeling sick was somehow still smelling that awful smell like roast pork as though grease and fumes were in her hair she knew why gomer didnt want to come out of the rain the senior fireman said i would think although he mustve been close to the seat of the fire i would say he was overcome with smoke before it got to him i dont think he would have suffered if thats what youre asking he turned to gomer that mattress mr parry has that always been in the back room there ar gomer had his tin open and his fingers were at work on a new ciggy whether he knew it or not boy used to sleep there sometimes when things was bad between him and kayleigh and sometimes not on his own what i heard cliff said mabbe her once locked him out best part of a week turned a blind eye i did he had enough problems back then i never figured he was still kipping yere mind mabbe thered be nights when hes walking into the ole flat and it just comes down on him that herd gone and left him for a biker and a bloody ole squat in cornwall and he just he couldnt stay there gomer stopped rolling the paper and tobacco as if his fingers had gone numb and he stared at the ground merrily wondered how often since last january hed walked into his own bungalow and experienced that same cold dismay but if you was thinking gomer looked up at cliff if you was thinking that mabbe nev parry come in yere tonight pissed out of his head and set all this off by accident or bloody carelessness you can forget it now boy not my job to decide gomer cause im giving you this other name now and dont you forget it gomer roddy lodge gomer said roddy lodge planthire cowboy from up by ross you go over there and you talk to that bastard about this now tonight fore he can wash the bloody oil off his clothes roddy lodge you write that down cliff wasnt writing anything down another car was pulling in behind the police car and gomers van cid i do believe the younger copper robbie said just in time for breakfast merrily put a hand over her mouth what you said to the bereaved usually in hospitals was something like would you like me to say a prayer would you like us to pray together it was not always appropriate merrily drove gomers van for three or four miles before pulling into a layby a mile or so over the hill from kington cemetery overhanging trees were dripping on to the bonnet an allnight bulb was glowing outside a cottage across the empty road as she killed the engine a barn owl glided low almost at windscreen level seemed almost to hover for moment whyve you stopped vicar it was the first time gomer had asked a question since theyd left the yard hed sat stiffbacked in the passenger seat staring through his glasses and the windscreen ought to ring jane she said herll be in bed i dont think so gomer somehow you gonner tell her i think so she fumbled for her phone nev she hadnt really known him yet she had no problem vicar ill get nev to do it see that bloody nev digged a whole trench got called away come back and filled it in and forgot he ent put the bloody pipes down daft bugger bloody sweatshirts never live it down gotter laugh though you gotter laugh be meeting nev on the site at eight say this for the boy no matter what hes put away the night before he ent never late probably because nev would have been sleeping on the premises there was nobody for them to tell immediately about nev his mum and dad gomers elder brother and his wife were both dead his exwife kayleigh was presumably still in a squat in cornwall with a biker and the police had advised gomer not to inform anyone more peripheral until there was confirmation dentist job the quizzing of gomer by a dishevelled detective constable had been brief and routine theyd want to talk to him again tomorrow when they knew more this time he hadnt mentioned roddy lodge whoever he was perhaps just a name thrown up by the shock a convenient focus for gomers uncomprehending anguish his denial of the obvious merrily called up the vicarage number and was starting to get anxious when it rang six times before jane picked up sorry the kid sounded muzzy think i kind of fell asleep in the chair a pause its bad isnt it merrily told her most of it no point in dressing it up jane was silent for a while then she said her voice pitched high and querulous couldnt it be like a tramp or something i know thats just as like just as bad for somebody but it we have to wait for official confirmation flower i just like knew thered be something like this its that kind of year anything that could possibly be bad is always worse starting with minnie what will you do now come home i suppose mum another pause as the wider implications sank in this is going to screw him up completely isnt it its not like he can revive that business on his own not at his age but if he doesnt he wont know what to do with himself hell just fade into we wont let that happen merrily said quickly go to bed this time flower or you wont be fit for school its halfterm of course it is holiday time jane said what fun merrily had been holding the phone tight to her ear and didnt think gomer had heard any of janes side of the conversation at all but when she pocketed the mobile and started the vans engine he turned to her green dashboard lights reflected in his glasses whatever small amount of light was available gomers glasses always seemed to reflect it ent gonner pack in vicar ent gonner walk away never thought you would gotter put it all back together somehow yes kind of memorial would that be for the boy the business went down the toilet we should talk about that put me outer the picture gomer said its what he wanted who roddy lodge well we can talk about that too merrily let out the clutch too quickly the van lurched and the engine stalled when weve got clearer heads when were not so youre bloody well fobbin me off ennit no im not but poor ole bloody parry shock of it turned his mind done his ole brain in wont face up to the truth the boy had a drink problem comes in out of his bloody head sets light to the mattress always been a liability accident waitin to happen thats what theyre gonner say ennit no merrily restarted the engine no theyre not everybody liked nev everybody who knew him ar well thats true thats dead right but it werent nev he was after me he wanted to get at see poor bloody nev he just got in the way gomer cant back away from this vicar gotter take my piece o the blame i never thought see even after what i yeard in the swan tonight i never thought anybody in his right mind would he shook his head but he ent see thats the point ent in his right mind i never really reckoned on that it was something about his voice this time and the realization that he must have been going over this in a kind of mental mist all the time shed been talking at him merrily switched off the engine and then the lights watching the green glow fade from gomers bottle glasses she slid a hand under her hair undid her dog collar pulled it off and put it on top of the dashboard she lit a cigarette all right she said whos roddy lodge demonizing roddy gomer borrowed merrilys mobile and rang his home number he wanted her to hear a message on his machine which if you didnt use the skip signal would relay everything recorded since you last wound back the tape he sat there for about four minutes with the mobile at his ear before thrusting it back at her listen the moon was back in the sky two of them back in gomers glasses animation merrily listened mr parry its lisa pawson im back in london listen im afraid ive had lodge on the phone private drainage for serious countrydwellers there was no other kind you had a septic tank and when the smell got too bad you had it emptied for some incoming city types however having to take responsibility for your own waste could be a perpetual source of fear what if it overflowed what if it all started oozing back up your lavatory in the middle of a dinner party it was the fear of sewage that kept firms like the birmingham based efflapure in business after meeting lisa pawson gomer had spent a couple of hours on sunday evening making inquiries about the firm apparently an efflapure was an overpriced overcomplicated highmaintenance piece of junk that was supposed to turn your liquid waste into something you could safely add to your whisky it would be smoothly and expensively installed for you by any one of a number of teams of socalled skilled subcontractors all over the country mostly cowboys gomer said like roddy lodge of down by rossonwye and somehow he knew youd been to see me it was awful i really think he must be slightly off his head he insists theres absolutely nothing wrong with his positioning of the efflapure and that you and the surveyor are in it together trying to discredit him naturally i dont believe a word of this but please will you call me as soon as you return bleep merrily passed the phone back to gomer how on earth did this lodge know youd been to see the woman somebody seen the van sure tbe gomer put the mobile to his left ear and carried on listening to the sequence of messages no big surprise its so near the main road that place scores of motors going past anybody couldve seen me even roddy lodge isself anyway vicar shouldnt surprise you how fast word dget around in this county no i suppose not also see theres a lot o folk his voice faded she saw the moons beginning to shake in his glasses whats wrong gomer handed her the mobile again he took off his glasses turned away never woulder believed it gomer wanted one and a half mile of track clearin right up to the top of the garth and would we do it for two hundred bloody hell i says theres at least five days work there mr pugh nev i says he could argue it out with you he wanted to so if you hears from frankie pugh thats what its about all right bleep gomer coughed and looked out through the windscreen now that the sky had cleared again you could see the lights of eardisley village merrily put a hand on his arm hed become almost his old self telling her about efflapure and roddy lodge now mrs pawsons angsty voice was back in her ear im sorry this is getting ridiculous hes just phoned again this time he says he doesnt want any trouble and while he isnt admitting that it was wrongly positioned he says hes now prepared to come and take it away and return our money in full in fact he he was absolutely insisting that he should be the one to take it away im sorry one moment muted voices mrs pawson in hurried conversation with someone in the room then she was back my husband agrees that no way should that man be allowed back on the premises so im hoping that youre going to be able to keep to the schedule and remove the appliance tomorrow as we arranged i propose to telephone lodge and tell him that youll be handling everything if theres a problem please call me as soon as you can thank you mr parry bleep merrily lowered the phone both these calls were this morning last one bout two this afternoon i reckon gomer said no problem about lifting the unit me and nev we was gonner go over there first thing but i still wanted to call her back see someing puzzling me why didnt her take him up on this offer to shift the thing isself save em paying me to do it save me trying to flog it for em secondhand didnt make no sense unless she wasnt convinced lodge would give them their money back gomer shook his head moren that what did she say when you called her back her wasnt in so after tea i gets on the phone to young darren booth thats the local surveyor called me in in the first place and darren well you ever met darren youd know hes terrible loud rugby club malevoice choir thats darren but today the boys gone dead quiet on me gomer he says my advice is leave it a while let it lie likely herll change her mind you know what these londoners is like now is that funny or what vicar its odd ar what kind of ole wallop is this darren i says he says he ent right thats all lodge ent stable darren says very protective of his business he says and wouldnt say nmore comes on about how he has a hurgent appointment rings off soon as i puts the phone down it rings again voice goes gomer parry i says ar thats me voice says we dont like the pardon my french vicar we dont like the fuckin welsh we dont like the fuckin welsh pinchin our business youre gettin a warnin tonight you comes south of hereford youre finished gomer parry youre a dead man then the line cuts off that was him lodge held back his number so i looks him up in the phone book calls the number and nobody picks up i reckon he wasnt calling from home see thats how it seems to me now i reckon he was on a bloody mobile from down by my bloody depot figuring out how he was gonner torch it youre gettin a warnin tonight how much clearer you wannit merrily sighed if he was on a mobile it might not be that easy to trace the call and unless you have it on tape course i dint think that much about it only made me more determined to do the job anyway a bit later i was gonner go to the parish meeting thinking you might be in need of a spot of backup see and im going across the square when jumbo humphries rolls up in his caddy says how about a quick one in the swan and im figuring if anybody know about lodge itll be him so jumbo humphries drives this ole caddy ah merrily got out another cigarette i did notice this big long american car on the square that was him bloody ole thing that is vicar does about eleven miles a gallon on a long run you ent come across jumbo got this place the other side o talgarth secondhand motors stock fencing animal feed newspapers and a snack bar harrods they calls it merrily smiled and thumbed the zippo illuminating gomers face seeing what might be small tear marks she lit her cigarette quickly and put out the flame and also a private investigator gomer said youre kidding gomer sniffed ent that bloody brilliant tell the truth but hes cheap checks out stuff for farmers mostly stuff the nfu wont do for free spyin on neighbours in feuds land disputes stockthievin goes around with a video camera mickey mouse operation you ask me but jumbo he thinks hes bloody humphrey bogart hang on this is the man you were keeping pace with on drinks you and he each drank four pints in the swan and then he drove off in this huge conspicuous american limo charmed life gomer said plus he do weigh over twenty stone reckons it dont affect him the same he paused come to think of it he had a couple of whiskies as well we had a good ole chat catchin up you know and he told me a good bit about lodge oh merrily said it was after midnight now and she was cold and tired but gomer was sounding increasingly focused and rational and that was good and if he needed to talk well women were good at listening who said that never mind merrily smoked and listened it had been a rare case for jumbo humphries the one that brought him up against roddy lodge probably routine for city private eyes gomer said but rare for jumbo divorce what hed previously failed to mention about roddy was the boys legendary success with women gomer said hed found this hard to believe flash bastard but not much to look at anyway jumbo humphries had been retained by a farmer from down near welsh newton whod employed roddy for fielddrain work and come to regret it big time first off tools equipment things disappearing a hayfork a stainless steel spade whenever roddy had been which he couldnt believe at first this farmer as he knew the lodge family honest straight religious baptists couldnt believe it was down to roddy this petty thieving so he didnt say anything and then a couple of weeks after lodge had finished the job and left the farmer got word in the pub that his wife who seemed to have made a lot of extra shopping trips lately had been seen getting out of a white van in a layby where her own car was parked when the shopping trips continued to increase the farmer hired jumbo humphries to follow the wife merrily found it hard to imagine how a twentystone man in a cadillac was going to operate undercover in the vicinity of sparsely populated welsh newton and this turned out to be a valid point although jumbo humphries had used one of the land rovers from his usedvehicle lot to follow the farmers wife one afternoon to a disused quarry where a man was indeed waiting in a white van he evidently had at some stage been spotted the van man this is lodge right gomer said jumbo recognizes him soon as he seen the dark glasses so he parks out of sight he thinks on the edge of this quarry gets out his video camera starts creeping up on the van figuring he might film em through the back window get his evidence then gomer got out a rollup and merrily lit it for him noticing his hands were a long way from steady he had two good drags before continuing then just as he comes around the side o the van bloody thing starts up see spins round comes after jumbo big empty space this is the ole quarry yard and jumbos running for his bloody life vans coming straight at him near takes his foot off and jumbo he stumbles and drops the camera van runs over it four hundred quids worth of camera occupational hazard i suppose for private eyes merrily said not round these parts it ent but there was more to come see lodge knowed jumbo everybody does he knowed where to find him where he goes where he drinks that night jumbo comes out the pub at llyswen just on closing time finds all four of the caddys tyres slashed had to call a taxi to get home come back with a lowloader next day to pick up the ole caddy he looked at merrily expectantly see well gomer its one thing running over a camera and slashing four tyres i mean its bad but a major arson attack on a competitors yard involving loss of life vicar you yeard what that woman said on the phone and darren and youre gettin a warnin tonight how did jumbo know that it really was lodge who slashed his tyres couldve been pure coincidence couldnt it gomer snorted put it together vicar darren says he ent stable somebody tells lodge gomer parry plant hires been on his patch lodge goes straight round there and leans on darren then hes on the phone trying to put the frighteners on mrs pawson only shes in london didnt jumbo take it any further vicar we ent talkin about bloody peter marlowe yere no he didnt take it no further he backed off what he says to me he says mess with lodge gomer you ent dealin with a normal human being nmore in what way mental vicar lost it blown it works on his own all night sometimes been witnessed fires from the bloody hip when he feels threatened and he ent scared what he does feels hes nobody can touch him invulnerable ar met that type a few times gomer you are that type merrily thought dismally youre pushin seventy gomer jumbo says and roddy lodge ent even forty dont be a bloody hero that was tonight in the swan look merrily sensed his absolute certainty and turned to face him an arm around the wheel i accept that the guys erratic possibly a little unhinged i realize you were right to tell the police and i think you should tell them again tomorrow ill tell them she turned the key in the ignition tomorrow though lets just go home now she let out the clutch and the van lurched into the empty road gomer was silent for a while merrily considered the possibility that in his state of desolation he was simply demonizing roddy lodge what little evidence there was still pointed at poor nev he knows they ent there see gomer said after a couple of minutes these pawsons knows they ent there cept weekends plus he likely knowed we was coming to take out this efflapure come the morning her said her was gonner tell him right sorry what are you getting at suppose he was plannin to go for that tank isself meantime gomer for why would he do that keep his good name ennit small county vicar man like that couldnt live with folk knowin gomer parry plant hire had come and took away his fancy tank on account hed put it in the wrong place and it werent needed anyway plus also i just figured this wed have one to look at then wouldnt we wed all know what a piece of ole junk it was suppose he was makin sure we couldnt do that job at all by torchin the shed destroyin the gear listen i ent sayin he knowed nev was in there i ent sayin that yet gomer i know this has been a an unimaginably awful thing to happen but is that even vaguely meanwhile he comes for the efflapure isself under cover of dark just to be sure knowing he got the place to isself is that entirely rational he ent a rational man vicar if hes done the job tonight if hes been and took the efflapure thats evidence possibly if the pawsons stick to their story dont matter if they dont vicar we got it on tape on the machine yes i suppose you have merrily drove slowly into eardisley the first village on the blackandwhite tourist trail which ended up eventually in ledwardine at night all dark oak whitewash and shadows the village shed centuries and the cardealers showroom right in the centre looked surreal seventeen mabbe eighteen gomer said no moren twenty what miles merrily sighed to this pawson place right no traffic in hereford mind say half an hour max and what are we going to do if we find out he has taken the tank vicar well know the two moons were clear and sharp in gomers glasses well bloody know legs off spiders so this was what they called the hour of the wolf something like that the dark night of the soul the time of being transfixed by this acute piercing awareness of the total pointlessness of everything and of an utter mindless universal cruelty jane had lain awake for nearly an hour with ethel the black cat on the bed beside her and real life hanging over her like this huge leaden pendulum swinging slowly from side to side in the darkness you might as well just lie here for ever because if you sat up at the wrong time the lead weight which you were never going to see coming would suddenly smash you down again with sickening force this was what happened this was the great almighty secret of everything the moon the oncebeloved moon made fitful appearances amid smoky cloud in the attic window turning the coloured squares between the timber framing of the mondrian walls into variations of grey everything was variations of grey jane felt suddenly almost breathless with horror with the thought that this where her life was now could actually be as good as it was ever going to get felt aglow inside with this bitter rage the understanding that as you got older and your body got weaker the lead weight would smash you harder and more frequently until you couldnt get up any more the way it was hammering gomer parry who was one of the kindest most actually decent people jane had ever known like a grandad to her now because gomer was getting old and old people got ill and they got mugged some universal law setting them up for this the law that said its always going to get worse it was as if shed never fully realized this painfully simple fact of life made her mad as hell at mum this smart stillattractive woman devoting most of her creative essence to the totally pointless adoration of something which if it existed at all existed only to treat us like shit jane sprang up in bed switching on the wall light plucking the payasyoutalk from the bedside beanbag she leaned back against the headboard switching on the phone punching out eirions mobile number ok totally uncivilized time to ring anybody especially the guy you were supposed to be in love in but hed have switched off his phone by now so it wouldnt matter shed just dump something into his voicemail had to say something about this and couldnt call mum without sounding like the little girl all alone in the big dark vicarage hello jane eirion said oh sh she nearly stabbed the no button jesus irene i am so sorry i dont know what im doing like why isnt your phone switched off its nearly one am she reached up in a panic and snapped off the light as though he could somehow see her with her hair all over the place and her eyes all puffy how did you know it was me because eirion said patiently of the solemn pact we made that we would always leave our phones switched on at night so that if one of us was in crisis and needed to talk jane swallowed oh we remember now do we i didnt think we meant it obviously one of us didnt she started to cry im sorry irene im truly sorry im the worst kind of bitch that ever whats wrong you been listening to that eels album again it doesnt matter jane said it was very stupid of me ill call you tomorrow jane eirions soft welsh voice sounded like it was weighted with all the sorrow of his ancestors if you hang up on me now i may have to steal my stepmothers bmw again and drive thirty miles to quench my overwhelming desire to strangle you very slowly all right jane sniffed hard you asked for this right big question am i the only person of my age ever to realize that god if god exists is in fact some enormous moronic cosmic infant who just like sits there pulling the legs off spiders eirion thought about it for some time probably not he said jane said is there a longer answer there undoubtedly has to be a longer answer cariad and probably a good reason why that concept is theologically unsound just dont ask me what it is without giving me some kind of notice and youre really proposing to go to university next year but not to read theology theologys shit anyway i speak from insider knowledge jane just tell me whats wrong could you do that whats happened how do you know somethings happened because you didnt ask me if i was naked right jane said that was a joke i know im not anyway tonight i dont think i even care jane said and she told him why she was alone in the vicarage at one am it evidently knocked him back he didnt seem to know how to react he knew gomer she couldnt remember if hed met nev shit he said oh bloody hell thats the poor guy shit like consider ok nev consider that this guy was just put here this human being was created to be a digger driver to live in the same valley all his life to become overweight to have a very bad marriage to to get humiliated get drunk and then get fucking burned to death thats it i mean thats it irene the nev parry story the whole incarnation what was that about what was it supposed to teach him how is it going to help refine his immortal soul and like dont give me any of that welshchapel bollocks about redemption through endless suffering i dont know eirion said soberly maybe its not something were permitted to understand yeah great either that or its all complete crap how often do you think of that i find im thinking it a lot now no god only chaos youre an emergent atheist suddenly what happened to paganism yeah jane said paganism what did happen to paganism you want the truth sometimes im inclined to think modern paganisms purely and simply about having fun a reaction to the grey studied bloody misery of christianity dressing up casting spells cobbling together phoney rituals that sound heavy and significant and kidding yourself you have like exclusive access to some arcane inner knowledge which i mean somehow it all just like dissolves in the face of real life the fucking savagery of it jane rubbed a wet eye with the heel of her palm she felt cold and barren nothing left to cling to except i wish you were here irene well me too obviously im coming over tomorrow anyway later today would that be knights frome the session oh yeah lol had finally fixed it with prof levin for eirion the alltime rockobsessive to sit in on a recording session i dont even know about that now i dont know how things are going to turn out life just comes at you doesnt it like an axe i was just thinking again is mum living a lie it often comes back to that why dont you have a proper talk to her theres never time if its not trivial parish crap its deliverance stuff and how valid is that really i used to worry that she was in genuine spiritual danger from the unseen world but how much crap is that how often does the bloody unseen world destroy your jane is this the time to talk about this stuff i dont think so au contraire irene its the time when you can see the reality of it in all its stark reality what about your psychic experiences you were always going on about that stuff i think i think we fool ourselves half the time we desperately want there to be something else and our subconscious minds our brains help us out comfort chemicals for a moment she was shocked at the hard croaky sound of her own voice and she like mum always says when everything else fails you just have to believe in love jane stared into the darkness i dont know whether thats a smart answer or just a smart getout she was thinking what if loves also a lie what if theres only sex to take your mind off the shit for a few minutes id better go she said mabbe this was a mistake gomer said as they followed the a a couple of miles out of hereford hitting the open countryside again south of belmont you needs your sleep vicar all these buggers in the parish trying to stab you in the back parish politics im afraid merrily murmured are what people do when life isnt happening to them i gotter be up early too mind gomer said see about hiring some machines for a week or two got a minidigger at the bungalow but he ent gonner handle much she slowed oh gomer got clients they ent gonner wait around gomer thats not excuse me entirely sane nev would want it he sounded like he was somewhere else planet plant hire twentyfourhour service see merrily flicked him a sideways glance if you even attempt to work this week im going to have you sectioned wouldnt work girl buggersd only put me in the care of the community then youd get me back he paused you knows me by now vicar i dont get back to work itll all come down on me she was silent it was true if he didnt keep on in the face of everything hed turn into some kind of elderly person and not the most contented kind this was why they were here now heading towards rossonwye through the squally night nothing to do with obtaining evidence because there wasnt going to be any this was about gomer parry never giving in right he was on the edge of his seat not far now vicar we oughter stop some way off pull off the road like we broke down dont wanner look conspicuous see the traffic was mainly longdistance container stuff widely separated merrily settled in behind a tall van with a sign on the back that read hows my driving with a phone number if thered been one on the back of gomers van tonight the line would be jammed ok slow down now by yere he tapped the wheel and she took the van over the kerb and onto the grass verge braking hard when high bushes loomed skidding on a mud path thats all right girl shove him tight into them bushes ill get out your side merrily switched off the lights and the engine and climbed out onto the wet verge looking around she ought to have known where this was but it was different at night a stretch of tarmac no houses visible on the other side the moon revealed what looked like endless fields just a few tiny lights in the far distance on the nearside a ragged line of unbarbered bushes followed the road around a lefthand bend maybe a hundred yards ahead gomer joined her got the torch yes wheres the house just around that next bend gomer looked back along the verge pointing see that wood he runs along the back but he made no move to go that way as if hed finally accepted the futility of all this realized hed clutched at the idea of roddy lodge as saboteur simply because he couldnt face going home to an empty house a cold bed and an answering machine with nevs voice on it i expect youd be able to tell straight away if by any chance lodge had moved this thing merrily said sure to gomer said dully lets do it then she moved along the verge the hem of her alb getting soaked in the long grass if anybody sees us we can say the van broke down and were trying to find a phone when they rounded the bend the road began to dip and the house was below them a block of shadow it was no more than twenty feet back from the road and looked even closer because of its comparative isolation living here youd hear the traffic all night a restless lullaby entrance is just past the house itself up a little drive gomer whispered all the lands the other side see and thats where the thing is the hefflapure he stopped and looked back at her shaking his head as if he was just waking up bloody daft this ennit something you had to do thats all merrily said naw just an ole man lookin for a whats the word scapegoat cant think merrily said look tonight we youve seen what no relative should ever have to see maybe i dunno maybe we both needed to drive around a bit ar gomer stood at the edge of the a squeezing his fingers together he seemed to have left his ciggy tin in the van merrily pulled out her silk cut offered him one gomer shook his head people thought he must be called neville used to get letters addressed to mr neville parry i thought that too what was he called nevin seaside place in north wales where his folks used to go on their holidays likely he was conceived there merrily smiled and they both stepped back onto the grass as a highsided touring coach swished past towards ross probably empty except for the driver its passenger windows only feebly lit were reflected fragmented in the leaded upper windows of the pawson house but its dipped headlights set up more of a glare in gomers glasses and in the dusty back windscreen of the big digger in the drive all the breath came out of gomer in a rush and merrily actually went cold with shock the digger sat there silently unoccupied its shovel half raised in front its him gomer said drably after a moment lodge hes bloody well yere nil odour after a moment merrily felt calmer when shed first seen the jcb in the drive it had been like the instant when a dream turned malignant when your subconscious mind presented you unexpectedly with an image so loaded with menace within the logic of the dream that it jerked you awake for reasons of mental selfpreservation and then you thought surprised at yourself for heavens sake it was just a truck gomer she said lets just lets think about this but gomer was already off the way hed reacted back at the depot when hed realized the savage truth behind cliff morgans gentle probing about nevs whereabouts only now he had a real solid target he was a man with something to prove something tangible within his grasp before she could think to stop him he was in through the gateway urgently pushing back shrubs and squeezing around the side of the digger and under its wide front shovel which was as far as he got because that was when the nightmare came out of remission merrily must have seen it first a movement from the blackness between the drive and the house and it made her jump but she didnt cry out because it could have been a cat or an owl and then she saw gomer come skating backwards bumping along the side of the digger bushes ripping at his jacket gomer he crashed back into a timber gatepost she rushed to him he was still on his feet but wheezing gomer christ are you and then there was another mans voice uncoiling from the shadows you want some more you want some more matey you come right back now look and touch my digger again merrily gripped gomers arm steadying him he hit you pushed me was all caught me off guard ennit can you can you find my glasses vicar somewhere just yere merrily crouched fingers scrabbling in the gravel but her gaze was fixed all the time on the narrow alley between the digger and the shrubs at the edge of the drive made wider by gomers hurtling body she found she was screwing up her eyes expecting some sudden harsh light to hit them but there was none she could see the uneven roofline of the house and the moving white dot of a plane between clouds she was about to switch on their own torch then changed her mind because because oh jesus because maybe it was better kept as a weapon she tightened her grip on the rubber stem of the torch still patting the gravel with her other hand while trying to rationalize this trying to think of any possible explanation other than that gomers crazy theory about roddy lodge had been for heavens sake dead right the only other explanations involved coincidence one coincidence too many in the gravel she touched smoothness and a wire earpiece and in the same moment saw a man standing at the end of the drive between the tailgate and the house moonlight glinting on the creases of his jacket leather he stood in silence not moving then he called out what you at over there merrily stood up thrusting gomers glasses into his hands ok thats it this is where we leave weve seen the digger we know hes here lets go we can call the police cant do that vicar gomer pushed his glasses on calmly curling the wires around his ears cant just walk off now no good buggers ent gonner believe us anyway time they gets yere if they comes at all hell be long gone we got this bastard cold right yere now two of us witnesses gomer chicken then is it the man enquired no hint of fear in the voice although the words were spoken rapidly you boys chickenshit merrily whispered let it go lets just go back to the van youre right were witnesses its all we need i promise you gomer ill back you up all the way but we need to gomer straightened up bawled out you wanner know who i am is it no merrily dragged on his arm gomer didnt move felt as firmly rooted as the gatepost she let go with a sound she realized was a sob as he started to shout who am i gomer parry plant hire thats who i am you murdering bastard silence merrily closed her eyes squeezing the torch with both hands please god get us out of this she could hear another lorry grinding round the bend in the a and considered running out into the road waving her arms to flag down the driver well well well the man said gomer stepped away from merrily stood there with his arms by his side little soldier little gunfighter merrily shook her head no lodge who says what you done with that jcb lodge ent your business the voice higher now like a fox barking in the night its that bloody tank ennit you took him out pause the lorry rumbled away on the road to ross what tanks that then mr gomer parry the bloody hefflapure oh you heard o that then pause thought they was still digging cesspits where you come from carryin it out in buckets gomer took a breath there might be method in this madness but merrily didnt think so a duel planthire rules and then she thought what if he isnt on his own how could he move that thing without help what if hes keeping us talking while someone else she whirled round the entrance gaped you better ave a good explanation of where you was tonight lodge gomer said you betterve got some good witnesses a moments silence what you on about little man you know bloody cause i dont reckon you knows what the fuck youre talkin about any more mr gomer parry i dont reckon you knows nothin bout nothin ole man well bloody past it clingin on by your bloody old arthriticky fingertips oughterve packed in while you was ahead look but you couldnt let go else you was just doin it to keep away from your ole woman you bas you dont bloody know then roddy lodge just erupted shit you dont know shit laughter like flames in the night this yere tank he ent no business o yours this is my digger my fuckin tank i put him in i took him out no business o yours never was your business you ent got no business boy you ent got business worth shit every fucker knows that knows im number one now look i got fuckin respect for miles round yere done tanks for all the nobs all over the three counties and down into wales i done prince charless fuckin sewage over at highgrove gomer shook you lyin bloody toad i done madonnas fuckin sewage up in the cotswolds i done stings shit down in wiltshire in other circumstances merrily thought this could have been funny surreal anyway gomer she whispered urgently listen to me you were right hes not rational lets get the hell out you go fetch the van then girl ill keep him you bloody well wont you can come with me now whos that with you gomer darren booth merrily could see roddy lodges silhouette almost fulllength now in the alley between the jcb and the hedge bizarrely lodge seemed to be bouncing on his toes come on out then darren take you both on come on out come on boys he sprang into the middle of the drive and started shouting again voice high and rapid and streaked with outrage tried to pinch my business tried to blacken my good name tellin porky pies about me come on boys take you both her dint believe you look her knows what i give her was good knows im number fuckin one and dont you ever forget it mr gomer fuckin chickenshit roddy lodge broke off looked up squinting ent darren is it gomer said nothing if it ent darren who is it i bet its only that fuckin fat mentaldefective you got workin for you merrily could almost see herself as if in a film slowmotion making a lunge for gomer and gomer not being there gomer moving away from her along the side of the jcb thin branches whipping behind him until he and roddy lodge were facing each other in the open you murdering bastard no no no merrily started edging around the other side of the digger it was a tighter squeeze and it brought her up against the halfraised shovel about six feet wide with a piece of tarpaulin hanging over the rim please god meaning what roddy lodge said and she could see his lean body and then his face concave with a jutting pointed jaw pointed nose eyes that slanted slightly a puppet kind of face she thought and he was tense now this was clear even in vague moonlight a sheen of sweat on his face hed run out of banter and mockery he was nervous because he did it she thought he did it she could hardly breathe roddy lodge and gomer were standing only feet apart on a paved forecourt in front of the house if lodge made a move on gomer took one step she would have to go for him with the torch she started to tremble you set fire to my yard gomer said never you set light to my place tonight boy and my nephew he was in there i dunno whether you knowed that but it dont matter he still bloody died roddy lodge stood there taking this in she couldnt make out his expression she raised the torch ready to run out and thats murder gomer said roddy lodge didnt move but something did maybe a cloud because now his face was washed by pallid light and she could see he was smiling it was this big loose smile causing his jaw to drop as though all the tension in him was evaporating in the moonlight lodge said easily you know what parry youre fuckin mad you are youre fuckin out of it it was murder gomer said whatever you say matey lodges voice was quieter now you ent denying it you ent even i ent even talkin to you nmore ole man youre senile fuck off home i would while you can still walk lodge began to move towards gomer not hurrying but not delaying either and whatever he could see now in gomers face it was making the smile on his own grow bigger and whiter the torch felt sweaty in merrilys hand as she squeezed past the digger along the rim of its front shovel trying to transfer the flashlight to her other hand feeling it slip out of her grasp and down into the shovel she expected a clang but it landed on something soft the tarpaulin she leaned over reaching down into the metal maw grabbed for the torch stumbled clutching at the tarpaulin dragging some of it back releasing a curling piercing pungent sweet aroma and her scream and she watched roddy spinning round with all the inevitability of slow motion whos that who is it merrily pushed herself away from the shovel and staggered out into the forecourt shaking hard feeling sick roddy lodge walked towards her across the moonstroked flagstones her stomach was turning over he wore a grey leather jacket tight leather jeans and cowboy boots everything covered with drying red mud a woman his voice rose to a note of wonderment you leave her alone merrily saw gomer parry about five yards away both arms down by his side fists tight glasses opaque gomers voice was weaker now could have been coming from half a mile away she was willing him not to move and all the time her mind was scrabbling for purchase on a sheer cliffface of solid ice it cant be when roddy lodge came up to her the first thing she noticed was his aftershave he must have put it on with a paste brush she almost retched nice one too ent you roddy was examining her as if she was something that had just been delivered to his door very nice what you doing with the likes of this little toerag my darlin the aftershave was so pungent it made her think of nil odour the fluid undertakers used in coffins the stuff the nurses at the general had kept under the bed of denzil joy whose stench still sometimes soaked through her sleep flash image the halfcooked corpse of nevin parry she felt faint with nausea cant be cant be not again automatically her mind was erecting a segment of st patricks breastplate i bind unto myself the name the strong name of the trinity im very sorry about this merrily said calmly im really sorry mr lodge he had his head on one side peering down at her his eyes were aglow he had a luminous white smile she sensed a lot of energy there and even some humour she sensed him wanting to touch her she didnt move away her coat had come open over her chest she was expecting him to become aware of her dog collar then realized shed taken it off in the van she took a breath mr lodge my names merrily the reverend merrily watkins im gomers parish priest ive been with him all night since we first heard about the fire she paused mr lodge im sure you can imagine what kind of effect all this has had on gomer his nephew dead everything destroyed whys he reckon it was me roddy lodge said look her voice felt warm and soothing full of pulpit projection thats what ive been trying to tell him the police the police said nev had been drinking heavily and they think he probably started the fire himself accidentally she didnt look at gomer but she could feel it setting around him a shabby concrete overcoat of bafflement and betrayal she lowered her voice hes an old man mr lodge hes lost everything when he wanted me to drive him here i i didnt know anything about this whatever history there is between you and him i just assumed this place that it held some memories for him and nev or something i dont know what hes got against you or why its come up now but im really sorry turned his mind is it roddy said im sure hell come through this with help im just i mean i hope youre not going to go to the police or anything i promise you ill talk to him come and talk to me you want sweetheart roddy grinned it was a wide engaging grin but separate from his eyes which seemed to have their own staccato light like the sparks from her zippo vicar eh i goes and talks to our vicar sometimes nice feller he unzipped a breast pocket of his leather jacket ent as sexy as you though i reckon hes a bit scared of me tell the truth he laughed a high barking i scared him i did i scared the ole vicar did you told him bout all the things i seen in the night spooky sounds interesting well then merrily didnt move as roddy pulled out a card and came right up to her you come and talk to me any time you want any time and anything you want doing im your man special rates for the church look he inspected her face as though he was committing it feature by feature to memory thanks she took the card id like that yeah roddy said you would indeed my darlin merrily walked away without once looking back gomer following behind like a beaten old dog she didnt look at him either she walked along the side of the big yellow digger without glancing at it or breathing in walked out of the gateway and along the verge of the a with the long grass wet and cold around her ankles sensing that roddy lodge was watching them and so not hurrying not giving in to the urge to run to the pushing in her chest she walked around the bend in the road to where the van was almost embedded in the hedgerow she unlocked the van and opened the door wide so that gomer could climb across to the passenger seat where he sat in silence sagging as if all the lifeenergy had been vacuumpumped out of him she got into the van and turned the key in the ignition and for a moment was afraid it wasnt going to start but the engine caught on the second turn and she waited until there were no headlights in view before carefully reversing the van out onto the road she drove for a mile or so in the direction of ross before pulling off the road into the car park of a darkened pub she switched off the engine but left the headlights on illuminating a hanging sign featuring a rabbit or a hare with a fluffy tail seen from behind merrily needed light she needed to see anything coming she tossed her head back over the peeling vinyl of the driving seat and let the breath out of her mouth and when it came out it was an enormous sob her body slumping into shudders vicar she held the wheel as if she was never going to let it go couldnt you smell it he didnt reply he didnt understand merrily pulled herself up and found her phone she couldnt remember the number of hereford police shed have to ring and see if they could put her through to anyone in cid i stum stumbled gomer grabbed hold of this tarpaulin in the shovel of the digger and it came away she switched on the phone and turned to look at him i know i know the smell now you see from when we found barbara buckingham you remember no mistaking it ever again is there gomer lurched to the edge of his seat in the shovel thought i was hallucinating at first thought it was the shock you know of seeing nev and but it wasnt the same this one was putrid state of decay merrily stabbed three times later she would have to call jane and explain why she might not be home until dawn or later part two his intelligence was born in the fields and woods on the very edge of gloucestershire and herefordshire honed in the thickets of the countryside nurtured in a world where it was sometimes safer to kill a man than to kill a hare geoffrey wansell an evil love phobia the woman in lols bed smiled sleepily an arm came out a long warm forefinger touching his lips as he bent down before you say a word she said i will tell you right now from the bottom of ma heart that it was very very good looking into his eyes now and slithering up in the rumpled bed like a mermaid breaking surface and also right right for this moment what i so much needed ok lol sighed ok laurence she took away her finger but stilled him with her gaze even though one eye was lost under this tumble of black hair with the long pale streak like a vein of silver in onyx ah well you were good lol straightened up you were wonderful me he shrugged spread his hands did all this stuff that he was afraid was going to look deliberately self deprecating uncomfortable now he looked away out of the lefthand window where the midmorning sky over knights frome was grey and shiny with unshed rain it made the window seem like a square of tin plate in the wall of freshly plastered rubblestone aye all right she swung her legs out of bed if you push me ill concede that good was maybe just faintly inappropriate but right was right see i was with this young guy before doesnae matter who these kidsre ten a penny believe me slick cool deft and empty you know awful proficient sure but proficiency isnae even halfway there especially when its like received technique out of jansch out of thompson john fahey whoever in addition i was getting well fed up with him trying to get into ma knickers like merrily she wore a long tshirt in bed this one worn thin from many washings the faded figure on it with the top hat seemed at one time to have been bugs bunny like i should be grateful to him for being fifteen years younger you know moira said jesus the arrogance of these guys she stretched and the tshirt rode up and through the thin cotton lol saw her nipples over the rabbit ears he backed up embarrassed catching the edge of the tea tray which rattled like im some hag moira said she was sitting on the edge of the bed her hair almost reaching the duvet she started rearranging the things on the tray this is entirely wonderful laurence but faintly ridiculous why not just leave me a kettle profs orders lol said hed awoken her with a call to her mobile as arranged at eight and then carried the tray rapidly along two hundred yards of mud track before the teapot could cool and then up fourteen stone steps to the granary thered be a small kitchen here eventually meanwhile prof had said he wanted moira cairns looked after in the oldfashioned way this apparently was something to do with memories of moira bringing morning tea and toast to his room when they were recording way back ach said moira when lol went on to remind her of this that was just to make sure the auld bastard didnae take anything stronger she poured tea steam rising tell me hows he doing now in that particular area carries this cappuccino machine around with him like a teddy bear i dont think theres ever been anything stronger in the house moira nodded approvingly sugaring her tea lol suspected she was sitting on a whole stack of horror stories about profs drinking days and now youre here as well keeping an eye on him good arrangement on the whole lol hesitated hed been here for several months now since abandoning plans to become a psychotherapist since prof levin had persuaded him to work on the longawaited solo album that was not in lols view longawaited by as many people as prof seemed to imagine but now the album was virtually finished and lol didnt think he was doing enough around the studio to justify his de luxe accommodation it was a good arrangement certainly altogether too good apart that is from when characters like me come down to strut our prima donna stuff and pinch your lovely wee apartment moira said where are you sleeping yourself meantime oh in the loft over the end of the studio i slept there most of the summer anyway its fine its no summer now though therell be no heating in there will there once the studios off its fine honestly moira smiled crows feet developing but it didnt matter at all this woman would be sexy at seventy this wee place though i have to say is totally magical all those steps like a tower house you can stand at the window at night the lights of malvern in the distance would that be the town itself great malvern west malvern i think best not to know for sure moira said all distant lights at night should be the lights of fairyland there to inspire us but just out of reach she looked at him over the rim of her cup makes you uneasy living here just a bit her level of perception was increasingly scary why too perfect i suppose paradise syndrome the granary was on the edge of a field sloping down towards the boswells place and well separated from the stable block housing the recording studio prof levin had managed to buy it along with adjacent outbuildings and two acres of land when parts of the surrounding lake estate had been sold off at the end of the summer but then moira said to a lot of people thisd just be a high level hovel in the middle of a muddy field inconvenient to get to and too small to do anything decent with its a personalized concept paradise well yeah when prof had suggested that he might like to move in here lol had suspected although nothing had been said that prof was also thinking about merrily with whom lol must never be seen i would say youd become like a son to prof moira said but possibly that would be overstating it just a tad youre somebody he feels he has to help because he knows youre never gonnae help yourself like if the whole ideology of this place is the prof devoting the glorious sunset of his career to assisting pardon me the underdogs like you out of the money raised from the fat cats like me she threw up her hands whoops did that sound like charity ive no illusions moira lol said it is charity unless of course she raised a forefinger he gets it all back on the album yes although we all know that unless youre immensely famous already its buggerall use making an album if youre no gonnae tour it ah he shouldve seen this coming whereas a good tours almost guaranteed to put an album into profit lol sighed but of course we both know the prof has no interest whatsoever in payback only the way i see it this is gonnae nag away at you until you have to really do something about the whole what allergy phobia lol went to look out of the window over the frome valley across the meadow he could see the boswells beloved donkey stanley browsing his paddock taking it all for granted like he was only collecting a little of what was due to his species after centuries of toil and maltreatment obviously moira said when youve been out of it a long time its bloody hard especially on your own nearly twenty years i was just a kid good long time for the fear to feed which is what fear does like ive got these ten dates provisionally fixed for the winter and thats gonnae start off being an ordeal no question even after two and a bit years lol turned back into the white room where moira cairns was sipping her tea his feeling was that the word ordeal would not in moiras thesaurus carry any significant crossreference to playing live in front of an audience ok listen now laurence she was watching him over her cup bottom line if this proposed tour goes ahead how would you feel about being part of that lol went hot then cold aye i know all right sunshine dont panic moira put down the cup and stood up this beautiful scary mature woman in faded bugs bunny nightwear stay right there i have to take a pee you stay right there and consider all your getout lines but also remember how it was last night this morning was actually the first time hed been alone with her last night in the studio prof had been there the whole time and also simon st john who was the vicar of knights frome and played bass and cello simon knew moira cairns from way back when they were part of the same band having its albums engineered then produced by prof levin so this was in the way of a reunion with lol the outsider getting involved because he just happened to be here moiras new album would be the first majorleague product of knights frome studio where prof wanted music to be made at leisure songs laid down as and when no pressure on anyone timeless lol couldnt remember which of them had suggested they should try one of his songs as if moira didnt have enough of her own the idea had just seemed to arise and theyd wound up reworking his neotraditional ballad about the changing face of the english village the bakers lament at first moira was singing with lol on guitar and then and he wasnt sure how this had come about either lol had taken over the vocal simon st john threading cello through it sinuous and lowlying like the river frome and moira contriving this incredible harmony prof had recorded both versions and it had been like moira said kind of interesting not technically terrific but there was something going on something organic something visceral something a little wonderful all those years since hazey jane folded and lol had felt like part of a band again of course it was just for amusement a dream a fantasy sequence who wouldnt imagine they sounded good recording with moira cairns moira who now lived in seclusion most of the year on the isle of skye coming out to perform only rarely leaving deep tracks strewn with legends moira who had been born halfgypsy in glasgow who was said to be possessed of the sight a goddess of folkrock the vein of silver in the long black hair how many pictures had he seen of that never before over a loony toons tshirt of course but why should she want to do this for someone shed only known for a few hours a favour to prof laying all her hard won credibility on the line as a favour to prof last night it had seemed magical now it was merely unreal tell you what im thinking she called from the bathroom maybe we should do the one gig to begin with just to see how it goes yeah lol sat down on the edge of the bed moira said sorry what was that couldnae hear with the taps on see whats happening im booked to play somewhere called the courtyard in hereford in i think its a week on wednesday we could use that for starters as an experiment lols heel clinked on something under the bed nothing formal nothing on the posters i mean too late anyway you just show up drift in and out as you please then we toss in a couple of your own numbers see how it feels lol already knew how it would feel he could already sense his fingers sweating on the frets with any more than three other people in the room all the chords would crumble hed lose the tune forget the words and in any audience there were always going to be two or three people who would remember he bent down the item under the bed proved to be his kettle its flex coiled up next to it all that stuff about the morningtea tradition never had made total sense if prof thought it was important to return old favours why hadnt he brought the tray a setup moira cairns came out of the bathroom looking fresh and composed in a limegreen kimono so she said where do you wannae start well naturally lol didnt want to start at all hadnt he done half a college course in psychotherapy worked for a while with an analyst and counsellor in hereford he could deconstructit all very efficiently for himself thank you even down to the implications of his nick drake fixation nick drake had made three classic albums but was always afraid to perform in public consequently perhaps the albums had undersold and nick drake undervalued had died of an overdose of antidepressants but lol the poor guy was mentally ill moira pointed out and you never were you were just a victim of the system with no support at all to fall back on when this bastard bassplayer very kindly gets you a conviction for having sex with a fifteen yearold girl to keep himself out of the shit when you were what eighteen nineteen thereabouts shed evidently been thoroughly briefed by prof an innocent all alone your parents having become these totally insane religious maniacs who disown you the more prof tells the story the more insane my parents become so you fall into the system unnecessary residential psychiatric socalled care ie drugged senseless by the fucking state moira tossed back her hair forked lightning in a night sky no way thatd happen now with no damn beds to spare for the real loonies laurence why arent you angry lol shrugged one day moira warned your shoulders are just gonnae freeze up let me get this right if you reappear on stage now nearly two whole decades later the whole audience isnae gonnae be thinking ah heres the awfully talented person from hazey jane where the hells he been all this time its gonnae be like hey is that no the big sex offender of or whenever you really think that no lol said too quickly look he turned to her im really grateful moira and if i could do it id be you know id be incredibly proud but were talking albatross here like what you dont need around your neck now listen im a vulnerable wee creature behind the shell she came and sat next to him on the side of the bed i need compatible support i dont need flash i need sensitive and faintly flawed you need somebody who can get the chords right and wont just stand there in a pool of sweat laurence she took him by the shoulders you can do this you have to do this wheres your main income from this and that royalties from songs from the old hazey jane albums i wouldnae even like to ask how much that comes to whats your girlfriend say about it lol tensed girlfriend the wee priest moira said patiently i bet even the wee priest earns more in a year than you do who er who told you prof told me simon told me now see theres something i mean i shouldnae have to spell this out to an exloony who trained as a shrink but thats something you did overcome rejected by the bornagain parents and now here yare in a close personal relationship with an anglican priest major psychological breakthrough or what lol stared down at the bedside rug they werent supposed to say anything about that which sounded a little pathetic who prof simon moira blinked but youre an item right you and the priest youre going out together well we lol smiled ruefully we stay in together sometimes moira stared at him or rather we just dont go out anywhere very public shes inevitably like a lot of women priests especially in a country parish shes insecure about some things attitudes i dont want to make it any more difficult for her it started to rain a pattering on the east window lol what year is this yeah i know it sounds ridiculous but when you consider that she also has this other this other thing she does in the diocese exorcist yeah i know they dont talk about it she still tends to attract publicity lol said i mean there still arent that many women priests in the uk let alone women deliverance ministers so if the press found out even the local press ah moira contemplated this supporting her chin with a hand gnawing the side of a finger right i think i get the picture crazy woman who pursues evil spirits for a living takes up with exloony singer with a conviction for a sex offence not good is it moira cairns shook her head slowly jesus laurence you dont go out of your way to make things easy for yourself do you lol smiled his hopeless smile caffeine in the early afternoon with winddriven rain coming in hard from wales and the last of the apples down on the vicarage lawn the police arrived actually just one of them di francis bliss of hereford cid which was a relief it meant this was informal di bliss sat at the kitchen table and drank coffee greedily he was unshaven been up all night couldnt hide his excitement merrily weve gorra name for the dead person oh they had merseyside in common he and merrily if not synchronistically shed been a curate there her first job in the clergy her baptism of fire and acid but good times on the whole by the time shed arrived in liverpool frannie bliss stocky redhaired raised a catholic in kirby would already have left it was unclear how hed wound up in hereford he folded his hands around his warm mug lynsey davies local woman reported missing back in the middle of august by her partner i say partner one of her partners the father of two of her kids anyway which he reckons gives him first claim claim on what on any compensation that might be due to the dependants of a murder victim i imagine everybody talks compensation now you dont have a loss you have an opening for gain not a loving relationship then with lodge on the side frannie bliss sniffed merrily feeling chilly even inside her oldest rollneck woolly carried her ashtray to the table and slumped down opposite him it was a day for despairing of people blisss excitement depressed her but then if everybody enjoyed their jobs that much the sum of human happiness she surrendered to confusion and lit a cigarette when you say local village called underhowle backside of rossonwye where it joins the forest of dean id never been there before lodge has his depot on the outskirts and a bungalow hes built next to it lynsey davies lived in a council house in ross she was thirtynine had four kids by three different blokes and was apparently roddys intermittent girlfriend a funloving lady so she was identifiable then frannie smiled thinly ah not strictly the expartner paul connell reckons he doesnt mind having a quick glance but im not sure how useful that would be it does help a bit that the body was dumped in peagravel rather than soil with this big tank thing on top so its not as badly eatenup as you might expect after a couple of months underground and the clothes tie in weve sent for dental records anyway lodge actually took it her out of the ground dug down by the side of the tank fished her out probably manually dumped her in the shovel of the digger tucked her in nicely merrily shuddered recalling the mud drying on the front of roddy lodges leather jacket on his trousers the er you know the bodily fluids theyd have gradually drained out through the gravel bliss said so although she was a big girl the body wouldntve weighed that much wouldntve taken a great feat of strength for roddy to roll her onto a couple of feed sacks and lift her out of the pit and into the shovel merrily thought of roddy lodges pungent aftershave wondering if hed plastered it on to combat the smell didnt make too much sense this was a man who installed foul drainage she and gomer had seen the big digger go rumbling past while they were waiting for the police on the pub car park the body presumably out in front sunk into the raisedup shovel like an offering to the moon gomer had wanted to follow lodge merrily had talked him out of it half an hour or so later the police had cornered roddy at his depot the womans body was still under the tarpaulin not much room for denial how did she die the pm should be taking place as we speak evidently frannie didnt want to say how shed died he finished his coffee can i go over a few points according to your statement you and mr parry went to this house because you had reason to think roddy would be going there to retrieve this septictank unit the er efflapure but we didnt expect him to be there right he lifted his cup dont suppose sure she went to fetch the coffee pot trying to recall what shed said in her brief statement to a detective constable in hereford in the early hours i know it all sounds unlikely frannie but you have to remember we were both pretty hyped up last night there was no way gomer was going to go home and sleep but we really didnt expect to find lodge there actually merrily it all sounds far enough off the wall to be true given the circumstances even if i didnt know you well enough to think it unlikely in the extreme that youd lie to the police he beamed at her but in fact weve also spoken to mrs pawson in london who confirms lodge insisting that he should be the one who took the thing away which of course now makes perfect sense not a question of professional pride as you assumed but the fact that the bugger had a body buried underneath it and he was panicking at the thought of it getting discovered by gomer parry makes a lorra sense from roddys point of view it doesnt really make sense to me that he should bury a body under a septic tank merrily poured bliss more coffee and saw his wrist quiver after a long night he must be sizzling with caffeine i mean ok he might not have expected it to be dug up again within weeks but surely there was always going to be a chance that some day it was going to be reexcavated they dont last a lifetime do they they can last a lifetime apparently but yeh i do see what you mean but youve gorra remember were not dealing with a fully rational person a feller who drives through the night with a body held up in his bloody diggers shovel he did kill her then i mean theres no suggestion that he might have been getting rid of a body for someone else an extension of his wastedisposal empire hes arrogant and daft enough but i dont see it do you my feeling is well have a confession before dark im leaving him to stew for a few hours im not hurrying this was not merrilys impression she still wasnt quite sure why bliss was here shed expected a visit at some stage but not so early in the investigation and it wasnt as if ledwardine was on the ross side of hereford this was a special trip will you be talking to gomer again because janes round there at the moment i dont particularly want jane was making gomers lunch the kid had still been awake when merrily had got in around am neither of them had really slept after that er yeah frannie bliss sounded doubtful we will be talking to mr parry again at some stage obviously though ive gorra tell yer it might be less easy than he thinks to prove that roddy lodge torched his yard and besides youve got something more important now bliss looked pained dont put it like that i know the lads dead and im not saying it wasnt down to roddy but while hes still dodging around lynsey davies hes flatly denying the bloody fire says parrys three sheets in the wind gorra grudge professional rivalry all this kind of shite roddy is indeed very proud of his professional standing among other things could be forensicsll find traces of combustibles on his clobber but meanwhile all im saying is lets get him sewn up on the easy one first then see what else we can discuss with him its been a long night merrily what about dna after a fire but youve charged him er no no i havent not yet oh i want it in the papers bliss said if hes charged its sub judice and the clamps go down i want it splurged all over the papers radio tv the lot that weve found a womans body under a newfangled septic tank and that a thirtyfiveyearold man is helping with inquiries i want people to think about it and talk about it not just in the village i want the name efflapure in the public domain im sorry she poured another coffee for herself maybe thinking it would attune her to blisss wavelength why cause roddy works over a wide area yes i done tanks for all the nobs all over the three counties and down into wales i done prince charless fuckin sewage over at highgrove see what im looking for merrily is a full list of all the efflapures or anything else hes put in weve got his books but we all know that with a bloke like roddy they wont all be down on paper for the taxman i want to know exactly where hes been she nodded she didnt really get this too tired maybe but she nodded anyway merrily bliss said youre a woman yeah i still like to think so suddenly despite or maybe because of her fatigue and the sordid sickening nature of the discussion she felt a piercing need to be in lol robinsons bed in the white room in the granary she looked away knowing she was blushing and a priest bliss sat up in his chair facing her with both hands flat on the table his voice becoming scousenasal and youve been close to evil closer than most priests id say even if youve not been at it long so i just want to ask you off the record about the kind of stuff thats not in your statement i want to know how you felt about roddy as a priest as a woman she met his gaze his eyes were bright with caffeine and candid ambition she liked bliss actually more than she liked his boss dci howe who was apparently away on something called an sio module course but she wasnt quite ready to say how she felt about roddy lodge you come and talk to me any time you want thanks id like that yeah you would indeed my darlin she said youre leading the inquiry then frannie so far he said but i may not have long before somebody takes over you know how it goes so all that about being in no hurry was bollocks yeah truth is merrily im chasing a feeling about this feller im supposed tove gone home for a kip ages ago but ive been driving round thinking about it roddy he nodded what i reckon he took a breath and seemed to be swirling it around his cheeks before letting it out i reckon there could be more of them more lynseys the problem was jane realized that nobody really understood gomer they looked at this weedy little old guy in the bottle glasses and they somehow failed to see the rebel warrior crunching down the border clay on his grungedup caterpillars swinging the arm of his jcb like some huge broadsword they couldnt discern the elemental side of gomer even mum who should have known better by now had been like keep an eye on him make sure he takes it easy dont let him overreact they didnt understand overreaction was what kept gomer fully alive hed agreed finally to let jane go to the chip shop then hed left half his lunch all morning hed kept phoning people in a compulsive kind of way no hed go it dont matter what youve yeard it ent over gimme a week ill be back to you gimme ten days max but there was a dullness in his glasses ive got my provisional licence now jane wrapped the congealing chips in their newspaper and dumped them in gomers kitchen bin i could work for you weekends i mean jcbs its just a matter of experience and technique right and an hgv licence gomer said heavily oh that too certainly i knew that she also knew that in some curious way he wouldnt feel free to mourn nev until hed secured the business if he let it go it would be a kind of betrayal in the same way the small modern kitchen was amazingly clean and neat everything shiny the way minnie had kept it but not like a shrine jane thought a shrine was static and frozen in here you could still feel minnies busy spirit and gomer needed that like he always needed to know the big diggers were out there oiled and ready to move the earth the kitchen window overlooked the orchard out of which the buttressed church spire rose like a rocket on its launching pad starship mum soon to be transmitting soft porn if uncle ted got his way everything was getting out of proportion jane said i suppose if you could wipe off the jobs youve already got on the stocks you could take some time to kind of reorganize things like reduce the scale of the operation gomer looked up ar mabbe you put your finger on it there janey gotter deal with the commitments first ennit i ent given up hope i know where i can rent a digger and theres a coupler fellers i know would likely help me out but they wont be in till tonight see i suppose its going to be an even smaller pool now that this roddy lodge is going to be whatever happens to him gomers glasses she would swear darkened jane couldve punched herself for bringing this up again this whole lodge thing was very weird and sick when mum had told her shed felt obliged to feign disappointment at missing the excitement but in reality she was glad she hadnt been there awfully glad too that mum had got herself and gomer out of it avoiding confrontation jane had learned that in situations involving crime and death only distance lent any kind of excitement the fact that this lodge in all probability had killed fat nev who jane had known ok not well but she could picture him could hear his voice knew what a crappy life hed had made the guy repulsive a monster but gomer was different somehow for gomer the discovery of the womans body in the truck had been almost a frustrating development an intrusion coming between him and the man whod murdered his nephew and wrecked his business did gomer feel maybe unconsciously a certain resentment towards mum for forcing him to take the easy way out let the police handle it unlikely because gomers affection for mum was almost a fatherdaughter thing but there was something what are you doing this afternoon frannie bliss said i nothing vital lie down for half an hour maybe go across to the church and say some prayers for gomer and nev phone lol avoid uncle ted go back and talk to gomer see if theres any way to help him through this only id like you to come and look at his place at underhowle take less than an hour to get there you know me merrily i dont have too much faith in psychologists and profilers but ive still gorra sneaking regard for priests he gave a small smile of whichever side of the fence frannie merrily said do you have any real concrete reason for suspecting hes done it more than once just his attitude and the fact that at least one other womans gone missing from that area in the past year oh he likes women its not a crime i use the word like ok merrily put out her cigarette ill tell you he was heavily suggestive i mean towards me in an oldfashioned way i suppose youd have to say i was standing a couple of yards away from a body hed just exhumed and he was telling me i was you know it wasnt exactly sophisticated and it wasnt subtle he actually used the word sexy here we are in the grounds of an empty house hes just been accused of murder by gomer and hes talking like weve just met up in a singles bar and weve both had a bit to drink had he do you think i wouldntve thought so his voice didnt seem to be slurred and i couldnt smell anything on him other than an awful lot of aftershave he was still hypedup though in what way she thought about it at first i thought he was nervous gomer had called him a murderer however as soon as he found out this was about the fire he as you said kind of denied it laughed it off anyway that was about when i gave myself away dropped the torch in the shovel on the tarpaulin covering anyway as soon as he saw i was a woman maybe that was when he got cocky he seemed quite relaxed from then i wasnt of course id smelled the smell i just wanted us to get the hell out of there before he pulled a gun or a knife or something do you think he detected you were scared and that was what made him so forward you mean do i think he got off on that a woman being blatantly nervous of him maybe i dont know where was mr parry at the time mr parry was standing there gobsmacked at me selling him down the river i really dont think the impression i have thinking back on it was that roddy had ceased to be aware of gomer from the moment he became aware of me he said a woman like you know for me merrily shook her head im sorry that sounds even to me that sounds like the kind of thing you say in hindsight when you know youve been face to face with a it sounds about right actually bliss said for instance when the lads brought him in last night he was rabbiting nonstop in the car like they were his best mates like they were all on a coach coming back from an outing hes there jammed up between two burly uniforms and at one point hes suggesting that if they ever fancy a onenighter with the trimmings he can get them fixed up trimmings ill spare you the details did he realize why they were arresting him oh yeh merrily you say in your statement he told you hed been to talk to the local vicar she nodded that would be jerome banks you spoken to him would i need to lodge claimed he scared the vicar told him about things hed supposedly seen spooky was lodges word didnt go into detail he seemed i dunno kind of proud of this spooking the vicar i said that sounded very interesting and he said in this heavily lecherous way that i could go and talk to him any time i liked and you said i said thatd be nice or something like that ah frannie bliss rubbed his stubbleroughened jaw what nice yes thats more or less what he said to us huh she reached for the zippo and the silk cut like i say they couldnt shut the bugger up last night and yet this morning when we brought him out of his cell and into an interview room hes a very different man withdrawn sort of hunched up into himself like hed been drunk last night and now hes very badly hungover didnt want to know us any more kept muttering not talking not talking kept wanting to go back to his cell see thats a bit unusual normally they cant wait to get out we tried all the usual things good cop bad cop were a little more psychologically sophisticated nowadays merrily since when she drew out a cigarette with her teeth anyway it wasnt happening we werent getting anywhere he didnt even ask for a solicitor we offered him one he said no no to everything no no no dont wanner talk leave me alone sinking further back into himself complaining of headaches well all right well have enough forensic by the end of the day to package him up no problem but i he looked into merrilys eyes i know theres a lot more to come out if we handle this right and you want to be the one to uncover it before they send howe back from her course to take over merrily eyed him along the length of her cigarette aw please sorry but eventually bliss said he just looks at me through his fingers and he says you get that little woman ill talk to that little woman what bliss smiled a touch bashfully not quite meeting her eyes you took a bloody long time to get round to that merrily said yeah sorry about that no youre not bliss shuffled in his chair merrily how would you feel about talking to him might save us all some time help you get it wrapped before they bring in some flash dci from headquarters or summon ms howe back by talking to him you mean either with you there or with a tape running something like that but i wouldnt like to have you going in there cold thats why i want you to see his place get an idea of what kind of bloke were dealing with it wont take long now wouldnt mind look i know the bishop and the chief constable have had drinkies together but you dont work for the police yeah yeah i dont want to cross any of your personal barriers i just want a firmer idea of whether im talking to a sexual fantasist who got carried away one time or to a real sexual predator maybe somebody who started out degrading women and progressed to killing them them plural and as well as whatever he might disclose to me you probably want to watch how he reacts to me as a woman right well you know i hadnt actually thought of that frannie forget it bliss was silent for a moment he waved away her smoke youve disappointed me merrily i thought what you did was all about stopping the spread of evil and suppose hes in some way innocent suppose youre getting carried away i can show you all right she put out her cigarette shed have to admit that the possibility of lodges innocence was remote ill talk to him but ill warn him first that under the circumstances there could be things i would feel obliged to pass on to the police then he has the option of telling me to push off bliss didnt look too unhappy about this and no tape no video merrily or i could put your idea to the bishop hed need about two days to think about it the old worrier she stood up frannie are you even fit to drive bliss squeezed shut his eyes and opened them again wouldnt have any more coffee in that pot by any chance just how funny it gets they travelled down the long misted valley with steel skeletons striding ahead of them this was where herefordshire and gloucestershire lay back toback on a lumpy mattress of tiered fields rising into old woodland of browning broadleaved trees and conifers high on the hillsides but the valley didnt look as if it belonged to either county as much as it belonged to the power industry you cant believe they can still get away with this can you merrily said sorry frannie bliss driving was somewhere else the pylons they looked seriously hostile like an army of the dead bristling with obsolete weaponry i mean would it be all that costly to run some of it underground the joke was that there were so few homes in view that you could probably have electrified the lot with half a dozen windmills wreathed now in fog the pylons were a primitive show of strength maybe one day theyd be industrial archaeology not yet frannie bliss glared at the countryside through the windscreen of his black alfa as though it was holding out on him he was still a city cop at heart you couldnt accost pedestrians the same in country lanes where you off to son whats in the rucksack theyd come in from the a the dual carriageway pumping heavy goods in and out of newport and cardiff and the west country here lorries lurched past the most voluptuous curves of the wye valley and that famous rossonwye skyline the tallsteepled church crowning the town above the river and the watermeadows and the mockmedieval sandstone walls dark wooded hills were the ross backcloth and those same hills were directly above them now sunk into wet mist a few miles beyond the town no i was just wondering bliss said how many sewerage systems roddys put in around here every farm needs one doesnt it every cottage merrily saw where this was heading you could start a terrible scare bliss nodded didnt seem too concerned you put this out in the media she warned you get everybody for miles around wondering if theyve got a dead body under their septic tank in a pocket of her coat shed discovered the card that roddy lodge had given her last night efflapure r f lodge registered contractor the old garage underhowle nr rossonwye it was in a plastic evidence bag now locked in the boot of the alfa frannie bliss seemed close to becoming obsessive about roddy lodge i wouldnt mind looking under say a few selected septics narrow it down a bit he smiled well see anyway hows business the evil one doing much locally youd know better than me he was changing the subject but she could sense his anticipation and was unnerved by it he glanced at her hows lol hed encountered lol during the summer over the hopkiln tragedy and the problems surrounding allan henry the developer oddly bliss and lol had seemed to understand one another but that didnt mean she could trust him with an update were still friends and hows your private life inspector bliss not many private bits left whats that mean he took a sudden right between a scots pine and an untrimmed hedge the car skidded on some mud and bliss narrowly avoided the hedge ah he said just the usual police thing your married life suffers on account of the job and then it gets so bloody messy at home the job becomes a refuge like that im sorry i dont want us to be over but its going down so fast now i dont really know how to stop it and before you say do you wanna talk about it frannie no thank you not now maybe when this is finished i wonder how often youve said that maybe all right bliss said probe over were nearly there listen when we get to the actual place im not gonna force yer into a durex suit but try not to touch anything eh were just going to his house arent we its not as if its a murder scene she registered his chilly halfsmile oh we dont know for certain bliss said but he had tove done it somewhere and we do know he brought women back here and when you see inside the place well youll probably want to wear a durex suit this was where gloucestershires forest of dean looked to be stealthily pinching bits of herefordshire the lane narrowed between wild saplings growing on the verges and then within fifty yards of a sign announcing underhowle but before any evidence of a community they were there a clearing and a short cindered track opening into a forecourt fronting a building of grey concrete a classic garage from the s sectional temple to the motor car with a white metal sign r f lodge in front the stumps of petrol pumps behind one of the towering pylons that looked as though it had just walked down from the conifered hillside either side of the garage with its high twin entrances shuttered now stood newer concrete buildings frannie bliss parked the alfa between a police car and a white van on the forecourt lowering his window as a uniformed constable came over sir theres been a deputation of local people demanding to know whats going on here ds mumford didnt want to speak to them so i just told them i wasnt authorized to make a statement itd be up to the sio just to put you in the picture i think theyll be back i do not doubt it son andys up at the house is he bliss turned to merrily ive had andy going through roddys books phoning his fantasy clients is he known at highgrove you reckon youre really building this up arent you merrily im a detective inspector who would like to be a detective chief inspector im thirtysix years old and i think im worth it she grinned and stepped out into the peppery breeze bliss ushered her along a flagged pathway down the side of the garage and there within ten yards of the rear of the grey building was the bungalow it had been invisible from the front maybe just as well as it wasnt pretty multicoloured bricks assembled in no particular pattern flat roof no garden no flower tubs just a concrete surround and the tiled pit of a drained swimming pool near the back wall of the garage and in summer you can float on your back and watch the sun sizzling through the power lines merrily said apparently he got the land cheap built the bungalow himself more or less you dont say down in a parallel field she could see half of what looked like a stone chapel be worth quite a bit now its actually quite well built according to mumford who knows about these things maybe it just lacks the feminine touch bliss glanced at her how true that is he said roddy lodges office was at the rear of the bungalow to the right of the back door its walls were only half plastered and its rectangular window looked into the brackeny hillside through the steel bones of the pylon merrily saw a filing cabinet and a metal desk with a bright red computer and a phone on it also a bulky middleaged man in a shapeless dark suit sitting in a vinylbacked executive swivel chair bliss bent down to him cocking his head on one side so was the prince cooperative andy was he as nice as he always seems on the telly good afternoon reverend mumford carefully folded up his mobile phone and placed it on the desk nice to see you again hello andy merrily wondered not for the first time what kind of vocation this was turning out to be when she seemed to encounter more coppers than priests mumford looked at the mobile boss im just waiting for a call back from mrs jilly coopers secretary they do seem to remember being approached by lodge sometime last year but had no need of his services how wise bliss said and highgrove came back to me to confirm getting repeated letters and leaflets from him i asked if theyd kept any but apparently they didnt ive also found a pile of press cuttings in the filing cabinet mostly relating to famous people whove moved to this area in fact anywhere within a fifty or sixtymile radius what does that tell you merrily wondered apart from that hes enterprising and a terrible celebritystalker bliss said hes very upfront for a stalker hes certainly not efficient mumford nodded at the scarlet computer which had yellow speaker grilles and looked like a toy at one time he seems to have tried doing his bills and stuff on that thing but the last one i can find on the hard disk seems to be over a year old hes all over the place after that and the computers gathering dust other things on his mind andy shows a lot of nerve in a way merrily said i mean a small operator making a direct approach to prince charles and princess anne at gatcombe mumford said at least shes down here on his list when i phoned i wasnt able to talk to anybody who might know about him so ive arranged to call back in an hour or so as for stings place no answer at all a couple of other people you wontve heard of boss seem to remember getting leaflets from roddy as well as individual letters yeah said frannie bliss but have any of these nobs actually hired the bastard mumford shrugged merrily said this is like one of those old ealing comedies bliss didnt smile right he opened the office door come with me merrily ill show you just how funny it gets the focus of the living room was a big mahogany cocktail bar brand new but well out of fashion there were tall stools optics dozens of bottles and a neon sign roddys bar the low seating was arranged around it a couple of sloppy dark leather chairs and a sofa behind a long glasstopped coffee table with copies of loaded and front on it this is clearly a man who knows all the best discount warehouses bliss said on one wall a bullfight poster had roddys name added to the list of contenders there was a bang olufsen sound system with speakers on wall brackets and a cd pyramid with one cd lying on top ibiza nights vol but the stereo was unplugged as was the widescreen tv as if roddy didnt use them much any more didnt spend much time here its all very clean merrily observed he has a mrs wellings from the village comes in once a week but she says this and the kitchen and a couple of other rooms are about as far as shes allowed to go bliss led her back into the passage this was a plain corridor bungalow doors to left and right two of them still unpainted it reinforced the feeling merrily was getting of a man who moved around like a moth never settling to anything for very long how long has he lived here built it about four years ago from money his old man left him hes got two older brothers like twenty years older ones living in oz one has the family farm up the valley both quite respectable by all accounts roddy was a bit of a difficult boy but not in the sense that hed be known to us and he wasnt i dont know the full circumstances but you had a situation where the father bequeaths him a wodge of cash on the proviso that he uses it to set himself up in business the brother up the valley says he seemed to have knuckled down to it bliss had stopped outside a door at the end of the passage with a conspicuous metal lock screwed to the outside the lock was conspicuously broken thats us most coppers are frustrated burglars he opened the door after you this is where you dont touch anything but i dont suppose ill need to emphasize that it was dark inside except for a shape like the screen of one of the old black and white tvs she remembered from when she was a little kid when you had to fiddle with a switch labelled horizontal hold because all you could get were black white and grey lines she blinked and realized it was only a window with venetian blinds their blades not quite fully closed oh sorry bliss said ingenuously once she was fully inside the room lights i forgot merrily was starting to feel annoyed hed been setting this up for her so shed be in the best viewing position to get the full effect when his hand crept around the door jamb and found the switch and all the women came out of the shadows it didnt seem unusually disturbing at first they were centre folds mostly you could even see the little holes and rips left by the staples they were pasted on two white emulsioned wallsthe other two walls were black or a very deep purple she hardly needed to screw up her eyes against the light the only illumination came from shielded spotbulbs just above skirtingboard level and it was subdued serving only to reveal the photos and deepen clefts between breasts and thighs of which there were quite a lot could be as many as a hundred pictures merrily wondered they were softporn poses mostly colour and black and white a scattered few were harder core a couple featuring women using vibrators the weakness of the lights and the clouding shadows added the illusion of movement that was disturbing in an eerie way the rest merrily decided was just sad for a man twenty years out of his middle teens like some repressed schoolboys fantasy den isnt it frannie bliss stood in the bedroom doorway merrily turned to glance at the bed keeping her hands in her coat pockets the bed was kingsize unmade black shiny sheets well of course there was a thick smell makes you wonder how he ever got a woman to spend a night in here doesnt it bliss said i dont think hed get one for a second night ah well he came a little way into the room the answer of course is that hes got another bedroom along the passage red lights pictures of spanish dancers nothing to offend other than aesthetically and i dont imagine thereve been too many cultural exchanges in there so if we assume thats where he takes the er young ladies then thisll be where he enjoys his own company merrily shuddered she recalled the shadow of roddy lodge standing immediately over her in front of the pawson house the birthdayboy look on his trowelshaped face a woman hed said like any woman another one for the wall bliss stood there hands in his pockets they both had their hands in their pockets bliss was watching her waiting merrily met his eyes er he cleared his throat youre not getting it are you sorry take a closer look would you merrily she didnt move i dont see that therell probably be some ladies you might not recognize dont know them all meself but the one just to the left of the door for instance is kelly emerson who was found raped and murdered in swindon last year that was the picture the family gave the police for the crime posters it was widely used in the papers at the time what she followed his forefinger to a blurred black and white face dark synthetic curls big smile naked body in shadow she didnt understand the newspapers had used a nude photograph of a missing woman she moved in closer realizing that there was something wrong here something skewed saw that the face of kelly emerson was in grainy black and white but the naked body was studio quality and on closer inspection was slightly too big for the face merrily backed rapidly away aware of breathing harder thing is of course bliss said that he couldntve done that one theres a bloke doing life for kelly feller from bournemouth they got him on dna and then he pleaded guilty no messing its beyond any question but lodge had pasted the cutout face of a murdered woman onto the body of some anonymous pinup from the sun just another model just another dead woman she made herself go back and examine both walls more closely there were several faces she recognized now celebrity murder victims celebrity suicides also the most famous car crash casualty of all time all of them women all of them now dead their faces pasted onto cutout nude bodies tragic victims twisted with scissors and paste and lighting into profane pinups merrily turned away from the wall all the sensations of last night were coming back from the feeling of grease and smoke in her hair at gomers burnedout depot to the waves of aftershave to the cloying perfume of decay under the tarpaulin i dont understand she said i think you do merrily bliss said softly youre looking at his inspiration these are the ones he wishes hed done the ones he wishes hed got to first she stood in the dimness staring no longer at the illuminated wall but into the very thin lines of grey and white between the blades of the venetian blinds theyre all pasteups not all of them i think some were just piccies he got off on part of the mixnmatch i expected to find one of lynsey but shes not there maybe because shes not had her picture in the papers yet therell be a reason he bliss paused he might tell you what it is it was as though hed opened the door of a deepfreeze i cant do it she said thats your decision merrily i cant force you to see him he doesnt want to talk to me you know that he just wants a woman in the room with him any woman you know that she remembered roddy lodge passing her his card scrutinizing her as if taking a mental photograph offering to tell her all the scary things hed told the local vicar about what hed seen in the night she didnt like to think now about what he might have seen in the night inside or outside his own head thanks shed said id like that yeah you would indeed my darlin merrily pushed her fists hard into the pockets of janes duffel coat determined not to shiver youd better tell me what you know she said to bliss how did he kill lynsey davies he shrugged strangled her the pm should confirm it roddy told the lads in the car hed throttled her he just hasnt said it for the tape yet probably not bare hands we think something was used possibly a belt he paused you can probably understand now why i want to dig up a few more efflapures yes bliss was probably right to want to dig up every efflapure that roddy lodge had ever planted i didnt want to say too much in advance open the blinds now if youre feeling a bit oppressed she tugged on the cord and grey daylight made the room look merely tawdry the view sliced horizontally by the blinds was further slashed and diced by the great steel legs of the pylon at the edge of roddys garden would it offend the crimescene people overmuch if i had a cigarette merrily said dark lady eirion subjected jane to this sideways perusal she didnt care for they were heading out of hereford on the darkening ledbury road bound for knights frome like what jane demanded go on say it theyd been dissecting her mothers love life to discover precisely why it was going nowhere from the lofty plateau of a relationship that was actually working ok within the restrictive parameters of herself and eirion being still at school and stuff like that jane figured this was legit her duty even after all it had taken her over a year to engineer the mumlol thing jane eirion did this exaggerated sigh you didnt though did you what engineer it it was nothing to do with you in fact if youd kept your nose out completely it would probably actually have happened before it did thanks well its true you cant leave anything alone you totally smug fat git she glared out of the window at the newly stripped hopframes around perton when eirion had picked her up at five pm shed noticed hed put on a bit of weight a big welsh problem its because of all this driving to pick you up eirion said maybe i should stay in and do situps and weight training im sorry she said gruffly not looking at him i didnt mean fat exactly he didnt respond they drove in silence for a mile or so they were in eirions new old car a little grey peugeot with one of those cym stickers identifying the driver as a resident of wales whod taken the vehicle abroad if only to england in fact usually only to england and everything like everything was irritating jane tonight obviously she loved to talk and theorize about mum and lol but right now she realized this she wasnt stupid it was also an escape from the aura of manic desperation surrounding gomer she wished there was something she could do for him but even eirion didnt have an hgv licence probably wasnt old enough besides it would take more than dealing with a backlog of digging contracts to put gomer back together this time the big pendulum had taken him down once too often this year anxiety began to inflate in her chest she folded her arms over it anyway it doesnt matter who engineered it if it was meant to happen if its the right thing for her and for lol obviously and it quite clearly is but because of what she does shes got to be sure its the right thing by him like he deserves that kind of deference if he exists its a big responsibility being a priest eirion said lamely the truth is jane said theyre both basically wimps neither of them had the confidence to commit they were just kind of moving warily around one another like cats thats not being wimpish its what you do when youre an adult eirion said the trite bastard youve made a few mistakes before and you dont want to jump into anything without being sure of the territory especially when theres additional baggage you mean me no you egomaniac emotional baggage history well jane said its not like theyre still not making a complete bollocks of it all this about everything having to be kept under wraps which is like totally ridiculous its not totally when you think about it jane leaned back against the passenger door whats to think about if you look at the anglican church as a whole about half the priests are gay right and theyre not hiding their private life any more are they theyre practically announcing it from the pulpit dearly beloved brethren eirion did this reedy voice this morning i have to impart to you all that the big black guy living with me at the vicarage is not really a nigerian theological student as originally announced in the parish magazine in fact hes my special friend jane fought back the grin but i mean with a gay vicar youve got an ordained minister whos having sex with one or more partners with no possibility of any of them ever becoming the vicars wife in the traditional sense so why cant two heterosexuals because right now eirion said in his explainingtothe child tone neither of them needs the shit shes had more publicity than she ever wanted just lately plus lols got a lot to work out with this album and the chance of a comeback after well a very long time be bad enough for someone who hadnt had the kind of problems hes had ill tell you one thing irene if mum had walked away he wouldntve been able to finish that album if you listen to the new songs most of them are actually about her which has got to be just the most incredible turnon hasnt it like being the dark lady of the sonnets jane with all respect and everything ok hyper but if i was his muse eirion stopped for the traffic lights at trumpet you still fancy him dont you she stared at him resentful again hed refused to let her drive claiming the car wasnt insured for a learner which was bollocks probably the truth was he was afraid but what this is really jane what she said sulkily what this is really about is moira cairns isnt it thats crap moira cairns is really old and really beautiful and charismatic moderately attractive i believe if you like that kind of thing and you can put up with the grating accent and what possibly five years older than your mum his patronizing lilt was back thats not very old really is it and moira and lol have the same musical background and lols going to be playing on her album and shes doing one of his songs and theyre under the same roof miles from anywhere recording well into the night that is total absolute complete bollocks jane said furious it was getting dark now and some of them were carrying torches or lamps about a dozen people men and women with a few teenagers lurking on the fringes from a distance it looked like a group of very early carolsingers but close up merrily could tell they werent going to be bought off with mince pies a man came forward his voice preceding him across the cindered forecourt of roddy lodges garage wed like if we may to speak to the senior investigating officer frannie bliss turned to merrily raised an eyebrow and then walked out to them a poised and dapper figure despite the loss of sleep and all the coffee a pro an operator that would be me di francis bliss how can i assist well i hope that for a start you can tell us exactly whats going on the man was half a head taller than bliss he wore jogging gear luminous orange he put out a hand fergus young chair of the underhowle development committee also head teacher at the school he and bliss shook hands while merrily stayed in the shadow of the concrete building hoping on one level that all this wasnt going to take too long and on another because of what lay ahead for her that it would take half the night mr young bliss said im happy to tell you what i can but im afraid its not going to be much well to begin with if i may ask this where is mr lodge ah bliss put his head on one side mr lodge to use a phrase which i only wish wed been able to improve on over the years but we somehow never have is helping us with our inquiries a woman shouted please dont patronize us we know the kind of questions you people have been asking in the village yeh im sure you do bliss peered cautiously into the assembly the press arent here are they of course not fergus young said were all local people and were here because were quite naturally concerned about what appears to be intensive police activity around the community in which weve chosen to invest our lives and if that sounds pompous im very sorry it certainly didnt sound local he was about merrilys age and had a bony equine head with tough and springy dull gold hair he looked like the kind of evangelical head teacher who did an hours fellrunning before morning assembly look he said i can assure you that anything you say to us will be treated with sensitivity and discretion bliss looked pointedly at the teenagers or fergus young said if youd prefer to talk to just a few of us in a less public place im sure that might be a better idea sir yes young turned to the group to discuss it frannie bliss moved away hands in his trouser pockets merrily murmured shall i wait in the car not unless you really want to i might need backup with some of these plummy bastards and so they all wound up walking almost single file into the village of underhowle in the blustery dusk the lane was slick with wet leaves nobody spoke much merrily knew that bliss was working out how to turn this around milk the villagers while telling them nothing they didnt already know and making it sound like he was taking them into his confidence walking a couple of yards behind the delegation she had the feeling of being towed into something she was going to regret underhowle she didnt know what to expect the village though still in herefordshire and close to the most expensive curves of the wye valley was also on the fringe of the forest of dean the less affluent part of rural gloucestershire former mining area high unemployment a fair bit of dereliction it wasnt only the river severn that separated the forest from the cotswolds and it probably wasnt only the wye separating underhowle from the posher parts of south herefordshire bliss dropped back to take a call on his mobile yeh then he listened for a while so that bears out good good the trees dwindled lights appeared lovely job ta very much george bliss snapped his phone shut dropped it into his jacket pocket and quietly punched his left palm with his right fist fergus young glanced back at him sharply merrily wondered if bliss had been given the postmortem result but he didnt enlighten her she caught up with the others never seems to stop raining these days does it she said to nobody in particular reaching for her hood aspect of global warming a whitebearded man growled we only have ourselves to blame i suppose so there was a solitary street lamp at a staggered crossroads a signpost pointing through the rain to ross in the west lydbrook in the east ahead of them merrily saw sporadic cottages and modern houses edging warily up a stubbly hillside with the pylons marching behind in the dusk with few lights it looked stark like a big sloping cemetery well use the village hall i think fergus young said not what merrily was expecting given the bleakness of the village nor after the abattoir ambience of ledwardine parish hall what she was used to it had evidently been a barn left over from the days when the village centre had formed around old farms now it was the classiest kind of barn conversion chairs with tapestry seats tables of antique pine wall lights shone softly on unplastered rubblestone open beams and rafters a sandstone lintel above a window in the end wall had one word carved into it ariconium there was also a coffee bar a dark wiry guy with a shaven head went behind it flicking switches gotta be espresso im afraid that all right for everyone inspector london accent lovely frannie bliss said merrily wondered how long before he succumbed to caffeine poisoning she took a seat near the door glad she was wearing civvies most of the villagers including all the kids had dropped away at the entrance now there were only four locals in the hall the shavenheaded guy the man with the white beard a weathered woman in her fifties wearing a tan riding jacket and fergus young lean and rangy and looking more relaxed in here briskly unzipping his orange tracksuit top ill introduce everyone very quickly ok ingrid sollars who runs our visitor centre chris cody making the coffee chris is also on the development committee and er sam hall not on the development committee the bearded man was sitting on the edge of one of the tables he had thin white hair dragged back into a ponytail was maybe in his midsixties merrily had the feeling hed invited himself to the party and im sorry fergus young turned to frannie bliss inspector bliss of course and your colleague sergeant is it one day maybe if she keeps her nose clean bliss smiled blandly at merrily this is dc watkins merrily smiled back fractionally saying nothing yeah well it probably made sense the truth would only provoke questions they could do without right now she sat quietly like a minion in the civilized warmth she was aware of her thoughts being sucked back into roddy lodges necroerotic grotto this wasnt something she felt qualified to analyse it needed a forensic psychiatrist more than a priest in fact specialist advice was essential before bliss took this any further although obtaining it would mean alerting his superiors to the possibility of something far more extensive more labyrinthine than a oneoff domestic killing which was why he was counting on her to soften lodge and she wasnt going to be up to that was she and whats the development committee exactly bliss said there was laughter from chris cody with the shaven head the youngest of them probably midtolate twenties he and ingrid sollars were laying out bright red cups and saucers on the bar top its what were obliged to call ourselves to attract lots of terribly useful grants from various organizations fergus young explained but its all rather more casual than it sounds brings results however merrily recognized the voice which had earlier accused bliss of being patronizing i was born here ingrid sollars said and i can tell you this community has prospered more in the past five years than in the previous forty we dont intend to let it slip back and thats why we dont need any of the more unsavoury kind of publicity mans only doing his job ingrid sam hall said mildly notoriety we can do without lot of things we can do without lets stick to the point shall we fergus young glanced at sam and then at bliss smiled and shook his head as though implying this was a little local conflict nothing to worry the police sam hall wrapped his arms around his knees and stared at the ceiling chris cody and ingrid sollars began to hand out coffees ta very much bliss sipped contentedly glancing from face to face so how well do we all know mr lodge ingrid sollars frowned well enough not to say another word until you tell us what hes supposed to have done she had greybrown hair pulled back into a tight bun all right bliss sat down and stretched out his legs i can tell you this much some of which youll know already were investigating the suspicious death of a thirtynineyearold woman whose body was found on mr lodges property its now been confirmed by a pathologist that this woman was strangled oh shit chris cody sat down sam hall swung his trainered feet to the floor youre saying youve charged roddy with murder weve not charged him with anything yet but youre going to would you advise me not to sir there was silence except for noises from the coffee machine and rain on the window it was quite dark outside now poor roddy fergus young said bliss tilted his head inviting him to expand i young sighed all right im the local head teacher at the primary school if youd told me that one of the kids had committed a murder my reaction would be much the same im not saying hes in any way retarded well maybe emotionally and im not qualified to give an opinion on that but the idea of roddy lodge as a murderer its just hard to this woman ingrid sollars was still on her feet the dead woman who is she sorry cant tell you that until shes been formally identified is she local depends what you mean by local im sorry because questions were being asked in the village about a woman who whos been missing for some time bliss nodded merrily recalled his mention of another missing woman inspector bliss have you found the body of melanie pullman ingrid sollars stood in front of him her back arched is melanie pullman dead bliss folded his arms merrily tried to catch his gaze this wasnt fair did you know miss pullman bliss asked she worked weekends for me when i was running a riding school then she started going out with roddy lodge and i didnt see her so often why did she break up with roddy i assume because he took up with another woman which nobody could understand sam hall said melanie was a nice girl and pretty whereas the other woman looked uh he glanced at ingrid sollars smiled and shook his head what bliss asked ok goodlooking but older and kind of a hard bitch you want the truth sam hall had a curious hybrid accent the gloucester roll you found east of ross made more fluid by something transatlantic ingrid sollars stared at him like hed already said far too much so whos the other woman bliss said casually aw hell ingrid sam hall said this is all gonna come out why waste time names lynsey davies inspector when shes not in residence at roddys place she lives over in ross which is where he picked up most of his uh companions so thats where we could expect to find ms davies at the moment then is it sir i guess though there is another ok sam put up his hands to field ingrids glare no gossip ill stick with the facts yeah someplace in ross personally i havent noticed her around the last couple weeks he raised an eyebrow at bliss then looked away to show he wasnt going to follow up on this ingrid sollars moved towards a chair then turned back to bliss when melanie pullman disappeared some of us thought you the police ought to have looked harder but you abandoned her i dont think abandoned is quite the right word bliss said but yeh there are hundreds of adult missing persons and not that many police we have to prioritize and unless we think someones in immediate danger we cant always devote the resources wed like to however i can say id be very surprised if this turned out to be miss pullmans body and not only because its about two years since she disappeared oh ingrid sollars sat down expressionless thank you nonetheless bliss said thoughtfully since you mention it in the light of whats happened the circumstances of melanies disappearance might warrant another look do you think oh now just a minute fergus young sat up this situations fraught enough im just asking the question mr young how long after breaking up with roddy lodge did miss pullman disappear is it possible she disappeared before breaking up with roddy if you see what i mean sam hall said id say not but around this time roddy lodges love life wouldve been a little hard to chart boy seems to have gone through what you might call a delayed adolescence like hed discovered sex for the first time in his thirties i guess youd say no woman was safe although by safe thats not to say fergus young nodded regretfully in a way sams right i suppose thats what i meant earlier about roddy being a big kid his overtures to women were always so obvious so unsophisticated so immature really that we perhaps didnt appreciate how often he you know stop it ingrid sollars shouted youve no grounds neither of you fergus looked embarrassed im sorry its true that most of us havent been here long enough to give you a reliable opinion he looked at ms sollars you were born here of course and brought up not to gossip mr young well i was born here too sam hall lowered himself into a chair opposite bliss and i think this is a situation where the famous forest caution can do more harm than good i know the lodge family reasonably well solid traditional farmers made a good living looked after their money regulars at the baptist church before it closed and roddy was the baby right bliss said sam hall nodded merrily noticed he was drinking not coffee but spring water from a bottle mother dead so it was an all male household harry lodge and the three sons of which roddy was the youngest by almost a quartercentury harry never remarried and whatever happened he tended to accept it as the will of god personally i dont know too much about roddys life when he was growing up being as i was away for some years but i guess it was kinda constrained he stopped and glanced at ingrid who presumably had been here during those years but she wouldnt be drawn and looked away dont give up on us mr hall bliss said sam shrugged well when i came back from the states harry lodge had just died and left roddy the money to start a business give himself a direction in life to everyones surprise not least roddys i guess it took off and and so did roddy after this confined godfearing life on the family farm where earnings tended to be conserved were certainly never flaunted he suddenly had more money than he knew what to do with i guess it went straight to his head theres this little sports car in the garage along with the diggers bliss said yeah a red one and some pretty expensive weekend wear in his wardrobe id guess sure with his flashy car and a place of his own he found hed become suddenly attractive to a certain kind of woman i guess he was getting to think he could have just about any woman he wanted or a good proportion anyway lynsey davies didnt seem to mind least she stuck around maybe she liked the sports car and were the other women around too at the same time not in underhowle but i have friends in ross in some of the pubs there roddy was felt to be a nuisance always trying to pick up girls sometimes succeeding aw hell more than sometimes rebuffs bounced off him if theres such a thing as what the americans call a retard only with a mental age of sixteen then thats what i guess youre looking at here nicely put sir said frannie bliss merrily expected follow up questions tracing the directions roddys newfound liberation might have taken him but bliss stood up well thank you all very much i think weve managed to exchange some useful information there if you can think of anything else ill leave a couple of cards on the bar here ring me outside bliss said to merrily next time i talk to those buggers itll be individually like the woman can obviously tell us a lot more but shes not gonna do it in front of the rest of the underhowle development committee whats that about what are they developing everything place has been going down the pan for years used to have three pubs post office bakery all that used to be plenty of jobs in the forest of dean mining and forestry obviously now even farmings in trouble and a place this scrappys never going to make the tourist trail all they had left was the school and they had a hell of a battle to keep that going that guy fergus got a big campaign going now hes a local hero they walked back along the lane the rain had stopped again but the wind was up rattling like a flock of pigeons in the trees on either side and the other little bloke cody the one who doesnt say much hes the big industrialist builds computers here got a little factory doing very well comparatively not exactly bill gates yet more of a bill catflap somebody called him that merrily laughed into the wind bliss looked at her they dont pay you much do they the church what makes you think that the knackered old volvo that coat i always thought maybe you got extra for being an exorcist no just the privilege of having only one parish instead of about six like the bloke who covers this patch merrily looked down at her coat dont worry about me ill have saved enough for a new one from the oxfam shop before winter sets in bliss smiled his mind already moving off somewhere else she could almost see it racing ahead of them down the windy lane a striker needing a swift score before somebody blew the whistle she tried to intercept you learn anything back there about roddy lodge and lynsey davies just threw up more questions if he was suddenly getting his leg over half the girlies in ross why the older woman thanks you know what i mean whats more curious i wouldve thought merrily said is why if hes doing so well with real live women why the wall full of dead pinups ahead of them she could see lights in the garage complex where andy mumford would be working stolidly on alone in the bungalow with roddys gallery she didnt want to see that again and was worried that bliss was going to ask her to and whats ariconium frannie eh the word ariconium was inscribed on a stone in the hall i dont know ive seen a few mentions of it around the village listen are you up for this now roddy you can ask him about the dead ladies merrily shivered frannie its a police station not a wine bar hes going to be on his guard he isnt going to tell me anything that he wouldnt tell you i really cant see that it merrily he stopped at the edge of the garage forecourt by the police tape let me be the judge eh thats one of the things im worried about merrily said the tower the cairns woman was sitting alone in the glasssided recording booth cradling this curvedbacked ovation guitar she wore this long dark blue dress and the white streak in her tumbled hair was like a silk ribbon that had come undone from up in the darkness of the gallery about ten feet above the halflit studio floor she looked yeah ok impossibly romantic made you want to puke jane in her tight little woollen top directed a resentful glare at eirion besotted the bastard as the goddess moira put on her headphones and began adjusting the tuning on the ovation on the other side of jane in the tiny gallery was lol who wasnt playing on this track it was going to be a traditional folk song stripped down jane was relieved to see how lol kept looking away from the lovely moira to where prof levin was hovering over his mixing board like a bald eagle earlier while eirion had been drooling around the cairns woman shed told lol and prof all about gomer and the hateful pendulum of fate and the impossible fix the poor little guy was in and the dilemma should he even be going back into a really backbreaking job working alone at his age but what would become of him mentally and emotionally if he didnt prof levin who was not that much younger than gomer had said that if this planthire thing was what the man did age was a meaningless consideration but he would say that wouldnt he here in his cosy studio later jane had privately conveyed to lol as much as she knew about the even more grisly sequel to the fire involving this roddy lodge stuff she hadnt even passed on to eirion because mum had told her not to but there were going to be no secrets from lol right nothing to make him feel insecure in the relationship and therefore open to a lowlevel fingered riff started up on the guitar in the drumtight ambience and then the voice came in a voice that was low and heavy with dark magic and loaded with this beckoning sexuality bitch jane snatched a glance at lol noticing that he was looking less than relaxed maybe wondering and with reason why mum herself hadnt phoned to explain why she hadnt been able to see him just lately he was wearing one of his sweatshirts with the roswell alien face on the chest and his hair was nearly long enough again for the old ponytail he was sitting very still there was more jane wanted to say but you werent allowed even to whisper up here or the wrath of prof would come down on everyone and she couldnt do that to eirion for whom this place was a bloody temple other people tact and consideration walking on eggshells life was getting like some fragile little comedy of manners jane sighed and leaned back in her canvas chair and listened to the song predictable tragicballad stuff about a lady who waited in her tower room watching every day at the window for her unsuitable suitor and secret lover to return from the wars the way you did eirion was nodding hands on his knees so impressionable she glanced at lol he was biting his lower lip the way mum would when something worrying was taking shape in a traditional narrative ballad there were no wasted words and no sentiment long years passed and the hair of the lady in the tower was starting to go grey her father was bringing wouldbe suitors to her door but of course she wasnt interested and refused even to see them jane thought of penelope queen of ithaca waiting for odysseus to return from troy as the seasons turned she moaned and cried to the moon and the sinking sun and the flowers grew and the flowers died how long can a war go on and then suddenly in this moment of like startling telepathy jane began to hear what she was sure lol must be hearing the awful subtext of the song the realization just flew over her like a ghostly barn owl and she was sure she must actually have flinched the song was a mirror image of lols own situation the tower was the granary on the edge of profs land and the person in the tower was lol himself the lol who would wait for long hours days weeks for mum to come to him she having to come to him because of the covert nature of their affair and it was she who was out there following a vocation that for two thousand years had been the exclusive preserve of men and working in its darkest places it was mum who was away at the war moiras voice had grown thin with despair this was a voice that killed the cliché of the form invoking not so much beery folk clubs as the smoky jazz cellars of another era a voice laden with doomed love jane thought in horror it has to change doesnt it it cant go on she knew that lol considered his music trivial next to mums spiritual work he probably felt as confined and helpless as furious and impotent as he once had in periods between medication like outside of a recording booth he had no reality it would never occur to him the way it occurred to jane that mum and the church too might just be wallowing in selfdeception for lol it wouldnt be the validity of what mum was doing that mattered as much as her having the nerve to go out and do it one bright morning the lady in the song is looking out from her tower and sees a lone horseman and her heart takes a great leap at this point moiras voice rose about an octave and jane saw profs bald head nodding in satisfaction she didnt actually know how the song was going to end but she knew a bit about traditional music and she recognized the fearful shrillness of false hope as moira cairns sang it was the springtime of the year and the sun was in the sky but the messenger climbed down from his horse and night was in his eyes right so next time her lover appeared in the tower it would be as a ghostly apparition it was always as a ghost last night he came to me my dead love came in when the next verse didnt come jane looked down and saw that the cairns womans fingers had fallen away from the strings she stood for a moment as if shed forgotten the words and then jane heard her call across the studio listen prof can we leave this one for tonight huh prof said something that jane didnt hear eirion clutching the wooden railing at the edge of the narrow gallery exhaled a word that might have been awesome aye moira replied to prof goose over ma grave lets move on di frannie bliss at the wheel again said if you ask me those people those villagers the real locals not the white settlers they bloody know they know at gut level that hes done it before theyve more or less given us another name melanie pullman youre still naturally suspicious of country people arent you frannie merrily said you dont understand them so they scare you a bit balls bliss drove past the pub with the hare on the sign where only last night merrily and gomer had huddled over a mobile waiting for roddy to drive past with his cargo no all right they do scare me they have a different morality its a fact is it not that country people kill without too much thought farmers hunting types they dont even question it its still a big step to hunting people she pushed her cold hands into the opposite sleeves of her coat chinese style the car heater wasnt doing anything for her basically she didnt want to go to hereford police station to absorb confidences from a killer she wanted to go home i dont know bliss said and unless lodge opens up to you tonight well be fighting for every scrap of the picture and thats why i want to get into lifting some more septic tanks tomorrow soon as its light if i can on your own youre going to sign out the west mercia police shovel ah well bliss speeded up the wipers as it happens youve put your finger on a minor logistical problem there merrily i want to lift a couple of efflapures right now i could get onto headquarters obtain the necessary chitties and have a nice professional jcb team out here accompanied by a bunch of nice regional crime squad boys with a detective superintendent in green wellies and its byebye francis thanks for all your help modern policing merrily said you cant get around it but think what that would cost and suppose im wrong also theyd make a mess of a lorra nice gardens specially with all this rain weve been having so what im saying how much better how much more discreet how much less likely to cause a panic if we have a small operation conducted by a feller who really knows his efflapures its an argument i suppose good man your mr parry bliss said a very able contractor everybody says that merrily rose up against her seat belt forget it listen it makes a lorra sense feller who can whip em out put em back no mess might even make a better job of it but gomers got a personal axe to grind on roddy lodge which is why i thought he might be happy to do it frannie you are so irresponsible aw merrily whats he gonna do plant evidence bring his own bodies bliss drove placidly through the scattered lights of the village of much birch im assuming not all gomers plant was destroyed i mean hell be able to put his hands on a digger of sorts im not even going to answer that you just did bliss said thank you reverend she scowled i cant help feeling that something heres swallowing us up me and gomer lets not be melodramatic merrily maybe its just you she said and your voracious ambition bliss laughed presently they crested a hill and there was the city of hereford laid out before them like an illuminated pinball table postsession they were all except for lol crammed into the scruffy kitchen behind the studio where prof levin had his cappuccino machine going pinned to the wall over the sink was the proposed cover for lols album he was shown in black and white in an empty field wearing his roswell alien sweatshirt someone had made him take off his glasses so that he looked totally disorientated which was quite a smart move actually in janes view the album title was stamped diagonally across the photo in stencilled packingcase lettering alien which was cool it was a very cool cover altogether like lol had been taken away and brought back but not to the place hed been taken from it wouldnt have his name on the front so that the punters would have to take it out of the rack to find out who it was by she asked prof levin is it actually going to happen for him this time do you think jane what can i say its a strange and lovely album it needs word of mouth people say ive got an awfully big mouth well there you go and eirions very good at manipulating the net it all helps prof levin wore an oversized king of the hill tshirt his offwhite beard was freshly trimmed he was the man eirion said right now eirion was chatting up the woman having done his innocent nervous approach all pinkcheeked and lovable the smarmy git assuring her he had all her albums for heavens sake he was too young to have all of moira cairnss albums lol meanwhile had disappeared so whats on your mind jane prof said oh i well i was just thinking that it would be like seriously useful if lol was to become mega very soon i mean not for the money or the fame as such prof levin inclined his head overconveying curiosity behind him the cappuccino machine was making impatient noises give me a moment darling and ill be with you prof said to the machine jane said like if he was so big so famous well we all know it wouldnt go to his head because because it just wouldnt i agree totally i mean if he was famous enough that people would be like hey can it really be true that lol robinson is going out with some little woman vicar does that make sense prof levin considered some see its not as if she thinks shes any kind of big deal but he does he thinks shes spiritually over his head like too good for him i suppose literally when in fact hes probably been to places we cant even imagine mixing with really mad people on a level that even most psychiatrists never reach prof said gently i think perhaps she understands that jane but maybe they have one or two things to work out before they consider going public i still think itd be useful if he was out there up there recognized you know i think he thinks that too though hed never give me a break prof levin spread his hands i agree so is there anything else we can do prof shook his head i think what we do jane just for the moment is nothing i think we butt out and let what happens happen jane saw him lift his gaze across the room towards the cairns woman she heard eirion asking the scottish siren something about a man who played the pennine pipes whatever they were moira was smiling politely but her attention was on the doorway lol coming in so wheres your mother now jane prof levin said shes er working i think coming down from the gallery jane had said to lol im sure mum was going to call you tonight shes just been kind of overburdened lol had merely nodded and then gone outside on his own into the night the alien oh god prof called to lol jane was just telling me she thinks you should get out more no i didnt jane felt the blush coming turned her head away she heard lol saying i wouldnt argue he came over prof would it be feasible for you to spare me for the odd day ive kind of ive just agreed to maybe take on this kind of parttime job job prof said mildly what kind of job manual lol looked down at his guitarists fingers ill wear gloves obviously sure whatever prof turned to attend to his cappuccino machine casually assembling mugs manual is fine maybe you could also do bingo calling at night to help destroy your voice lol explained to jane i called gomer i havent got an hgv licence or anything but i can do the handdigging and things jane blinked what just to clear the backlog keep the business going until he can get things reorganized youre jane stared at him in dismay he was sweating lightly his hair roughed up youre going to work with like shit of all the people shed thought might be able to step in and help gomer even considering eirion for heavens sake jane felt herself going deeply red humiliated conspired against the cairns woman tossed back her lovely hair and started to laugh her croaky glaswegian laugh aye she said the therapeutic power of shit thats been overlooked for years on the other hand it would at least get lol away from this bitch pulling into the car park at hereford police station bliss said im not even going to attempt to compromise you this is down to your own conscience merrily no tapes no video no tricks no water glasses up against the door just let him talk and then you can tell me as much or as little as you want to when merrily got out of the car her legs felt as unsupportive as they had last night when she was taking her first steps into the ruins of gomers yard bliss joined her under the lighted entrance on the gaol street side therell be an alarm you can sound if he makes any kind of move ill show you all that and well be directly outside merrily pushed a hand through her damp hair could i go to the loo first prayer for guidance you forgot how many toilet cubicles had served as emergency chapels please get me through this they walked up a ramp to the modest entrance inside utility seating under crimestoppers posters a man sitting in the window briefcase by his feet a whitehaired sergeant appeared and raised a hand to bliss francis a moment two minutes douglas and ill be with you bliss led merrily through a door and then through a couple of offices both unoccupied you want the lavvy now maybe you could show me the room where were going to do it sure one of the interview rooms i thought he smiled tightly you want to bless it first or something when she saw the interview room she thought a blessing wouldnt be such a bad idea claustrophobic was too friendly a word it was below ground level a bunker almost opposite the cells a windowless cube no more than nine feet square with fluorescent lights and airconditioning vents the air felt like very old air reconditioned bloody hell merrily said bliss shrugged its not the flamin parkinson show merrily now do you want the bog or do you want to stay here and purify the place while i fetch roddy there were two chairs one small table a microphone for the tape was plumbed into one of the brownfibred walls merrily sat down in one of the chairs and said glumly whatever you like the whitehaired sergeant was in the doorway francis douglas cant this wait the sergeant said when you came in did you happen to notice a young man with a briefcase does he concern me that the sergeant said was mr lodges solicitor bliss stared at him douglas mr lodge hasnt gorra fuckin solicitor he refused a solicitor you were there you go and explain that to this kid then douglas said the solicitor was on his feet waiting for them he wore black framed jarvis cocker glasses under glossy dark hair streaked with gold he looked all of twentyfour but he had to be older to have qualified hes a new one bliss peered through the glass office in ross douglas said ryan nye highflyer hes hardly out the fuckin nest i did try to warn you francis but your phone was turned off yeh bliss walked out into the reception area mr nye di francis bliss how can i help ryan nye smiled affably if a little nervously shaking hands mr bliss this isnt my usual sort of thing so i hope youll excuse my naivety but i was rather hoping you could either charge my client or release him hes not well is he not well in what way exactly sir i rather thought youd have been informed headache nausea disorientation it can be a very disorientating experience sir getting arrested for murder and im afraid i dont see him being charged tonight then i really think he should see a doctor or look im trying to be helpful here have you thought about a psychiatrist bliss folded his arms are you an expert on mental health mr nye of course im not im trying to be helpful you have reason to think he might harm himself sir his behaviours erratic thats all im saying bliss was silent for a moment then he said as a matter of fact and i dont know whether hes mentioned this to you sir he has asked to see a priest what for the last rites ryan nyes face expressed pained disbelief look inspector its my impression that mr lodge doesnt want to see anybody at all and i certainly wouldnt advise would you like us to go and ask him again sir no i wouldnt actually he certainly didnt say anything to me about a priest i really do think you should consider quite carefully what ive been saying my client is not a well man outside bliss went off like an inexpensive firework storming into the night then fizzling out next to a lurid traffic car at the front of the station looking like he wished he had the energy to put his fist through its windscreen or into the face of roddy lodges solicitor mr ryan nye spoiling his glossy streaked coiffure dislodging his jarvis cocker glasses you know what this means he leaned against the traffic car means weve gorra leave the light on in roddys cell have an officer peeping in at him all night also means ive gorra get onto the stonebow unit at the hospital and drag a psychiatric nurse over here and if anything happens to him im up the swanee merrily said you dont really want him to be mentally ill do you hes not mentally ill hes a crafty sod fuckin nora where do these leeching bastards come from is this lad an ambulance chaser or did somebody engage him on roddys behalf frannie merrily looked over a traffic queue to the new magistrates court that the planners had allowed to eat up a useful car park be careful ok merrily went home by taxi she hung her coat over the post at the foot of the stairs and fed the cat alone in the vicarage she felt edgy and unclean and also guilty at being grateful to roddy lodges flash young lawyer for sparing her an intimate session with a man who kept eroticized pictures of dead women on his bedroom walls it was nearly nine pm to get this out of the way she rang the reverend jerome banks rural dean for rossonwye she remembered him as a wiry man with an abrupt manner an exarmy officer whod once served alongside james bulldavies at brecon if roddy lodge had been mentally unstable he ought to have spotted the signs she got his answering machine and left her name would try again tomorrow she had a shower washed her hair thinking of jane at knights frome with lol wishing she was there after putting on a clean alb she still felt uncomfortable a little clammy she was pulling her black woollen shawl around her shoulders ready to walk over to the church for some further cleansing when the phone rang it was the reverend jerome banks mad he said oh yes absolutely barking id say recognizing madness had someone followed her in if it was a footstep it was a light one it might be a cat sometimes cats came into the church and once thered been a badger but badgers werent stealthy they clattered and rummaged merrily was sitting in the old choirmasters oaken chair with her hands on her knees a single small candle lit on the altar fifteen feet away a draught from somewhere bending the flame making shadows swirl and dip and rise to the nightdulled stainedglass window at the top of the chancel ledwardine church was locked soon after dark nowadays unless a service or a meeting was scheduled shed let herself in through the side entrance which at least had a key you didnt need both hands to turn against all advice she hadnt locked the door behind her it was fundamentally important to feel she had protection in here inside this great medieval nightdormant engine or else what was the point probably hadnt been a footstep at all after a day like this the world seemed riddled with tunnels of obsession for a cold moment merrily held before her an image of the frozen smiles of all the dead women on roddy lodges bedroom walls as they writhed in other womens bodies and then she let it fade whispering the lords prayer apart from having to give evidence at the inquest on lynsey davies her role in this particular police investigation was probably over and yet shifting restlessly in the choirmasters chair how could it be over when she was still attached via gomer who would never back off until lodge had been convicted for nev plus here was frannie bliss about to exploit gomer in the interests of keeping the case in his pocket bad selfish policing and he knew it maverick cops were for the movies and frannie was on a narrowing tightrope meanwhile roddy lodge barking of course the reverend jerome banks had said at once a complete fantasist wanted to tell me about the ghosts hed been seeing all over the place well isnt as if you and i havent met lots of people like this all the clergy do they seek us out expecting tea and cakes and a sympathetic ear that also happens to be entirely uncritical hardly dangerous in the normal i mean not even to themselves not in the normal course of things well hardly going to spew out all this to the detective chappie was i what was i supposed to say boy didnt seem deranged in a psychotic sense i had absolutely no reason at all to suspect he might ever do what hes done well of course i hadnt so you just offered him a sympathetic ear no i said that was what these people expected personally ive never been one to play the jolly old dimwitted vicar thats whats got the church into its present enfeebled condition if you ask me public starts to think were all halfbaked and this chap was getting on my nerves to be quite honest bumptious full of himself never seen the like i wasnt entirely sure to tell you the truth if he wasnt taking the piss you said he came specifically to tell you about the ghosts he said he was seeing look jerome banks had made an exasperated rumbling noise he was asking me how his property could possibly be haunted how this could happen when it wasnt an old house just built it himself so how could it be haunted i said had he put the pipes in properly had he had the wiring checked by experts he was hearing strange noises you mean lights were going on and off that kind of i dont know thats what usually happens isnt it look mrs watkins im not awfully ashamed to admit ive never really been into that kind of malarkey dont know how you people manage to keep a straight face half the time and anyway this was rather before your time so the only alternative wouldve been to refer him to your predecessor old dobbs who was completely bloody barking in my view well in everybodys view really so i was rather relieved when lodge reared up aghast said no he didnt want any of that thank you very much any of what you know prayers for the unquiet dead then why did he come to see you his family was baptist anyway surely no idea at all never met the chap before so did he say what kind of manifestation hed been experiencing oh it was probably all washing over me by then i didnt take detailed notes you know as well as i do that we could spend all our time listening to all kinds of complete nonsense but when youve got half a dozen parishes to organize you have to adjust your patiencelevel accordingly when exactly was this probably in my diary somewhere but off the cuff two years ago three she hadnt pushed him any further but she guessed there was quite a lot he wasnt saying not her business anyway merrily let her head roll shoulder to shoulder with tiny cracklings like the beginnings of fire in kindling her woollen shawl was a distraction she let it slip over the back of the chair and began to relax her body starting with her toes tightening muscles letting go warmth would come for a while shed resisted easterninfluenced meditation the awakening of the chakras as vaguely unchristian and also very jane but the demands of deliverance especially had brought out a need for experience on a deeper level a need to find moments of knowing there were still too many times when she was appalled at her own weakness and ignorance the frailty of her faith a woman of straw ok humility was crucial but so was a small hot core of certainty some kind of retreat might have helped restore her inner balance but thered never been time for that hadnt even been time for a holiday this job was smothering her it was everywhere like fog lose thoughts concentrate on the breathing it had taken her some time to realize that this was not about breathing consciously but becoming conscious of your breathing simple things like that gradually the fabric of the church faded the stonework the stained glass the roodscreen with its carved apples the pulpit where she tried to preach while hating the word preach with all its connotations the entrance to the bull chapel with its eerily sleepless effigy after a time the church ceased to be its furniture its artefacts now came the space the atmosphere the charged air this was the church her spine straightened from what she hadnt realized had been a slump there was a warmth in her chest her breathing was deepening there was a moment when the warmth aroused an underlying pleasure that was close to sexual she had a glimpse of lol and let it go at once you just let it go without guilt or selfrecrimination you let the breath become the spirit and the spirit filled you pouring down to the stomach with that strange active relaxation of the solar plexus separation breath of god god breathes me and at some stage entered prayer thack merrilys eyelids sprang back the building seemed to shudder as though the pews the pulpit the stone tombs had been brutally hurled back into place she knew at once what it was knew every little noise this church made after hours the latch when you were used to it you could let the iron latch on the side door slip silently back into place when you werent the latch came down hard thack someone had been in here with her for a while and then gone out or wanted her to think theyd gone out the draught had died the candle flame was placid now making a nest of light on the altar merrily rose quietly stood under the roodscreen and listened intently for more than a minute staring down the central aisle rat eyes in the dark anyway she refused to be intimidated if theyd gone theyd gone if they hadnt she was safer up here close to the altar she hadnt finished anyway she knelt in the centre of the chancel and prayed for gomer and for roddy lodge and for frannie bliss who confused police work with poker his cards up against his shirtfront always raising the stakes she waited for two or three minutes before coming to her feet bowing her head gathering her shawl from the back of the choirmasters chair and going to the altar to snuff out the candle she listened again there was nothing to be heard inside not even the skittering of mice only the wind from outside the row of high plain diamondpaned windows was opaque no moon to light her way down the aisle she always thought she could find her way blindfold around this church but twice she collided with the ends of pews nerves at the bottom of the aisle merrily walked into something that should not have been there and fell hard onto the stone flags the original plan had been to return to the studio to carry on working until midnight but after jane and eirion had left moira had said she was tired so prof had suggested they wind up soon after this gomer had phoned the familiar old buzz under his voice how you fixed for ten oclock boy tomorrow the mobile had halted lol at the door maglite in hand about to guide moira back along the track to the granary hed been thinking maybe hed have a week or so at least until after nevs funeral to get himself a little fitter before gomer summoned him to make a fool of himself laying field drainage under the sardonic gaze of some radnor valley sheep farmer police it is see cant say too much on the phone but anything thatll help bury that bastard ill do it they knows that were working for the police cant say too much ten oclock boy early night for you too then moira said when he folded up the phone hand me the torch laurence i can see mself back youll need someone to run for help if you get attacked lol said moira rolled her eyes taking down her black cloak from one of the hooks inside the stable door the cloak was well worn he noticed and its hem was frayed she walked outside and waited for him the night was dry now and the wind seemed to have pulled back into the west leaving a thin breeze they followed the pool of torchlight along the track between two old oaks avoiding the puddles moira said janes mother your friend howd she come to be doing that job you dont believe in a calling no becoming a priest i can understand that part in other circumstances i mightve gone that way too who can say i was meaning the exorcism side of it i dont know how many women priests would be doing that job but id guess not many no how it happened was a year or two ago she was faced with something she couldnt explain a well a haunting and the church wasnt helpful and she made some comments at a particular conference about the lack of any kind of real advice for the clergy on the paranormal and there was a guy there who was about to become the new bishop of hereford and he had this oldstyle exorcist he wanted to get rid of he tossed her in there cold there was a training course oh right a training course so thats all right then he looked at moira her cloak billowing a little as if it was responding to her annoyance she said were there no some aspects of herself she needed to resolve perhaps just that ive talked to a couple of exorcists over the years and they both got into this particular ministry to try and understand certain experiences or abilities theyd discovered they possessed precognition clairvoyance mediumship common ground there for you oh aye its all been pretty much normal with me since i was a wee girl hereditary from ma mother she stopped pulling the cloak around her i suppose what always bothered me most was not that i was sensing stuff that just seemed to go flying past other people but why why me y know what was i supposed to do with it was there some wider purpose or was it just there to give me a hard time penance from another life or some shit like that i just wondered if this was how it was with your friend if she had personal stuff to come to terms with lol shook his head she wouldnt claim to be psychic she realizes she was brought in because she was a woman youngish personable new image thats it really and shes trying really hard to live up to it jesus moira ducked as more trees locked branches overhead these guys have some things to answer for dont they just the administrators the politicians the power people with their meaningless degrees and their cheesy tony blair smiles who think finding their sensitive side is learning how to change nappies and slice the fucking quiche they never appoint people they believe can actually do anything in case they do it too well just the ones theyre pretty sure they can control hes gone now anyway lol stopped at an old footbridge over the narrow river frome which had seeped through the summer and now was racing with the rains of autumn you think that as a normal person with no obvious special attributes she maybe shouldnt be doing what shes doing moira leaned against the bridges damp wooden railing it bother you what she does well its not really my place oh come on its just that she was doing it before we does it scare you maybe not as much as it should he pointed the maglite vertically so that it made a white cone in the air i dont know or maybe youre more afraid of whats in here moira pointed to the side of her head than what just might be out there she levered herself away from the rail well more often than not in my experience laurence they are one and the same seems to me she crossed the footbridge ach this is none of my no go on a single light gleamed ahead of them shed taken his advice and left a light on in the granary so that when they came out the other side of the trees they could see it in the middle distance it would be lovely moira said to think that the holy church confers protection but i cannae help thinking that the awful mess that is modern anglicanism is now becoming so far removed from the source that being an anglican exorcist deliverance consultant maybe its a wee bit like going into an unknown tropical jungle without your injections carrying a road map of the home counties deliverance consultant jesus the weakkneed bastards cant even say what they mean lol stopped on the bridge beneath it the swollen frome foamed and spat it wasnt the river he thought he knew from the far bank moira said so i was lunching today with your notinvariablyamiable local clergyman the reverend simon st john a serious psychic dogged all his life by premonitions apparitions all the bloody itions you can name still thinking of it as a kind of sickness and the church of england as his sanatorium guy wholl run a mile from the unexplained lol joined her on the bank uneasy the torch beam showed the frayed hem of moiras cloak trailing in the mud she didnt seem concerned simon and i were discussing your problem the need to keep up appearances in truth we couldnae see you at the heart of village life in your alien sweatshirt handing round the vol auvents at the vicarage garden party then stepping up on the podium with the boswell guitar to perform a couple of angsty numbers for the parishioners simon said if it was him in merrilys shoes they could all go eat their lace curtains but then hes a guy the kind of guy lol reflected who never worried about appearances and got away with it merrily tended not to get away with anything in the end though we couldnae come up with an easy answer although simon said itd be a terrible shame if you didnae come through the two of you not least he said because of what shes doing this lonely path full of doubt and soul searching and wondering whether youre going clean out of your mind she needs somebody around her whos up to recognizing madness thanks as for the wee girl jane they came to the granary the light from the window outlining the steps some problem there laurence my impression not a happy kid i may be wrong i dont think so merrily limped into the vicarage dragging the black sack after her an ordinary herefordshire council mediumquality plastic bin liner under the security light over the church porch shed taken one look inside and then closed the top quickly spinning the sack round and round she shut the front door and stood with her back to it panting she felt as if something was making circles of madness around her she didnt know whether to call the police tonight or tomorrow shed call them tomorrow she needed to sleep on this needed to sleep full stop except jane wasnt back yet she was late shed expected to be home by eleven because eirion would then have to head back to abergavenny and it was already twenty past ok not overlate maybe she should wait ten minutes before ringing lol at the studio to see what time theyd left she left the bin sack in the hall went into the kitchen and found the germolene pulling up her alb to expose the kind of cut knees that jane was always bringing home as a kid rubbed some on couldnt be bothered with plasters she went to put the kettle on lit a cigarette and stood for a few moments staring through the open door at the print of holman hunts light of the world the housewarming gift from uncle ted a tired and disillusioned middleaged jesus doing this sorrowful simper ill hold up the lamp but i dont really expect any of you to follow she thought sod it went into the hall and brought back the sack that someone had left at the bottom of the aisle someone who had entered the church while she was praying left the bin liner and crept away leaving her to fall over it afterwards shed sat there on the stone flags which also served as memorials feeling the lumps in the sack thinking of roddy lodge and dead bodies now she emptied the contents onto the kitchen table she stared at the heap again and tried to laugh this was beyond insane merrily sat down at the table picked up one bundle pulled off the rubber band and counted out the notes slowly and meticulously in fifties there must be forty or fifty similar bundles on the top of one there was a printed note on a quarterfolded sheet of a copier paper for maintenance of the church at ledwardine without the need for commercial enterprise a donation she heard a car pull up outside a door slam eirions familiar parting tap on the horn she swept the bundles into the bin liner rapid footsteps on the path then janes key jiggling around in the lock as she pulled the bag into the scullery the phone began to ring how did it go huw owen said huh sorry huw i the meeting lass the mobilephone mast oh god was that this year sorry quite a lots happened since then no ted didnt raise it in the end however merrily pulled out the chair slumped into it stretched out her sore legs and suddenly felt like talking not about the bundled money she wasnt up to discussing that not until shed puzzled out a few things she told him instead about roddy lodge from gomers fire and the death of nev to the discovery of the body on the truck from the visit to lodges bungalow to the interviewroom session that didnt happen it took about twentyfive minutes after half a day with manic frannie and the shock of the bin bag laying out the lodge affair for the stoical huw was almost relaxing underhowle eh he said not a place id ever been to before dobbs went huw said sorry the late tommy dobbs your esteemed predecessor he were in underhowle a few years ago not at the invitation of the rural dean he wasnt unless ive been misled whos the rd banks happen before his time five six years ago summat like that haunting job sort of reason i remember it dobbs did summat hed never been known to do before mmm he rang me for advice in the normal way his consultative procedure would begin and end with god flattering merrily was thinking this couldnt involve lodges bungalow because it wasnt even built then were you able to assist i er no he were right in this instance not our usual thing alleged case of what im afraid youd have to call alien abduction yes that wouldve fazed him mr owen he says always one for formality was dobbs humanoid entities in silver suits what does this convey to you mr owen course dobbs didnt have a telly buggerall use referring him to star trek this was in underhowle someone in underhowle was claiming to have had a close encounter several as i recall several encounters not several people only one person young woman late teens i believe dobbs did a report on it for the record to cover himself sent me a copy i could probably find it for you but i expect sophiell have it on the files up at the cathedral if youre interested dobbs found it disturbing because he didnt think the girl was lying or mentally ill but he still couldnt do owt with it ive heard of alleged alien cases where blessings or minor exorcisms have helped mind which makes you wonder if there isnt a spiritual dimension to some of these socalled close encounters not this time though merrily yawned ok perhaps ill have a glance at the records you never know do you you wouldnt remember the name of the girl for the file reference aye vaguely summat like yours melissa no melanie pullford melanie pullford merrily stiffened couldnt have been pullman its possible because if shes been abducted by aliens again this time they forgot to bring her back been missing two years bliss thinks lodge might have killed her you have any thoughts on that aye tell the bugger if it was confidential between the girl and deliverance that might not be entirely ethical tell him anyroad i dont like coincidence he wont do owt mind hes a copper if even the likes of us are suspicious of alien abduction on the whole not the best thing to say late at night to merrily who always felt responsible especially if nobody else did sometimes your most appealing quality jane had said once but most of the time your worst fault she sighed and made a note on the sermon pad to call sophie first thing and then gomer phoned and told her what he was doing in the morning he and lol merrily went anxiously to bed that night and anxiously to sleep had anxious dreams part three it is important to acknowledge common experiences that emerge in all world cultures and religions when we are living in an evershrinking global village all cultures including our own acknowledge the existence of spirits at levels beyond the human we call them angels matthew fox and rupert sheldrake the physics of angels holes it had to be had to be but now on the steps of chapel house merrily was sandbagged by second thoughts how did you do this how did you go about accusing someone of giving you eighty grand tell me jenny box had said the other night on the square have you asked god for the money have you asked god it was a very old house as old as the vicarage but better kept a narrow cobbled alley now separated it from the timber framed row that began with the black swan shed always thought it was called chapel house because it was across the street from the former zionist chapel now selling antique furniture obviously the house was centuries older than the chapel but shed imagined it being renamed around the turn of last century when nonconformism was hot beginning to feel conspicuous merrily lifted the knocker let it fall and heard a long echo from inside the house with any luck jenny box would be out this was a bad move she wasnt ready yet how could she not have come after breakfast jane had casually told her what she already knew that lol had elected to become an unskilled labourer for gomer and theyd stared at one another for a moment jane displaying hostility like this was merrilys fault while merrily wondered if the kid could possibly know the worst of it what it was likely to involve evidently not at about nine eirion had picked her up and theyd said they were heading back into wales for the day if theyd secretly been going to join gomer and lol in the search for decaying bodies under waste tanks jane might have thrown up a smokescreen but eirion wouldnt when theyd gone shed tried to ring lol twice no answer why did he still find it so hard to accept that someone might want him to be there spooked by the way the lodge affair was starting to surround them all like a blanket of smog shed pulled the plastic sack from under the desk in the scullery emptying it out again to make sure she hadnt dreamed its contents and carefully counting it all this time eighty thousand pounds exactly for the church right ok shed knotted the neck of the sack and called the deliverance office in hereford got the answering machine sophie must be down at the palace with the bishop merrily had left a message asking if they happened to have the melanie pullman file and if so could sophie email it it had been then stowing the bin sack under the desk that shed realized shed finally run out of reasons for putting off a confrontation with mrs box inevitably the old oak door of chapel house opened not bumping and scraping like the front door of the vicarage but gliding and here was mrs box carefully madeup or rather madedown her hair was brushed and shining and her face wore pale foundation but no lipstick no eyeshadow she was wearing a simple black dress with a loose cord around the waist why merrily smiling her gracious smile this silkyvoiced willowy woman the exmodel who would always make you feel graceless and untidy you couldntve timed it better i was just off to my morning prayers now we can go together oh she was waiting for me she knew id come merrily turned to descend the steps thinking theyd be off to the church but jenny box had already slipped back into the dimness of the old house well come on then merrily ive been dying to show this to someone whod really understand gomer was standing up in the minijcb leaning forward like a horseman on stirrups to witness the uncovering easy now boy dont you scratch him as most of the tank had been buried and seemed to be coated with tough rubber it was hard to imagine how a few scratches would matter but this was gomers show gomers world lol eased up using the tip of the spade like a trowel teasing away shards of clay this was how theyd unearthed the first efflapure a big rubber ball full of human waste slow and careful as though it was likely to explode like a giant landmine in a welter of shrapnel and shit you couldnt pull it out without emptying it first and they hadnt got a convenient tanker so it was a question of digging down to it getting underneath and lol was waistdeep in the hole his jeans soaked through because hed said no to plastic trousers outside the hole it was already late morning but the sun was like a softboiled egg across the long field beyond the garden fence there were still woolly rolls of mist on the hill above underhowle howle hill this would be hanging a literal name on a village that lol had never heard of until today he didnt know this area and hed never been to the forest of dean which andy mumford said began the other side of the hill he didnt know it and yet he was already inside it feeling its juices smelling its smell everything here was earthy and pungent but it was also thankfully kind of unreal middle earth gomerland mumford was standing well clear saving his suit from mud spurts as if hed picked up lols thoughts on some mental police wavelength he whispered loudly into the hole you see anything or smell anything apart from gods earth mr robinson you come out of there quick and we summon the white people meaning the forensic people white coveralls until then it would be just the three of them two seasoned professionals and a wimpy little singer with muscles like sponge cake guitar fingers delving in mud and slime gomerland maybe inches away from meddling with the dead which would then be merrilyland smell mr sandford whose garden this was had been peering in quite intrigued but now he jumped back alarmed smell here it came the first shower of outrage i thought this was just a formality thats what inspector bliss told us on the phone he said it was just yes sir im sure thats right mumford said no youre not you think theres the colour was flaking from mr sandfords smooth face a dead flaming body down there mike here came the blonde wife tottering in unsuitable sandals at the edge of their bungalows colonialstyle verandah mike oh for gods sake glossy lips retracting in revulsion it is this melanie pullman isnt it theyre looking for melanie pullmans body oh please not here you got some information you havent told us about sandford was waving his wife away and backing off from the hole like it might widen and swallow him he was about lols age wearing sweats and trainers suburban weekendwear in an area of wellpatched tweeds overalls and waterproofs hed told them hed taken half a day off work for this please calm down sir mumford said in his stolid farmerly way we dont know anything like i said this is just one of a number of installations well be checking out in the course of the day in fact six lol had been told in an area roughly bounded by the towns of ross ledbury and coleford this was the first recently installed and less than half a country mile from underhowle where this roddy lodge lived from gomer lol had learned a lot about lodge liar conman incompetent installer of overpriced drainage systems the man who murdered nev also a woman they were here to look for number three why deny it dont expect this do you mr sandford had returned nervously to the edge of the hole his wife had gone back into the house shed be calming herself by phoning friends lol thought this was how panic spread the next house they arrived at discretion would no longer be an option no lol said you dont move out the bloody city to find a place where your kids can walk home from school in safety and just when you finally think youve mr sandford nodded at the exposed tank how long before you know lol shook his head the pit gomer had excavated on two sides of the efflapure was wide enough now for him to move around the tank he reversed the spade holding it twohanded just above the blade and began to scrape soil from the curved rubbery casing his arms already stiffening under sleeves of drying mud youve got a job locally he asked mr sandford talking only to cover his own nerves because if there was something dead down here he was likely to be getting very close to it he was aware of a dark bib of sweat spreading over the front of his tshirt computers mr sandford said oh lol took a careful sniff at the earth decay yes but vegetable surely nothing more than that gomer had said grimly youll know boy when you finds it like he was certain they were going to youre not local mr sandford said no not very lol began to prod tentatively at the peagravel around the bottom of the tank in which case you wouldnt know this is silicon valley in the making youve got a factory not me personally chris codys the genius saved the whole village from a slow death seventeen new jobs this year if you include parttime employment for cleaners and so on thats bigtime here and its just the start what software manuf lol recoiled as his spade found something in the gravel black could be a shoe he looked up at gomer the lot sandford hadnt noticed it we make computers right now the big things computers for kids it was a pipe just a thick black pipe i thought lol collected some breath unsure if this was relief because of all the bits you might uncover first a shoe would probably be the least distressing i thought kids could use anything eightyearold hackers getting into the white house and all that nah little kids this is simple computers for fouryearolds threeyearolds two or younger with games they can understand by the time they get to school theyre computerliterate and most of em can read and write puts em a couple of years ahead of other kids fantastic might look rundown and primitive round here but this place is the future and thats why all right gomer jumped down from the digger tossing his ciggy into the mud ill come in there now boy you sure gomer lol was already out of the pit a shiver up his back but you do not expect this mr sandford said watching the efflapure as if they were excavating hell itself in his halfacre garden careful now jenny box pulled back the rug in her oakpanelled hall revealing the hatch in the crooked wooden floor chapel house merrily said you mean even the estate agents didnt try to make anything of it mrs box said they thought twas just a little cellar a wine cellar they called it which they thought would sound more appealing to the kind of people they were expecting to buy the house she pulled back a bolt and slipped slender fingers under a black castiron ring this hatch is victorian im guessing and theyd have made a feature of it but for most of last century itd have been nothing but a storage space the hatch came up easily jenny box laid it down flat she depressed a switch in the oak panelling stone steps were softly lit from below after you reverend mrs box said merrily put a toe on the first step she was still wary of enclosed and windowless spaces after a harrowing night last candlemas in a private mausoleum in radnorshire maybe she always would be there used to be a rail mrs box said but itd fallen off and i didnt replace it twas always my feeling that going down there a certain sense of danger would be not inappropriate sometimes if im feeling a little daring ill go down in the dark and light a candle you should be a bit careful merrily said what if you fell and got trapped tssk jenny box said scornfully merrily went down the steps which curved she was wondering some kind of priests hole was the house old enough for that as she came to the bottom step she glanced back over her shoulder trepidation lightly brushing her as if the hatch might come crashing down the bolt thrown sealing her underground with what there was an absurd moment of relief when she saw jenny box following her she went forward ducking not something she had to do very often even in the oldest cottages but here the curved ceiling was at its highest only an inch or so above her head mrs box laughed lightly kneeling room only for most people today i guess people were all a lot shorter when this was built a round lantern with an electric bulb hung close to the wall and merrily saw she was in a short narrow passage its walls recently replastered and painted white a smell incense she didnt move she felt cold down here despite still wearing her coat the short woollen one newish she hadnt wanted to look too poor this morning she wants me to know is that possible go on jenny box was behind her not quite touching her go through the passage opened out into a small white room lit by a second lantern and given focus by a low wooden altar the atmosphere was suddenly so pervasive that if she hadnt been so unsettled it might have brought merrily instinctively to her knees i didnt know this even existed shed been expecting something contrived something fabricated something faintly naff but there were places where you could be brought in blindfold and youd still be instantly aware of the energy of prayer the altar was of dark oak its top a good four inches thick it had on it a small golden cloth a heavy gilt cross on a stand and two thick yellow candles in trays before it a goldcoloured rug lay on the flagged floor and the ceiling was painted gold like a chantry there was an oak settle against the back wall an incenseburner hung from what looked like a meathook in a corner and behind the altar was a tall picture involving a misty white figure with a downpointing arm extending to form what could be a sword from a small alcove in the stone wall to their left jenny box took down a box of cooks matches and moved to the altar when i contacted the previous owners well no not them because they were only here two minutes but the daughter of the people whod owned chapel house for about a halfcentury before that she said they always knew there was something funny about this cellar and in fact local people used to say it was haunted the daughter said her parents just used it as storage space for junk they didnt know its history nobody seems to but i dont think that matters no i mean i could tell straight off that there was something i had it cleaned out completely did most of it myself scrubbed for hours at the floor the first time id scrubbed a floor in many many years it seemed like an important thing to do like washing the feet of she broke off and smiled almost bashfully it had obviously even been used as a coal cellar at one time the walls were pretty filthy so i started to scrub away at them too and that was when the cross appeared merrily looked around oh its not there now jenny box struck a match it disappeared again im afraid there i was scrubbing at the wall one day and the plaster came off and it left the exact perfect shape of a cross but when i came back the next morning all the rest of the plaster had fallen off it wasnt for anyone else you see her faced tilted she sought out merrilys eyes it was to show me she said you know merrily said nothing this was no place for scepticism although it was still cold there seemed to be no intrusive air down here and when mrs box lit the candles their flames rose elegantly and brought the painting behind the altar to flickering life she saw a stormy sky over a church steeple and parting the thunderclouds the figure of white smoke with what was now clearly a naked sword its not exact jenny box said a friend of mine did it in london shes a fashion designer so i suppose the whole things a bit glib and glossy but she did her best with what i outlined to her an angel well someone said it must be the archangel uriel the one with the flaming sword and perhaps there is something in that i wish i couldve painted it myself but ive never been very good that way twas all i could do to paint the walls it was hard to imagine jenny box sweating in overalls collecting those unavoidable emulsion spots on her delicate skin well i couldnt let anyone else in not after i realized what it had been before i couldnt have vulgar fellers smoking and swearing down here now could i jenny box smiled down at merrily arms by her sides her black dress simple and monastic except for the way its velvet cord hung loose just above her hips in this moment merrily was entirely sure that this woman had left the money unpretentiously in the black plastic bin sack and in the next moment she recognized the church steeple in the painting and the wooded hills behind it its oh that parts exact mrs box said i gave her a fine set of postcards to work from merrily took a good hard look at the picture it was about two feet by four in a plain mattwhite wooden frame the paint was probably acrylic and it looked surreal now like a magritte the church hardedged an almostphotographic image no brush strokes either in the clouds airbrush probably very professional she turned to ask a simple question what does it signify jenny box had gone to sit on the oak settle her hands folded primly on her lap her face lambent like some rembrandt saint merrily saw that the question wasnt going to be needed three tanks raised and still nothing relief for the sandfords and two other householders frustration for mumford theyd moved almost in a circle around underhowle but had never gone into the village itself the last efflapure had fallen back suddenly into its pit and lol had twisted his ankle hurling himself out of the way one more mumford said and then likely well call it a day like hed been doing the digging at the last place thered been a bunch of curious villagers and this pitiful middleaged couple from monmouth whose nineteenyearold daughter had been missing for five months a relative in ross had told them about a man being arrested and the police digging for bodies anything they said was better than not knowing it was heartbreaking and probably unnecessary lol thought he was aching all over by then earlier hed listened to mumford talking to bliss on the phone arranging for the couple to meet him when do you decide this isnt working lol asked mumford as they were unloading the gear for the fourth time no point in appealing to gomer for whom this was personal isnt for me to decide mumford said likely the bossll turn up in person at some point they were on the gravel forecourt of a tall victorian stone house with an old rectory nameplate on the gate a woman of about twentyfive with short fair hair and an eyebrow ring was standing watching hands on her narrow hips after a while she sashayed over to lol you dont really think roddys a mass murderer do you dont actually know the bloke lol said hes just a little weird is he you people if somebodys weird theyre automatically some raging psychopath right im not a copper lol said hes the copper she looked over at andy mumford and rolled her eyes forget it mumford went to meet a man coming out of the house mr crewe connorcrewe piers hows it going inspector big guy well overweight certainly fiftyish with luxuriant greyspeckled hair and a wide easy smile he wore a denim shirt overhanging baggy corduroy trousers sergeant sir mumford said in the resigned way that told you sergeant was as high as he was going and even that had been unexpected thats mr parry over there hes a professional drainage contractor he wont take long and hell leave your ground without a blemish im sure thats true mr connorcrewe beamed his big round face like the friendly planet in a space picture book lol had owned as a kid just as sure as i am that youre all wasting your time here not that its my place to offer an opinion at this stage sir mumford said a very slight eyemovement conveying what lol judged to be intense interest were open to anyones opinion did you know mr lodge well obviously he installed this setup for me and its worked efficiently enough so far gomer sniffed in contempt and he had an assistant like your man here mr connor crewe said and they were both very civil very obliging which must have saved mumford a question at each of the other places hed asked if thered been anyone helping roddy lodge in each case it had been someone different and no they hadnt been there all the time mumford had said lodge was known to use cheap casual labour usually pulling someone from what he said was a bottomless local pool of fit blokes claiming sickness benefit or rather not like your man mr connorcrewe said in this case the assistant was the i believe late lynsey davies the young woman stared at him you never told me she was helping aha said connorcrewe lots of things i havent told you my sweet shit piers she said he might have dumped her here he certainly might have killed her here the way they were carrying on violent arguments one minute practically shagging in the mud the next mumford got out his notebook right he said lets have a proper chat shall we sir in the house at first lol had thought she must be connorcrewes daughter evidently not she stayed outside with him and gomer after mumford and his notebook had followed connorcrewe into the old rectory watching them mark out a circle around the efflapure which was sunk into a paddock behind the house that was a shock mind she said lynsey she looked out across the paddock and another couple of fields to the tops of some houses underhowle we all knew lynsey in ross everybodys saying she was a slag which is yeah i suppose dropping babies everywhere but thats not the whole story she was smart whos looking after them babbies now gomer said as lol uncovered the top of the globular tank she shrugged whos always looked after them grannies exboyfriends exboyfriends mums having kids never held lynsey back ace at palming them off on people can you just mind him for a hour and then she dont come back for six weeks you had to admire it in a way she had this fierce determination to experience everything she could get out of life used to buy these heavy books from pierss shop which was how i got talking to her i mean she wasnt stupid when she wasnt around any more we just figured shed gone off with some bloke could be anywhere you just couldnt imagine her being dead thats all if her wasnt stupid gomer slid an oily towrope under one of the thick rubberized loops on top of the tank how come her wound up with lodge dunno probably because he had a fair bit of money like a lot of money compared to lynseys usual men and a fast car she did use people lets be honest she was good at men you said lodge was weird lol stepped back from the tank started to cut into the turf around it with his spade he was wondering how deeply involved in all this merrily might have become because of bliss yeah well he is you talk to people round here theyll tell you like how he works at night that kind of thing ar gomer came over he got out his tobacco tin there was one cigarette already rolled in there and he offered it to the girl cheers she stuck it in her mouth gomer lit it for her works a lot at night then do he its what people say bound to get all blown up now so like suddenly hes become like this vampire she took a long needy drag and let the smoke out piers and me were in the pub last night in underhowle nobody was talking about anything else obviously but the place was divided between the people who couldnt believe hed done a murder and the ones whod always known he was a psycho like when he did mike sandfords sewerage lorna was uptight cause he was out there most of the night they could see him prowling under the full moon digging thats it for weird lol said he works nights well you know mood changes up in the clouds one day drinksareonme chasing all the women next day hes slinking around like he dont want to know you or anybody like manic depression lol said oh sorry she peered closely at him i didnt realize you were a psychologist lol smiled sadly sure youre not a copper i mean you dont look like a copper but you dont look like whatever he is either no lol was disappointed he hadnt been this muddiedup in years not physically i do like to suss people as a writer short stories plays poetry when im moved dennis potter was going to look at my tv play he lived in ross you know but then he snuffed it and your has a bookshop piers yeah in ross secondhand antiquarian i work there couple of days a week more in summer piers phoned me said i might want to come up this afternoon as a writer because you were digging for bodies hes thoughtful like that something caught her eye oh look the poor police cant get a signal lol turned and saw mumford had come out of the house was backing away staring at his mobile held at arms length he ended up next to gomers truck the phone now tight to his ear ariconium the young woman said last defensive outpost against the technoinvasion she came right up to lol she wore a black fleece the zip pushed halfway down apparently by the pressure of her breasts im cola french gosh lol didnt move really all names are real whats yours lol there you go whats ariconium lol said roman town on the old iron road between glevum and blestium thats gloucester and monmouth to you the historians say it was down the valley where westonunderpenyard is now but piers reckons most of it was where underhowle is now its his new buzzthing piers gets obsessions then theres no stopping him mumford came over leave that a moment boys woooh said cola french something came up go go go mumford ignored her jerked his chins towards the house lol and gomer trudged after him to the edge of the paddock cola french watching them from behind her writers knowing smile lets just quietly pack up the gear mumford said were on standby to meet mr bliss oh we are are we gomer said bear with us gomer mumford said tiredly been bearin with you all morning boy and we ent found a bloody thing your gaffer wants to check his information fore he gets carried away ennit my gaffer mumford said says that roddys finally talking ar talked about what he done to nev yet has he i dont know gomer they ever tell you anything andy boy mumford maybe sensing mutiny said all right this goes no further gomer looked scornful looks like hes coughed on three mumford said lynsey melanie pullman and the girl from monmouth rochelle bowen lol turned away the sky was shabby and sunless now and only the line of pylons gleamed soon as he decides to remember where theyre buried mumford said theyre bringing him out to show us that good enough for you gomer clapped his hands together producing a sharp echo from the direction of coniferclad howle hill the glory when i first came here mrs box said id spent the whole day looking for somewhere to live an agent had sent me the particulars of a place in the country out past hereford that was far too big and had all this land what was i supposed to do with seven and a half acres buy myself a tractor besides the local church was ugly and the minister was a disinterested auld devil i wont ask which one it was merrily stood with her back to the candlelit altar and the long painting doesnt matter i can see that now jenny box was demure on the oak settle hands forming a cross on her knees but at the time and for other reasons too i was very deeply depressed and the countryside was flat and unwelcoming and i felt lonely and unwanted and unnecessary you know id spent a holiday here once with my husband when things were good with us and i loved it and id built up my hopes of finding somewhere but now twas all wrong i didnt feel i belonged or was ever going to belong i was starting to question the whole idea of moving out here and the clouds were gathering and i just got into the car and drove in any direction i didnt care merrily asked hesitantly your marriage had broken up no oh no and still hasnt though he goes his own way and has his women like he always did well thats fine i dont have a problem with that any more no i just decided i wanted a place in the country and he was in no position quite frankly to object i mean he comes down sometimes from london at weekends to discuss business matters youll have seen him no doubt though not in church but if he looks like staying for more than one night ill go and stay in london for a few days the marriage you might say is winding down slowly merrily recalled the gist of her words from the other night the business i was in the things i was doing for money and selfgratification all thats repellent to me now i came here to cleanse myself a reference it had seemed to her modelling days her brief career in daytime tv was there more to it though but youd still be business partners merrily said would you happen tove been in one of the vestalia stores lately merrily cheltenham cardiff er no i dont seem to get out of the county too often ah well theres one supposed to be opening in hereford in a few months time and thats what you might call a bone of contention i dont like the name much any more twas from my sad new age days i was one for the goddesses then well its too late now to change that but i want the hereford store to reflect a more robust spirituality merrily recalled what she could the concept of vestalia was about introducing spirituality into the home from sacred candles and ornamental crystals to very expensive hearths like pagan altars you mean a christianization ive been looking at hereford cathedral at the ornamental chantries in particular but well have a high church feel with censers and things im going to london next week to talk to some designers i want a store which is going to reflect the true magic if i can use that word of christianity the angelic and your husband hates and deplores it thinks its going to destroy us well the hell with him im the one with the ideas gareth has the contacts and the business acumen gareth it was who persuaded countless londoners to install woodstoves to burn scented sacred apple logs brought up from the country at enormous prices wouldve been cheaper for some people to chop up their furniture and feed it to the flames mrs box laughed coldly i dont even want to discuss that man thank you very much in this holy place she stood up and glided to the door and reached up and put out the lamp so that the sacred cell was lit only from the altar and then she went back to her seat in shadow now anyway twas springtime she said im sorry merrily stepped to one side so she wasnt blocking the candlelight this day i found myself driving out towards leominster im leaving the main roads behind soon as i can looking for somewhere to get out and walk and think twas spring and the leaves were half out and some blossom on the trees which were all startling white against a sky that was deep and mauve coloured and loaded with rain that it wasnt about to part with until it was good and ready i parked up close to a footpath sign and i climbed over a stile and here i am on the top of a hill overlooking what proved to be this very village i think i know which place merrily recalled a certain afternoon walking with the late miss lucy devenish proprietor of ledwardine lore who had known everything there was to know about the history of the village and made informed guesses about the rest of course you do jenny box said and youll know how it overlooks the orchards with the spire poking out through all the apple blossom so very white the blossom was this day under that heavy heavy purple sky and heres me just kneeling there on the grass and praying and weeping and weeping and praying you know how it comes over you i merrily looked down at the flagstones yes a movement jenny box sliding gracefully to the end of the settle sit with me merrily hesitated and then came to sit on the oak seat opposite the altar and the picture of the church and the figure of light in the sky there was some other movement almost imperceptible a small quiver a flutter in the close air jenny box gazed directly at the altar when she began to speak merrily felt something like the breeze under jennys voice i found myself praying to the highest to be relieved of all that useless socalled spiritual debris praying with this absolutely overwhelming intensity but the intensity wasnt from me yunderstand it wasnt that halfphoney feverish passion id known before it was something out there that came around me and enveloped me something i was powerless to resist to give you the auld cliché merrily nodded you understand that merrily you understand what it is im talking about here yes merrily said and relaxed for a moment into common ground and memories of blue and gold yes this did happen of course you do jenny box said see id always thought myself to be a deeply spiritual person but twas a poor spirituality if i had but known it tarot cards and magical crystals and all the shiny paraphernalia of the devil paganism slithering in round the back like a doortodoor salesman with a suitcase full of glittery trash merrily whose attitude towards paganism had become less black and white lately said nothing but i was drawn to it all in the beginning you see because of its leanings to the feminine its exaltation of womankind let no one say merrily that it isnt men thatve brought the world to the state its in let no one dare to tell me that me that was hurled away from the catholic church when i was barely out of my teens soiled with the sick hypocrisy of men ah is this men in general merrily said or or more specifically our parish priest father colm meachin the words coming out in a rapid breathy monotone the saintly father colm with his stately manners and his highflown rhetoric and his political friends and his thin white hands all over a quiet girl niamh fagan who was my friend but that ah you see its too perfect thats the real problem sorry too neat and hard it seems to me now and it doesnt capture the glory of it all the picture merrily doesnt capture the quite explosive glory of the moment and i never really expected it to but i thought the moment should be commemorated here nonetheless merrily moistened dry lips the moment the unsettling thing was that merrily was sure she could remember the exact day last april or may a ferocious electric storm heralding rain that had been almost equatorial a sunday tourists in the village hurrying into the church porch jane bored because eirion had the flu and shed been stuck indoors all weekend a flash of lightning merrily a flash so wild and bright i had to shut my eyes against it and when i opened them the whole of the sky was as black as a peatbog and then the soft voice putting a thrill in the still air of the underground chapel came the tiny light right at the centre in the very darkest part of the storm the church steeple in the painting was without any doubt ledwardines shooting out of crowded apple trees with the wooded hills behind it and the stormy sky above charcoal clouds delicately parted as if by the point of the sword and the light oozing through in violetmagnesium bubbles the little lights growing larger before my eyes until its like a ball or an egg shape like some ufo thing but i knew from the first that it would be more than that more glorious merrily looked at the white figure the swordbearer not michael nor gabriel but apparently uriel a peripheral archangel uriel came from the biblical fringe the apocrypha as i stood there on that little hill jenny box stood up absolutely transfixed there was a sudden she swung her arm slash of fork lightning and the lightning itself became the sword the sword was the lightning you know and i just shut my eyes merrily and the rain came down so very hard that i was soaked to the skin inside a minute soaked through and laughing like a fool jenny boxs face shone with joy in the altar lights shed stolen the show had been in charge from the beginning there had been no way of putting that question so was it you who brought a sack full of money into the church last night not now not here in jennys private chapel jennys holy space in the light of the candles and jennys holy vision so i drove down to the village and by the time i got here in less than ten minutes it had almost stopped raining and the weakest of suns had come out and here i am walking around the village in a dream burning inside with the white heat of pure joy im walking around the square looking up at the old buildings and just revelling in the atmosphere not the quaintness thats all rubbish but this tenuous strand of sanctity that still threaded its way through the streets in spite of all this commercialism i seemed to see the thread unravelling before me and so i followed it and you can guess the rest it led you here there was a for sale sign the only one in the whole village as i remember merrily tried for a smile these things happen but they didnt really did they not very often they do i know that now mrs boxs face was flooded with happiness but at the same time merrily was recalling the sense of loneliness and disturbance which had blown like dry leaves around the woman in the square on the night of the fire and i knocked on the door and the people didnt want to show me around at all oh youve got to go through the agent they said but i insisted i was very strong that day and i felt the absolute rightness of it and i virtually made an offer there and then i dont think for one minute they believed me thought i was some stupid doolally tourist woman but it didnt matter i left the house and the sun was shining and i walked down to the church and it was there it was right there in the churchyard that i was granted another small vision the one that clinched it merrily was silent too many visions mrs jenny box née jenny driscoll this former model this former minor tvperson turned successful businesswoman said what i saw was i saw you merrily looked down at her own hands one squeezing the other in your dog collar and your long white tunic walking out of the church talking to some visitortype people with their anoraks and their cameras i saw you all in white and i felt i was in the centre of the future merrily became aware that she was no longer the least bit cold too warm if anything will we pray now mrs box said very softly will we pray together by the time merrily got back to the vicarage she was disgusted with herself woman of straw in the scullery the computer took for ever to boot up it was a reconditioned pc bought primarily to receive emails mainly from sophie and it hadnt seemed too healthy for some weeks now there was one message highlighted from deliverance subject extraterrestrial and she printed it out couldnt get her feet under the desk because of the bin sack which she now had no damn choice but to take to uncle ted after those brief and nervous prayers mrs box had been very gracious giving merrily tea giving her fruit cake in a whitewalled lowbeamed parlour that was furnished almost frugally two grey sofas a low shakerstyle table no pictures on the walls and merrily sitting in the middle of one of the sofas on the crack between two cushions had said eventually weve had theres been a donation watching jenny box who knew it arranging herself on one of the sofas a bleached sunbeam stroking her hair to the church merrily said a substantial donation really mrs box smiling vaguely thats really wonderful im so glad its a very large amount in cash so large that im not sure i can keep it oh why ever not because a cash donation of that size is bound to be considered miraculous said mrs box an answer to a prayer to a dilemma suspicious because its anonymous and in cash jenny box inclined her head to one side appearing to consider the implications and then said in that light velvety voice of hers well now surely if the donor didnt want to put his or her name on the bottom of a cheque then it would not be in the spirit of the gift for you to institute inquiries and thus risk causing unwarranted embarrassment would it not be the thing to treat it as just the most lovely coincidence and perhaps even an indication from god that turning his house into a place of business was not the way ahead merrily nodded smiling weakly had she really been expecting a confession under the surface vulnerability jenny box was clever a slick operator and rich but that didnt make it feel any more right so much of this seemed wavery blurred by an intermittent aura of flickering instability i saw you all in white and i felt i was in the centre of the future had she been wearing the surplice that afternoon the white alb she didnt remember but to merrilys knowledge no one throughout the recorded history of the village had ever claimed to have seen an angel lighting up the sky over ledwardine church hard to say which was the most unlikely that or aliens in underhowle im sorry merrily this took rather a long time to find and as like most of canon dobbss files it was handwritten im afraid i had to type it out im now back in the office if you have any more queries sophie how extraordinary not i would have thought canon dobbss thing at all the report itself dated april was quite short subject miss melanie pullman of goodrich close underhowle near rossonwye source the reverend iain ossler temporary priestincharge ross rural nature of the problem nocturnal disturbances of unknown origins the attending minister canon thb dobbs states i was asked to look into this most bemusing case by the reverend ossler who having been consulted by the family of the subject was unable to determine whether or not it fell within the purview of the christian ministry of exorcism i found miss melanie pullman to be a relatively articulate young woman of some eighteen years an employee of boots the chemist in rossonwye who had been left in a somewhat confused and i would say debilitated condition allegedly resulting from a series of experiences at her home over a period of four to six months merrily wondered what melanie pullman had made of canon dobbs with his eroded graveyard archangels face and no discernible sense of humour a man who had rejected the term deliverance and all attempts to introduce a series of guidelines for anglican exorcists i interviewed miss pullman in the presence of her mother mrs audrey pullman and her elder brother mr terence pullman throughout the interview miss pullman complained of headaches and said she had been experiencing a number of physical symptoms which the family general practitioner had diagnosed as a nervous condition subsequently prescribing small amounts of valium the family dwelling is a former council house on an estate of similar homes and has no record of psychic disturbance according to my inquiries with previous ownerstenants miss pullman recounted a number of incidents an example of which i quote here from my notes i awoke in the early hours of the morning to find that the television set in the corner of my bedroom had inexplicably activated itself i am certain that i had switched it off as usual before falling asleep however there was neither picture nor sound only a blinding white light on the screen which i could not look at for long inexplicably activated itself merrily wondered what terminology melanie had actually used this light eventually became dimmer and finally faded away however concurrent with this i became aware that my bed itself was becoming bathed in an orange light which became increasingly bright miss pullman then related a most confusing story of apparently being taken from her bed and losing consciousness and subsequently awakening in what she described as a spacecraft of a spherical nature where she was laid upon a white metal table and subjected to an intimate physical examination by humanoid creatures which she described as being thin and grey with unusually large heads and eyes like black mirrors she claimed the examination concluded with one of the creatures having sexual intercourse with her asked if she would describe this experience as rape miss pullman became embarrassed and said that she would not her mother later explained that some days afterwards miss pullman had been treated by her doctor for what was described as a vaginal infection whilst my information is that reports of this type of alleged experience are not uncommon particularly in the united states of america it was my impression that miss pullman had indeed undergone some manner of hallucinatory or dream experience that is i did not believe that she was making it up the central question however remains was demonic interference involved i have learned that some investigators of the phenomenon known as alien abduction have proposed a correlation between this type of experience and folkloric tales of people who were taken by the fairies as they slept sometimes with similar suggestions of sexual interference often resulting in the birth of a changeling offspring as miss pullman does not appear to have become pregnant i would be inclined to rule out any involvement of socalled elemental forces my own tests through prayer and meditation failed to detect the presence of a demonic evil but i remained concerned by miss pullmans physical conditions which had led to her taking considerable time off work and according to her mother moping about the house accordingly after blessing the premises with the use of holy water i had a short meeting with the general practitioner dr ruck whom i must say i found to be less than helpful dr ruck stated that this was the second such case reported to him within a year from the same housing development in underhowle and he considered it to be a fad among young people arising from certain popular films and television programmes i asked the pullman family to keep me informed about any future developments but have not heard from them since canon t h b dobbs diocesan exorcist hereford merrily was unexpectedly impressed by canon dobbss general diligence and openmindedness ok this hadnt unfortunately extended to women priests and women exorcists in particular but he had done his best with what to him must have been a perplexingly contemporary kind of haunting the idea of aliens as postmodern fairies was one shed heard before true there was no suggestion of the demonic here nothing for the deliverance ministry to combat with traditional means but who did you go to when you were convinced that something which you couldnt resist had arrived in the night and taken you away for experimentation certainly not the police if she showed this to frannie bliss it would only put question marks over melanies mental state as for the doctor bloody valium the universal panacea merrily recalled when jane approaching the peak of her new age phase a year or two ago had believed she was having nature spirit experiences in the orchards of ledwardine and she was startled by a pang of nostalgia realizing that she very much preferred that fey impressionable kid to the hard bitten cynic whod emerged around the approach to her daughters seventeenth birthday she wondered what eirion thought of the new jane she went back to the computer to email her thanks to sophie and discovered that she couldnt the screen had frozen but in a peculiar foggy way and when she tried to restart the computer she found it wouldnt bugger hard disk gone or what shed have to ask eirion who she had to admit was becoming an indispensable extension of this household meanwhile she rang the cathedral gatehouse sophie thanks for doing this do we have another case in this particular village sophies voice which had once seemed severe now conveyed this inimitable mixture of calm and capability alien abduction no but dobbss subject has since disappeared and the police are worried about her and youve been consulted in a roundabout kind of way has there been anything on the radio about the discovery of a womans body early today near ross oh said sophie that no this is not her thats another one oh well at least this would delay having to take the sack to ted she told sophie everything that had happened last night up to but not including the binsack incident which was purely parish business it was like unloading stuff on your older sister my god what an appalling night for you sophie said two of them two dead bodies possibly both victims of the same man i hadnt heard about mr parrys fire im so very sorry hes a wonderful man and a good friend to you do you really think this person was insane enough to start that fire gomers in no doubt and theres definitely something wrong with lodge the bedroom wall was very yuk i mean i can understand why bliss is convinced lodge has killed more women and you say mr parrys out there now digging for more corpses with lol merrily fumbled a cigarette into her mouth is this entirely wise of inspector bliss not in my view merrily said but who ever listens to me jenny box she thought jenny box listens expecting confession made sense see gomer told lol as the truck bumped down into the valley under the big pylons this place was on the edge of the forest and anything could happen in the forest full of old secrets never told perfect place for a killer to lurk undiscovered for years unlike radnor forest that area of crowded green hills forty miles west of here where gomer had grown up the dean was the real thing trees oaks chestnuts sycamores conifers miles of the buggers walltowall twentyfive thousand acres sure to be royal hunting ground in the middle ages therefore operating according to separate rules its own code what you gotter remember lol boy gomers eyes shrank shrewdly behind his telescopic glasses what you gotter remember bout the forest is its wedged up between these two big rivers the wye by yere and the severn in the east and the severns real wide the other sides like another country so youre lookin across at neighbours you likely ent never gonner talk to the whole of your life sounds like west london lol said point im makin boy if you wanner get the other side of that river from yereabouts you gotter drive miles and miles down to the big bridges in south wales else your only alternatives all the way up to the city of gloucester and struggling through the terrible bloody traffic you gets there now in between gloucester and south wales see you got the forest like a big island full o trees trees were already thickening on both sides of the road and the cab of the truck was blue with gomers smoke and if the forest folk couldnt easy get out where do they go but down pits see iron mines it was way back to roman times and coal mines all closed down and covered over now mostly but the lands still riddled with bloody ole shafts mines and secrets boy thats the forest mines and secrets despite the cold and the shuddering of the truck lols body was sagging into sleep he sat up shaking himself like a dog how come you know so much about it gomer ar well gomers voice went gruff my first wife god rest her her family comed from cinderford used to have to go over at christmas times like that never felt accepted mind suspicious devils her family close interbred it was noticeable that gomer had been talking more in the last five minutes than he had all day hed never mentioned his first wife before not in lols hearing this was gomer galvanized sensing the closeness of a climax coughed on three lynsey melanie pullman and the girl from monmouth rochelle bowen rochelle was the daughter of the couple whod caught up with them when they were excavating the third efflapure at a brick cottage outside pontshill she was nineteen a trainee dental nurse missing for five months lol had felt heartsick seeing in the faces of the parents this withering combination of resignation and cold dread making it all searingly real he hoped they werent going to be around when bliss arrived with his prisoner gomer slowed at a sign pointing to under howle two words as though the village had no identity separate from the hill lol couldnt see a village out of the truck windows only closegrowing trees with brown frizzled leaves this actually counts as the forest gomer so close to ross gomer sucked on his ciggy this boy counts as a place even the forest folk dont know perfect hideyhole for the likes of lodge bastard goes out from yere like them bloody ole raiders from centuries ago cheatin philanderin killin he coughed burnin then crawls back to his lair all snug they came down into the village which looked muddled and haphazard houses floating in the early dusk like croutons in a brown soup they passed the hulk of a church entering a street with surprisingly several shops their lights coming on down through a disjointed crossroads back into the trees and then lol saw on his left the first police car the police tape and the tiered façade of the garage like a concrete lego garage from his childhood with the pylon rearing behind it gomer turned in very slowly and deliberately truck wheels grinding cinders all snug he said merrily punched in the numbers of lols phone im sorry the mobile you are calling is she switched off again it was so basic lols phone that it hadnt come with an answering service in fact he probably hadnt even taken it with him she pictured him digging willing but a little inept in some muddy field redbrown stains on the alien sweatshirt her mind could still never find him without the alien sweatshirt once shed insisted on bringing it home to mend a hole in the shoulder and had ended up sleeping with the faded item under her pillow how sad was that you wanted to be adult about these things wanted to take it slowly but your emotions operated at a different velocity feelings on fasttrack playing the old hazey jane albums when you were alone in the car his voice a little higher then a little smoother hed been not much older than jane at the time and now nearly twenty years had passed and oh god merrily lit a cigarette her hand was shaking it didnt seem to take much to make her hands shake nowadays jane had also talked about the folkrock singer moira cairns on whom eirion had seemed to have developed a crush although the kid had emphasized in disgust that the singer was old enough to be his mother merrily recalled a moira cairns album with a sleeve picture of cairns trailing a guitar along an empty beach something special then how special was she now last night prof levin according to jane had thrown an oblique glance at the lovely moira in her slinky frock and had said they should let what happens happen was this jane winding her up jane who wanted a situation where lol actually moved into the vicarage with his guitars which which was really not possible at the moment was it what would they say about her in the village whore the diocese the press and of course uncle ted merrily stared at the phone uncle bloody ted no real reason for putting this off any longer she called him she called uncle ted clowes and arranged to meet him in the church in ten minutes she put out the cigarette got back into her best coat and pulled out the sack full of cash its origins still uncertain with the sun going right down the wind getting up and still no sign of the hereford coppers arriving with lodge gomer left young lol robinson rubbing his hands in the cold tramped across the cinders and dragged miserable andy mumford over to one side by the garage wall time to have this out you said three right andy boy you reckoned hed confessed to three andy mumford looked over his shoulder i never said anything at all gomer you know that three that it just the three women i dont know what you mean behind mumford coppers were moving through the dusk unloading tackle from a blue van dont you give me that ole wallop gomer levelled a finger hed known this boy for years born to a big family over by wigmore and if ole ma mumford was yere shed have the truth out of the bastard what about torchin a certain plant hire shed what do he say about that boy miserable andy looking frazzled coming up to retirement didnt need this well too bloody bad gomer could feel the old fury coming to the boil hed worked all day for nothing much seen his good friend young lol robinson reduced to a limp rag and now in all the excitement of lodge shooting his mouth off just the one serious crime gets very conveniently forgotten not sexy enough that it andy not got no spectaclar headlines in it unknown welsh border drunk gets isself roasted look gomer andy said awkwardly weve been cooperating the best we can with dyfedpowys on this one but it calls for a lot of forensic and thats not easy to come by after a big fire i dont know how much you know about dna but it doesnt survive that kind of blaze anyway proving that someone else other than nev was involved is not gonner be a simple matter take it from me ole wallop gomer was ramming his glasses up tight to his eyes in the ole days theydve bounced the bastard off the cell walls a few times till he told the truth he was thinking of wynford wiley the radnor valley sergeant never liked the bugger but he knew how to get the facts out of the lowlife gomer andy sounding pained lodge has a very smart young lawyer im told going about it the oldfashioned way is the best way of not getting a conviction on anything these days take it from ar we all know what goes on nowadays threecourse dinner and tucked up with a hotwater bottle all cosy spect hed be getting a conjugal bloody visit if he hadnt done for all his girlfriends badtaste thing to say and fair play gomer was truly sorry for those girls and their families but thered been no woman in nevs life at the end and nobody was going to stand up for that boy if gomer didnt do it now headlights blasting through the trees brought andy mumford out of his slump theyre here gotter leave this now gomer two cars three do one thing for me gomer gomer kept quiet ill admit i warned the boss about hiring you for this andy said but he was in a hurry and i reckon he thought youd have a bit more of an incentive than most diggermen boy had that right but dont just dont when you see lodge dont say nothing dont do nothing soon as we nail this psycho on the women well talk about nev i promise just you keep in the background meantime and dig where youre told dont do nothing else you understand me you knows me boy exactly andy says grimly the first cars pulling up just a few yards from gomer its not a police car the boy bliss gets out first he stands there hands in his pockets waiting as the second car fits itself in behind three uniform coppers in this one and lodge bent drainage operator and likely the biggest serial killer in these parts since bloody fred west gomer fired up a ciggy in the fading light and waited too stepping warily into the gloom of the vestry merrily found that uncle ted had already moved the wardrobe into a corner and folded up the card table and was now brushing the dust from his sleeves obviously envisaging the gift shop i thought the main counter about here and perhaps a second display stand under the window merrily said perhaps if we brick up the window altogether we could have an even bigger display stand oh i dont think so ted said because when you add up the cost of extra lighting he dried up realizing lips twisted in annoyance that his niece the vicar was taking the piss his face went a deep and petulant red i very much hope he said that you arent going to backtrack on this we do need the income backtrack she didnt recall ever agreeing well she carefully reerected the card table in the middle of the small drab room and placed the black bin sack on it maybe we can now afford to postpone the decision for a while she was still dreading telling him about the money obviously theyd have to put it out that thered been an anonymous donation without necessarily revealing how it had arrived the gossip anyway would be considerable ted frowned i admit the mobilephone mast would bring in a regular income but you havent mentioned that in a while no i to be honest ive been a trifle perturbed by what ive been reading about possible health risks particularly to ah elderly people it seems nothing proven but it might be wise to ah i see sorry to toss a spanner in the works he stood with his back to the door hands across his belly the last man in ledwardine habitually to wear a paisley cravat down the front of his viyella no thats very publicspirited of you ted merrily said listen theres something i have to tell you somethings happened he peered at her why are you all dressed up because im leaving for barbados tonight merrily said ive come into money she emptied the contents of the bin liner on to the table ted picked up one of the bundles of notes and then moved rapidly to the door and flung on all the lights bloody hell he said lol saw them bringing lodge out couldnt easily miss him in direct contrast to the dark blue uniforms on either side he was wearing orange overalls probably policeissue while they ran tests on his clothes his head hung so you couldnt see his face and his hands were cuffed in front of him he let the two coppers move him around in the greying light like a bendy doll a mistblurred listless moon was skulking in the trees the wind brushed fallen leaves into heaps against the closed doors of roddys garage and the police clustered in front nobody was doing much talking but lol was aware of an excitement he guessed they wouldnt want to show you could hear it in the agitated jostling of the leaves and the tense metallic thrumming in the overhead power lines there were about eight police visible among them di frannie bliss who lol had met during the summer a brief liaison founded on the need to pull merrily out of a threatening situation thered been a degree of selfinterest then but you felt you could trust him up to a point surprisingly bliss came over knew the music industry was in a bad way son but not this bad lol nodded gloomily weve got robbie williams round the back unloading the truck yeh i thought it was bliss was dressed for action in a nylon hiking jacket jeans tucked into calfhigh cowboy boots you look happy though lol was wary the police and their prisoner waiting around the night closing in and the di sparing the time to acknowledge the hired labour tentatively happy small teeth flashed briefly youre looking a bit knackered yourself laurence bliss pulled leather gloves from his jacket and put them on i suppose it was the little reverend got you into this relieving mr parrys burden in his hour of sorrow thought it might help him to have somebody to laugh at and how can we ever refuse her eh all right son listen bliss led him to the edge of the police tape voice lowered heres the situation after whats been a difficult day by and large mr lodge has decided to cooperate but this is he waggled his fingers funny stuff you know gorra go a bit careful he nodded at the spade obviously youve mastered the complexities of that more or less but what i need to know is can you if necessary operate this little digger of gomers lol took half a step back stumbled hey were not talking heavy plant bliss said this is tonka toy lol looked around he couldnt see gomer anywhere but he could see roddy lodge luminous in his overalls with a policeman either side and another man in plain clothes joining them a policewoman was handing out plastic cups of tea or coffee from a couple of flasks in the boot of a police car including one for the prisoner roddy clasping the cup like a chalice between his cuffed hands the reality outside the recording studio more of it than lol had counted on im not saying were gonna need the digger bliss tapped the spade this might well suffice but if we do need to go a bit deeper i dont want mr parry within quarrelling distance of roddy lodge better an inoffensive little artiste than a combustible old bugger with a grudge this is my view and how would you feel lol said before he could think if your nephews murder was getting sidelined by a slippery copper on the make must have been even more tired than hed figured bliss merely frowned suspicious death his nephews suspicious death laurence i apologize for calling you inoffensive he paused anyway thats over the garden hedge dyfed powyss case im not saying there wont be meaningful discussions with our welsh colleagues when this present business gets sorted but right now i want to build on what we know weve got its about seizing the moment now you run along and ask mr parry for the keys of his little digger lol didnt move i thought youd have real forensic people to do it now youve got something positive never fear you happen to strike anything softish ill have vanloads of the buggers here before you can scrape the shit off your wellies ive just gorra be quite sure our friend here isnt being disingenuous so where will this be where are we going going were not going anywhere bliss patted lol on the shoulder and walked with the wind behind him across the crowded forecourt towards the cops guarding the prisoner right then roddy my son lets be having yer here hed buried one on his own property di bliss the third man with lodge stepped out his hands going up protectively as the headlights of one of the police cars sprayed his dark suit i just want to say before you lol saw bliss quiver mr nye weve had an independent doctor in to check him over weve also had him looked at by an experienced psychiatric nurse neither of whom thought he was seriously ill or unfit to travel now will you let us get on with our job please the guy shook his head he looked young maybe not too sure of his ground inspector i have to tell you that im far from confident that anything mr lodge might say under these circumstances can be considered admissible i think i know what you think bliss stood with his arms by his side fists tight and what i think is that mr lodges mental state has no particular bearing on the situation at this stage and im more interested right now in what hes got to show us rather than what he tells us and if any of this upsets him further im terribly sorry mr nye but in comparison with the parents of rochelle bowen with whom i spent a very distressing fortyfive minutes this afternoon my sympathies mr bliss i repeat that my client is unwell and i think you could at least bearing in mind that mr lodge hasnt been charged and he is cooperating fully remove the handcuffs bliss threw up his arms all right well take off the f the handcuffs he moved close up to mr nye i should however remind your client that if he at any stage makes a personal decision that his continued presence here is no longer entirely essential ive got police officers posted at the front and the rear and every conceivable exit from these premises is that fully understood mr nye we wouldnt expect otherwise in the circumstances said mr nye thank you inspector bliss nodded one of the uniformed policemen bent to remove lodges handcuffs you believe that lol turned behind him gomer was furiously assembling a ciggy the headlights turning his glasses opaque like crossslices of banana you ask me ent nothin wrong with that piece of rubbish you couldnt bloody shake out of him he shoved the new ciggy in his mouth and closed the tin with a snap gomer you dont need to explain nothing boy miserable andys spelled it out keep parry out of it dont nobody mention nev you go with em ill stay yere its nothing personal lol said just bliss covering himself against any comebacks in court if they do find anything and it was you who dug it up a man with a grudge he sighed he didnt want to operate the digger either even if he could be sure he knew how to nobodys going anywhere it seems looks like they want to dig here maybe we should tell them they can do it themselves not with my bloody gear they dont ive lent tools to cops before gomer pulled a single key on a chain from his overalls so dont you let anybody else hang on to it lol said nervously it may not come to that they watched roddy lodge flexing his arms rubbing his freed wrists lol saw his face properly for the first time and it was the colour and the texture of paving stone his eyes seemed sunken but somehow gleaming back there like glass like cats eyes in the road and then he started slowly shaking his head a smile forming up jane said so youre saying jenny driscoll saw an angel she flinched slightly an actual with like wings merrily stood up went to switch on the earthenware reading lamp on the wide window sill it had been clear to her that if she was going to tell the kid about the money then a preliminary account of mrs box and the vision of the angel was probably unavoidable besides this had been not too long ago very much janes kind of thing up in the apartment against the mondrian walls two bookcases still bulged with pastelspined paperbacks about contacting nature spirits working with the elements finding secret pathways to enlightenment which had bothered merrily quite a bit at one time less so now if occasionally it bordered on neopaganism it was still spirituality better than agnosticism certainly better than the possible onset of atheism lets say a startling brightness formed out of the veins of light on the edge of clouds merrily said resembling in this case it seems the archangel uriel this is the lesserknown one usually portrayed with a sword pointing down it was very dramatic mrs box says and it was pointing at the steeple your steeple this would be you remember the huge spectacular storm one sunday last spring where we were standing here at the window and the whole of the orchard was lit up white like a snowstorm well mrs box parked her car and walked up onto cole hill she was in a an emotional state evidently jane said eirion had dropped her off around four before having to go home for his stepgrandmothers eightieth birthday party now the day was closing down the old aga making its smug aga noises without putting much heat into the kitchen merrily and jane had mugs of tea for warmth the lamp laid a golden mist on the room the kid had changed into white jeans and a sweater discarded by merrily as terminally shapeless it seemed to fit jane better she slid forward on her elbows chin cupped in her hands gazing into her mothers eyes very candid and calmed by something awesome that merrily was seeing more frequently a level of understanding that murmured adult merrilys hand tightened around her mug ok just reassure me jane said that you dont believe a word of this bollocks the strengthening nightwind rattled the trees bastard bliss was livid he stormed over to where lol and gomer were standing out of lodges earshot lawyers got it right for once boss mumford was ambling behind like a pack pony blokes mental andy hes mental when he wants to be bliss moved up to the barrier tape clutched it with both hands failed to snap it im buggered if im chauffeuring the crafty bastard back to his cell after this little works outing id rather dig the whole site up and make him watch put him back in the cuffs look a bit peevish mumford said im a peevish person ent bein helpful nmore then gomer said insouciantly through blue smoke no he ent bliss stared out across the lane into the trees hands rammed into the pockets of his green and cream hiking jacket as you may have overheard mr lodge appears to have had a lapse of memory and is now effectively saying he no longer recalls precisely why he brought us here ar gomer smiled through his ciggy relief seeped into lols aching body like warm alcohol it looked like this could be over before it started whats he got here andy bliss said boss how much ground acreage roughly what we looking at id reckon say two and a bit acres all told thats including the yard and the bungalow and the triangular piece of land at the bottom with the pylon on it oh and the other side of the main perimeter fence it seems lodge owns a paddock and then theres about one and a half acres surrounding what used to be the underhowle baptist chapel lodge used to own that too but hes now sold it to the underhowle development committee proper little property speculator bliss said sourly we been in there the chapel empty boss the development committees turning it into a museum for all the roman finds well still put it on the list for the durexsuits hes just had money to spare and a good accountant mumford said property always makes sense even derelict property i bought the field next to us with an old cowshed yeh you would bliss hacked the heel of a cowboy boot into the cinders wouldnt know where to start here on our own would we take days to dig up this lot and i havent got days he turned his back to the tape looked across at roddy lodge standing motionless in his orange overalls im gonna look a right twat when this gets out lol noticed two kids hanging around at the far end of the tape one apparently shielding the other who was bending over the tape probably cutting himself a couple of feet of it as a souvenir gomer cleared his throat but frannie bliss didnt look at him a policeman advanced on the two kids who ran off up the lane towards the village then one turned and gave him the finger it began to rain very lightly there was a sigh of resignation from bliss yes mr parry course gomer spat out the last millimetre of ciggy if i hadnt been discharged from my duties told to take a back seat like lol became aware of just how cold it had become how thin his old army jacket was and how much night there was stretching ahead what you got in mind gomer bliss said lol just hoped that whatever it was wouldnt involve him or his frozen muscles merrily said so i emptied out the sack and waited for it to happen and sure enough he metamorphosed before my eyes out goes the churchwarden in comes the lawyer dr jekyll and mr no this is ted merrily said mr hyde and mr evenhyder jane grinned fractionally merrily poured more tea glad to be off the subject of angels she was bewildered by janes reaction to the report of a dramatic visionary experience on her own doorstep was this not the kid who had entered her middle teens with a fervent belief in fairies and the kind of elemental forces not covered by the bible there was a point where new age philosophy and christianity crossed over and angels were it and you didnt just abandon all that virtually overnight not even jane so what did he say jane demanded clearly far more interested in the manifestation of the money obviously annoyed that this was the first shed heard about it when both uncle ted and jenny box had been told oh lock the church at once merrily merrily threw up her arms pulls out his mobile brings up the police number which he appeared to have in his index ok i say but im locking it from the outside ive not got time to sit around here no no you cant leave me on my own with all this money i said ted ive just dragged it all the way along the bloody cobbles from the vicarage on my own so where is it now probably in his safe at home i somehow cant see him surrendering eighty grand to the police for safe keeping hell give them the minimum legal leeway just to make sure it doesnt match up with some robbery and assuming it doesnt merrily shrugged goes into the parish coffers end of story everybody happy we just dont spend any for a while to be on the safe side its a lot of money mum jane said soberly take a whole canteen of collection plates to accommodate that lot mmm merrily was remembering a row shed had with uncle ted when shed decided to abolish the timehonoured practice of sending round collection plates during the final hymn lets not make an exhibition of it ted they can put something in the box on the way out ted had insisted this wouldnt work people never shelled out unless they were publicly shamed into it it even emerged that the old bugger had sometimes taken twentypound notes from parish funds placing one on each plate prior to its circulation setting an example and jenny driscoll didnt come close to admitting it was her jane said maybe i didnt push her hard enough but i suppose its actually quite a considerate thing to do if it had been a cheque with her name on it wed both have felt uncomfortable like she owned the place or me yeah but secretly you know its her and she knows you know and nobody else does just you and her that makes it altogether more subtle dont you think too subtle for me flower for a few moments neither of them spoke the only sound was ethel the cat at her bowl crunching dried food you know your problem dont you jane was carefully inspecting her nails youre becoming unworldly reared up me merrily obvious side effect of deliverance jane put her hand down and met merrilys stare across the table like in the job if youre exorcizing some house or something it has to be that its not you doing it its god youre just the vehicle if in doubt butt out god will find a way no think about it jane said shes targeted you all that bollocks about seeing an angel over your church and then she bungs you eighty grand she wants something youre in the crosshairs vicar merrily took in the kids serious face the hair darker now pushed back behind her ears a face she hadnt seen before she felt a stirring of panic very glad now that there were some aspects of that unnerving couple of hours in the incense air below chapel house that she hadnt told jane about she finally flared a little somehow i just cant help being a little surprised at hearing the rational not to say cynical argument from someone who used to stand on the lawn on nights of the full moon and solemnly utter ritual incantations i was a kid then it was last year look jane planted both palms flat on the table leaning across doesnt this worry you in the slightest she might look like a wilting snowdrop but what you have here is an extv person a top businesswoman with shops all over the place whos probably never been known to do anything that wasnt for publicity the moneys for the church not me your church what you think i should take it back jane shook her head helplessly i dont know but i should be really really careful if i were you merrily said nothing she was hearing jenny box from the square the other night it isnt over you see those things arent over those things have hardly begun no she didnt know what that meant either because if you think gods going to see you right protect you from whatever devious shit jane like he protected gomer like he protected nev merrily closed her eyes not tonight please all right she breathed in and out slowly all right i didnt do very well did i there were things i should have asked her that i didnt maybe i had a lot on my mind with this police thing which is probably all over now anyway all over not for gomer it isnt not for lol either who probably wouldnt have got involved at all if you what jane shrugged sulkily just something else youre letting slip away isnt it oh for gods sake this is not going to become a row ive tried to ring him several times maybe youve got more problems than you know reverend maybe uncle teds actually right i do not when he says deliverance is taking over your life and he doesnt even know what its done to your basic common sense merrilys lips tightened bloody teenagers what a great shame it was that there wasnt some kind of hormonereduction therapy so how did you leave it with the driscoll woman jane said like thanks for the cakes and see you in church she merrily stared into her cooling tea she asked me to do something for her she wanted me to formally reconsecrate her private chapel in the cellar janes smile was three parts sneer and no consecrations but a blessing yes probably the kids exhaled breath was like a slow puncture the kitchen seemed bigger and felt colder well what was i supposed to say jane its what i do and of course what you do is of major spiritual like cosmic significance even though its all f fantasy whereas us down here i bet i bet you dont even know about lols first gig in twenty years lol merrily whispered gig the rain fell steadily on the field at the back of the bungalow lol held the rubbercovered lambing lamp over a spot just off centre lighting up a circle of green and yellow he could hardly flex his fingers any more he thought that if he were to lie down now in the cold wet grass hed probably be asleep within a few seconds yere gomer bent down pushing his fingers through the grass just about yere sure tbe where gomers hands were you could see the soil level was lower the grass a slightly different shade before locating this spot gomer had spent no more than twenty minutes scouring the site as if he was dowsing for water sometimes pulling back bushes and brambles getting lol to shift piles of building rubble a circle of police was forming around them as gomer came triumphantly to his feet alongside lol and the lamp bout last spring i reckon this was dug up no latern that try it anyway i would youll know soon enough bliss was sauntering up looking less than impressed when a howl of outrage exploded over the heads of the circle of cops you dont wanner take no notice of that ole fuck hes well past it he is he dont know what hes in the choked silence lol was aware of the razory thrumming of the power lines then a chuckle one of the uniformed police fisted his palm in glee frannie bliss smiling in the lamplight like a freckled cherub punched gomer joyfully on the upper arm thank you roddy thank you god laughter you could feel the current passing around the circle bliss beckoned the policewoman gomer this merits a nice plastic cup of tea which tiffany here will provide for you if im not being sexist there and an eccles cake welsh cake boss the policewoman said sorry tiff bliss was still smiling as he handed lol the spade take it slowly son like he could take it any other way quite when he began to tremble he wasnt sure he was just suddenly aware of doing it it couldve been the cold because it was cold and it was wet and the earth was clammy but he knew it wasnt that hed been cold and wet most of the day his head was full of rumbling theyd brought two cars round the back with their engines running and the headlights on full beam he was caught in the lights the star attraction sweating under the scrutiny of a hyperattentive audience lol robinson on stage for the first time in nearly two decades lol robinson performing live digging up the dead he was directly under the power lines heavygauge black strings on a fretboard of night cloud the spade was about eighteen inches down now raising a little hill of muddy soil and wedges of clay at the side of the hole lols glasses had misted up and the spade was feeling sledgehammerheavy pulling him down the way the old solidbody electric guitar had done once on stage with hazey jane lol sagging under the responsibility the knowledge that all he had to do was touch a string with a fingernail the wrong string the wrong note the wrong chord and there would be this hallfilling blast a power he didnt want the amplification of his inadequacy his head felt hot the sweat on his face was like cream moira cairns said smokily in his head let me get this right if you reappear on stage now the audience isnae gonnae be thinking ah heres the awfully talented person from hazey jane where the hells he been all this time its gonnae be like hey is that no the big sex offender of or whenever lol hated it here the halfimagined zinging of the power lines was like the panting of old amps on stage and like every chord he played every spadeful he dumped on the heap at the side of the hole they landed on it pulling it apart mauling it blurred figures in boots and uniforms spotlit from several angles lol had the clear sensation of digging his own grave like some prisoner of war surrounded by uniforms and he didnt even notice when the spade found something something that was actually not softish until frannie bliss his liverpool accent cranked up to distortion level was bawling stop whats dis whats dis whats dis a skull a human skull caked in clay lol was out of there fast gripping the spade with both hands leave it bliss said as if people were going to rush to the thing in the hole like it was a holy relic he snatched a lamp and shone it down spade laurence bliss grabbed the spade from him and stood astride the hole handing the lamp to mumford he started to probe with a corner of the blade lol found himself next to the lawyer mr nye who turned away from him like lol had flakes of dead flesh on his arms hang on bliss said what the lol saw something in the hole that was dull and grey and blistered with earth bliss said right fetch roddy now he got the spade under it and levered it half out it was not a skull suitcase boss one of the police crouched down the curved shiny bit lol saw was a metal cornersupport too small bliss looked down in disgust like a kid on christmas day who didnt get the bike after all attaché case more like feels like its bloody empty i said fetch roddy lol thinking he was maybe the only person here who was relieved walked away from the lights towards the shelter of the garage hands in leather seized his left arm and spun him around white flashlight speared his eyes all around him there was heavy movement in the mud scuffling panting torch beams were intersecting erratically in the rain when they let him go without an apology he realized something had happened oh shit panic scraping a young coppers voice i cant bleeding believe this the initial stampede had been constrained procedure now they were fanning out covering the ground lamp and torch beams pooling someone had gone into the bungalow and put on all its lights the whole compound was lit up now multiple shadows climbing the windowless back wall of the garage somebody bliss said through his teeth is going down for this the hoarsened edge to his voice suggesting that he was getting worried it was going to be him the hole in the grass lay abandoned someone had taken the case away there was no stench of decaying flesh but that didnt mean there wasnt a body down there somewhere lol stayed away from the hole only roddy lodge could explain this and he wasnt around roddy lodge had taken a personal decision that his presence here was no longer essential hed just walked away into the darkness cantve got out of here mumford kept saying thats for certain i know this place now end to end and if everybodys stayed in place he cannot have got out you better be right sunshine for all our sakes bliss turned to the lawyer and if you he was ill mr nye had his arms folded and kept looking over his shoulder lol instinctively looked over his how dangerous was lodge he was ill the lawyer insisted there was no question at all that he was ill im not feeling too marvellous meself pal and if i thought for one minute that when you asked for those handcuffs to come off dont be absurd this man blisss forefinger came out like a gun is a suspected multiple murderer so dont you go anywhere mr nye is that a thr and who the fuck bliss roared out staring past mr nye let these bastards in maybe it was the kids driven away from the perimeter tape whod spread the word but it wasnt just kids this time lol thought of a football crowd filing through turnstiles only with lamps and torches jesus its a fuckin circus the group of people moving along the path on one side of the garage building was led by a tall woman in a long stock mans coat a lone pc behind them spread his arms helpless sorry sir they get back to the entrance now bliss walked up to the woman mrs sollars you should know better than this were not running a funfair here then what are you running a man demanded youve spent the whole day digging up peoples gardens with abandon i suppose you thought you were being discreet he looked down at two children miles ffion home please i did ask you before one of the kids said aw fergus or there may have to be proportionately less time on line for the whole of next week the man said calmly the woman said if youd had the common decency inspector to keep the community informed oh pardon me bliss snarled ill have a special flyer pushed through everybodys door next time look i dont have time for this youd better go over and stand by that wall all of you and stay together you understand me because if any of you gets in my way im gonna do you for obstruction and thats not youve mislaid him havent you a man with a white beard said you dont have roddy right now im telling you not to come any further stay together and dont let anyone else in here can you do that can you do that for the sake of the community bliss began to walk away the bearded man said you dont look very far do you he had a vaguely transatlantic accent he wore a loose denim jacket and a plaid cap and he had a canvas bag hanging from a shoulder strap also good nightvision lol figured although he didnt have a torch he was peering around into the dark areas bliss continued for a couple of paces and then stopped lol saw exactly where the bearded man was gazing up on angels jane had gone upstairs for a bath leaving merrily hunched by the sittingroom fire feet in woolly socks cardigan buttoned to the top but still feeling cold she pulled st thomas aquinas from the shelf aquinas on angels intellectual exercise could sometimes deflate anxiety she opened the paperback immediately shut it again snatched up the cordless and tried lols phone it was now over a week since shed seen him and ok it felt very much longer really what kind of relationship was this to jane for whom two nights without a call from eirion was cause for sleeploss it must look like a trial separation merrily felt angry frustrated losing her grip a marionette with its strings pulled in different directions by jenny box uncle ted frannie bliss and jane like what had happened suddenly to turn the kid into the selfappointed voice of rationality in this household the phone you are calling is switched off inevitably nearly two hours into darkness now were they still out there digging for frannies corpses on the windy fringe of the forest merrily tapped in gomers home number on the off chance that they were out of there this yere is gomer parry plant hire we ent in but that dont mean we ent available so you be sure and leave your number damn merrily hit end and tossed the phone on the sofa slumping down with the book she found st thomas aquinas no more accessible it is not necessary that the place where an angel is should be spatially indivisible it can be divisible or indivisible greater or less according as the angel chooses voluntarily to apply his power to a more or less extended body and the whole body whatever it be will be as one place to him she read the paragraph twice more you could always rely on thomas to make you feel totally thick hard to imagine a mind this colossal functioning within a society of bows and arrows boiling oil trial by ordeal but then inside grey walls in the thirteenth century with no tv or radio or phones or kids only a solitary circle of candlelight a trained intellect powered by spiritual energy might well acquire laserlike focus in the dog grate a mix of coal and apple logs burned with an intensity that she could neither feel nor find in herself to be a serious student of aquinas theology was not enough you also needed to be stephen hawking an angel is in contact with a given place simply and solely through his power there hence his movement from place to place can be nothing but a succession of distinct power contacts what she was hoping for was ok a sign like sometimes you could open a book it didnt have to be the bible to a random page and the solution would be there as though at the end of a shaft of light the answer might not depend on a literal interpretation of the text it might be a certain metaphor which sprang a diversion lit some indirect path to an unexpected truth jenny box what the hell does she want from me jennys angel was that a metaphor or what a person coming from new age spirituality from earthpowers shamanism and healing crystals to christianity would probably need some kind of visionary incentive real or imagined jenny box would have to find ample metaphysical justification for her move to an obscure village in herefordshire ledwardine as glastonbury ledwardine as lourdes just as merrily herself often wondered if shed been washed up here for a reason at college shed always seen herself as an urban priest firing faith in concrete alleys full of vomit and discarded syringes she lay back on the sofa with the aquinas paperback on her lap closed her eyes and saw four possibilities jenny box had hallucinated the angel jenny box had invented the angel an optical illusion an angel floodlit by a dozen small lamps it looked like a gigantic headless metal puppet with six arms rigidly outstretched wires from its pendulous fingers wires from its elbow joints if there was a formidable elemental force travelling those wires the pylon itself looked dangerously unstable lol thought and archaic a skeletal survivor of the days when cars broke down every few weeks and a single computer filled a whole room this was your standard national grid tower the bearded man in denims had explained in his relaxed tourguide kind of way hed hung around with lol when the adrenalin kicked into frannie bliss there were over fifty pylons in this part of the valley he said and this was one of the big ones it was carrying volts and roddy lodge lodge was about forty feet up like a crawling insect not far beneath the first pair of arms at the end of which the live powerlines were coiled around insulators resembling hanging candles of knobbly green glass lol heard bliss telling someone to call for an ambulance and the fire brigade he was standing about twenty feet from the pylons splayed legs of reinforced steel hands in the pockets of his hiking jacket more controlled now that he could see his prisoner again could see that the prisoner had nowhere to go nowhere in this world lol wiped his glasses on the sleeve of his jacket it had stopped raining but the wind was up the wires were zinging in his head vicarious vertigo youre not with the police then the bearded man said directly in front of them was the abandoned excavation the spade still sticking out of it from here they could see the whole of the pylon maybe feet tall and the shape of howle hill behind it a black thumbprint on the sky im just one of the gravediggers lol said that mean i can actually talk to you without i get told to climb back on the school bus and leave it to the grownups least the police dont have guns lol said hoping he was right about this one of the reasons i came home my friend protest about something in new labour britain you dont get shot you just get patronized names sam hall by the way lol lol robinson he saw that sam hall was older than hed first appeared well into his sixties maybe beyond that that backwoodspioneer look grizzling over the years tough day lol sam said mildly as if they were unwinding at something not overexciting like crowngreen bowling before lol could reply a woman screamed he saw roddy lodge gripping an overhead girder swinging himself apelike into a steel v finally wedging there the orange overalls might have been designed to make him conspicuous in a pylon at night like a warning beacon for aircraft aw roddy a small shrillness under frannie blisss voice as he called up roddy you daft bugger wheres this gonna get yer tell me that eh no answer thats because he doesnt know sam hall said to lol sorry less of course he has an end in mind lol glanced sharply at him which would depend on whether hes done all they say hes done sam hall said how much dangers he in boy were all of us in danger from those monsters i could name you three maybe six peopled be alive today if theyd lived the other side of that hill but roddy my guess would be that hes done this before youll notice somebody already cut through the barbed wire the power guys snag around the base to stop people climbing and this is roddys land so id say it was him evidently knew where to find the footholds hes been up there before just look at the guy go roddy was moving again pulling himself onto the first of the great arms about sixty feet up now lamp beams following him for gods sake a woman shouted from behind them cant anyone get him down not possible ingrid sam hall said although there was no way she could hear him not worth the candle he said to lol towers earthed so anyone standing on its earthed too electricity will do anything to hitch a ride to the ground what happens he gets too close its gonna jump him and i wouldnt like to be the person holding on to his feet when it does you know a lot about it lol had his hands deep in his pockets hunched against the shivering worked in the power industry sam hall let out a big echoing laugh that sounded a little shocking in this situation like it was bouncing around the valley partner what i do is i work against the power industry roddy lodge had come fully to his feet he was standing on the arm a yard or so out from the shoulder holding on to a diagonal steel bar with one hand on the ground the policewoman tiffany and a male colleague were arranging a sheet of white plastic over the hole lol had dug weighting down the edges with bricks from a pile of building rubble fact is sam hall said a bunch of fat cats here and over in the us would give just about anything in the whole world to have me up there stead of that poor sucker a gasp of wind hit roddy and he swayed and lost his footing and slipped down between two girders and hung there his feet dangling in space christ lol whispered three police officers ran amid screams towards the pylon could be safer if he dropped now sam hall said he doesnt hit metal on the way down he might not die all depends on what he wants out of this this is a little early for you cariad eirion said hows the party yn cymreig im having to watch my grammar the whole partys in welsh jane sat on the edge of her bed wrapped in the big bath towel my stepgrans discovered cultural correctness in her old age and her heritage distant cousin of saunders lewis see youve lost me already anyone who wants to speak english is finding it expedient to go outside eirion said bit like having a fag out on the balcony wow jane said another world is that where you are now im in the kitchen but not i have to tell you because my welsh isnt wholly fluent where are you my bedroom just got out of the bath goose bumps everywhere she heard eirion moan faintly we could have telephone sex if you like jane said im letting the towel slip slowly down my breasts there are tiny bubbles of moisture what is it you want eirion said tightly ok i lied im fully dressed in fact its so cold in this house that im wearing my fleece and leg warmers thank you listen how far are you from the nearest computer decades eirion said obliquely check someone out for me on the net you remember jenny driscoll all softvoiced and drippy did these crappy daytime tv shows on fashion and decor and makeovers and stuff like the ones i always watch to find my feminine side irene this is yeah i do know who you mean nicelooking youre really into old ladies arent you theres a word for it and she lives in your village who told you that you did christ was i ever that sad irene listen this sounds this is going to sound very stupid but this woman this driscoll or mrs box as she now calls herself shes got her claws seriously into mum meaning what i cant tell you but it comes out of some middleaged religious obsession or maybe its just attention seeking or maybe shes just a lonely old bag i wouldnt like to venture a hard opinion at this stage but essentially shes claiming this is what shes told mum right that shes had a mystical experience involving an angel in the sky over the church our church dont laugh and she has a chapel in her house this kind of shrine under the floor and she took mum down there and there was incense and candles and stuff and of course mums reacting in a suitably spiritually correct fashion and you think this is another world eirion said its not actually a joke its not actually funny for at least one very bizarre reason that im not allowed to tell you about so dont ask me but i do not believe this woman has had any kind of experience and irene are you still there yeah i jane its still happening isnt it youre still huh your this whole darknightofthesoul thing a few months ago if anybody claimed to have seen an angel within fifty miles of ledwardine youd have been so excited youd be up all night with a video camera yeah well im over it all right it was pitiful and im finally over it you can waste your life on that kind of shit i dont think you mean that jane how would you know what i mean eirion sighed what do you want me to try and find out anything what happened to her marriage why she got out of tv any of the kind of scurrilous flotsam that gets washed up on the net surfing for shit just help me eirion silence i called him eirion jane thought in dismay you want any dirt i can find on moira cairns at the same time he said thats not fair no he said im sorry eirion didnt sound sorry he sounded disappointed somehow a crowd had gathered the way crowds did suddenly it was just there lol didnt know how many people lived around underhowle but at least seventy of them had to be here now the ones who hadnt broken through the police tape must have come across the fields on the other side of the pylon by the edge of the woods fringing howle hill perhaps forty people were standing within twenty feet of the tower like theyd bought tickets not enough police here to move them on like the police didnt have enough to think about frannie bliss was pacing around the base of the pylon conspicuously uneasy now lol could make out people crouching with their camcorders bliss stood back hands cupped around his mouth a sudden white light shone all around him someone had brought along one of those longdistance spotlamps roddy can you hear me son this is di bliss frannie bliss roddy lodge had pulled himself back on to the metal arm he was braced against the towers skeletal spine clouds had dropped away from the wafery moon and the girders gleamed white like bone roddy can you hear me on the ground bliss was competing against the spectator buzz but the voice from the pylon burst sharply in the air no like a hole punched in a paper bag making its own hush dont wanner talk to no more coppers roddy bliss bent backwards lets be sensible youre about six feet from enough juice to light up half the county just let yourself come down and take it very carefully you got nowhere else to go you know that son thats what a surprise blast of wind gasps from the crowd as lodge clutched at a steel diagonal caught it and clung to it thats what you reckons is it mr copper its very dangerous roddy thats all im saying theres massive voltage up there you know that silence roddy if you not to me ent no danger to me copper im electric already look frannie bliss stared at the churned ground lol could feel him groping for viable words high above him washed by swirling lights roddy lodge was glowing red like a pantomime demon lol willing him to give it up come down from there dont raise the stakes roddy suddenly reeled back one arm locked around the cross bar the other thrown across his face his feet seemed to skate on the metal the light sam hall said lights affecting him plus the shit coming off of the power lines hes gonna be disoriented by now his balancell go completely cant they see that angrily he strode down the field towards bliss two uniformed police came out of the dark from two sides restraining him sam turned on one of them not me you asshole get across there and tell some of those stupid bastards to switch off their lights if they dont want to kill him jesus whynt you jump a sudden strident male voice in the crowd whynt you take a bloody running jump lodge they do want to kill him lol thought sickened he was sweating and trembling with the cold but at the same time he was glad he was this side of the pylon away from that crowd it was an audience audiences wanted it all he felt hollow inside and his head was throbbing with fear for the man on the pylon the performer in the spotlights you reappear on stage now moira said softly in his ear its gonnae be like hey is that no the big sexoffender when he turned away teeth clenched he could still see the shining red figure projected like a hologram vibrating in charged air whynt you go for a swing on the high wire roddy the same mans voice save the taxpayers havin to keep you the rest of your bloody useless life a fragment of silence shaddup a woman shrieked you ent lived here two minutes its no damn business of yours bliss was tramping back up the field this is useless how am i supposed to try and talk him down with these fuckin hayseeds andy wheres right listen get half a dozen uniforms go across and get the lot of them out of there its gorra be private land tell them theyre trespassing theyre obstructing the police whatever you want but the first one objects you nick him he tore past lol making for the cars sam hall was back brushing himself down straightening his denim jacket this is not good no he looks down all he sees now is row upon row of blinding lights his heads gonna be close to exploding the lamps aimed up into the pylon made a white gauze in the rain mist lol sensed an ambivalence in the crowd hes a murderer hes murdered one of our own at least one yet lodge himself was one of their own the lights went in and out of focus lol looked down he saw a tiny red glow tracking across the field lodge the beams from the crowd swung down again like they were voiceactivated and found oh god found gomer parry standing where bliss had stood his cap off his white hair on end in the wind like a hearth brush a fresh rollup in his teeth lodge gomer parry plant hire you yearin me gomer bliss went lurching back no where was it you set that fire boy whered you go where was it you went monday night you knoooooooow a roar of pain gomer snatched out his ciggy say it boy say it again whered you go exacly that night tell these folks silence beams intersecting like aircraftspotting searchlights gomer waited rocking back on his heels in the mud i done it gomer bounced what where i burned him i f fried him a shrill giggle tremolo yelps i fried the fucking bastard in his own fat bliss had hold of gomer was dragging him away christs sake what you trying to you knooooooooooooow tryin to get at the bloody truth gomer pulled away which is moren you done and im tellin you boy it ent i done roddy lodge was shambling slowly along the downsloping arm of the pylon arms outstretched like a tightrope artist a man on a high diving board not too far above him now hung one of the insulators from the second tier its power hugging glass discs gleaming cold green candle of death i done em all blisss head went back his fists were clenched tight gomer just stood there and stared down at the ground both of them in shadow all the lights trained on the pylon roddy stopped even from where lol stood he could see lodge was grinning i done he shuffled swayed i done all them women i done lynsey i done i done mel you yearin me i done em all i done that welsh girl i done i done moren you knows cause bliss stood there ramming his fists into the sides of his thighs roddy reached up like he was trying to clasp the wind and the night cause im the devil im satan im the biggest fuckin serial killer ever lived you hear me i was gonner do fuckin fuckin madonna cause im number one look im number fuckin one silence fell like a canopy lol was suddenly and horrifically aware of something in the crowd that was less apprehension than a kind of active anticipation and yet he also actually heard someone beginning to weep a hoarse bubbling sound as the rain came down harder a distant siren the ambulance or the fire brigade lol watched gomer walking slowly away from the pylon looking at the ground the wind had reined itself in there was a dense waxy stillness to the air one of the police laughed uncertainly got the biggest witness list of all time there boss when hes in the dock lol heard sam hall saying very quietly he wont be will he gomer reached them muttering we digs holes is what we do ent no affair of ours now his voice was shaking lol had never heard gomers voice shaking before not even with anger ent up for no public execution we just digs holes ennit he kept on walking along the alley by the side of the garage lol followed him holding his spade at the end of the alley he looked back once and saw roddy lodge standing halfway down the arm of the tower with his hands reaching up as though other hands were up there in the night sky waiting to catch him lol didnt think he either saw or heard what happened next maybe his mind edited the moment a jump cut all he was fully aware of was the lights going out in roddys bungalow stadium rock they seemed to have awoken at about the same time in the still hollow of the early hours merrily sensed him becoming aware by touch that she was actually here in this strange bed in this unknown timberframed chamber that was strange to her too shed never slept in here before the air was different the sounds in the walls and it was the first time theyd slept together with no sex not that theyd slept together many times pathetically few in fact since theyd first done it in the summer done it here she was thirtyseven years old actually thinking of it with that old teenage delight in the forbidden an adventure two kids in a small secret room in an ancient house with timbers that creaked and grumbled in the lateoctober night it felt deliciously out of time a place you thought you could never reenter soft and sticky and warm and illicit and in the vicarage where the vicar might come in and catch you doing it doing it more spontaneously thrilling than making love that hint of sin shameful utterly when she thought its me im the vicar she couldnt stop giggling and hid her shame under the duvet because there really was nothing at all to laugh at tonight jane had gone off to bed with a book half an hour before gomer had arrived at the back door the kid must already have fallen asleep if shed heard him shed have been straight down it was elevenfifteen pm gomer had been looking very tired his glasses halfclouded in fact more than tired perturbed unhappy he didnt seem in the mood to talk he had with him some wreckage dressed in lols clothes boy ent in no fit state to drive home vicar figured you might have a bed made up in one of the spare rooms being as how youve always been strong on the idea of sanctuary see for the weary yes merrily had agreed that was a possibility lol had smiled lopsidedly there was a smear of dried mud on his forehead a pocket of his jacket was hanging off he stood there among the fallen apples looking like a refugee whod crossed eastern europe on foot shed wanted to laugh and to touch him gomer said and i figured youd wanner know anyway know evidently this had not turned out as expected looking at gomer now was reopening narrow channels of anxiety merrily hadnt asked about anything only offered him some tea and something to eat which hed declined claiming that if he sat down he wouldnt get up till morning shed watched him tramping back to his truck small and grey against the remaining lights of ledwardine there was only one other vehicle parked on the square shed gone back in and made some tea for lol and left him to drink it while she slipped upstairs and quickly made up a bed in the fifth bedroom the small one at the back of the house over the kitchen and therefore warmer than most of them also well away from the stairs leading to janes attic well talk in the morning merrily had said lol had wanted to tell her everything now but shed slipped away to run a bath for him he was here in her home what else mattered a lot but it would wait while he was in the bathroom shed stolen most of his clothes and loaded them into the washing machine when she came back upstairs nearly an hour later dressed for bed he was still wrapped in the towel lying on his stomach on the single divan in the fifth bedroom shed stood looking at him for quite a while his compact body his wet hair before taking away the towel and covering him with the duvet then shed set her alarm clock on the window sill knelt and prayed silently and then slipped in next to him putting out the light so we we went back lol said how could we not they had their arms around one another holding themselves together in the narrow bed in the darkness chaos people screaming and pushing as if they thought the whole area was in danger of becoming electrified couldnt get out of there fast enough she was visualizing it recalling the pylon standing over the bungalow in a whole valley polluted with pylons bliss went crazy had everybody thrown out except gomer and me and that was only because he wanted to give gomer a bollocking lol stared into the dark gomer was right it turned into a public execution he wasnt still up there no he fell off when we got back to the field he was lying at the foot of the pylon someone said he was still twitching but i couldnt but you didnt actually see it happen wanting him not to have detailed images lived for years in lols head today had left multiple bruises and scratches on his body and his face and that was enough i dont know his hand tightened around her upper arm against the memory its all mixed up with what other people said they saw there was a bang a flash of light he was all lit up for a moment somebody said merrily was picturing roddy lodges angular jutting puppet face jerking in spasms she shuddered was this really where hed wanted to end up when hed slipped quietly away from the police she recalled him screaming at gomer that night at the pawson house chicken then is it you chickenshit when we saw him afterwards lol said i didnt know what to expect whether hed be burned to a crisp but it doesnt this guy told me its like a microwave cooks from the inside but was he trying to kill himself did he know what he was doing she was feeling leaden inside now with guilt and remorse recalling that initial relief when shed been spared a meeting with roddy lodge at hereford police station because of the intervention of his solicitor who had insisted his client was mentally ill why had lodge wanted to see her what had he wanted to tell her that he was refusing at least at that stage to tell the police and would it have made a difference lol said in the end he was holding out his arms standing there on the arm of the pylon spotlit from all directions and hes suddenly flinging out his arms bliss had been shouting up to him about the dangers he shouted back that he was electric already this was some minutes before he before the electricity jumped into him there was this guy there called sam and hed said that was what might happen whether the wind or the rain made a difference i dont know but he couldntve touched anything his fingers mustve been at least a couple of feet from this hanging thing the insulator hanging down from the second arm above him this was just after he confessed she felt his face move against her hair lol nodding so gomer bliss obviously blamed gomer for pushing lodge to the brink the confession obviously that was what bliss wanted but not in public the way it happened it was like lodge was i dont know stealing his glory merrily said stealing the case right out of his hands and giving it to everybody stealing the whole judicial process roddy lodge having the last laugh hijacking frannies result and gomer gomer wasnt laughing hed got what he wanted roddy did confess to the fire and nev what about nev he said he fried the fat bastard so gomer got his confession too finally it was really odd all the way back here he said hardly a word youd expect some kind of cathartic reaction but not a word i think gomer was seriously stunned you travelled all the way back in silence merrily felt around on the oakboarded floor for her cigarettes no he talked about this and that the tanks and why we hadnt found any bodies underneath them how that was one secret lodge had taken to his grave which of course is another problem for bliss nobodys going to tell him where to look now he could dig up half the county and still not get close lot of explaining ahead for frannie id imagine she thought about bliss and his messy home life and the job only the police gave it a capital j becoming his refuge it wasnt going to be much of one now his superiors would want to know exactly how he came to mislay his prisoner why hed sat on the case kept it to himself hired the volatile gomer parry to dig up septic tanks installed by a man gomer believed had murdered his nephew she wondered how much of a basis bliss had really had for bringing roddy lodge out to underhowle how much lodge had actually told him in the interview room evidently hed admitted to several killings but had he given any indication of why serial killers had become a species their motives taken for granted they were male predators and that was it jungle carnivores bringing down young women like gazelles to be pawed and raked at leisure leave it merrily peered at the old luminous alarm clock in the window she didnt want to oversleep and have jane find them here in the morning even though the kid would probably be delighted hell it was the morning in three minutes time it would be hell four am lol said suddenly i felt sorry for him bliss lodge his voice sounded distant detached his arm went slack around her thats not right is it how can anybody feel sorry for a man who killed women merrily said its a christian thing trite empathy lol said i saw him up there and i seemed to feel what he was feeling or it translated itself it was like stadium rock all the lights pink floyd or something crazy or something merrily said whens the gig oh next week wednesday why didnt you tell me i in case you mean youre considering not doing it its a moira cairns concert thats all it says on the posters nobody would be the wiser im going to order some tickets dont do that i can get you some shell be worth seeing she i want to buy them she said out of my meagre stipend merrily shush theyd agreed that in the morning he would stay up here until jane wasnt around and then hed slip quietly away through the orchard to pick up his car at gomers no one would know merrily felt tearful why did you do it why did you offer to go with gomer i like gomer she reached for his hand it felt like halfset concrete feels like you wont be able to pick up a guitar for days she stiffened is that why is it he kissed her naked shoulder and i sensed people wanting him to die i was sure i sensed people wanting to see him die lol sighed as if this was something he needed to get out of himself merrily was about to say something when she realized he was asleep she kissed his forehead and wondered if he was dreaming about roddy lodge or moira cairns part four i am glowing radioactive we draw beams around the world super furry animals rings around the world icon it was during her sermon the following sunday that merrily realized it wasnt over that roddy lodge though dead wasnt out of her life this morning shed awakened at five am or thereabouts after the return of that old recurring dream the one where she suddenly discovered she was living in a house with three floors after thinking there were only two and on the third floor was something dreadful and she knew that shed have to go up there and face it alone she was moving very slowly up the second staircase the fear of reaching the top intensified by the inability to turn back in dreams turning back never seemed to be an option when the dark upper landing suddenly came into view and then she was at the top and the first strange door was just above her and beneath it was a thin grin of icy violet light this was enough ejecting in terror from the dream merrily had rolled over with an urgent need to be held but the bed was wide and empty and outside the uncurtained window the boughs of old apple trees were creaking in the sour october wind alone for two nights after lol had gone shed gone back to the fifth bedroom slept in the single bed theyd shared before returning despondently to her own bigger room sad huh and puzzled and unhappy because now she actually was living in an old house with three floors and jane was in possession of the attics she thought shed dealt with the third floor here in church there were more stairs she preferred to avoid the polished wooden steps to the pulpit she knew she should really be up there this morning little woman big congregation even for october when they tended to increase because there were no lawns to mow and the kids had stopped demanding days out here close to the front sat big jim prosser from the eighttilllate which reduced its sunday opening hours at the end of the tourist season here even was kent asprey heartthrob jogging gp back with his wife after a midlifecrisis fling a penitent kent with mrs asprey one week only probably merrily put a tentative foot on the first pulpit step then backed down again what shed been doing during the summer and early autumn when congregations were smaller and cosier was to sit on a hassock on the carpeted chancel steps under the apple screen and not preach but chat sometimes a few members of the congregation would join in and there was a sense of warmth and unity she found it exciting was never sure where it would lead one sunday it had spontaneously opened out like a flower into communal meditation it was hardly going to happen today the congregation was like the bed too big too cold too quiet and swollen by too many comparative strangers whose presence could only be explained by curiosity over rumours of merrilys links through gomer with the roddy lodge sensation an electric death still pulsing in herefordshire like a snaking naked wire this was a small county everybody knew somebody related to the lodge family or the families of girls and women missing from home one was from a farm near staunton just a few miles from ledwardine or at least someone who had considered having an efflapure system installed everyone had been exposed to radio and tv reports and centrespreads with the same grisly sequence of pictures and tasteless variations on the daily stars villagers watch in horror as man boasts im the biggest serial killer ever then is fried in the sky underhowle itself was reported to be in a grey state of communal shock nearly a hundred people including children as young as five and six had heard roddy lodge confess then watched him die many were being treated and counselled for the trauma and the shock waves radiated outwards tracks of the border beast on the third day most of the headlines were variations of this one from the mail where had roddy lodge been where might he have interred the bodies is there a corpse under your septic tank the mail asked the speculation now was that this was a false trail coldstoring the body of lynsey davies in the peagravel under the efflapure had been a oneoff emergency measure maybe lodge had felt in danger of discovery at the time anyway there would surely have been better options open to a killer with his own jcb so the other bodies could be anywhere all over herefordshire and the forest of dean this particularly was a live issue and merrily had felt obliged to address it had assembled a sermon around the life and death of roddy lodge why did such people exist why had god created serial killers a difficult one why exactly it was certainly not a question voiced by the grateful papers as the search for bodies went on as police interviewed and reinterviewed the relatives of missing women and girls across five shires as press and tv cameramen prowled underhowle reporters free to speculate now that the killer who had confessed so publicly was never going to face trial and the police in this case were who exactly no mention in the papers of bliss or indeed of dci annie howe all the press briefings had been given by a detective superintendent luke fleming merrily had never heard of him must have been from headquarters she noticed that there was nothing in any of the papers about roddys taste in bedroom decor given that he was dead why not every day shed expected her own involvement in the discovery of lynsey davies to be disclosed by the police but despite the local gossip inadvertently fuelled by gomer she suspected as he pursued the truth about the fire nobody had approached her this morning preparing for holy communion in the early light shed decided to dump the roddy lodge sermon it had seemed unnecessary gratuitous sermon b then she didnt sit on the hassock but she didnt go into the pulpit either she stood at the side of the lectern erm she felt obscurely nervous she really needed notes for this one but there was nowhere to conceal them and because pews were filled further back than of late she had to project more than shed become accustomed to had to make like a preacher if we if we sit down and really think about it i suspect most of us will remember an occasion when somethings happened very suddenly to divert us from a certain course of action maybe a flat tyre that stopped you making a particular journey and then some time later you find out that that journey might have led you into a far bigger crisis a motorway pileup or some confrontation that you might not have been able to handle and then you say and how often have most of us said this she leaned out an arm around the stem of the lectern found herself locking gazes for a second with james bulldavies three pews from the front perhaps it was meant she stepped back thats a useful phrase isnt it meant by whom by god and why should god single us out for salvation why should we be diverted from the pileup thats going to kill or injure several other people longish pause for the christian theres another option suppose we think about that phrase in the context of the possibility of there being she smiled faintly angels among us jenny box was close to the front to merrilys right washed in amber light from the circular stainedglass window in which a clutch of apples was pensively surveyed by several angels jenny box with her fine oldgold hair under a small white hat that was almost a skullcap her eyes unblinking but also unfocused as if gazing into the ether merrily wondered how thomas aquinas would have handled this what do i mean by angels to be quite honest im not sure do i mean heavenly forces agents of change powerful invisible intelligences capable of assessing a situation seeing the direction its going anticipating the consequences and occasionally intervening sometimes as a result of prayer but often quite spontaneously or so it seems mrs box was watching her now merrily avoided her gaze we talk about governments being interventionist or non interventionist should they step in and overrule market forces or whatever its always a fine balance and because governments dont have godlike wisdom or much wisdom at all you might think sometimes they often intervene over the wrong issues but we have to assume that angels that they never get it wrong she hadnt had time to prepare this properly she was opening a can of worms were angels messengers of god or aspects of god to what extent were they independent was this the time to mention ledwardines own angel not the one with the sword allegedly witnessed spreading its radiance over the church in a thunderstorm but the anonymous one with the bin sack full of used fifties that would take their minds off roddy lodge for a while maybe not uncle ted had whispered to her earlier as they came into church that he was still awaiting police clearance on the money if he didnt hear anything this week he was damn well getting back onto them the bible doesnt go into too much detail about the nature of angels they just are most of us if we think about them at all think of them in the context of particular episodes usually involving halos and harps and a few gobsmacked shepherds or we might mention with a shiver something we like to call the angel of death which merrily looked up at the stainedglass window with the apples the angels there were solid and looked female with their extravagant golden curls and small pursed lips which we always see as something horribly sinister rather than something gentle and understanding which exists to guide us through what for most of us is the only situation since birth in which we are one hundred per cent helpless jenny box had lowered her gaze merrily thought of all the hospital beds shed sensed to be enfolded in dark downy wings but then the thought pierced her like a thin blade what was the angel of death doing when the face of lynsey davies was turning blue under the savage pressure her eyes bulging her tongue i as far as i know ive never seen an angel so i really cant tell you if they look like the ones in the windows over there if theyve got actual wings or if theyre light and vague or as invisible as breath i suspect that angels look just like us and how many others are dead nobody knows and why nobody knows some people do claim to have actually seen them in times of crisis some to have sensed them she swallowed lifted her eyes and her thoughts had she sensed them at her shoulder during a eucharist once perhaps on christmas day in an aura of profound holiness as the bells awoke the valley most of us though have only seen evidence of what appears to be a practical intelligence which comes out of nowhere to alter a situation now that in itself thats such an amazing concept such a superman thing that its easy to get carried away to start looking for angels looking for evidence of angelic intervention in everything every little situation she paused looking around for jane who would occasionally slip in at the back without making a thing about it no sign of her today no surprise my own feeling for what its worth is that angels are a layer of creation an aspect of divinity of which we should be aware or more aware and if we ever have reason to think that an angel has intervened for us then maybe we shouldnt just say oh it was meant we should spend some time thinking why why me why now what merrily was thinking right now was that all this sermon had told its listeners so far was that this vicar hadnt yet worked out where she stood on angels or indeed on jenny box probably the parish churchs biggest benefactor since the bull family ran out of spare cash she looked into the congregation perhaps for some guidance on how far to take this and caught a movement from the bottom end of the nave frannie bliss walking quietly through from the porch frannie bliss but like several others bliss must have left before the after service tea and coffee either that or shed imagined him jenny box didnt stay either but then she never had she probably considered the serving of refreshments to be misuse of a holy sanctuary on this one merrily would always disagree this was about giving and sharing and opening up not taking peoples money sometimes people would want to discuss aspects of the sermon but not today nobody it seemed wanted to disclose a personal angelic encounter outside after everyone had gone only james bulldavies hung around in the churchyard it was a james kind of day stiff blustery he angled over hands behind his back stared moodily at a windfall apple that had landed on a grave this box woman merrily drew her woollen cape over her surplice tilted her head to one side curious pulled prematurely from the army on the death of his father james had reluctantly shouldered what he perceived to be his familys burden of responsibility for the village lately however under the influence of alison no doubt he seemed to have shrugged much of it off coming to church alone avoiding the traditional bull pew generally adopting a neutral stance on parish issues dont like to interfere mrs watkins he cleared his throat as you know hows alison fine he flicked a brittle wafer of lichen from the eighteenth century headstone opposite the porch met the husband have you husband james folded his arms looked down at his shoes he had on a checked shirt and a mudcoloured tie under the old tweed jacket he wore like battledress encountered the guy in the swan friday evening up here for the weekend works in london ive never met him worried man james gazed over merrilys head towards the lychgate no one wants a wife playing away merrily blinked she got a sudden flashback of james at the height of his crisis drunk on the square alison trying to haul him into the land rover mistress hed called her and then whore ownership but alison had been cool about all that another man merrily said here good lord no james snorted gord mrs watkins gord what has its place religion the church always accepted that as you know part of the framework more of these newcomers we can bring into the fold the better absolutely fanaticism however something else entirely oh i see you mean god is the the other man she smiled church for james was a local obligation a necessary hour of faint tedium on a hard pew smelling of polish echoes of public school jamess school had had masters when the idea of a woman priestincharge had been mooted for ledwardine hed apparently been the first to object shed kind of thought that was in the past find this amusing do you vicar james she said hes my boss he sniffed look she said its not awfully warm here do you want to come back to the vicarage sit down with a cup of tea and no he shook his head quickly no time sorry i just this is simply the gypsys warning all right im strongly suggesting you keep that woman at arms length if you know whats good for you sorry dont mean that to sound like a threat of course not simply that box told me some things guyd had a few drinks so im treating most of it as confidential however presume you know shes been in psychiatric care no i didnt know that well there you are but merrily thought of lol we do try not to hold it against people let the loonies come unto me sayeth the lord and i shall mrs watkins james said wearily i realize that taking the piss out of me has become a little hobby of yours but whats he like what mr box oh he considered my height perhaps an inch or two taller a little older than her but not appreciably keeps himself fit he avoided merrilys eyes inspecting the oak frame of the porch as if the bulls still paid for its maintenance yes she said but whats he like exjournalist businessman now handles her shops says he does all the work she wanders round tweaks a few things dont know these shops myself decor saying it like youd say blue movies smoothish type is he still here wouldnt know we were only introduced on friday guyd drifted into the swan for a few drinks because he was a little tired of sitting there watching his wife reading her bible and mouthing psalms he told you that behind him in the churchyard merrily saw a tiny tendril of smoke rising not in so many words conjecture look vicar i dont know the ins and outs of it never been anyones idea of a marriage guidance counsellor thank gord i suppose not but if box is blaming anyone james dropped his hand from the oak then id say hes looking in your general direction and thats a bit more than conjecture how do you mean well i i james glared down towards the lych gate as though wishing he was out of it womans got a bit of a crush on you after all pretty common knowledge in the village what ah wrong word as usual sorry still big thing women getting ordained more underneath all that than any of us suspected and you yourself all this crosswaving holywater im simply saying youve probably become a whats the word if you mean role model icon bloody hell james wrong word too is it shut your mouth james bloody hell she was shocked couldnt look at him as they walked out under the lych gate she glanced back down the crooked alley of graves to where shed seen the smoke gomer parry was sitting in his usual spot on minnies grave a rollup in his mouth poor old parry james had followed her gaze never bloody rains eh they buried his nephew yet next week after the opening of the inquest bad show didnt notice him in church having problems with the old faith you think merrily said nothing gomer always went to minnies grave when he had something to work out along with minnie hed buried both their watches with new batteries gomers was one of the old kind which despite the batteries still ticked loudly sometimes hed said he thought he could still hear it helped him think she watched the smoke rise from gomers ciggy darkening the day a signal of distress something was wrong after hed told minnie maybe hed tell her when they reached the square she said to james you going to come and discuss this thing in private tell me what on earth people are saying i think not james sniffed the air never been a gossip anyway told alison id be back before one ive said all i wanted to say question of watching your back vicar watching your back thank you james merely nodded and walked away with long strides merrily looked around the square as if there might be small knots of people pointing at her and muttering maybe the angel sermon hadnt been such a good idea maybe if jenny box had told anyone else here about her vision it was a very bad idea in fact the square was empty except for frannie bliss leaning against one of the oak pillars of the little market hall munching a mars bar merrily sighed aura of old hippy lol took the call just before one on the kitchen phone at profs from the studio he could hear a playback of moiras lady of the tower veined now with the seamless cello of simon st john just moiras voice and simons cello experimental on the phone he heard that you boy you know who this is a warm voice not quite american lol was momentarily baffled before the voice threw up an image of the sepia sleeve of the bands second album all beards and back porch sam lol i hope you dont mind this intrusion i got your number through talking to the cop bliss came over to see me a couple days back has he calmed down now i guess you might say that sam hall said though he doesnt strike me as a man who can handle calm too well anyhow we had a talk and it uh it all came out about you and what you did when you werent up to your ass in mud that bliss lol said so discreet its a wonder he never made the special branch behind him simons cello glided over the chasm left by moiras voice after the verse where the messenger climbed down from his horse and the night was in his eyes so in the afternoon i went on down to the village hall sam said they have a community computer room there courtesy of mr cody and i started to search the web and hey there you were boy all over the show folks saying how come this guy is a footnote to so many other peoples careers whered he go folks all over the world america australia asking questions about lol robinson but you didnt just ring up to scare me sam laughed which i concede is the good side of the web people talking to each other sharing enthusiasms the payback however in phone lines in power thats bad bad bad but even a dangerous crank and a madman such as myself has to compromise sometimes which is how i wound up at ross records and they didnt have the hazey jane albums but they did have this collection by norma waterstone with the bakers lament and well the up and down of it is youre good boy you are good lol was confused thanks thats kind of you but i like how you write what are essentially new folk songs the bakers lament thats a new song sounds like its been around for ever till you really listen to the words discover its a new take on an old theme and it packs a strong message about what is happening to the countryside so the upshot i wound up buying this norma waterstone album er waterson lol said some voice huh played it four times last night used up all of my power ration listen im gonna come to the point lol youre a guy feels strongly about the destruction of the country you know my take on all that and the power lines but you dont know it all there is so much more well im sure and listen i dont mean worldwide i mean here im talking underhowle im talking lodge and im talking melanie pullman i talk about this the whole time and nobody listens to me cause im this old crank this lunatic with a chip im the fool on the goddam hill man and nobody listens wanna cut me off now go on lol said you wanna cut me off you cut me off everybody cuts me off sometime anyhow after the boy died the other night i listened to all my neighbours walking home saying how it was all for the best save the taxpayers having to keep him in jail for the rest of his miserable life and im thinking hell am i the only person in this whole village sees this as some kind of a tragedy im always saying that am i the only person in this whole valley knows whats happening to us all anyhow this time i went home and i started to write myself a poem sat up the whole night to finish it a twocandle poem and when bliss told me about you i started thinking hey this is more than coincidence this is meant to be not one of lols favourite phrases meant to be was a trap im gonna ask you straight out sam said i like to be direct if theres any way at all that you could find the time to turn this poem into a song well i dont have the money to pay you but you could keep the song if you liked the idea and the cause is good its a world issue and a big one its what my lifes been building towards sam paused you still there boy you hung up on me yet when eirion called jane was lying on her bed with ethel the cat and a paperback as soon as she heard his voice she thrust the book under the pillow as if he could see it down the line eirion said im afraid i have to tell you she seems genuine jane there is like no dirt at all on jenny driscoll not on the net anyway and i searched hard in fact what ive read i rather like jane thought that with this unnatural thing he was developing for oncegoodlooking old ladies his opinion was hardly to be trusted but she didnt say anything do you want to know now eirion said or shall i print some of it out and fax it over or something can you give it to me potted ill stop you if anything sounds interesting ok eirion cleared his throat and started to enunciate like it was the voiceover on a tv biog she was born in county wicklow into a respectable lowermiddleclass family father was the manager of a small softdrinks business as a teenager jenny apparently got itchy feet and sent her picture to a model agency with an office in dublin it turned out she had the kind of looks that appealed at the time and she wound up in london within a year someone said she looked like a girl who bruised easily evidently a famous quote this was the postpunk new romantic era apparently terrible clothes terrible music and this element of sadomasochism mum was there ive seen the pictures she was briefly into goth yes eirion said thoughtfully i know lewis jane gave it serious menace kill that fantasy right now eirion chuckled ok so new romantic jane knew some of this but there might be something new but romantic in a kind of besmirched way eirion said because she looked so vulnerable they were putting her into these vivienne westwood type of things so that she came across like some kind of teenage streetwalker smudged lip gloss and mascara with dribbles like shed been crying tarnished before her time you know it was all a little bit pervy i suspect im so glad you recognize it she seems to have recognized it anyway eirion said she suddenly packed in modelling at the height of her career washed off all the makeup and got a job in childrens television on the production side how saintly where she was soon found to have an aptitude for presenting what do you know and kids liked her because she still had this faintly risqué reputation so in no time shes presenting this cult teenage show she was out of her teens by then but she didnt look it and she eventually became quite popular with parents and older people because there was obviously a genuinely nice person underneath and as she got older she resurfaced presenting these lifestyle kind of shows this is the mid to late nineties when she was also offered a column on one of the papers couldve been the mail or the express i forget but that was how she met her husband gareth box a journalist wrote the column for her do you have to be disparaging all the time eirion said box was an assistant editor in charge of features or something but since she was making so much more money than him he seems to have packed that in soon after they got married to manage her career maybe she was being exploited hmm jane said sceptically anyway this was when private tv production was really taking off and jenny and her husband came a long way very rapidly and started creating these home makeover type of programmes with heavy emphasis on feng shui there was a series for channel four which i remember seeing a couple of and it was actually pretty good and that was when they set up this shop called vestalia which very rapidly became a chain and seems to be worth well a lot of money never put a foot wrong then but then she backed out of the spotlight or she saw when the spotlight was about to move on or they were making so much money that she didnt need all that bullshit any more there was some speculation at this time that the marriage was cracking up eirion said although she was never linked with anyone else staying together for the sake of the business i dont know jane they were worth quite a lot by then because vestalia was into major cities and also changing direction one article i found from the telegraph at the end of last year was about how she was increasingly into personal development and meditation and spirituality and he wasnt particularly but he went along with it and it was then that the shops started to really specialize in creating a spiritual home environment theyd stopped using the phrase feng shui though because that was seen as a passing fad this is quite good actually jane said were getting closer in fact this was moving nicely in the direction of home chapels she slid the paperback book out from under the pillow it was called working with angels fairies and nature spirits about a year ago ok she would admit this shed been finding it seriously inspirational entirely sensible in its evocation of a complex world with all these different layers of existence all these forces and incorporeal intelligences you could call on to improve and focus your own life now however as a more balanced person she was simply consulting the book to establish where the box woman was coming from obviously it helped that not too long ago jane herself had been just as loopy but there was method in jennys particular madness her socalled spiritual development always seemed to run parallel with an increase in material wealth the bottom line this didnt sound like a woman who gave away eighty grand without some underlying purpose unconnected with her immortal soul you actually did ok here irene how very kind eirion said no really i mean thanks maybe she and eirion approaching this from different directions his investigative skills her background esoteric knowledge could nail the duplicitous bitch to the wall before mum got stitched up what do you do now how do you respond to this prof levin advanced on lol across the studio floor what you do now laurence is not respond that is you decline rapido because the one thing you of all people do not need at this stage is to get in with crazies so what you do is you call him back and you put it very politely and very firmly you dont ask any more questions you resist all his attempts to make you read the lyric and you never ever write a song or the merest line of a song that reflects this proposed theme in any way except lol backed up against the glasssided recording booth i kind of you then make sure to avoid having dealings of any kind with this person ever again only i kind of like him lol said jesus prof feigned an intention to put his foot through the golden weave fronting the guild acoustic amp of course you liked him these people theyre oh so very nice and humble and they tell you youre lennon and dylan and paul simon all rolled into one and they would consider it an honour to in some small way serve your art pah two years later five ten whenever it seems like youre finally doing ok for yourself along comes the exceedingly unfriendly letter from their lawyer he actually dealt with that lol said he said he was prepared to sign the whole thing over to me draw up whatever document you like he said and ill sign it he said this wasnt about money laurence everything at some stage is about money however this is your funeral prof turned away shaking his head and mooched off towards the kitchen and his cappuccino machine make it a noisy one when hed gone moira cairns leaned back against the outside wall of the recording booth she wore very tight jeans and a black top her hair loosely tied behind with a crimson ribbon so she said what is the great world issue this guy feels so strongly about electricity lol said pylons dangers of ah so this would be a person you met at the ah execution moira came to sit on the amp opposite tell me about it wheres the guy coming from exactly strong aura of old hippy lol said hes very proud that some elements in the us government and the power companies were glad to get him off their backs he talks about extensive scientific research linking overhead power lines with everything from brain tumours to leukaemia clusters research that is constantly ignored therell be background there always is lol told her that sam hall appeared to live in a remote cabin on howle hill generating his own electricity with a windmill while putting pressure on the power companies if not exactly to accept responsibility for all the health damage then at least to run more cables underground in rural areas he says hes a crank and a loony and proud of it and he admits to propositioning anyone he thinks might be able to publicize the cause he says that seeing lodge dying up there traumatized him into action again i mean if he was asking bruce springsteen or sting to write a song about it moira put her head on one side perhaps he doesnae know sting and springsteen listen loony or not i wouldnae quarrel with the sentiments i hate those things there has to be a better way going round with gomer i got to see the whole valley on environmental grounds alone id like to help assuming hes on the level i mean we dont get to do much for anybody do we in this business not like some people not like your wee friend the reverend huh moira smiled lol stared at her in dismay people always said she was psychic they didnt say she had the ability to uncover the hidden motives you hadnt even admitted to yourself its so charming the way you blush moira said so few guys today can still do that laurence its perfectly fine for you to wannae be involved with the stuff in her life like i said the other night a guy who understands the nature of madness he let out a shallow baffled sigh there was something else it was when i was standing there watching this man climbing up towards eternity knowing how it was going to end and getting a strong feeling of people wanting it to happen what like the audience at the colosseum or somewhere willing the emperor to give the thumbsdown to the gladiator who came second i dont know it was like there was something there to be understood what did you arrange with this guy he said come and see him sometime bring your lady he said will she go with you i cant see her having time tell you what moira stood up suppose i were to tag along check out this guy i can be quite intuitive you know that wouldnae bother you if i came along no that would be call him then i cant call him he doesnt have a phone you leave a message for him at the village hall and he calls you back there are lots of things he doesnt have interesting moira said nothing but the night the wife bliss said kirsty shovelling a third sugar into his coffee letting the spoon clang on the tabletop aw its dead difficult merrily this personal shite the first thing shed noticed was that he hadnt shaved this wasnt frannie frannie was dapper frannie was tidy he drank some of the coffee made a face i mean ive gorra say i never really wanted a wife in some ways it was that simple merrily rolled her eyes the police its like you either go at it firing on all four cylinders day and night or its just a just a job me i never wanted just work im like you it had to be a vocation a calling and there was never gonna be a wife not till i was pushing forty anyway and i certainly never wanted kids there were tears in his eyes now needy little twats have you had anything proper to eat frannie merrily asked hed told her on the square that hed give her an hour or so to get changed get sorted meaning get jane out of the way she guessed and then hed come and see her if that was all right nothing for me thanks he put up both hands kirsty she used to make me take a flamin yoghurt to work she doesnt bother any more i miss that he looked out of the window towards the ragged apple trees there was silence not even the mousescratch of jane listening behind the door to the hall perhaps merrily thought shed grown out of that and therefore really had gone up to her apartment after lunch shed be back at school tomorrow so shes a local girl merrily said kirsty shit on her shoes soon as she could walk bliss made a desolate face all her familys sunk into these bloody deadend farms all within about ten miles ma and pa and her old bloody gran and about six thousand aunties jesus they look so normal when you first meet them country girls she worked in the fashion department at chadds she was very chic so anyway thats why im still out here chasing sheepshaggers before we got married west mercia was gonna be strictly shortterm i was looking towards i dunno the met yeh maybe the met or even back to merseyside with a bit of rank to stand on but kirsty shed just die in a big city just curl up and im not kidding im not exaggerating i know i hate that in her its not how wives are supposed to be is it shes supposed to want to follow me to the ends of wherever except that wherever you go youve always got your family around you merrily said because your familys coppers the job and she knows that and she knows that if shes stuck in some city suburb and all she has is you and youre not there half the time very slick reverend very psychologically acute true though probably bliss said tell me if this is not what you came for i mean you could always go to your longsuffering priest for five hail marys and a yeh all right its what i came for shuffling round the village square like a stray dog on a sunday morning its finally come to this merrily poured herself some black tea so you made a martyr of yourself you put your career on the back shelf for love tugging me forelock to fasttrack floozies like annie howe grovelling on me knees to pofaced jobsworth gits like fleming listen i might not be universityeducated merrily but i was doing all right ive had approaches you know you get enough results its still possible to make your own fast track until you fall off it yeh bliss looked at her you fall off you go down the flamin embankment so fast you break both legs so ive gorra simple choice stay here and rot in an office or bugger off what a waste either way what a fuckin waste ok merrily reached for her cigarettes lets look at the facts after what happened in underhowle this luke fleming comes over from headquarters and decides that you mishandled the case from the start if you hadnt kept it all to yourself played all these wild cards including gomer roddy lodge would be safely tucked up in his cell instead of on the slab i took a risk bliss leaned on an elbow hand cupped around his unshaven jaw several risks even i couldve told you that you did mmm well when you thought about it he was actually lucky his conduct hadnt been the subject of an internal inquiry in fact with an inquest pending he wasnt out of the disciplinary shadows yet and yet merrily couldnt help thinking that the last time shed been aware of him bending the rules was when last summer hed passed information to lol that might well have prevented annie howe hanging her out to dry on a very public washing line did she still owe him did it matter anyway i mean it could have been worse frannie suspended bumped down to sergeant but that wouldve been a public admission that we fucked up still comes down to the fact that ive no future in west mercia now and the normal thing would be to go on the transfer list and we know what that means have you asked her indirectly we had a big row last night ended with me driving off and sleeping in the car my fault as usual when the jobs going well im not there when its not im there but im flamin unbearable i could stay on in hereford work me shifts gradually mature into the mellow but secretly bitter and twisted old di who lets the youngsters buy him pints and passes on his wisdom how would it be if i had a chat to kirsty and let her know ive been telling yer all this look ive gorra fair bit of leave owing as you can imagine its been suggested that i take it now kirsty thought it might be a good idea if we left the kids with her ma and went away for a week to try and get ourselves sorted that was a very good idea merrily thought that was what the row was about bliss said merrily closed her eyes in despair oh frannie you clown i cant leave it like this merrily ive gorra know know what for heavens sake if i was right bliss leaned heavily on the table spilling sugar making his mug and spoon rattle you know what theyre saying now you know what flemings saying hes saying that what were looking at with roddy lodge is a one off bogstandard commonasmuck domestic that he strangled his girlfriend during a drunken barney figuring he could cover it up with no fuss but when we pulled him being the kind of cocky sod he was he gets carried away with the bigkiller image that was flemings first assessment of the situation in other words hes saying roddy lodge serial killer was created by me oh and then he talks to roddys gp and then he consults moffat the forensic shrink who confirms that roddy was exhibiting absolutely classic symptoms of advanced manic depression you see where thats going it merrily hesitated lol would know for sure but she had a good idea and it fitted all too well they lie dont they she said glumly manicdepressives lie on an industrial scale exactly bliss smiled icily in the manic phase they may tell extravagant lies which can be very convincing because they half believe it themselves if it isnt the truth they believe it ought to be in other words they boast about things they havent actually done i done tanks for all the nobs all over the three counties and down into wales i done prince charless fuckin sewage over at highgrove bliss said flemings pointing to one thing in particular that roddy came out with when he was up the pylon he said he was gonna kill madonna we have all this on tape of course thanks to some local smartarse with a video camera you yourself said he claimed to have done madonnas drainage in the cotswolds and of course madonna doesnt even live in the cotswolds he got that wrong her place is down in bloody somerset or somewhere roddy lodge never got closer to madonna than pictures in the news of the world but what about the other two melanie pullman and the girl from monmouth theyre saying i offered those names to him and he went for them with his tongue out they say my style of questioning was antiquated and inept given that weve no proof that either of the women are even dead to deal with it once and for all flemings hired another firm with five diggers theyd excavated about fifteen more efflapures by yesterday nothing he didnt even answer merrily didnt know what to say if roddy lodge in fact hadnt been a serial killer at all if there werent any more bodies buried then that was surely the best possible outcome except that frannie would be seen as an ambitious but misguided detective whod driven a man to his death a man who if hardly innocent was certainly guilty on a far lesser scale than oh hell bliss put his hands behind his head and stretched out his legs talking flatvoiced to the ceiling the last thing fleming said yesterday afternoon was that if id suggested to roddy that hed killed lord lucans nanny hed have gone for that too he said i was dangerously naive he said that in my craving for fame and glory i was probably only slightly less manic than lodge himself he said the combustible combination of lodge and me had created something it was gonna take west mercia a long time to live down he said finally he said that if he didnt see me again for the rest of his career hed consider himself a very fortunate man his hands fell away from his head and he slumped in his chair his lips compressed into the kind of smile you put on to ward off weeping he didnt need a catholic priest this was his confession merrily wondered if hed told any of it to his wife she feared not which i thought spelled it out very nicely he said after a while pastures new frannie and dont expect a reference she didnt even like to ask what fleming was saying about the incineration allegedly by lodge of nevin parry bliss stood up and walked across to the window another option of course is for me to quit the service altogether frannie this is just one man he might move on himself doesnt matter marked me card now no ill do exactly as advised take two weeks off use them as best i can he turned away from the window and came up to where she was sitting she could smell dried sweat on him she could smell anxiety and frustration a toxic mix im telling you he did it merrily he did melanie pullman and he did rochelle bowen and maybe some more i could see it in his eyes i could feel it in me chest somewhere there are bodies oh it was what shed been afraid of if the maverick loner cop was history the suspended cop determined to clear his name was movie history anyway frannies situation was in a way worse than suspension his conduct would not be investigated the investigation would simply continue without him an investigation that was no more now than a tyingup of loose ends nobody was in danger the beast was dead and perhaps he hadnt been that much of a beast after all im gonna find them merrily what commandeer gomer and lol again id pay them frannie youre bonkers you dont even have anything to go on do you you wouldnt know where to start well i would actually bliss said if for instance we talk about the piccies on the walls part of his fantasy despite all this chatting up in pubs making a fool of himself when he was in his manic phases he was actually afraid of real live women he only felt truly safe with dead ones aw youre just im just saying what the shrinks going to say i dont recall you had much to say about lodge throwing his weight around in the police station subdued uncommunicative sick didnt want to leave his cell hunched up into himself i think thats what your phrase was at the time the word depressive somehow springs to mind all right then bliss sat down again lets go back put yourself back in that bedroom for a minute look at the bed with the nasty black sheets sniff the air now look at the pictures in halflight from the lowwattage bulbs so that theyre not like pictures any more theyre actual shadowy women right there in the room with you flickering about moving in the dark and you know theyre all dead but he didnt kill them tell me you couldnt feel the evil in there merrily tell me you couldnt feel it as a priest i dont i dont know what i felt i know what i felt it still doesnt make too much sense frannie you dont have any kind of scenario for roddy lodge as a mass murderer you dont even know why and in what circumstances he killed lynsey davies do you what happens if you dont find anything to support the theory you dont yet have what happens if you go blundering about and you dont find anything at all merrily i seriously think you should follow kirstys suggestion and go on holiday somewhere quiet and uncomplicated with good food nice views and room service and spend a lot of time talking to one another shes throwing you a lifeline if you could only see it at the end of the week if you play your cards right who knows how the situation mightve changed i mean id be the first to miss your famous scowl around the place if you went back to merseyside but merrily i do have a scenario what lol tell you about the attaché case the one gomer dug up just behind roddys bungalow before he went up the pylon like a monkey possibly i stay there bliss stood up dont go away bliss didnt have the actual case any more the case had gone to the lab it had been so lightweight that theyd thought at first it was empty he said he didnt have the stained and crumpled newspaper cuttings that had subsequently been found inside either but he did have photocopies and if shed give him a minute hed fetch them from his car on the square this just doesnt go away she thought why doesnt it go away when he returned she saw that the old briskness was back his caffeine eyes burning through the fatigue whatever this is should you be showing it to me merrily i shouldnt evenve taken the copies away who gives a shit he dropped the a buff envelope on the kitchen table and slid out a stack of papers he spread them merrily recoiled headlines snarling headlines pleading headlines shouting outrage black on white hard and contrasty and unremittingly ugly in the depths of evil the predators they grew into monsters a lethal lust i dont understand even though they were only copies of copies of old newspapers she didnt like to touch them a low cloud of blackflecked smog was almost visible above the heap bliss fiddled about in the papers and brought out one with a font that looked among the rest almost comfortingly familiar the hereford times inquest on remains found in fingerpost field much marcle its funny how many people mentioned it when we were in underhowle bliss said we never thought its only about eight miles away marcle as the crow flies nothing really is it sorry i dont much marcle frannie merrily froze up the table was whited out by ghastly flashphoto images bodies under concrete in a cellar in gloucester police digging up red herefordshire fields a series of young women raped tortured and butchered over a period of twenty years gloucester council had demolished the house and talked of eradicating the name of cromwell street but both gloucester and the village of much marcle in herefordshire would retain the memory of this man and his vicious wife for ever an evil you couldnt see through because there was nothing on the other side but the night on the sofa in roddys bar how many twelve officially including his first wife and two daughters but probably more oh yeh bliss said could be a lot more the estimates range from twenty to sixty the little bastard kept careful count im sure of that even if he could never remember their names very efficient in his way this is what people dont realize most serial killers they relish the reputation the drama of it the fancy names the papers give them the night stalker all this shite they enjoy that sense of ritual with him that was no big deal at all he just had an extremely skewed sense of right and wrong he didnt relish being evil because he couldnt see himself as evil it wasnt a concept he understood this is a man with a big part of him missing and the space filled up with something black yes merrily was finding all this sickening didnt see the point wished they were still into marriage guidance bliss had hung his jacket over a chair back now he was unfolding one of the cuttings flattening it out this is the important one not the article the photo the picture under the headline though embellished with the smuts and smudges of hasty copying had a feeling of formality a flash photograph carefully posed of the two of them merrily was sure she must have seen it before even if you didnt know who he was and what hed done what theyd both done you would automatically have given him an identity maybe the onetime randy paper boy grinning over his handlebars grown now into the backstreet grease monkey who would guarantee to get your banger through its mot for twenty in hand or seeing its you my love a tenner and a kiss frederick west in suit and shirt and tie was leaning over the back of a sofa that had floral cushions behind him was a photomural of mountains and fir trees freds hands were resting around the shoulders of the woman sitting on the sofa plump mumsie rosemary his wife fred looked like hed rather be doing something else to her rose looked happy about that two big smiles for the camera four eyes alight with twisted love and shared memories of dead girls oh it was an eyeopener for all of us no denying that bliss said it shocked us out of our provincial complacency merrily it actually shocked coppers look i she pushed the paper away west wore a grin that could sear your dreams maybe i shouldve read more about it at the time but i couldnt face it when was it ninetyfive i wasnt here then and i still had some other problems personal i had nothing to do with him meself bliss admitted id not been down here long still a dc when they were digging at marcle it was a couple of years later when i was in a pub with a sergeant from gloucester who once escorted west to a remand hearing and this guy he said that the worst thing of all the very worst thing was that you could actually get on well with him one of the lads good for a laugh of course youd hire him to install your new bathroom why not and leave him alone with your wife while you were at work bliss inhaled through clamped teeth its easy to go through all the pictures now and say yeh you can tell straight off hes an evil bastard but if you didnt know i mean look at him an imp a troll wheres the serious harm in him merrily chose not to look for the moment it hadnt even registered at the time that he was a herefordshire man he was always the gloucester massmurderer because that was where he lived operating as a selfemployed builder out of a tall terraced house in cromwell street the house where fred had promoted rose as a willing prostitute watching her doing it with other men especially black men where the wests had rented out rooms to young people who didnt take too much luring into sex and where the police had found most of the bodies of women and girls buried in the garden or concreted into the cellar frederick west who lived for sex and then killing became part of it fred west the lust murderer and rose his alltoocomplicit wife but the killing had started long before fred and rose moved to cromwell street it had started when he was a herefordshire country boy born and bred less than thirty miles from ledwardine and only a tenminute drive from underhowle this was where the police had gone next after cromwell street discovering that the roots of the evil lay deep in hereford red soil something bliss now kept emphasizing i remember when the lads came back from marcle after they found the first body in the fingerpost field probably his first victim ann mcfall tied up and strangled stabbed butchered here his fingertips pressing into the pine top of the kitchen table a feller who grew up among farms worked for a slaughterhouse in the country where where everybody killed yeah you keep saying that and buried the bodies to west it was no different from disposing of a dead ewe he cut them up for more efficient burial efficiency that was the only ritual for fred an efficient workman an efficient workman always makes good afterwards is it really such a big step i mean if you can kill and butcher an animal youve got over the queasy part havent you only the morality of it left to deal with and he didnt have any of that anyway frannie can we just get to the point merrily felt jittery like a child who couldnt swim standing on the edge of a frozen pond and watching a friend skating enthusiastically towards the centre hes dead he hanged himself in winson green prison while awaiting trial and his wifes serving life for her part in the murders she pulled her cigarettes towards her and jane will be coming down for tea very soon and when she does i really would like not to be discussing this stuff get to the point you know the point these selected articles were in an attaché case buried in what would have been roddy lodges back garden if hed been of a horticultural bent and are they fleming the socos entirely sure that lodge was the one who buried them bliss sniffed i dont know what they think theyre not telling me things any more but im sure and im asking meself why why did he bury them why didnt he just burn them if he wanted to get rid of them was that all there was in the case the cuttings no this is it this is the point there was one other thing one photo which to my great sorrow i didnt have time to copy of so i cant show yer it but youve already seen it in a way its a happy snap of roddy and lynsey in roddys bar you remember roddys bar in his bungalow neon sign optics tall stools leather suite copies of loaded the same what this photo shows is lynsey on the sofa in a nice red dress and roddy in his suit and tie leaning over her from behind like hes dying to start pawing got his back to the bullfight poster smiling for the camera geddit identical pose to the famous shot of fred and rose i may be starting to feel sick merrily said well hold on to it a bit longer frannie bliss went over to his jacket and dug an envelope from an inside pocket now then ive gorra cutting of me own here andy mumford put me on to this good memory andy bliss laid the paper in front of merrily it was from the daily telegraph dated december life for killer who copied the wests frannie no read it first it was the report of the trial at cardiff crown court of a man from south wales known as black dai because of his preference for black clothing in he was thirtytwo a car thief whod never had a proper job he was obsessed with fred and rose west oh god bliss said nothing he sat down again the phone rang in the scullery merrily let the machine take it she read that the prosecution had told the court how black dai had suggested to his girlfriend that just like the wests they could travel the country pick up girls have sex with them and torture them no merrily took out a cigarette then pushed it back into the packet the girlfriend had thought it was just fantasy on his part until black dai abducted a young woman from a pub disco in maesteg glamorgan and subsequently drove her sixty miles to herefordshire where he beat her to death with a wheel brace and dumped her body in woodland at a place called witches fell at symonds yat symonds yat just a few miles outside rossonwye five miles from underhowle black dai got put away for life and i keep thinking what a great pity it was frannie bliss said that we were prevented by a green young lawyer from letting you and roddy have your little chat and what do you think hed have told me that he didnt tell the entire population of underhowle if hed opened up to you we might not evenve needed to take him out to underhowle merrily im thinking of when gloucester pulled west in and he was leading them a bit of a dance until a woman social worker was brought in to look after his welfare while on remand seems she looked a bit like ann mcfall the first victim his first love the words love and victim tended to be synonymous in freds world and pretty soon he was telling her everything out it came possibly the full body count no more ever found but still merrily jerked upright thats why you set me up for it no honestly swear to god i had no idea then never even thought about west and no dont worry you dont look remotely like lynsey she was twice as big as you for a start she had a flashback then to her one contact with lynsey davies the nauseous blast of human decay from under a tarpaulin a stench like a howl of pain and outrage she pulled out the cigarette again lynsey however bliss said did look more than a bit like rose bit bigger maybe taller but buxom merrily lit the cigarette youre saying that roddy saw her as his rosefigure that he saw the two of them as cant say theres no solid precedent for it can you yes but when you look at all the women fred west killed and the one he didnt kill thats because rose was what she was his soulmate if he had a soul and also found guilty of ten murders bliss pointed out and now in prison with a recommendation from the judge that she should never be released talk about starcrossed lovers when you start to ask yourself what the chances are of two people that depraved finding each other within a small area of rural england yes the aura of an almost alien abnormality lit the image of fred and rose two people whod formed into something that lived for physical gratification in its most twisted and degraded forms mixing other lives at random into the bubbling sexual soup lynsey mightve put it about over the years bliss said and she might notve been on the shortlist for the mothercare trophy but my guess is that when she posed for that picture she wasnt aware of the true significance so when she did become aware that she was posing as rosemary west well how would you react youre saying he killed her because she found out and was threatening to shop him probably we dont know we probably never will know who took the picture automatic exposure i should think there were two slr cameras around the place and a camcorder in the car lodge liked gadgets just like fred did on the other hand roddy was different from fred he boasted more fred was talkative but roddy was loud yeh its possible he got somebody else to take the picture flaunting it a bit frannie why did he go up that pylon there was nowhere else to go wed got men on all the possible exits he knew that maybe he stupidly thought we wouldnt spot him up there in his orange overalls and he could wait till wed gone hed been up the pylon before i reckon somebodyd cut away the barbed wire they bind around the legs maybe he used to go up them as a kid like kids do for a dare you dont think he intended to die no i dont i think he saw himself as invulnerable merrily look what i wanted to ask you why do you think he buried all these west cuttings together with the picture of him and lynsey as fred and rose if he was suddenly worried about them being found why didnt he just set fire to the lot he was good at fire if we accept gomers viewpoint well he didnt get rid of the pictures of women in the bedroom did he what do superintendent fleming and his pet psychiatrist think we didnt exactly get around to discussing it merrily shook her head slowly i dont know frannie i mean youve established that he did have some kind of west fantasy although how far he took it none of us can say for certain as you say if he wanted to put all that behind him burning would be a quicker and safer option sealing the picture together with the news cuttings in the case making it absolutely clear by the context what that picture was meant to convey seems more of a an affirmation i suppose she found herself thinking of gomer who when minnie had died had buried both their watches with new batteries in her grave go on bliss said like its a way of binding them all together fred and rose and lynsey and roddy binding together how sealed up together underground i dont know you see he took us back there leading us to think we were gonna find bodies and there are no bodies buried there only this little case which gomer found in the end making roddy bloody furious and it was shortly after that that he did a runner perhaps that case was more important to him than bodies he took us back to uncover something and then when we got there he changed his mind whats that tell us tells us he wasnt thinking straight frannie look i merrily didnt see how she could help bliss any more from where he was sitting his future in the police service depended on proving that hed been right from the beginning about roddy lodge it depended on finding bodies bliss stood up put on his jacket well thanks merrily youre a pal i havent done anything she followed him out into the hall where the jaded jesus stood with his lantern at the door frannie bliss turned fred and roddy two selfemployed contractors who pride themselves on being methodical efficient in what they do under the light with those freckles he looked like a schoolboy and schoolboys would do anything somewhere merrily there are bodies merrily shut the front door went back into the kitchen reached automatically for another cigarette then tossed the packet down and went into the scullery office where the light was flashing on the answering machine she pressed play oh merrily im so sorry to bother you on a sunday but could you ring me at home its twenty past five thank you sophie she rang back something ive forgotten or something i dont yet know about you sound gloomy merrily just trying to untangle some things soph sorry there was a short silence and then sophie said merrily ive been meaning to ask why dont you and laurence robinson come for supper one night oh she knew of course nothing had ever been said but sophie had known maybe even before merrily had known thats very kind of you i dont mean tonight or even this week but sometime this was sophie reaffirming that it was ok she was not a priest as the bishops secretary she didnt need to be but sophie lived for the cathedral and if you knew it was ok with sophie there seemed no immediately obvious reason why it shouldnt be ok in the sight of god thank you merrily said was that what you wanted oh no that would have waited until we met this is rather more complicated i understand youve been peripherally involved in the police investigation at underhowle of which weve all been reading who told you about that shed never thought to inform the bishop perhaps she ought to have you spoke i think on the phone to the reverend jerome banks who in turn spoke to the bishop in connection with the late mr lodge it wasnt an official approach he isnt complaining merrily according to the bishop he seemed not ungrateful for your interest from what i understand mr lodge dead is considered no less of a problem in the parish than was mr lodge alive mr lodge wasnt considered a problem alive nobody knew about his hobby well they do now and its put the reverend banks into what he perceives as a rather difficult situation merrily we do realize your involvement here had no connection with the church and that it isnt your parish obviously but the reverend banks did have a suggestion to make which the bishop has asked me to put to you and thats what im doing there was a movement at the door jane stood there wiggling her fingers in a resigned hello again kind of way merrily smiled and did it back in relation to mr lodge sophie said i have to ask you how you would feel about burying him the plague cross the skyline had broken into a lushness of wooded hills and an elegant tiered town the river wye fronting it like a moat in the late afternoon a low unexpected sun was burning across the dual carriageway gilding the town and its tall steeple moira looked enchanted lol thought as though the pattern had been laid out especially for her the suns last curtain call timed for this moment she wound down her side window has quite a soft air actually that would be the sandstone walls id guess lols geriatric astra rattled down the side of a traffic island and then crossed a long bridge that became more like a causeway with green parkland beside the river bank on the left sandstone cliffs hanging over them on the right there were no suburbs this end you entered the town almost at its centre expecting a fortified gateway instead there was a single medievalstyle round tower set into the red walls victorian gothic but it fitted moira nodded approval somebody got this place right lol glanced at her often she talked like she was reacting to a sixth sense she no longer questioned moira had something of the threshold about her according to gomer parry the way the council had ballsed things up only disabled taxidrivers could be guaranteed to get parked on the street in ross but this was sunday and lol found a space close to the top of the hill before the first shops he locked the car moira was waiting for him leaning on a wall peering down towards the twisting river pulling a black woollen wrap around her shoulders it was that time just before the street lights came on when the autumn air was thickening and the church no more than a couple of streets away seemed less solid than it had from across the river the steeple a sepia spectre wheres he gonnae be this guy lol almost said where do you want him to be this woman seemed to persuade things to happen when hed rung the village hall at underhowle to leave a message for sam hall sam himself had answered the phone as though hed been waiting around for lols call sure lets do this right now but lets not do it here lets meet in town hour and a half say he said hed find us in the churchyard lol looked towards the steeple along a narrow uphill street where everything was sundaysilent there was no wind and the dusk was forming like coppery smoke around them and moira said so youre definitely up for the gig right they walked up some steps to the churchyard their footsteps echoing from the buildings of brick and stone on either side so the offers still er open yeah moira who persuaded things to happen took his arm hugging it to her what a difference a death makes eh something like a pebble landed in lols gut directly under your feet sam hall said are hundreds of dead people buried in their clothes no shrouds no coffins sam had found them at the edge of the prospect a plateau behind the church with a view of the river and beyond it twentyfive miles of darkening countryside rising to the slopes of the black mountains on the welsh border hed explained that there used to be a bishops palace up here a second home for the bishops of hereford who for centuries had been the biggest landowners hereabouts now the prospect was mainly public space a high garden sloping down to the sandstone walls and the royal hotel moira had looked around tossing an end of her wrap over a shoulder no sign of power lines oh theyre around sam had said come with me id like to show you something turning away abruptly and setting off back along the path with a seasoned walkers easy gait a small knapsack hanging from his shoulder like just another crease in his plaid jacket they went back into the churchyard under mature trees still heavy with dark foliage where a straight path led from the church itself down towards the centre of the town near the end of the path opposite a shadowy street of houses and offices was this stone cross on a hexagonal plinth with steps now sam hall had a foot on the lowest one this is the plague cross in the great plague took out more than three hundred people putting ross into quarantine all the trading with the outside world was done down by the bridge and they washed the money in the river even the church services here were suspended and the dead lol glanced at moira who was standing very still the white streak in her black hair gleaming in the last of the light as she watched sam climb to the third step and put a hand up to the stem of the cross the dead were buried in pits right here sam said at night buried according to a local account in their wearing apparel the bodies were brought up here on carts and dumped while the minister stood here right where im standing now and gave the last blessings by torchlight can you imagine that moira said nothing lol thought she probably could in full colour with agonized suppurating faces and the stench of disease suddenly in the stillness he saw it all too was aware of people in a state of exhaustion beyond despair beyond pity beyond both fear of death and expectation of life the images were so dense and complete that it felt as though moira was sending them to him this is the same great plague that swept through london he asked only it came to ross first prosperouslooking place even then but the streets were thick with filth and packs of rats most of the rich folk left town but the minister stayed to bless the sick and the dying sam turned to moira youd have heard of this man maybe me name was the reverend price at the height of the plague the darkest hour he had all the townsfolk that could make it to their feet join him in a procession all walking with this desperate dignity through the town streets at five am chanting a litany a solemn appeal to the lord for deliverance a light came on in one of the houses across the street making it seem darker in the churchyard and his faith was rewarded when the sun rose that day it was said the plague went on the run sam hall stepped down from the cross and youre wondering why im showing you this right well see a plague is how i think of it the great plague of the twentyfirst century i have an engraving of this cross as the motif on my notepaper this new plague is about power lines lol said the power towers are the enemy we can see sam stared up into the sepia sky if we could see all the tv and satellite signals all the radio waves serving mobile phones police communications cab fleets air networks the sky would be this kind of poisonous black the whole day long if we could smell them like exhaust fumes wed all choke to death but its a whole lot more subtle than that they zip unseen and unfelt through our atmosphere and through our bodies and our brains they are the insidious wind that blows right through us all through flesh and tissue through bones it sounded like a speech hed made before sam was back on the path youll notice i came down off of the cross before i said all that im no preacher just a guy who seethes inside whenever he sees some twelveyearold kid in the street calling up her pal on a piece of pink plastic that burns brains which is always gonnae be denied moira murmured oh sure the bigger the investment the stronger the denial like the electricity industry denied the report that came out of bristol university a couple years ago linking overhead power lines to leukaemia skin cancer lung cancer you name it a plague on all humanity huh sure and were all of us guilty to some extent even me i won permission for a windmill to generate clean power for my place up on howle hill i dont have a phone let alone a mobile but if i want to get on the web ill still go down the hall use one of codys community computers act of plain hypocrisy with the guy hellbent on turning underhowle into the hot spot to end all hot spots hot spots lol said hot spot is the term for a dangerous configuration of transmitters pylons whathaveyou which renders an area lets say difficult to reside in codys computer plant came to the area on account of a development grant and a derelict site going for peanuts and now they want to but you know all this im a stranger moira said i dont know any of it sam hall looked hard at her in the dimness moira folded her arms in her wrap we have a complex situation sam said the small industries which once built up underhowle into a community with three four pubs a bunch of shops and its own school went to the wall long ago by the midnineties the shops had all gone out of business the school was threatened with closure and the village wasnt pretty enough to attract the cottagehunters from london specially with these damn pylons like watchtowers around belsen and auschwitz it was almost night now and growing cold somewhere at the back of his mind lol could hear prof levin saying the one thing you of all people do not need at this stage is to get in with crazies biggest disease in underhowle when i came back from the states was apathy sam hall said i didnt mind i just wanted a place i could afford and where id be left alone to be a crank and a painintheass idealist sustain my fantasy that we could live without the goddam mains services run by fat cats whod watch us die one by one to stave off wastingdisease of the wallet lol wondered if sam saw himself as the new reverend price whod chosen to live and fight in the plague hot spot at first i was as pleased as anyone sam said when like the recipient of a touch of magic underhowle began to undergo a small revival two things happened almost simultaneously he told them two new elements of growth that fed one another two men with compatible dreams fergus young a teacher with real vision took over a dying primary school down to fourteen pupils and chris cody this computer whizz brought in enough employees with young families to fill it up again i like fergus hes evangelical like me gave up a lot for that school even his marriage in the end hell i even like chris fergus knows how to inspire kids he was getting incredible results very quickly but i guess it was the computer input that revolutionized everything they provided computers for the school lol recalled the efflapure owner mike sandford telling him about the childrens computers they were manufacturing for fouryearolds threeyearolds two younger they donated computers sam hall said not only to the school but to every household in the catchment area with a small kid time the kid reaches school its computerliterate with all the educational benefits that brings plus most of them could read and write by age five or earlier so between them at this rundown school in a rundown village fergus and chris have already created a generation of very smart kids lol recalled mike sandford again might look rundown but this place is the future this been publicized moira wondered in all the right journals result codys kiddie computers are starting to sell internationally so yet more jobs parents squeezing themselves into the catchment area to get their kids into ferguss school property prices rising place still isnt pretty but its changing fast two shops reopened in the past year one by cody as a retail software outlet but the other sells food and we have a hairdresser we have the refurbishment of the village hall as a sophisticated community centre and you know so far so good we were all getting along together fine on the underhowle development committee till we fell out sam said that although hed been less enthused than some by the idea of underhowle becoming a blueprint for rural regrowth hed kept quiet about the aspects that worried him until the demands for better communications began bringing results until the growing complaints about the poor mobile phone signals in the valley and the bad quality of tv reception began to have enough relevance for the fat cats who ran the networks to act on them when the development committee had voted to express its approval of a plan for a new and powerful mobilephone transmitter on the side of howle hill along with a tv booster less than half a mile away sam had quit the committee in an atmosphere of serious acrimony now the booster was up and shooting signals at underhowle the new phone mast only awaiting the green light from the council and no groundswell of opposition to get in the way only sam the crank the fruitcake i expected support from the newcomers but hell with the village taking off the way it is theyre scared to be seen as blocking progress in most cases their jobs depend on it but its with the number of goddam power lines we already got intersecting here its my absolutely unswerving belief were in for one hell of a hot spot health problems and mental health problems on a scale you cant imagine signs are there i can give you a long list of people who died prematurely people living too close to volts when that damn mast goes up its gonna be electric soup but i got no proof and no backup lol was thinking sam was going to need more than a rally and protest song to raise any he didnt know what to say sam said sure i have friends outside links with green organizations but green activists they tend to be gentle people they dont have maybe the blind rage needed to tackle what is one enormous ecological problem and i would venture to suggest reverend a spiritual one moira said huh i can explain this aspect if youll give me some time if we can meet this week perhaps i can explain it in detail but essentially our local minister reverend banks is a man with and as someone whos at least half a christian i make no apology for this a man with a small closed mind who refuses to absorb or even to consider mr hall i wouldnae doubt that he is but if i could i realize your positions bound to be sensitive where another clergypersons concerned but there are some things i need to get aligned in my own mind and i could use some advice from someone such as yourself he stood at the foot of the plague cross shoulders slumped sagging a little looking more like his age he unshouldered his knapsack as if it had suddenly become too much of a burden and laid it on the bottom step sam lol said gently i think lol drove around the island and back onto the a from which the town of ross glittered in the early night like a birthday cake across three lanes of traffic and the river he drew a fold of paper from his jacket pocket gave me this just as we were walking back into town i guess its the poem the song he took it out of his bag almost like an afterthought just before we went our separate ways he handed the paper across to moira sorry the interior light doesnt work but theres a torch in the glove compartment i suppose i ought to feel flattered moira said this could be the first time in ma whole life i was ever mistaken for a good and devout person there was only one way this misunderstanding could have come about sam had talked to frannie bliss and bliss had disclosed lols close friendship with the diocesan exorcist for hereford lol had introduced moira to sam only by her first name moira merrily it was an honest mistake i dont think hes crazy lol said but he certainly seems less stable than he did the other night or maybe its me whos more stable than i was then well he heard the snap of the torch switch i dont think hes crazy either but he sure is no poet not good its like he just scribbled it down off the top of his head before he came out maybe he did aye in the darkness of the car lol was aware of moiras scent it made him think of deserted sand dunes in the hebrides or maybe that wasnt the scent at all her voice came back low he doesnae want you at all laurence or your talents it was a wee ploy and not a very convincing one he wants your friend he wants an exorcist its why he asked you to bring your lady yes if youd been alone i guess hedve sounded you out about an introduction when he thought i was her he went for it an ecological problem but also a spiritual one but when he found out i wasnae exactly ordained the spiritual part stayed under his woolly hat i guess hell find your wee reverend some other way lol said what if hes a little crazy ach laurence were all of us a little crazy and the plague cross well theres a sickness there all right moira said still she was quiet for a moment hes scared of something and hes no sure exactly what lol was puzzled he is sure isnt he he knows what he can see the pylons and the tv masts and those sinister mobilephone masts with the bits sticking out but he cannae see electricity and he cannae see evil lol said after a while is this a warning oh laurence moira said if it was all as simple and direct as like dont get on any planes on the th what do i say to you here im standing by the plague cross and this guys talking about people buried without coffins and then i start thinking about you and your friend digging for dead people and i get this rather loathsome curling sensation down in ma gut which i believe i managed to conceal rather well i dont know what that means do i what should i say to merrily she let him drive in silence for a while aye well she said thats a difficult one that night lol called merrily on the mobile from his loft mmm she said i met sam hall when i was in underhowle with frannie bliss he didnt go out of his way to speak to me then on the other hand bliss had introduced me as a dc which nobody seemed to question at the time maybe assuming there must have been a change in the height regulations lol said ho ho so am i supposed to go and see him why would you need to i was just warning you he might try and get in touch so youd know what it was about vaguely if he did and if i could just merrily said only ive been asked to bury roddy lodge you see bury him not dig the hole conduct the funeral why its a christian tradition but if you mean why me its because a large number of people in underhowle are saying we dont want this murderer in our churchyard and the local ministers got cold feet from sitting on the fence and im like your mr hall an established fruitcake lol said do you have to do it i dont have to a pause whats wrong nothing lol imagined her at her desk shoes off toes curled under the electric fire he felt that whatever she was getting into she should not be left in there alone black sheep kind of thing hed come down from the hill on his quad bike as soon as his wife had reached him on the mobile i cant discuss this shed said miserably when she saw the dog collar youll have to speak to mr lodge and went on talking about the rain and how much of it there was these days until he was pulling off his wellies at the kitchen door out of the plain square kitchen windows all merrily could see was damp fog greenish like mucus mr lodge this defined him now his father was dead and he was the eldest brother this was his farmhouse brownwashed and hunched into the foggy hillside and this was his name mr lodge the last one in the valley they looked at one another by the frosted fluorescent tube on the kitchen ceiling merrily saw a fawnhaired man in a working farmers green nylon overalls edging quietly towards sixty lean and wary as a dog fox he saw something that evidently worried him he coughed im sorry i er i didnt expect youd be a woman well now wouldnt she be running a wealthier parish if she had a pound for every time someone had said that ill make some tea mrs lodge mumbled yes he nodded at merrily well thank you thank you for coming he indicated a wooden chair with arms and a car cushion on it near the rayburn you have that one in the warm thank you she took off janes duffel coat and hung it around the back of the chair she was wearing the black jumper andskirt outfit and her fleecelined boots he looked away tony lodge he said reluctantly merrily watkins im afraid i only heard about this last night from the bishop ah he sat himself on a hard chair at the edge of the gatelegged table leaving about seven feet of flagged floor between them he sat with his cap on his knees so you ent spoken to mr banks not about this no ill probably be seeing him later if youre lucky she smiled easing her chair to one side so that mrs lodge could put the kettle on the rayburn which mrs lodge accomplished without looking at her not er not that im a churchgoing man any more tony lodge said my parents were chapel and i was raised to that when the chapel went out of use my father he started going to the church instead because at least the church was still here even if the services were few and far between he wouldnt go to ross to worship and he wouldnt go to ross to be buried and thats what this is about merrily said i gather theres a longstanding agreement with the church on burials never been any other way look they reckon the chapel here was near as old as the church and theres only one graveyard in underhowle thats up at the church where the lands better drained more suitable for burial and thats where we goes the lodges he paused thats where my brothers to go friday we thought if thats all right for you funeral directors lomas of coleford your father would not be happy if the sons were not around him and my mother you understand that of course erm mr lodge raised bony brown hands in a wardingoff gesture no he said calmly i dont want to talk about what hes done my duty to my father as eldest son is to see my brother buried at underhowle not cremated i would like there to be a proper service if mr banks wants to throw in his hand with the newcomers thats his business merrily didnt say anything she might have known it would be something like this there was a deputation here last night mr lodge said how much you know about that i ent sure deputation all sophie had told her was that the rev banks had said the lodges were not members of his congregation whereas the family of the missing melanie pullman was and therefore he would prefer it if an outside minister could handle roddys funeral it wasnt an unusual procedure in cases like this local people tony lodge said and some not so local wanting me to have my brother cremated said it would be better for his ashes just to be scattered in the churchyard that a grave would become a tourist attraction not the sort they wanted for underhowle the new underhowle bitterness tainting his tone now not the image they wanted for the new underhowle i see i doubt you do mr lodge almost smiled i doubt you do reverend but i dont suppose that matters i have met some of the people in the village mr young the headmaster and ingrid sollars mrs sollars yes i was surprised she was part of it but there you are they all have their own concerns things arent simple like they used to be in the old days you accepted responsibility for your village in good times and bad and the people there good and bad you kept together now its all about what you looks like to outsiders true i suppose she was mainly worried about how shed justify this to gomer leading prayers for the everlasting soul of the man he believed had murdered his nephew incinerated his depot and his machinery taken a pickaxe to the foundations of his life shed tried to reach him last night no answer youll be wanting some personal information about my brother tony lodge said ive written out a list date of birth where he went to school that sort of detail well actually what what merrily wanted most was a cigarette what i normally do is have a chat with the relatives of the person whos died so that at the service i can talk about them as people we dont bury bodies we bury people if you see what i mean she wondered if he did there were few signs in this drab functional farmhouse of real sorrow only of resignation perhaps an attitude branded into farmers by bse and footand mouth and endless forms from the ministry of agriculture now called defra which jane said stood for destroying every farmreared animal look mr lodge was facing her although she could tell his eyes werent focused on hers as much as on the space between them i dont want no fuss i dont want things said about him that werent true just for appearances i dont really want anything said about him at all just like it done quickly and with dignity isnt as if theres going to be much of an audience anyway merrily sighed im afraid you might find theres rather more of one than you think therell almost certainly be police and reporters possibly even television i wouldnt like to say he stood up he said without raising his voice he was cursed from the first that boy the kettle came to the boil behind merrily and began to shriek as if demanding she should leave she stood up too look if you want to have a think about it ill leave you my number or i can ring you well also have to discuss the choice of hymns that kind of oh and one other thing roddy roddys body where do you i dont know all the details yet of how they release him theres already been a postmortem they reckons the inquest is being held tomorrow well opened merrily said all theyll have is a short hearing at which the coroner will take formal evidence of identification which means that the body can be released for burial and then its adjourned usually for several weeks so the worst is to come how could she deny that mrs lodge almost brushed past her to reach the kettle on the rayburn close up merrily registered that she was quite a few years younger than her husband although the age gap was fogged by colourless wispy hair and an absence of makeup somewhere along the line shed lost the need or the will to be noticed merrily pulled her coat from the back of the chair they both knew that she wouldnt be staying for tea meanwhile if theres you know anything at all i can do you will conduct the service then of course if thats what you want ill talk to mr banks see whens best for everyone he nodded once and beyond that he said i wouldnt do anything if i were you lets get him in the ground and theres an end to it a bleak statement in bleak surroundings on a bleak day she wondered if in the end he hadnt been jealous of his manic young brother travelling the countryside and apparently making a lot of money while he the inheritor of the farm stayed and rotted in it was that how it was on the way here shed felt she ought to explain the circumstances of her own brief meeting with roddy lodge now she didnt think it would change anything would probably not help at all at the door she said what i meant was if theres anything i could do to help the two of you cope with this oh well survive he smiled crookedly in this job most of us gave up looking to god for any help a long time ago if its the same god that helps the continentals to reject our beef wheres the point not the time either for theological debate merrily saw that mrs lodge was standing over the belfast sink staring into it unmoving i erm i have to call and see mr hall sam hall i was told his house is somewhere near here aye carry on up the track and youll see his windmill its a bit mucky up there but youll get through friend of yours mr hall ive not really met him as such nice enough man said mr lodge used to be local then he emigrated to america and come back a bit cranky oh takes my dogs for a run loves dogs he says but he wont have one himself cause he reckons theres too many dogs around for no particular reason that kind of cranky ah right look i feeling if anything more hopelessly inadequate than was usual on these occasions i just want to say im very very sorry for whats happened thank you but you dont know whats happened do you tony lodge presented her with his summary of roddys life scribbled in felt pen on half a sheet of lined notepaper none of us do and likely thats best for everyone spectral in the fog the windmill rose like a huge petrified sunflower out of a clearing on a small escarpment a plateau on the edge of the hill it looked alien and probably always would merrily thought the house was about thirty yards away behind a wall around four feet high and the winter remains of vegetable patches pulling on woollen gloves she left the volvo at the top of the track before it narrowed into a footpath and curved past the house towards what she guessed would be the summit of the hill could only guess because it was smothered by the fog whitish here like a blank stage backcloth despite the murk she could see no lights in the house but then from what lol had said this place would never be well lit it was a brickbuilt bungalow square and compact with small windows dense as gomers glasses and a solar panel like a blister in the roof there was no smoke from the chimney the wooden front gate was unlocked and merrily went through along a path between veg beds to the front door inside its wooden porch she couldnt see a bell or a knocker and ending up banging on the panels with a gloved fist no answer she went back outside electricity and radiation lol had listed pylons power lines tv and mobilephone transmitters the twentyfirstcentury plague hot spots and the death road and something else it was clear he wasnt going to tell me or moira me or moira moira and me why did this nag they were all supposed to be adults but it had got into her dreams last night in the last dream shed suddenly realized with the dramatic intensity that only dreams could bestow that lol robinson was in the music business where everybody slept with everybody else awakening anxious and cold again of course she knew he wasnt like that quite the opposite in some ways after what had happened to him all those years ago but he was insecure about his abilities and perhaps this mature experienced moira cairns was giving him the reassurance that only another musician could oh god the fog swirled around her like hostile floss merrily heard footsteps on the track then a slurring in the mud the sounds somewhere inside the white fog she stayed inside the garden wall hands cold inside her coat pockets and the gloves the engine was running to support the heater doing its best but this was an old car and the heater took a while to get going the car warming up very gradually like an old man rubbing his hands and massaging his joints the volvo was backed onto the grass beside the footpath out of sight if not earshot of sam halls ecohouse on the passenger side mrs lodge was bulked out by a us army parka far too big for her shed started talking outside on the track her voice high and querulous and revealing the remains of a south wales accent hes not heartless shed cried i didnt want you to leave thinking hes heartless merrily said mrs lodge this is one of the hardest situations anyone has to go through when its not of your making but youre dragged into it and you dont know where your loyalties are supposed to lie cherry mrs lodge said my names cherry like the fruit not mrs blair the run up the track had reddened her cheeks as if to underline the point she told merrily shed known sam hall wasnt at home had seen him walk past towards the village over an hour ago and when her husband had climbed back on his quad bike and gone back to finish his fencing in the top field shed grabbed her chance to say what she couldnt say in front of him not that were not close she stared through the windscreen into the fog not that we havent been close i should say the bad things that happen on a farm even the money problems are things you can discuss this she sniffed and dragged out a clutch of tissues to wipe her nose this is beyond everything merrily said do you mind if i smoke if i were to open the window an inch or two of course cherry almost smiled seeming grateful for this sign of human weakness merrily lit a silk cut hes changed of course cherry said he doesnt think hes turning into his father because the old man was always so religious but he is she put away the tissue and turned in her seat to face merrily still there are worse things lord knows what roddy was turning into all in all i cant help thinking god help us that its as well it ended the way it did if we could say it had ended if were ever going to be able to say that were you there no neither of us was there i remember i went out to fill the coal scuttle about teatime and i thought i could hear something from down the hill but i thought it was just kids it was about ten oclock before the police even came and told us he was dead we didnt know what to do nobody else came we didnt know everybody had seen him electrocuted we just tony and me we just sat there and talked about it until the early hours but then the next day he didnt want to know and thats how its been since thats how the old man wouldve been and then it was in the papers and on the telly the videos peopled taken our neighbours socalled how longve you been married wanting to take her away from those images the car swaddled in fog was warming up inside now and cherry was talking freely it emerged that she and tony had met through a dating agency for farmers born in newport where her parents had a shoe shop shed always dreamed of life on a farm theyd been married twenty years since she was twentyseven and had two sons both now working in cardiff and loving it if tony lodge left them the farm it would only be sold off he had a decision to make and fairly soon he didnt need this on top of it all his wife said and when theyd turned up at the door last night the villagers the new villagers telling him he ought to do the decent community thing and have roddy tidily cremated i dont think im quite understanding this merrily said all this talk of the new underhowle would this be something to do with the development committee they dont even like to call it underhowle any more oh its a nowhere sort of name one of them said once when they had a public meeting about it a neither herenorthere name meeting about what ariconium thats what they call the project ariconium was an old roman town that was supposed to be further down the valley towards weston but mr crewe who bought the old rectory he reckons it was more this way and he found a little statue of a roman god and they all got excited and thats how it started really i cant see it myself i mean theres nothing there its not like as if there were walls and ruins things you can walk round its just marks in the ground i saw a stone plaque thing in the village hall with the word ariconium carved into it they wanted to put it on the signs at the entrance to the village but some historical organization objected because they said it wasnt proved but theyre fighting that theyre setting up a museum of things peopleve found and maps and audiovisual stuff in the old chapel theyve had a grant from the lottery lots of things like that they well mr crewe and mr young at the school and the chap who has the computer factory people like that seem to be more of them every day but theyve done a lot for the village kind of thing put a lot of people in work so everybodys going along with it and they make it all sound so exciting for the future more tourism more jobs theyre planning this big launch next easter with leaflets and articles in the papers and television and that the last thing they want is for the village to be associated with a mass murderer oh dear god no not now pretty tactless however coming to your husband so soon afterwards had to come in good time for the funeral they were nice enough about it i suppose said theyd help keep it discreet keep the press away how it was in everybodys interests to develop an upmarket tourist economy kind of thing and until that was established we had to be conscious of our public profile merrily shook her head at the crassness of it not even in normal circumstances the best thing to say to a traditional farmer cherry lodge managed a smile thats true she was actually quite pretty there had probably been a time before the reality of it all started to wear her down when tony lodge hadnt been able to believe his luck all tourism means to my husband is people tramping across his land leaving gates open thats what hes doing up there now repairing fences tightening the barbed wire battening down the hatches thats not good is it merrily said carefully and collected another grateful look like hes accepted that were supposed to be hermits now for the rest of our lives not show our faces down there cause were going to be tarred with it for ever a glimmering of tears and this familys been here longer than any of them longer than any of them she leaned forward in the seat you know what id like to do sell our story to the papers we had the reporters here loads of them and tony was ready to get his gun out to them but id like to get them back tell everybody what he was really like how weird he really was thatd teach she blinked i keep forgetting youre a vicar i dont get to talk to many women you must think no not at all merrily focused rapidly glad that janes duffel was still toggled over the dog collar what would you tell them cherry what would you tell them about roddy weird how oh cherry looked uncomfortable again too eager blown it all sorts of things tony used to talk about him a lot at one time all the things he couldnt understand theres always somebody in a family you talk about isnt there somebody you always despair of always oh whats he gone and done now black sheep kind of thing what kind of things did he do cherrys hazel eyes flickered youve put me on the spot now im not sure i should its ok merrily nodded quickly pushing her cigarette into the ashtray im sorry i shouldntve asked anyway ive taken up too much of your time already ive got the lunch to make and everything not that hell eat much ill take you back down merrily let out the clutch biting her lip how to play this look you can take up as much of my time as you want whenever you want any time you feel this is getting on top of you and you want to talk she backed into some bushes in the fog more scratches before managing a clumsy threepoint turn dragging the volvo back onto the track crawling down the hill in second gear foot on the brake headlights on until the farmhouse imprinted itself drably on the clogged air cherry was silent the whole way and when merrily pulled up she made no move to open the door youre not an ordinary priest are you well most of them are bigger mr banks it was who told tony about what you do well whatever mr banks said i dont think its anything to do with why i was asked to take over the funeral isnt it if it is nobodys told me cherry stared out of the window you on email are you yes well no actually the computers crashed at home but you can reach me at the office in hereford write down the address for me can you dont look so surprised im not a peasant ive been doing the accounts on an ibm computer for four years now listen if i write all this out for you and send it no one will see it you promise me that except possibly my secretary whos also the bishops secretary who you could trust like your mother but i dont know what good its going to do except i think we shouldve told the police and tony wouldnt do that it was when the police told us about all these pictures on his wall and they asked could we throw any light on it and tony said no we couldnt and afterwards he was going what difference is it going to make now anyway except everybody thinking oh theyre all like that all the lodges mental sick merrilys throat was dry the fog seemed if anything thicker now it felt like when you were a kid burrowing under the bedclothes with a pencil flashlight cherry opened the car door got out and then leaned back in it torments me i keep thinking maybe we should have tried to get him to see a psychiatrist we mightve saved those girls i mean he went to his doctor with the headaches and he didnt spot anything whatever it was i think a lot of people failed to react to it merrily said she was thinking of the rev jerome banks she was thinking of her own wimpish relief at being denied access to roddy lodge at hereford police headquarters cherry said this is going to sound stupid but what it comes down to is roddy and dead people from an early age this thing about the dead she leaned on the door frame looking around listening perhaps for the putter of the quad bike maybe im making too much of it lamp the school bus was actually starting up when jane looked out of the window and saw eirion standing there by his car in his school uniform in the fog and her heart pulsed the way it used to when he drove all the way from the cathedral school in hereford because he just like had to see her serious turnon and today hed come all this way in terrible driving conditions but when she scrambled down from the bus dragging her flight bag full of books she saw that he wasnt smiling from the beginning the most amazing thing about eirion had been his smile and when it wasnt there he looked pasty a bit jowly even these days anyway especially through the fog in the old days march april arriving at her school hed say i was just passing both of them knowing that this wasnt a place anyone in their right mind just passed so it was a catchphrase nowadays and theyd be touching one another before the cars doors were properly shut but tonight i just needed to see you eirion making it obvious by his tone that today it wasnt that kind of need you want a lift home when she got into the new old car the sky was going dark it always seemed to be going dark jane thought life was one long dusk eirion just started the engine and when they were through the gates he said jane do you think we need to talk like how many crappy soaps did you hear that line in in the course of an average week or you would if you watched them jane tried to think of a corresponding cliché couldnt come up with one what about she said finally well you he took the back lanes to ledwardine prolonging the journey like he used to when they werent quite going out together but he was hoping it could take for ever today with these conditions the fog had never really cleared from this morning theyd had the lights on in the school all day and what a long and tedious day it had been in eng lit shed collected a couple of daggerglances from mrs costello whom she liked really but come on wasnt life just a little too short for flatulent prats like salman rushdie i er checked out the insurance eirion said its probably ok for you to drive this car after all i mean when its a better day than this yeah she said a better day a better day a bright new beginning youre so young people said what i wouldnt do if i was your age again when what they really meant was that when they were young the idea of a bright new beginning for the world didnt seem quite so laughable in the summer after she and eirion had made love for the first time the first time for both of them with anybody it later emerged it was incredible like climbing a mountain and it was all there at your feet the whole of life a glowing patchwork of endless glistening greenery jane scowled didnt make love had sex and that was it done it now done it a bunch of times and sure sometimes before and during and after it felt as though she was very much in love and didnt want there to be anyone else ever in which case this was really it seventeen now an adult now what and why why bother it was all going to end in tears anyway ive been wondering whats made you so negative lately eirion said oh really and whether there was any way i could help the car heater panted the dipped headlights excavated shallow trenches in the greybrownness it was a situation that at one time might have seemed cosily mysterious as distinct from totally dismal because if i cant eirion said you know what i dont know well if you dont know after a while jane stopped noticing the limited views atmosphere was just a psychological condition right she found she was gripping folds of her skirt what was happening to her she didnt even want to drive what was the point be gridlock everywhere within about ten years its like you just want to wreck things eirion said if things arent working exactly as youd planned them you dont want to wait lifes short very short for some people thinking of layla riddock who hadnt even made it out of school when the big pendulum did it in one blow thinking of nev thinking of their day out in midwales when eirion had taken her to see this particular standing stone and it had somehow just looked like a stone and eirion had been dismayed because she wasnt going like hey wow cant you feel that earth energy jane felt her eyes filling up as the car bumped around a bit she thought at first hed just gone over the kerb in the fog but it was deliberate he was fully in control the car stopped and he switched off the engine jane looked out and saw wet grass where are we turning to him wanting for a moment just to see his old smile in the dimness and then fall into his arms and everything would be all right for a while anyway so where does it begin this clinical depression at what stage do they prescribe the pills she pulled her bag onto her lap folding her hands on top of it selfcontained untouchable inside along with the books was her walkman with the nick drake compilation cd nick drake who died of an overdose of antidepressants it could all be really funny except it wasnt eirion scrubbed at the windscreen with his hand you cant even see it what the steeple at ledwardine were on cole hill what are we doing here i dont know really he sank back in his seat this is where she saw it isnt it where jenny driscoll saw the angel or didnt as you decided so she stared at him if she was getting an inkling of what this was all about she wasnt inclined to allow the idea to develop doesnt matter anyway he stopped rubbing its too foggy i dont understand i think you do he swallowed its like i said before a few months ago this whole thing wouldve been just so exciting to you that wedve been up here every night on some kind of angel hunt no we wouldnt that would be stupid yeah eirion said it probably would be now but the thing is it would also have been fun i wouldve liked it flask of hot soup and the you know the need to keep warm oh right jane said laying on the scorn this is about sex no almost a scream thats not what think about it very carefully jane said sadly underneath it all it would be about sex eirion drew in a tight breath so were into freud now is it stirrings of anger bringing out the welshness in his voice i really wouldnt know about that jane said i think im probably just coming to my senses he exploded then this is your senses it seems to me that youre losing your fucking senses all all six of them jane said without thinking much about it can you take me home the windscreen was opaque with fog and condensation it was already going cold inside the car is this it eirion said is this it for us talking in this dramatized way to provoke from her an outraged denial i dont know she said maybe like the angel will float down and spread this healing radiance all around us and well feel really cool it was hard to see his face in what light was left but she could feel the extreme shock coming off him it was like being in one of those cold patches that mum was supposed to look for in haunted houses and though shed caused it jane felt detached from it and that wasnt right was it that was kind of cruel listen eirion said urgently we all get like this sometimes you read about executive stress and midlife crisis but i think those peopleve just forgotten what it was like when they were in their teens and there were like whole big areas of their lives they couldnt control what they dont remember how bad it could be sometimes when you cant cont you really dont understand do you she looked at him with pity ive realized that nobodys in control nobody and nothing all this information going round and round the world on the internet and stuff and its all bullshit and everybodys got a website that tells you nothing you want to know and all the politicians are like and mum mum knows these guys know sodall really and are never going to get us anywhere and the hospitals and everything are always going to be totally crap but she can live with it because shes managed to con herself into thinking that way above all this ridiculous mess theres this allknowing benevolent thing oh jane and meanwhile she and lol are coming apart before it ever came together and hell shag the cairns woman if he hasnt already because at least shes there for him at least shes there and mum will just spend the rest of her life humouring fruitcakes like jenny driscoll and poor old gomer will start sitting in front of daytime telly day after mindless day of soaps and kilroy not even seeing it after a bit and falling asleep until one blessed day he doesnt wake up silence its a phase eirion said feebly at last itll pass jane she jerked in her seat i dont want it to pass you cretin this is reality she started to cry and wound down the window to let the fog come in like a damp facecloth ill take you home then eirion said emptily merrily had come home via hereford calling in at tesco to pick up a sandwich and then at the hospital to see a couple of parishioners in the geriatric ward miss tyler and mrs mackay once neighbours in the village and now they didnt even recognize one another on the ward but they recognized merrily or seemed to and mrs mackay wanted her to pray with her and at the end of it merrily added her own silent prayer that something could be done about geriatric wards even the word itself had become demeaning and contemptuous and when you said it aloud it made a sound like a creaking wheelchair back home she found a parcel a brown jiffy bag in the porch and dumped it on the hall table when she heard the phone ringing she exchanged grimaces with the lampbearing christ and went through to the scullery to answer it you sound a bit down lass oh hello huw you find that stuff about the girl yeah i was trying to think if it could be relevant in any way to her disappearance depends if it were still going on getting abducted by aliens becomes a regular thing sometimes the experience is repeated sometimes it even seems to be sitespecific you mean the house is haunted rather than the individual that rather argues against aliens doesnt it more like geological conditions fault lines underground springs any atmospheric conditions that might promote hallucinations nothing to do with rehabilitation of the displaced dead no requirement for social services of the soul merrily sat down still wearing her coat huw ive got to bury roddy lodge so i heard did you amazing how much gossip drifted up the brecon beacons and would you have any advice on that for instance theres a body of local opinion doesnt want him in the churchyard that bother you i feel ok about it hes entitled to a christian burial however bearing in mind that ive never buried a murderer before aye a pause for consideration complications are possible a lot of psychic fallout drifting round a murder as for several murders not proved hes still an innocent man in the eyes of the law and that can make it even more complex unfinished business lass this is what you rang about isnt it huw was silent for quite a while long enough for merrily to tuck the phone under her chin while she shed her coat i had a call from young francis huw said the detective bliss you had a call from bliss catholic am i right ten a penny in liverpool and a bit not exactly unstable would volatile be a better word lets say impetuous whats this about huw lads been out and about asking a lot of questions in certain areas bee in his bonnet bees buzz certain areas specifically the west case why would he phone you about that she was cautious now i er i were a consultant on that inquiry you never mentioned that before couple of us were brought in after talk of the wests being involved with a satanic cult i wasnt aware of that talk by west himself mostly some of it was allegedly said in discussions he had with his prison carer while he was on remand couldve been bullshit anyroad during the police investigation a number of us were asked if we knew of anything any groups operating around gloucester or the forest of dean satanist sadist anything deviant one suggestion was that fred west were supplying this group with virgins abducting women taking them to some farm for ritual abuse subsequent murder course he lied a lot probably just a latent attempt to shift some blame was how the coppers saw it but they didnt want to take any chances and were you able to help well we couldnt supply a string of addresses of satanic temples if thats what they expecting but there was evidence of hard magic in cromwell street itself one of the victims young lass of seventeen was into occultism and bloodritual linked to bondage sandm whether they believed in it or not the wests were only too happy to join in lass ended up tied by her ankles to a beam in the cellar hanging upside down like a side of meat huws tone of voice had altered gone flat the level of emotion in his voice was often an inverse reflection of his actual commitment merrily recalled one of her fellow students on the deliverance course saying funny chap old huw been through the mill wears his scar tissue like a badge this had been unfair he didnt he might slope around in baggy jeans and trainers with holes in them looking ravaged but only ravaged like the lead guitarist of some old blues band you vaguely remembered from your childhood and he rarely talked about the mills hed been through dark or satanic anyroad bliss reckons theres a link between lodge and west that his esteemed colleagues are not taking seriously enough he told you about the attaché case and the pictures asked me if i could see any ritual angle asked me too could you told him i couldnt see either of them buggers being bright enough for that kind of stuff however we cant rule out a link can we west got around the forest of dean a lot him and lodge were both twobit contractors hold on merrilys hand tightened round the phone i dont think even frannie bliss is going that far he told me about a man from south wales who had a sick fascination with the wests and killed a girl on the edge of the forest in bliss was thinking along those lines west as role model he didnt see a personal connection for heavens sake merrily what im saying is this youve got one woman dead and the coppers are looking at the possibility that lodge killed her either because she wouldnt go along with his horrific west fantasies or she found out what hed done to the others what hed done to the others see what did he do to the others nobody yet knows whether there are others aye and happen thats why the police arent publicizing it about those pictures and the cuttings because once you throw down the name west its no longer an ordinary murder investigation no longer god forbid even an ordinary sexmurder inquiry its kidnap torture mutilation its the unspeakable its saying to the parents of every missing girl within a fiftymile radius or more youve read about west and what he did well were not trying to worry you or anything but huw she said hes dead lodge is dead and west is dead merrily west told this woman in winson green that hed done another twenty he also said there were other people involved now there must be a lot of folk with missing relatives who cant help wondering whenever they wake up in the night and in that area of west gloucestershire and the herefordshire border and the forest its all a bit close still raw if any link with west came out then you really would have a problem with that funeral yeah she sagged a little in her chair i hadnt really thought about that keep it to yourself huw said and pray that francis does the same he paused the lamp of the wicked shall be put out sorry book of proverbs i know whats the relevance i dont know if lodge had any connection real or imagined with west huw said all i know is that nowt reignites faster than the lamp of the wicked jane let herself in and put on the hall light which lit up the light of the world she stared into his lined face so benign so sad and worldweary so so holier than thou she experienced this shockingly powerful urge to pull down the picture and smash it to pieces on the flagstones this was how the church had been keeping bums on pews for two mil lennia he died for you you owe him guilt original guilt they gave you pictures like this to underline it you owe christ you owe uncle ted you owe the parish and the smug bloody church that pays you peanuts bastards janes face was stiff with drying tears the kitchen door was open the light was on and from the other side of the room she could hear mum on the phone in the scullery living the lie she closed the kitchen door quietly and went upstairs to her apartment in the attic where she and eirion had first had sex she dropped her bag on the floor and threw herself on the bed under the mondrian walls and sobbed in rage and incomprehension it used to be so wonderful up here so exclusive it had never felt so lonely so empty whats happening to you are you like some kind of freak that you cant just talk about blokes and bands and dvds like your mindless little friends at school not that she actually had any friends not really she got on with everybody ok on a superficial level but there was nobody to really talk to no reallife friends the one who might have been layla riddock was gone leaving only eirion who was intelligent and thoughtful and only a little overweight and who shed just just abused for no real reason other than that he probably did understand and of course shed known that he didnt just want sex he wanted love which she couldnt give him and now its over you just ended it like on a whim because maybe because he was getting too close he was blocking your horizon the horizon beyond which is nothing nothing at all no heaven you could only make a temporary heaven out of money or sex or drugs shed never done drugs had opportunities inevitably es whizz spliff all that but shed resisted it felt slightly contemptuous of kids who spent all their spare cash on chemicals because there were other ways to get there werent there meditation ritual dance spiritual exercises other ways of actually being there or not maybe there was nowhere to go but deeper into your own delusions jane turned the pillow over to the dry side merrily remembered the parcel shed left on the hall table and went to fetch it she was suspicious of parcels now the jiffy bag wasnt light and it bulged suppose it contained another few thousand pounds in used fifties she took it into the scullery and pulled it open under the anglepoise there were three paperback books inside all scuffed and with split spines an evil love happy like murderers she must have known there was a note on yellow paper attached to one of the books with a paperclip everything you ever wanted to know about the wests and a lot youll wish you didnt just in case you were interested let me have them back sometime f well thanks frannie merrily put the books back in the bag just what i bloody needed she switched off the lamp and sat there in the blood red of the old electric fire and wondered where all this was going bloody angels jane said what are you doing sitting here in the dark silhouetted in the doorway with the creamy kitchen behind her she looked so slight and vulnerable that merrily wanted to rush over and hold her the way you did sometimes even in normal circumstances as if shed sensed it and didnt want it jane backed off into the kitchen sorry merrily felt a cool wave of dismay sorry flower i was on the phone and the light just faded on me whats the time twenty to six merrily got up things have been a bit maybe we could put some music on later code for a deep and meaningful chat whatever you ok yeah the light throwaway kind of yeah carrying many times its weight of meaning and now the damn phone was going again merrily glanced back to make sure she hadnt switched off the machine by mistake better get it jane said quickly might be important merrily hesitated and jane turned away merrily sighed went back and picked up ledwardine vic mrs watkins cheery booming male voice george lomas lomas and sons coleford we havent done business before but were burying a certain gentleman if thats the correct term in this instance for mr tony lodge and your good self ah right erm hello you have friday i believe as i understand it and unfortunately mrs watkins i have to tell you as quite a number of people now understand it mr lodge had hoped to keep it discreet by using ourselves rather than one of the firms in ross but it seems someones let the cat out of the bag and i had a phone call this afternoon from the local press oh dear quite not what we want under the circumstances however ive spoken to the parties concerned including the reverend banks and we have an alternative proposal to put to you if it can be accommodated into your schedule and that is wednesday the day after tomorrow were suggesting late afternoon very late afternoon you mean under cover of darkness i think it makes sense mrs watkins it had been arranged that mr lodges coffin should spend at least one night in the church prior to burial so no one will be surprised to see a hearse arrive we propose and mr tony lodge is somewhat reluctantly in agreement that the funeral should be carried out as soon as possible we expect there to be no more than five mourners a clandestine funeral that wouldnt exactly be my choice of word but under the circumstances well mr banks is certainly in agreement it means that mr lodge will be safely interred before anyone can cause problems youve been warned of problems not if its dealt with on wednesday evening and arrangements remain confidential could we say fivethirty well there really wasnt an alternative was there ok splendid said mr lomas when she put down the phone it rang again under her hand damn merrily picked up led sophie said i was just doing my final check on the email and theres one you might just want to know about before the morning cherry lodge already how long is it quite long merrily ive already mailed it but i thought id tell you in case you werent going to check your emails again until the morning fine thanks oh sh the computers gone down its not working i was going to ring up someone tomorrow oh god look under the circumstances i think id better come in and collect it i could drive it over there if youre tired you sound tired no thats ridiculous ill come in hows the fog patchy ill wait for you no need ill wait ok give me just over half an hour when shed put the phone down merrily went into the kitchen and found jane at the farthest window where the light was dim looking out at dark nothings in the garden the kid didnt turn round off to hq then sorry something i need to pick up merrily saw that janes hair was flattened on one side as if shed been lying on it erm why dont you come too we could call for some chips on the way back ive got homework to wrap anyway it always takes you longer than you think its going to once youre up there closeted with auntie sophie no ill be as quick as i can honest but if you want to get something to eat meanwhile or i could jane said just go mum huh desperately cuddling ethel jane had thought about it for a long time and it was her fault no question she was the guilty party she would call him a mature decision you didnt because of your own weakness your own inadequacy just walk away like this from someone who was not only your first lover but also your best friend who youd lain with and laughed about things with together who had virtually nicked his stepmothers car last summer to drive you home from wales on a whim who also last summer had been face it hurt for you and almost very badly in fact almost jane clutched the edge of the refectory table with both hands squeezing hard until she too was hurting ethel watched her bigeyed from the stone flags she should be able to understand why she was feeling like this continually juggling rage and despair like shed read the catcher in the rye about the kid in the s making the shattering discovery that all adults were hypocrites but this wasnt the s and she wasnt a kid any more and shed known for years that all adults were total fucking hypocrites ok maybe except for lol and gomer and mum who did her best and anyway all these were people in the process of getting damaged jane let go of the table walked into mums office and snapped on the light it was actually quite calm and plain in here no awful victorian bible scenes just a blueframed print of a painting by paul klee which huw owen had once given mum irregular coloured rooftops under a white moon on the wall above the desk there was just one smallish cross in oak a paperback new testament and a prayer book lay on the desk there was a single bookcase in which the standard theological tomes were being gradually displaced by the kind of books that jane herself used to borrow paranormal stuff the deliverance ministry my mother the exorcist an anglican shaman a christian witch doctor paid peanuts to humour fruitcakes could be worse she might actually have finished her so university course and become a lawyer like dad like uncle ted jane forced a grin picked up the phone tapped out a mobile number more familiar than their own hed be home now in the grim family fortress outside abergavenny irene what can i say i dont deserve you i dont deserve to live could he bear to hear that again ominous silence no ring vodaphone robot the vodaphone you are calling has been turned off and nothing about voicemail no please jane felt like she was about to start hyperventilating hed even disabled his voicemail oh christ i didnt mean it slamming down the phone staggering back into the kitchen i didnt mean any of it you know i didnt you utter bastard drawing in a breath like a long thin hacksaw blade once too often shed abused him once too often jane wrapped her arms around herself it was over it really was over she stood there not moving as though she was set in marble an angel on a grave stood there for well over a minute before moving numbly to the sink halffilling a glass with water and drinking it watching ethel disappearing purposefully through the cat door she went back to the table and pulled out the chair where mum normally sat removing a book from the seat before sitting down this house was like a nunnery even the book was by st thomas aquinas mums place marked with an envelope at a page with she opened it some stuff about angels of course bloody angels messengers of god jane shook her head slowly in contempt then lowered it into her arms on the table top this was what mum had once admitted to doing when all else failed when she didnt know where to turn with a cringing curtsy to primitive superstition she would actually open the bible or some other holy tome at random seeking divine inspiration from the first she read god the weight of sadness in a gesture like that and wasnt it ironic that after years of mocking janes own passing fascination with nature spirits and angels mum should get finally get round to investigating the subject because a madwoman had given the church a hefty bung wasnt it also typical that shed turned to a medieval theologian rather than simply ask her own daughter who had read more books on angelic forces jane lifted her head slowly then shook it smiling what she guessed was a smile of nearinsanity but really what the hell maybe it worked a sign from god angelic inspiration she looked at the clock five to seven be a least a couple of hours before mum got back she got to her feet and went through to the hall didnt for once feel the need to take down the light of the world and smash it onto the flags didnt even give it a glance as she pulled her blue fleece jacket from the peg shrugging it on as she opened the front door mums voice bleating in her head from when theyd had the row about jenny driscoll maybe i didnt push her hard enough well of course she didnt she wasnt intellectually equipped for it the truth was that mum simply didnt have the knowledge everything she knew about angels came from the bible or the works of guys like aquinas whereas jenny boxnéedriscoll was coming directly from the new age where angelic energies corresponded with the devas the highlevel faerie entities supervising whole areas of life where angels were considered to be an ecological fact not a religious device ok it was all sad crap but it was crap she knew about nobody in well ok certainly nobody in this village was better equipped to get the truth out of driscoll the fog wasnt bad now actually jane zipped up her fleece plunged her hands in the pockets and set off down the drive towards the square and chapel house it would have been good to discuss this first with eirion but she was on her own again now had to find her own way make her own decisions thing seeing marilyn deliverance from cherry lodge cherrylodgeagritelcouk to deliverancespiriteccouk has her own separate email address merrily noted but id be a bit concerned about mailing her back all the same i wouldnt worry the husband probably never even goes near the computer sophie said some older farmers are uncomfortable with them their farms a private world a domain and they dont like the thought of anything having access whether its through a public footpath or the internet electronic intrusion is as big a threat as a ministry man with a clipboard lately sophie had been letting her white hair grow in the subdued light it looked unexpectedly dense and dramatic above the grey cashmere and pearls she was perched elegantly on a corner of the desk her back to the window conveying no hurry to be away sophie hill a woman who lived close to and for the cathedral who didnt therefore keep hours thered been tea waiting for merrily in the bishops palace gatehouse and chocolate biscuits janes auntie sophie jibe had not been entirely misplaced it was a bit like going to your aunties when you were a kid a guilty pleasure now especially with jane at home nursing her private angst have you read this merrily asked below the cathedral gatehouse the lights of broad street were still fuzzy with fog merrily its why i called you so what do you think well obviously my first thought was that they should have told the police i cant no of course not not without consulting her first but then when you think about it how interested would the police be anyway what difference would it make now hes dead weve been feeling isolated like outsiders now in our village even though tonys family has been here for generations were the nearest farm to the village but we dont feel involved any more or especially wanted and since all this came up its got much worse some people weve known for years have been very kind but they dont run things here any more thats why we didnt want to talk about it to the police or anyone it could only have made things worse than they are shes very fluent sophie getting things off her chest sophie nodded email can be a liberating experience as im sure you know one can say things it would be difficult if not impossible to say in a twoway conversation on the phone while the problem with letters is that not only are they more formal but one is inclined to read them back an hour or so later and think i cant send that and tear them up but with an email you pour it all out and youve pressed send before you can change your mind for people especially for women in remote situations its become a refuge a confessional a lifeline particularly women who cant discuss some things with their husbands she probably gets into chat rooms as well therapy company merrily sitting at sophies desk looked up head on one side ive often wondered never asked but are you in the samaritans sophie smiled briefly and looked away it was obvious now when you considered and shed be very good at it also one can write and transmit an email while ones other half is still in the house without the danger of being overheard without even having to sneak it into the post i suppose its become for many people the nearest thing to thinking aloud or crying aloud yes merrily thought of cherry lodge and her ibm and her spreadsheets tony lodge slumped in front of the tv and his wife ostensibly at work on the accounts in another room dealing with defra forms on the net in the night when it was cheaper while secretly entering the bigger world the limitless virtual world merrily started to go through the printout for a second time pencilmarking key paragraphs the police took me and my husband to roddys bungalow and we were both shocked because wed not been there much they didnt mix tony and his brother him being so much younger and wed certainly never been in the bedrooms before well i was not as shocked as tony because i thought well he was just a lad even though he was thirtyfive and him being single and everything it didnt shock me that much i mean the black sheets and everything we all knew how much hed changed since he went on his own how much more confident he was perhaps through being in business but then when we saw the pictures of women tony squeezed my arm to say nothing and when they asked us if we knew he collected pictures like that all of famous women who were dead now with nude bodies of page three girls pasted onto them tony said it didnt make any sense to him at all and he was just disgusted and he hoped it wasnt going to be talked about publicly or told to the papers because things were bad enough i saw those pictures when i went to the bungalow with frannie bliss he was hoping i might be able to throw some light on it but it was as much a mystery to me i mean without knowing the full background id never have been able to come up with anything as bizarre as this his father was very religious and he wouldnt even think about it and so obviously it wasnt to be talked about in the house but theres no doubt in my mind it comes back to the death of roddys mother when he was so young she was well over when she had him and never very fit always ailing they never thought shed make old bones well she was dead before the baby was years old it was all so unexpected and it must have taken a toll on her youd have thought hed feel resentment towards roddy the old man because of that instead of him being his favourite but he was very religious he always saw roddy as a gift from god for which there was a price to pay and that was the loss of his wife i never understood the logic of that but roddy was always special if anyone was resentful i suppose i would have to say it was tony and his brother geoff who had lost the mother they knew and loved and got roddy instead merrily what do you suppose she means by that sophie fingered the phrase gift from god all right it was unexpected a fluke but is she actually saying that he believed his ailing wife had been preserved by god just long enough to give birth to this monster merrily shuddered the farm was doing quite well in those days and the old man was able to employ a woman to look after the child in the daytime and stay over when he wasnt well but they never became substitute mothers because they never stayed in the job long enough it was a male household with a bit of help with the meals and the cleaning and childcare on top of that my husband has told me how roddy was always asking about his mother what she looked like and so on and one day marilyn monroe was on the telly and the old man laughed and said thats what she looked like and although there must have been pictures of his mother around the house roddy seemed to get fixated on this idea and he started collecting pictures of marilyn monroe to put up in his bedroom when one of his brothers said something about it roddy said it was all right because she was dead and then hed find other pictures of women he liked the look of and if they were dead hed say hed have them for his mother and hed put them up too and he seemed to find comfort in it so nobody thought anything of it you heard of anything like that before merrily asked be interesting to talk to one of the nannies wouldnt it perhaps the police already have sophie picked up the electric kettle to refill it reinventing his mother not some worthy but possibly rather dowdy middleaged farmers wife in some fairly dour farmhouse but in fact something worldshakingly beautiful with glittery dresses and glossy lips making a goddess of her a sex goddess sophie said quietly that came later merrily said lets do the childpsychology stuff first a boy with no mother an allmale household hes quite lonely at home his brothers are grown men with work to do his fathers well into middle age and strict in all kinds of ways its an altogether rigid regime so heres a child desperately in need of a mothers love jealous of all the other kids he sees being taken to school by their mums what you would call a projection then sophie offered or a simple invention some kids have imaginary friends roddy has an imaginary mum but is he looking for maternal love or a situation where he feels to some extent in control the way he doesnt normally in that house the dead dont push him around he doesnt feel quite so small and insignificant with the dead quite touching in a child sophie took the kettle into the adjacent washroom but it can only get unhealthy cant it as he approaches the dread years of puberty and all his burgeoning urges become fixated upon well i think we can both see where this is going its very hard to understand why they allowed it household of working men if it kept him quiet at night sophies voice came thinly from the washroom over the rattle of water on metal not if the rest is true roddy was always seeing people who were not there so he said he didnt seem to be afraid of them at first it seemed like just his imagination but when they heard him talking to them in his bedroom at night the dead well this was a very stiff godfearing house and talk of ghosts and spirits was thought of as sinful in the extreme roddy got into a lot of trouble with his father of course in most homes today they would have him to a psychiatrist but there was still a stigma attached to that kind of thing then even though it doesnt seem so very long ago to me when he was older it seemed to stop but tony reckoned it was only that he stopped talking about it they never said anything to the old man knowing it would distress him but it was definitely going on well into roddys teens tony said you could still hear him talking and giggling in his room in the dead of night and you would swear listening to it that he was not alone in there he said he and geoff tried to laugh it off but there was something frightening about it too and they just tried to put it out of their minds and not hear it and get on with their lives he said it was because they didnt want to worry their father but i am not sure this was a good attitude to take especially now obviously i am also sure that tony himself saw or heard more than he will talk about to me or anyone but theres farmers for you head in the sand was he psychic is that what were looking at sophie sophie sat down opposite merrily with her back to the window and the lights of broad street reached for a pencil and her shorthand pad what do you know that would reinforce that theory not much told me hed been to see the vicar and scared him after talking to jerome banks myself id say the scaring bit was wishful thinking but banks did admit roddy had been to see him claiming his bungalow was haunted the usual poltergeist effects were mentioned but that was probably banks being dismissive so either roddy was genuinely experiencing something or he wanted to give people the impression he was and this is in a new bungalow dont forget no history apart from his own sophie lifted an eyebrow he brought marilyn and the others with him when tony and i were married we lived in a bungalow in the village so that he could carry on running the farm with geoff roddy was about fifteen then and i never saw that much of him he didnt want anything to do with the farm except driving the tractor so he had a few other jobs including training as a mechanic at a garage in ross but he didnt stick that of course he never stuck at anything for long the old man said he was sure roddy was going to make something of himself one day although none of us could see it then geoff went to australia with his family and the old man died soon after tony got the farm and there was money for geoff and roddy with the proviso he spent it on setting himself up in a decent business which tony was to approve and oversee in the early stages quite a few local farms etc said they would offer him work if he got himself a digger and a bulldozer and the parish council said he could dig graves so that was how it started although we never imagined it was going to take off like it did i think that was because of getting into septic tanks he never looked back especially after he got that contract as representative for efflapure how he managed that well never know i think tony was also relieved when he started going out with girls or rather melanie pullman who was his first real girlfriend they were going out together for quite some time over a year but then they broke up and then she disappeared and he started going out with that lynsey now thats interesting dont you think sophie the fact that both he and the pullman girl were having odd experiences i wonder why they split up people do merrily especially a first relationship men have one sexual liaison and it gives them confidence to go out looking for something new merrily recalled sam hall in the community centre boy seems to have gone through what you might call a delayed adolescence as if hed discovered sex for the first time in his thirties no woman was safe so how do we follow him into the next stage which is killing living women im not sure thats somewhere i want to follow him sophie said and im not sure you need to either ill just make the tea merrily marked one more paragraph i should also say it came as no surprise to either of us the way he died he was always one for the pylons according to tony he had long legs and was always good at climbing when he was about ten he had a good hiding off his father for going up the one in the field behind the farm almost right to the top he wasnt afraid he never seemed to be afraid of anything tony said so it came as no surprise at all how he went was that part of his world of the dead climbing to another level of what but that whole area was an electric valley always part of his world who knew what connections he might have made merrily read the last sheet again i have never had any kind of experience in this house so i must assume that when roddy went from here it all stopped well it stopped here anyway and that was all that mattered to tony i am afraid to say head in the sand until its too late isnt it always the case im telling you all this mrs watkins and i havent told anybody else and i hope that as a church minister you will respect this none of us could possibly have known could we what was going on inside him we couldnt tony says that if we could just get him buried and do our duty by his father then we can try and settle down but i dont know i think tony is getting very depressed about it and i think sometimes that it would be the best thing for everyone if we were to sell up and move from here but we cant do that yet because who would want to buy a farm where a mass murderer was raised sophie came back with the teapot and went to the window fogs clearing glad you think so merrily said light and sparks before jane was even across the square she knew precisely how she was going to play it deceit against deceit lies illusion front despite the fog the square was collecting its nightly quota of upmarket xs welloff couples coming in to dine on a monday night for heavens sake at the black swan and the restaurant that used to be cassidys country kitchen the monday diners were mostly the youthfully retired with up to half a century to kill before death the swan mistily lit up had become more like a bistro than a village pub and pretty soon ledwardine would be more like a theme park than a village with its shops full of repro its resident celebs and of course its stateoftheart postmodern designer vicar with the sexy sideline in soulretrieval poor as a church mouse but you wouldnt kick her out of your vestry haw haw unfair bitch jane straightened her back and siphoned in a slow breath you had to channel your anger or it would all come back at you shed learned that much at least from her new age years the lights of the swan dimmed behind her in what remained of the fog as the pubs façade sobered up into a couple of timberframed terraced houses then there was an alleyway with a wroughtiron lantern over it which looked pretty old but probably wasnt it was unlit on the other side of it narrow and bent with one gable leaning outwards like a man in a pointed hat inspecting his shoes was chapel house the house was the real thing as for its owner hello im jenny driscoll and this afternoon ill be looking at ways you can turn your living room into a true sanctuary a place where you can really be yourself and yet also be taken out of yourself what do i mean lets go inside and find out yeah right lets do that three steps led from the pavement up to the front door jane stood at the bottom clutching the cold handrail it was quite dark here away from the fake gaslamps on the square there was a glow in one of the downstairs windows but the bottom of the window was too far above the road for her to tell where the light was coming from or if there was anyone in that room cold feet now of course something like this was always the obvious thing to do until it actually came to it like would she even be here if eirion had left his phone switched on if hed answered it if it hadnt been over well probably not but that was not what had happened and this in the event was where the obvious path had led probably it was meant a confrontation waiting to happen jane paused with a hand on the knocker all right stop consider this was her last chance to backtrack home and think this through properly for it might not in fact be such a good idea and if it failed and the driscoll woman hung the whole thing on mum it could get seriously dicey believe it clear footsteps behind the door then oh god shed been seen from inside so much for the element of surprise jane swallowed fog coughed mrs box look i hope you dont mind me just arriving like this but id really like to talk to you about angels we might be able to help each other aw she could wing this as it were she unzipped her fleece halfway thinking of jenny driscoll at seventeen terrible clothes terrible music and this element of sadomasochism thank you irene goodnight oh shit run too late none of the tugging and creaking you got at home the door opened like it was greased but not to reveal jenny box a man stood there there was a hum in the studio and prof levin was trying to track it down lying underneath the mixing board scrabbling about concerned about all the electricity under there lol offered to switch off at the master profs howl came out boxy you crazy how would i find it then why dont you take a walk laurence i cant concentrate lol said thoughtfully prof youve spent whole decades in this kind of atmosphere has it you know affected you at all huh all the electricity profs bald head came up glowing with sweat its an electric world whats your problem just is there too much of it are we killing ourselves nah prof said scornfully our bodies adjust one day well become electric beings just light and sparks he crawled out from under the mixing board this is about the mad guy wanted you to do his song right moira told me the guy who now wants urgently to meet the reverend to discuss whoknowswhat lol had driven up to ledbury to collect supplies from tesco and got back to find merrily had left a message with prof shed tried to see sam hall but he wasnt there shed call lol here again early this evening she hadnt hed called answering machine then gomer had called asking if he was free tomorrow prof stood up and laid his electrical screwdriver on the board you ever know mephisto jones mephisto jones the session guitarist no mephisto jones the road sweeper mephisto jones the systems analyst jesus he doesnt seem to have been around for a while plays acoustic now thats all he plays acoustic well lol said if hes happy happy hes fucking wrecked case i suspect of what your mans talking about mephisto takes his headaches to the doctor is referred to a neurologist the neurologist invites him to have a brain scan mephisto says what you wanna kill me now brain scan thats how much they know about it these neurologists a brain scan involves the use of a massive electromagnetic field mephisto jones was damaged by electricity i always thought it was the drink drink wouldve been easier and when i say that no this came out of nowhere out of the ether headaches weakness pain in the joints fingers swollen started with he couldnt work in the studio so hed go home lie on the sofa with a bottle of jamesons and the tv on and feel even worse it was a while before he put it all together that this was the tv not the drink by then he couldnt even listen to a walkman mobile phones goes without saying he told me he felt so ill some nights he couldnt stay in the house so he used to go and sit in the car in the cold because if he switched on the engine to power the heater he became allergic to electricity prof tilted his hands some people it just happens to like anything else some people are more sensitive to it than others most doctors still dont even accept it as a valid condition most doctors are arseholes give you a choice of nerve tablets red ones or blue ones in the end mephisto found this international support group for electroallergics or whatever the hell it is theyre called so where is he now somewhere in ireland with no power to speak of and a bunch of acoustic guitars living on old royalties and looking fearfully out the window in case someone should decide to drag his valley into the last century theyd have a lot to talk about mephisto jones and your madman if mephistos in a mood to answer the phone prof picked up his screwdriver not a mobile needless to say now will you leave me to my wires thats very interesting thank you prof but prof had already vanished like a badger into its set lol went through to the kitchen and out through the stable door trying to think what use a priest might be in this kind of situation tendrils of fog were still ghosting the trees along the banks of the hidden river frome but the rooftops were clear it was cold out here colder than hed expected presently his own song came drifting out as prof tested the system these burt bacharach kind of chords he couldnt put names to sounding better with distance remember this one the day is dwindling down in badgers wood collecting kindling smudgy eyes moonrise golden warm images the toes curling by the electric fire the rather loathsome curling sensation in moiras gut this bothered him hed heard too many shivery stories about moiras premonitions in fact lol shivered and was about to go back into the kitchen out of the cold when headlights lit the bushes along the track from the road the car came very slowly mud sucking at its tyres as the song went into its second short verse at the end of it streaked with cello the chord change registered as bitter and paranoid in the dense air the camera lies she might vaporize the headlights splashed lols eyes the car stopped the lights went down he heard the drivers door opening feet on gravel and then the door closing very lightly and carefully to make the most minimal of clinks a visitor sensitive to studio hours lol walked out and saw that it was young eirion on his own on the drive home the fog was patchy the road would be clear for up to a mile and then a sepia canopy would fall silently around the volvos windows muffling inside the car a grey passenger was nestling beside merrily all the way from hereford to ledwardine anxiety dead people were talking about dead people for much of his life roddy lodge seemed to have found solace in the dead and now he was among them gone nobody could be damaged by him any more except perhaps his family and the community really on the way out sophie had regretfully handed her another email received by the bishops office late this afternoon from the secretary of the underhowleariconium development committee asking for a meeting with mrs watkins she could hardly say no but the anxiety came from something more amorphous she was starting to feel spiritually darkened by the shadow thrown by roddy lodge and its merger with the even more monstrous shade of fred west a connection now strengthened by huw owen skirting the square slowing at the entrance to the churchyard merrily could see a light in the vicarage through the trees and then to one side another light a tiny one ruby splinters under the lych gate a light she knew of old its level above the ground the speed it moved like the landing light on a small boat gomer parry following his ciggy to minnies grave merrily braked hard right pulling the car half under the lych gate and sliding out the cold was a shock made her gasp she left the car door hanging open and ran through the gate into the churchyard spotting gomer where the path forked by the first apple trees he didnt turn round he knew who this was was mumbling his response before she caught up with him ent your problem vicar how many times had he said that to her she moved alongside him walking on the wet and freezing grass cold and nasty night gomer catch your death that time o year ennit it was like she was interrupting some interior dialogue the way lol had described him on their night ride back from underhowle like he wanted to catch his death listen she said im going home to cook something for jane and me itll be pretty basic but well be most insulted if you dont join us vicar this ent an issue you can sort out gomer kept on walking the give away ciggy cupped in his hand all right she moved in front of him crooked old gravestones damp and shiny on either side who told you ar about me conducting the funeral at underhowle for roddy lodge she felt his attention hardening as if he was only now becoming fully aware of her presence it was almost as if she could see his glasses lighting up youre plantin lodge the night air around them was unexpectedly pale as though the village lights had soaked into the fog and been carried out here branches of the old apple trees poked out like arthritic hands bugger he hadnt known then youre doing lodges funeral must seem like a betrayal to you gomer laughed without much humour cant none of us get away from it can we thats how it seems like it was bloody well meant sorry ar he said you and me both vicar she didnt understand pushed both hands far into the corners of the pockets of janes duffel think we got it all worked out see gomer turned and started walking back between the graves towards the lych gate feelings get the better of you ennit go shootin your ole mouth off fore you knows merrily followed him saying nothing new frost crackling under her shoes had to fix up nevs funeral see gomer said thats why i ent been around much is everything ok rector of presteignes got it in hand well likely have nevs nev back next week anyway been talkin to other folk while i was over there folk like cliff morgan the police sergeant told me what i already knowed vicar theyve finally linked him to the fire lodge there was the sound of a womans laughter from the square people entering the black swan gomer stopped under the lychgate nev started the fire he stared out towards the square accident like they thought found bits of an ole primus stove boy was likely frying bloody sausages pissed out of his head always used to say he didnt like eating at home nmore so thats it lodge is in the clear for what its worth to him now when did you learn all this gomer looked down at the cobbles bout five seconds before the bugger went up the pylon if you want the truth what he sighed ent got much of an appetite these days vicar but i wouldnt mind a cup o tea lol cleared a space in the clutter of the kitchen area and gave eirion a cappuccino from profs machine eirion was looking upset shoulders hunched eyes downcast the demeanour of the dumped i didnt know where else to come you know what shes like this loose cannon gone eight pm and he was still wearing his school uniform youve got to drive back to abergavenny tonight in this fog its clearing and they know where i am you dont mind do you lol i just eirion look lol climbed onto a stool at the breakfast bar which was still made up mainly of old packing cases look maybe the main problem is that the last thing she ever wants to think is that shes at all like her mum you know eirion smiled faintly a religious maniac bad enough if your dads a vicar but your mother so whats she going to do by way of rebellion obvious shes going to be a practising pagan secretly joining a womens mystical group meeting over a healthfood café in hereford next thing shes out in the vicarage garden bonding with the full moon eirion smiled and then suddenly merrilys realizing as if she didnt really already know that not all pagans are sacrificing animals and deflowering virgins on the altar shes even made friends with a witch for heavens sake and so from janes point of view some of that essential intergenerational friction that you need as a teenager to grow up with a positive sense of yourself is not there any more her mums no longer shocked and appalled lol spread his hands the way prof would do too easy this stuff i shouldve stuck with the psychology course eirion grinned so which way does she go next lol said satanism youre right eirion said its denial isnt it its not real atheism at all its just spiritual denial see you dont need me at all eirion gratefully drank some coffee what youve got lol said is a reluctant and therefore unhappy atheist were oversimplifying here because shes still towing a lot of emotional luggage including her dad all of that and like you say bad things happening to people close to her like gomer giving her ammunition to use against merrilys faith lots of triggers including me i expect eirion looked up slightly red its pretty clear ive been a serious disappointment in certain areas implying id been putting it about a lot with the band and everything the way you do im probably totally crap in bed and shes thinking christ is this it lol tried not to smile often its the ones who dont think theyre crap that there was history he could have gone into but the boy needed to get home tonight and then theres this jenny driscoll situation eirion said the woman behind the vestalia stores jenny driscolls discovering christianity and shes supposed to have seen an angel over ledwardine church and janes seriously contemptuous of her and all she stands for of course shedve given anything to have had that kind of experience herself so a lot of resentment lot of anger inflamed by all this about her mum not having a normal life giving everything up for god who doesnt exist anyway and if he does hes a complete shit you know lol leaned on his elbows on the breakfast bar she was laying all this on you day after day i wouldnt mind that if i thought there was anything i could do eirion looked at lol then looked away but you think theres something i can do well its just that jane thinks youre im sorry lol she thinks you and moira eirion hesitated biting his lower lip are perhaps having sex he said mournfully together like musicians do with the erotic charge of playing together lol sprang off the stool not that shes blaming you she blames her mother for neglecting the relationship putting god first as usual when gods only going to stab her in the back if he exists because hes a shit right she said any of this to merrily i dont know she was so happy about you and her mother finally getting together she thought shed brought you together i mean its obvious she really loves her mum despite all the rows they have maybe the only person she does truly love i mean i i was thinking isnt it just maybe a lot more simple to think that maybe shes found somebody else eirion shook his head look at me youd think we were married or something wouldnt you i mean theres bound to be someone else at some point isnt there its what happens childhood sweethearts twin souls thats pathetic isnt it eirion jesus jane thought lol and moira cairns were having sex would it be ok if i talked to merrily about this well i would hate it if she thought i was hoping shed you know intercede on my behalf but eirion sat there wearing his school uniform his puppy fat his dismal expression its just that jane suddenly all she sees is darkness doom nothing amazing out there any more mrs watkins has been a bit busy lately maybe she hasnt noticed how bad its been getting look im helping gomer again tomorrow lol said maybe i can call in the vicarage im really sorry eirion pushed fingers through his hair and stood up lol look man i might be overreacting all right lol looked at him shaking his head this is jane eirion yes eirion agreed miserably the man had said she cant be long i suppose do you want to come in and wait and at first jane had been completely wrongfooted this was hardly the kind of issue she could raise in front of both of them together especially if their marriage was more or less on the rocks and then shed thought on the other hand and had felt suddenly clever and strong in a thinkingon yourfeet kind of way in a lets use this situation kind of way yeah ok jane had said coolly i suppose i could hang on for a few minutes following him into the darkpanelled hall and then into wow i feel quite embarrassed about bringing anyone in here hed murmured im afraid my wifes tastes have become a little minimalist minimalist at once jane had liked the way he didnt talk down to her then she learned that this was how he was serious saying what he meant just two areas of light the smoky greenish night in leaded windows and the glowing crumbly fire built on the hearth just enough to bring out this oaky feeling of age and strength no tv or stereo on view or anything modern or new and the room was heavy with the oldest aroma in herefordshire the rich sweet scent of apple wood in fact she ought to be in two minds about all this really because although it felt like the old ledwardine this was actually the new ledwardine most ordinary people didnt have the money for this sympathetic sparing kind of conservation they just lived around the past with exposed wires along the beams and a parkray in the inglenook still jane had felt immediately at home enclosed hed taken her fleece to hang up sorry about the temperature but my wife absolutely refuses to have central heating in here it would damage what she calls the monastic purity its fine its quite warm its not terribly fine when you have to keep the damn fire going all the time gareth box had said sounding tired at the very thought of it but with this sort of attractive ashiness in his voice when im here i tend to build it up and keep it in all night which i suppose is wasteful nowadays maybe nowadays isnt what this house is about jane said smoothly you have to give it what it needs really i suppose you dont get to spend as much time here as youd like i think i probably do he said actually this is my wifes house she chose it restored it with her instinctive taste yes jane thought now observing him over her glass she at least has taste nothing minimalist about you mr box the two tudorlooking chairs were facing one another either side of the fire and were actually more comfortable than they looked and when you sat down you felt kind of transported back especially with a glass of wine in your hand red full bodied naturally and especially when you were served by gareth box because call this corny but with his collarless white shirt and black jeans his longish hair and his heavy wide moustache there really was something of the cavalier about him sitting down opposite jane pouring himself a glass of this serious wine and standing the bottle on the fairly rudimentary oak table by the side of his chair he looked far more suited to this house than the insubstantial jenny driscoll ever could a weary cavalier though perhaps depleted by civil war im sorry he held an arm towards the fire to see his watch there was no clock in the room she really shouldve been back by now seems to have very little awareness of the passage of time these days jane felt his gaze on her like a touch look jane there isnt anything i can help you with is there i feel awful now wasting your time wasting my time oh i really dont think so good worker gomer finally took off his cap and sat down at the refectory table he seemed to have lost weight the way he had just after minnie died his glasses were dulled merrily glanced into the scullery with ethel floating around her shins no sign of jane anywhere gone up to her apartment i expect can i at least do you some toast teall be fine vicar see how you feel afterwards she moved around switching lamps on then went to put the kettle on quite glad that the kid wasnt around she didnt want gomer inhibited oughterve told the cops straight away but he was already mad as hell at me that boy and it was all confused some folk nearhysterical bloody pandemonium i can imagine as soon as theyd left the church grounds hed emptied it all out for her no flam no excuses hed been mad as hell that night see likely with himself couldnt hold himself back even in public she remembered the location under the pylon could conjure the scene from what lol had told her the cops trying to conceal their panic at having lost a murderer local people all over the place smudging the picture as roddy lodge went weaving between the flashlight beams fast and lithe on his own territory used to moving by night covering a lot of ground very quickly easily avoiding the police because theyd be watching all the possible exits certainly not the pylon at the far end fully enclosed and no way out but up only gomer who was outside the action having left lol to do the spadework had seen him go catching up with his enemy at the foot of the pylon seizing his chance keeping his voice low you told em yet boy you mad ole fuck gomer asking the vicar to pardon his french but that was what lodge had called him mad ole fuck at the time hed been edging lodge back towards the giant girdery legs of the pylon telling him youre goin down anyway whynt you just tell em the bloody truth bout what you done to my depot what you done to nev tell the truth boy just once in your nasty lyin cheatin little bloody life lodges eyes swivelling all over the place lodge in his bright orange overalls but it was dark here no coppers anywhere near just gomer standing his ground fuckin kill you ole man you dont get out my way gomer not moving merrily could imagine all the scattered lights in the field gathering in his glasses as he raised himself up to his full five feet four glaring up into lodges concave face oh aye what you gonner kill me with got a can o petrol on you is it sonny half a second for it to get through and then lodge had come for him come at gomer rage going through his whole body you could feel the electricity of it gomer would swear and in the shock of it hed backed away giving just enough ground for lodge to straighten out an arm his open hand going flat into gomers face ramming the glasses tight into gomers eyes into his nose and then lodge had hissed out the typically crowing boastful sentences that proved hed had nothing whatsoever to do with the death of nevin parry course i done it you ole fuck been over to fuckin ledwardine loads o times look got clients all over that village rich bastards hadnt planned to torch your place but id got a coupler minutes spare that night then a final contemptuous push leaving gomer on his back in the mud and then lodge was off and away up the pylon though gomer didnt know that at the time as he heaved himself to his feet straightening his specs winded unsteady but perhaps it had been his brain that was most battered by what hed heard no wonder hed been so quiet for days hanging round minnies grave merrily put the kettle on the stove and came to sit down opposite him she was remembering lols graphic description of the exchange between roddy lodge up in the pylon and gomer on the ground lol recalling gomers opening challenge as completely as if it was the first line of one of his own songs where was it you set that fire boy whered you go where was it you went monday night you just couldnt believe it could you she said couldnt be sure id yeard it right gomer said well i was sure see but then im thinking mabbe he was scuse me vicar pissing up my leg so to speak i dont think he was ever that clever do you no lodge had surmised that because gomer lived in ledwardine that was also where his depot was aggressively admitting to something he hadnt done just to get the little guy out of his way and simultaneously proving his innocence and how had gomer reacted hed straightened his glasses and gone to the pylon to seek confirmation you were trying to get him to say it again just to be sure in your own mind or maybe to catch him out ar gomer took off his glasses rubbed them on his sleeve silly bugger gutted see how could i get it that wrong ever since been asking meself asking min at the grave if it was me killed him hounded an innocent man to his death well a you didnt force him up the pylon and b he wasnt innocent at all was he innocent till proved guilty gomer rammed both hands through his wild white hair rocksolid sure i was that hed started that fire which he admitted again on the pylon ar along with how he was gonner do wossername madonna i know who doesnt even live in the area load of ole wallop all bloody lies couldnt trust a thing he said he was in ross that night from early on cliff morgan told me that they got witnesses seen him in two pubs in ross but think about it this way if you hadnt had good reason to suspect lodge wed never have gone over there and found what we found and lynsey davies wouldve been quietly reburied somewhere more discreet god moves in myst i tried to tell him tried to tell that boy bliss when hes draggin me away perhaps that wasnt really the best time gomer still oughterve told him afterwards though ennit likely theyd have talked him down off there see if i hadnt been standing at the bottom givin the bugger stick worst of it is they ent never gonner know the full truth now is it never he looked across at merrily then lowered his gaze and now ive dumped it all on you vicar didnt wanner do that merrily patted his hand its what im here for as we vicars like to say you gonner tell him he looked apprehensive but she knew that whatever she wanted hed go with it he nearly always did a channel for gods opinion wasnt she which made offering gomer advice so much more of a responsibility i dont somehow think its going to arise you havent heard from him again have you in connection with more digging gomer shook his head no time for that in the last couple of days anyway hed been tidying up a few small jobs things he could do without hauling young lol out need the boy tomorrow mind to install a new tank for mrs pawson now the cops had finished messing up her garden herd been in london and who could blame her with no working drainage and knowing what had lain underneath the efflapure the two phones began to ring simultaneously in the kitchen and the scullery when the answering machine kicked in the message was fully audible through the open scullery door merrily i need to talk to you urgently so call me soon as you get back eh or if youre there now will you please pick up the phone oh god she said coincidences eh give me a minute gomer jesus merrily you took your flaming time gods work francis yeh listen ill keep it short the shits just hit the fan one of the people andy mumford spoke to in much marcle on my behalf on the subject of our late friend west decided there could be a few quid in it and phoned some bloody hack oh no who of course gets onto our press lady at hereford for an official quote and the upshot is to head off any really wild speculation flemings been forced to put out a statement on the west angle and hes fuming naturally and andys on the carpet and im lying very low so if anybody contacts you you havent spoken to me in yonks why should anyone phone me you didnt see the local tv news they had this story about the rector of underhowle backing out of roddys funeral due to protests by people who dont want him lying shoulder to shoulder with their godfearing ancestors then it was mentioned that youd be standing in i was named im afraid so merrily so if youre talking to anybody there or here or anywhere i did not take you into roddys lair you know nothing about any pictures on walls et cetera et cetera youre saying you want me to lie for you if you would please bliss said er you got the package yes thanks very much itll make a change from the bible seriously bliss said i should give them a glance there is a connection with west gorra be huw owen knows that as you what sorry merrily right lets sort this why did you really phone huw owen and how does huw owen know theres a connection between roddy lodge and fred west well he doesnt know bliss said awkwardly i mean none of us know its all right merrily said tightly ill ask him myself fred bloody west gomer said now why dont that surprise me merrily had left the scullery door open he could hardly have avoided overhearing hardly mattered now if it was all coming out in the press she sat down you remember the case you found for them behind the bungalow it contained a pile of press cuttings on the west case things like that always givin you all this ole wallop bout what he done and who he done it with gomer mused showin you photos of his missuss of his missus he looked beyond merrily towards the dark window in the back wall just the same as lodge lies lies and more bloody lies you never thought much of it see and then the truth turns out to be a sight worse sight more worse than you could ever imagine anybody could be least of all some cocky little builder love nest in the back of his bloody van always showing you photos gomer took out his ciggy tin and extracted one hed rolled earlier merrily stared at him you knew west gomer wrinkled his nose in distaste wouldnt say i knowed him thank the lord though you mightve thought you did after bout half an hour the way he went on givin it that making rabbiting motions with fingers and thumb the whole time bugger couldve yattered for hereford bout private things mostly and you can only take so much of that kind o chat he lit his ciggy good worker mind couldnt fault him on that always looked after his tools you said photos ones i saw was just pictures of his wife with no clothes on but this feller i worked with once said westd offered him you know bit of a session with the missus free like ive heard that and later they reckoned there was these video tapes doing the rounds never come across em meself mind porno videos worse gomer looked down at the table how do you mean ar well gomer coughed oh god merrily said quite when it became clear that gareth box was actually interested in jane as a woman she was not sure but it must have been fairly soon after he first called her jane as if he really knew her as if theyd known one another quite some time she supposed at first that it was simply a journalists thing assuming this easy familiarity although he hadnt been an actual reporter for a long time she guessed if eirion had got it right hed already become some sort of executive editor when hed met jenny driscoll it was just the way he said jane hearing her name in his deep worldweary voice there was a kind of charge under it also an intensity in the way he looked at her he was a very intense person and that wasnt stupid and shed only had one glass of wine well ok hed topped it up so say two but definitely not much more than that it wasnt as if shed been here very long and anyway jane could usually hold her drink no problem except for cider just have to be a bit careful she didnt say too much too soon my er my exboyfriend wants to be a journalist could do worse gareth said opens lots of doors well at your level i suppose not round here he shrugged i started not all that far from here actually worked for a news agency it doesnt matter where you start if youre good enough if you can spot opportunities yeah she supposed jenny box must have seemed like a good one at the time if you could put up with her obsessive behaviour er you havent actually met my mother have you gareth box sighed i certainly feel as though i have my wife talks about your mother quite a lot the way he kept saying my wife jane thought conveyed a definite detachment i tend to hear about all her problems though its hardly my business he smiled wryly how are things between her and er lol yes of course oh well wow the old girl really was getting in with jenny box complicated you know unsatisfactory but like whats new and he poured her a bit more wine and they chatted about lol for a while and a few other things he was very easy to talk to he concentrated on what you were saying made meaningful observations seemed concerned treated you like a person a woman yes that was the point from the first hed treated her like an equal only lol had ever really done this before even with gomer who was never patronizing it was still always young jane so this felt good she wouldnt deny that so like how do you feel about the angel thing a pause more to the point he leaned back in his chair tossing one long leg across the other tilting it so that an ankle lay easily on a thigh how do you feel about it jane well i jane drew breath and went for it frankly im inclined to think its kind of bollocks gareth didnt laugh he just nodded a lock of dark hair falling over his forehead jane felt obliged to qualify bollocks immediately and talked about angels and the kind of people who professed to see them talking too fast maybe he didnt interrupt she felt hot now edged her chair away from the fire i mean theres a history of sightings like this in certain places mainly abroad although most of them sound like mass hallucination but obviously theres no history of it here not over ledwardine church she forced a laugh the problem is the business my mothers in you cant just knock something like that on the head not easily can you no he said i imagine not and its hard for her you know gareth box nodded so you thought youd come over and knock it on the head she squirmed a little i just wanted to know what was really happening whats really behind it best not to mention the money at this stage i dont like to see her getting taken for a ride he was silent shit ive gone too far a log collapsed in the hearth jane jumped gareth box didnt move im sorry she said i dont mean to be offensive or anything he met her gaze although his own eyes were just shadows kept on looking at her steadily as though he was trying to make up his mind about her intense a little shiver went up her spine deliciously then he said very quietly what if i was to tell you in absolute confidence that shes done this kind of thing before she jumped again oh my god didnt know what to say look he said all this is pretty painful for me as you can imagine no man likes to think his wifes he looked away how old are you jane old enough he smiled i wouldnt doubt it jane can i rely on your absolute discretion yes absolutely she was aware that her voice had shrunk she found shed come to the edge of the chair she saw that two logs had enmeshed forming a red ashy heart the applewood scent filled her head this is a village gareth box uncrossed his legs and sat forward with his hands pressed together between his knees which seemed uncharacteristically hunched and defensive whatevers happening needs to be handled with a certain tact im used to that jane said it goes with the territory he nodded look i dont know very much about your mother but i think we both have to accept that in jennys eyes theres only one angel in ledwardine the log fell apart christ standing under the porch light merrily watched gomer walking away down the drive feeling relieved when he turned right at the bottom heading towards his home and not the churchyard not minnies grave what a small county this was gomer had met fred west when they were both involved in the renovation of some farm buildings at a small equestrian centre near ross gomer and nev had been putting in drainage and fred had been rebuilding walls and installing the electrics his van seemed to have been furnished in the back for sex which he talked about all the time for all these women he seemed to run into who were begging for it merrily had asked gomer if west might have had any contact in the course of his work with roddy lodge gomer who knew a lot of people in the service industries had said he couldnt be sure about lodge but more men and women of course had been associated with west than were ever likely to admit it merrily closed the front door locked it and barred it top and bottom she went to the bottom of the stairs flower no reply it was after ninethirty now the kid had probably made herself something to eat earlier although there were no signs of it in the kitchen merrily switched on the grill to warm it up just in case then she went into the scullery sat down with a sigh and the first of the three books about the west case on the back it said how and why an evil psychopath was able to ensnare so many in a web of unseeing complicity horrific but there was no avoiding it any longer perhaps she should know everybody else in the county seemed to it was part of the underside of hereford history fred west still crouched like a spider in a corner of so many lives even gomers the videos hed mentioned the ones hed only heard of after the west murders had become public knowledge were snuff videos it was said that fred had rigged up cameras and shot videos of himself doing what hed done to girls and young women gomer had wondered if maybe roddy lodge had somehow got hold of a copy the phone rang merrily looked at it didnt feel like speaking to anyone else tonight and let it go on ringing until the machine picked it up this is ledwardine vicarage sorry were not around but please leave a message after the bleep bleep then bitch merrily put the book down it was muffled one of those tissuesoverthephone voices bitch if you do that funeral on friday youre gonna regret it you stay at home on friday you understand you bitch jane let herself in very quietly by the side door and padded up the stairs to the attic collapsing on her bed under the mondrian walls this was killing her and there was nobody to ring nobody at all she lay there numbed by this shattering hyperawareness listening to parts of the past clunking into place like the pieces of one of those really obvious wooden jigsaws aimed at very small children or the ratchets on some crude medieval engine of torture squeezing your brain dad poor dead dad why exactly did he go off with karen his secretary with whom hed died in a ball of blazing metal on the m jane remembered seeing karen a couple of times in dads office and she wasnt exactly to die for was she maybe a bit younger than mum but not as pretty so what exactly was there missing from his marriage that drove dad into karens arms karens bed and why had mum instead of working to save her marriage thrown herself into the arms of god consider it was a known fact that a huge percentage of male clergy were gay ok so maybe no figures had emerged on women priests yet but looking at pictures of some of them in the papers you could soon draw your own conclusions jane sat up opposite the bed the longest mondrian wall with its garish red and yellow and blue emulsion looked like a bad idea clumsily executed she wished she was lying on gareth boxs hearthrug in the red glow of the applelog fire please gareth show me im normal eventually she got ready for bed sleep no chance and what was she supposed to say tomorrow over the breakfast table what was she supposed to say the next time she saw lol or maybe he knew oh yeah it would certainly explain all that wouldnt it all that keepingupappearances shit mum and lol not being able to see one another very often it was never a question of the relationship going stagnant because it had never happened had it it was another lie jane began beating her forehead into the pillow lies lies lies lies lies part five the areas called the temporal lobes which are the most electrically unstable brain areas create a feeling called a sense of presence when they are irradiated by an electronic signal this is where a person has an overwhelming feeling that someone is in the room with them and they are being watched albert budden allergies and aliens the visitation experience an environmental health issue other murderers claim they are being visited by the spirits of the people they have murdered they see apparitions they hear voices with him it was bricks and mortar the changes in temperature and acoustics in remembered spaces hallucinating himself back to his house gordon burn happy like murderers frederick no diminutives for that man martin amis bbc radio wales ariconium the doors of roddy lodges garage were painted dark green somebody had been at one of them with chalk the message read put him down a cesspit where he belongs merrily pulled into the verge just short of the village and took off her dog collar no point in asking for confrontation on the street though she might put it back on before meeting the development committee at ten when she went into the post office and stores to buy some cigarettes and a paper the fat man behind the counter asked if she was a reporter pity he said we want all the publicity we can get we aint rolling over for this one no way london accent who did he mean by we she glanced at the paper rack the story hadnt made the front pages of the tabloids but she glimpsed the name fred west in a singlecolumn headline halfway down the daily telegraph she took the paper to the counter and said casually why are people so worked up about this man being buried here hes local isnt he whatever hes done so was melanie pullman the fat man explained and how would you feel a fiftyish woman in a yellow pvc jacket detached herself from a carousel of tights if your sister was lying under some cold field you didnt even know where and a man who called himself satan gets a christian burial birmingham accent this time how would yow feel no way the fat man said no way they should get him cremated on the quiet do what they like wiv the ashes long as nobody knows you got a situation where this place is finally getting on its feet at long last do we want connecting wiv a sicko no way you only got to look at this female priest the woman was looking at merrily without recognition we all know what thats about thats the woman who got herself made exorcist making a big thing out of it anything to make a name for yourself these days publicity mad merrily nodded so ive heard she folded up the telegraph on her way out she heard the man say exorcist whats that about then making sure he dont come back richard dump him somewhere else and it aint a bloody problem laughter put him down a cesspit shove the famehungry bimbo priest in after him bitch but these two were both incomers there had to be some sympathy for tony lodge and cherry among indigenous villagers must be people here whod known roddy for years drunk in the pubs with roddy been to school with roddy played on the hillside with him nursed him as a baby this poor kid with no mother in a house full of taciturn men the poor kid who turned into a murderer who tomorrow gets buried darkly quietly before his time you didnt have to be here long to understand why the undertakers wanted to switch dates merrily took the newspaper back to the car on the main street of underhowle exposed at last in fogfree rainfree daylight shed left the volvo where the road shuffled uphill by the primary school and the new village hall that had once been a barn the school was utility victorian gothic she hadnt even noticed it in the dark when shed walked up with bliss and the locals but now there were lights on inside and the windows were lurid with fingerpainting and the severity of the main building was mocked by the yellow panels of a mobile classroom in the yard it was coming up to ninefifteen there might just be time before the meeting with the development committee to check out the church and the lodge family graves lay him to rest before anyone sees bury him with dignity if you must but essentially with speed because oh god lols gig it was lols gig tomorrow night thered just be time to get home get changed get up to hereford she leaned against the car behind the school the village was crumbling down the hillside in all the dull multicolours of broken dog biscuits close to the centre was the rustybrown bell tower of the church and the green areas between graves on the outskirts the blue smokedglass roof lights of the computer factory fitted into the gap between two small housing estates one in pink brick one rendered a drab subcotswold ochre and bestriding all like the watchtowers of a concentration camp against the forest and the sky the lines of pylons one of them a killer why should anyone worry about a single stone marking the spot where roddys body lay when you had only to look up to see the massive instrument of his execution the real lodge memorial sculpted in grey steel it stood defiant gleeful as a guillotine but right now nobody else seemed to be looking up the initial trauma was over and the community was functioning again happening on the ground in the unforced way it never seemed to in perfect pickled ledwardine underhowle in motion vehicles drawing up and moving off from land rovers to a vintage american car with tail fins people slipping in and out of the few shops with shouts of greeting hands raised soft lights coming on in a unisex hairdressers called head office finally getting on its feet how many ways had she heard that expressed prospered more in the past five years than in the previous forty and they make it all sound so exciting for the future well good luck to them merrily got into the volvo opened out the paper on the passenger seat and found that the story was straightforward and more restrained than shed expected fred west link in border murder inquiry by eric birchall crime correspondent the selfconfessed serial killer roderick lodge who was electrocuted after climbing a pylon to escape from police had an obsession with the massmurderer fred west detectives said last night an extensive collection of news cuttings about the west killings has been found hidden at lodges herefordshire home along with what west mercia cid describes as substantial evidence that he saw fred west as a role model west hanged himself in his cell in while awaiting trial for the murder of twelve young women and girls many of whom were found buried in the cellar and garden of his house at cromwell street gloucester miles from lodges home in the village of underhowle near rossonwye lodges only confirmed victim lynsey davies a yearold mother of four was buried under one of the septic tanks he installed over a wide area of herefordshire gloucestershire and monmouthshire but police have not ruled out the possibility that he may have murdered at least two other women without bodies we cant establish how much of this was sick fantasy said det ch supt luke fleming who is leading the inquiry lodge operated over a very wide area using heavy plant equipment weve been able to trace many of his recent customers but its clear that not all of them were recorded in his accounts and wed like to talk to anyone who has employed him in the last five years or so i would stress that this man was a known fantasist with possible psychiatric problems and the last thing we want is to create any kind of unnecessary panic lynsey davies was lodges girlfriend and it is quite possible that what we are looking at is a oneoff domestic murder by an inadequate who liked to identify himself with the most notorious mass murderer of recent years who happened to have lived and committed his murders in a neighbouring area meanwhile a row has broken out in underhowle village where many residents are objecting to lodge being buried in the local churchyard they say his grave would become a sick tourist attraction especially if more bodies are unearthed the local rector the rev jerome banks has declined to conduct the funeral service the diocese of hereford said a priest from outside the area would be taking it over taking it over oh yes in the capable hands of the deliverance consultant what could possibly go wrong merrily leaned back in the driving seat wearily closing her eyes and glimpsing jane at her most sullen at the breakfast table this morning before leaving for school with hardly a word and merrily too droopy with insufficient sleep to make a thing of it a tapping on the window made her jerk back crumpling the daily telegraph against the wheel the face sideways at the glass was a long face with a wide mouth springy yellow hair fergus young head teacher and chair of the development committee merrily wound down the window tough night detective constable fergus young said what merrily noticed first was all the red computers pushing out everywhere like the heads of wild poppies she was wondering where shed seen one before and then realized roddy lodges office roddy lodge had one of these no surprise in that fergus young said in his deep easy voice most households in the village have one now not only small children use them but also elderly people whod never imagined they could operate a computer and yes people like roddy i suppose for the same reason he showed her into his office a little friendlier now his long bony features more relaxed when shed felt forced to reidentify herself hed closed up visibly pondering the earlier deception why had bliss had introduced her as a colleague fergus didnt get the joke and why should he but ok if she was already being widely condemned as some selfpublicizing clerical bimbo she was going to sit this one out very quietly there were two more computers in the headmasters high ceilinged office another red one and a more conventional model it was central governments declared aim fergus had told her to provide one computer for every secondary school student in britain the primary kids here had two each one at school one at home there was a knock on the door and a boy of about eight stuck his head round it would you and your visitor like some coffee fergus thanks barney i think we probably would and if you see chris and piers connorcrewe send them through would you mate the kid nodded vanished merrily raised an eyebrow first name terms it kind of phased itself in fergus motioned merrily to a green leather sofa under the window and settled himself on the arm at the other end he was wearing jeans and a yellow tracksuit top some of them were getting so enthusiastic i realized they were beginning to see us as friends and is that erm good for discipline fergus tossed his stallion head surprisingly so after a while you find that most of the actual disciplining of antisocial elements is handled by their peers theyre inclined to take a harder line with disruptive behaviour than the staff ever would disruptive behaviour being anything that gets between them and what theyre trying to achieve you mean between them and having fun well sure having fun is how they see it at first but by the time they get to nine or ten its serious i mean were not regarded as teachers were advisers enablers they want to know something were here to help them its simply a question of awakening that desire to learn and that usually happens before they start school if we put a computer into every home as soon as a child can walk then another child a bit older shows the youngster how to operate it and by the time theyre four they cant wait to get here to meet the people theyve already seen on screen blimey merrily said how do you afford it chris chris cody hes been very good starting us off which of course is paying off for him now in orders from all over the country word of mouth so far and ive got a book on the underhowle experience coming out next year so its likely to rocket ive also been on the scrounge part of a school directors job nowadays is to go out and involve the local community and then the wider community and also discover where the grants are it all sounds utopian and it did the school at ledwardine had just quietly closed because it was too small to survive there hadnt been much resistance ledwardine had an ageing population and it was starting to show look fergus said there are problems of course there are weve got a hell of a social mix here from families where a books something you use to balance the table legs to the offspring of downshifting highflyers who came here for the air quality sometimes im beating my head against a wall and saying why the hell did i start all this but i have to tell you there are far far more of those fistintheair moments his face burned with fervour it was difficult in here not to feel the heat of progress a community on the turn merrily wondered why she hadnt read about this anywhere possibly because underhowle was on the extreme fringe of the circulation areas of most of the local papers the hereford times the ross gazette the forester the way it was moving it would soon be national press and tv occasionally fergus said well get some sniffy education officer coming over from hereford trying to put a wire in the cogs if youve managed it without them they hate you but weve reached the stage where we dont need those pygmies five years ago they were ready to close the school down through lack of numbers now if they tried to mess with us we could go it alone and they know it look there fergus pointed at a tray full of letters held down by a classical statuette on a plinth i actually get applications now from people in the cities prepared to move here just to get their kids into this school i could probably fill it twice over but i dont want people like that i want a proportion of those kids whose own parents can barely read i want the mix except in the graveyard merrily said it just slipped out a pause fergus frowning then he grinned ok he stood up went over to his desk and switched on the red cody computer take a look at this there was a tap on the door yes come in it was the kid barney with a tray of coffee things and two men shouldnt barney be in class maybe the class system had become outdated here perfectly timed fergus said as if they hadnt met before he introduced merrily to chris cody the dark shavenheaded twentysomething whod made coffee for them at the village hall then he presented a bulky cheerfullooking older man in a baggy cream suit and this is piers the scholar and gentleman who gave us this they all turned to look at the computer which merrily noticed had booted up in less than half the time it took hers and janes kids liked instant fergus zapped an icon a blue sky shimmered a word formed out of white cloud hardening up slowly ariconium the screen began to cloud again around the word you heard about this merrily fergus asked and she had the sensation of being drawn into the screen and what it represented absorbed into this allpervading enthusiasm heard a bit about it its a roman town originally thought to be further down the valley but new finds apparently have indicated it was actually here buggerall to see on the ground unfortunately piers said although we think an excavation would be illuminating and one day not too far in the future were going to have the money for it might persuade the channel four time team lot to start us off thats how we usually work or fergus does the point about ariconium fergus said is that it was as wealthy and successful as unified as this areas ever been on the screen a picture of underhowle village had faded up an overview seen presumably from howle hill with most of the pylons below the eyeline there was a dull sky duller than todays but it began slowly to lighten and the random scree of underhowles architecture faded into a regular pattern of simpler buildings of stone and wood and a straight road along the valley merrily said this is a vision of the future youve got it mdear piers nodded beaming he had a football head a looselipped smile wealth growth out of iron in those days fergus said the silures the local iron age celtic tribe had it first you can still see the sites of old iron workings and of course the hill forts above here and on chase hill above ross and into the forest then the romans crushed the silures and ariconium arose on the back of the iron industry on the main road to glevum gloucester and monmouth in the west iron was smelted here big time piers said big business plenty of work fergus levelled a forefinger at the screen i want the next generation to identify with that not with twentiethcentury decay were building this website to chronicle the project chris cody said in his quiet cockney accent and the schools actively involved along wiv the development committee he bowed his head to the other two men in creating a visitor centre in the old baptist chapel therell be displays of the latest finds plus reconstructions models computer enhancements a menu had appeared fergus clicked on finds and the screen filled up with a section of what looked like mosaic floor were expecting confirmation of a lottery grant any day now and then well make a start building a tourist industry for the first time new life new blood more jobs theres a fantastic surge of energy going through this place which you must have been able to feel it certainly looked as if it was flowing through fergus he hit the mouse with the heel of a hand bringing up shards of pottery some coins then turned to merrily on the sofa all three of them standing over her now defying her to deny the energy yes she said i can see what youre trying to do its exciting yes it is piers connorcrewe said its bloody exciting however we had a taste at the weekend of a different kind of tourism fergus nodded grimly he clicked on an icon bringing up the ariconium homepage clicked again and then the screen went blank i was about to get to that when you guys arrived of course the point was that getting any kind of tourism here was a coup not only was underhowle not a pretty place but it had the misfortune to be surrounded by places that were riverside ross and symonds yat goodrich with its medieval castle westonunderpenyard with its hilltop norman church underhowle wasnt in the wye valley and it wasnt strictly speaking in the forest of dean there would be people over in ledwardine whod suggest underhowle should be grateful for whatever it could get theyve been coming down from gloucester fergus young said over from hereford up from south wales even unbelievable scores of them clogging the lane parking on all the verges standing there like the morons they are said piers connor crewe and just staring at the pylon or taking photographs of their ghastly children with it in the background some of them brought sandwiches can you believe that i mean have you seen todays papers piers turned to chris cody theyre linking lodge with west now west christ what was that one spawn of satan devils disciple chris was smiling sadly probably at the outdated excesses of the nonvirtual world in the sun or was it demon seed just doesnt go away does it piers said after all these years that loathsome little man is still a household name hes won his place in the black pantheon now the most famous murderer god forbid probably the most famous man to come out of herefordshire and now roddy lodge how many has roddy killed could be years before they find them all and the difference is that gloucester council was able to remove cromwell street they turned the site into a walkway so nobody can tell any more where the house was and as far as i know theres no physical memory of frederick west in much marcle either i believe they scattered his ashes in the churchyard there and that was it blown away gone about half the children at this school were watching when roddy lodge died fergus said listening to him screaming out all that filth weve talked about it with them weve analysed it weve had individual counselling where necessary so the children will forget of course they will if theyre allowed to we all realize were never going to get rid of the pylon but we can make sure the tourist trail ends there merrily i beg of you if you have any influence at all over the lodges persuade them to have him decently cremated and lets all try to forget he ever existed chris cody said i dont really have a personal angle on this but a few of our people down the factory are saying they got relatives in that churchyard and they dont like to fink of them lying in the same you know soil as roddy lodge its a point fergus young said would you want lodge buried side by side with members of your immediate family no its all right i know what youre obliged to say piers connorcrewe folded his arms but if it comes to the crunch the church itself can say no you obviously realize that but the bishop hasnt said no merrily told him i suspect he takes the line that if we were to refuse to bury sinners it might just contravene one of the basic tenets of christianity as well as leaving us with the problem of where exactly to draw the line you know connorcrewe looked pained i understand that but i think were and lets not forget that lodge hadnt actually been convicted of anything neither had west fergus said but that didnt prevent some forceful opposition in much marcle which i believe succeeded in fact i also think im right in saying lodge hadnt even been charged look connorcrewe said what youre dealing with here that is us is the polite form of protest i can assure you that some of the locals would be more inclined towards what we might call direct action as in what well if there is a grave it could well get vandalized fergus said and i have to tell you were not only talking about relatives im told there are friends of melanie pullman already making dark threats and it seems to me without laying it on too heavily that this is as good a reason as any to tell the lodge family it really cant be done all right merrily got to her feet shed faced hysteria shed faced tears and rage there was nothing worse than reason maybe they havent thought about the vandalism aspect ill put it to them but you have to understand theres family history here tony lodge feels an obligation to his father whereas we merely have an obligation to the future fergus young said you have voicemail the mobile told her when she switched it on merrily put the phone on the dash sitting for a while gazing through the windscreen at underhowle lateautumnal yet throbbing with the spring of its future education education education tony blair or somebody had once said when asked about new labours priorities for a new britain she wondered what it would be like to have underhowle as your parish a kindergarten rather than a retirement home couldnt see anything progressive in it for the church not shortterm anyway not with the narrow and cynical jerome banks in place its out then huw owens voice grated from the mailbank bliss selfseeking little bastard lass im coming over tonight dont go anywhere she flung her head back over the top of the seat where the headrest had come off bloody men with their bloody agendas she closed her eyes when she opened them another shadow had fallen across the side window im gonna take a chance on this sam hall said when she wearily wound it down i think you have to be merrily watkins empty heart it was all here from the norwegian castiron woodburning stove no glass therefore no friendly flames to watch to the two solar panels in the roof even the radio was clockwork but there was a small traditional stereo his one vice he said otherwise showpiece goodlife but how good was it really it was a dark room this big living area the windows were tripleglazed and small one of them in a wall insulated with several hundred tightly packed books offered a view down the hillside picking up a line of pylons the wrong view it seemed to merrily i know youre asking yourself why sam said why if i want to live like this dont i do it on some hebridean island or in the empty heart of wales i did wonder that but then i thought id come up with an answer which was because he needs to keep reminding himself of something you mustve been a great loss to the cops mrs watkins silent laughter in the dimness that goddam bliss couldve saved us all a heap of time and trouble if he hadnt tried to pass you off as a detective why did he come to talk to you again usual stuff he saw ingrid too what did we know about lodge did we know of any other girls roddy went out with any guys he hung around with i doubt if i was able to help him but you think you can help me maybe we can help each other sam got down on his knees opened up the stove and fed it a log that looked to have been sawn to size ok im gonna condense this id rather have derision any day than pity yeah youre right of course i lost my only kid to leukaemia in the states and yeah we lived directly under power lines and sure i became fanatical about the whole issue drank too much destroyed my marriage and now im back in england and im still angry and i figure this is still a small enough country to make an impact and yeah youre sorry for my loss thank you so thats all that dealt with how much did lol tell you he told me what youd said about hot spots and the symbolism of the plague cross and he said there was a spiritual side to it that he thought you werent inclined to discuss with him the spiritual side yeah i guess he and i caught more than a hint of all that the night roddy died when we met in ross lol had this other lady with him who i thought was gonna be you and it threw me when she turned out to be another singer so i kind of clammed up moira cairns merrily said neutrally i think i was supposed to have heard of her i guess i was away too long the spiritual side merrily prompted sure i tried to talk to the reverend banks one time but if youve ever had anything to do with that guy merrily nodded sam hall bulked out with an icelandic sweater waved her to a big overstuffed armchair and put himself into another hed untied his ponytail and salty hair framed his bearded face when i was a kid we lived for a while in the village my dad was a friend of old man lodge and i was a few years older than tony lodge and roddy was just a small kid when i left for the states so i knew the family well enough to recognize the changes when i came back what did you do out there oh i was a film cameraman for some years industrial nothing glamorous no movies then i got into some stills work for the underground press who paid peanuts in the early days though it improved when magazines like rolling stone took off and that got me into radical politics i was kind of an old hippy even when hippies were young which was fun i wound up in this commune with my wife on the edge of the nevada desert under power lines as it happened and then our daughter delawney got sick and died and it all got serious i guess i became a little crazy for a while paranoid became convinced the power industry had a contract out on me hell maybe they did those bastards when the wife walked out on me i decided it was time to make plans to come back to the green and pleasant land only to find the power industry had beaten you to it yeah and what was worse sam walked over to the window and looked down the valley the village had come out to meet the pylons they mustve been some distance away at first with only the baptist chapel and the old garage up close but then they built the council estate with some houses right under the damn cables nobody gave a shit in those days and of course some developers and local authorities still dont i was so mad when i saw that it ignited all the old rage and i thought this time this time im really gonna do something about it he turned around hell mrs watkins this wasnt gonna be about me i was gonna give you the science im not that good at science and i found out one thing about the british media you only get one chance they come and they do one serious story on you and after that you either succeed or you become a joke i became a joke very quickly the fool on the hill thats my sig tune by the time i had something worth saying nobody was hearing me and that was roddy lodge of course and melanie pullman fellow sufferers but it was melanie i was most concerned about maybe a mistake sufferers from what let me start at the beginning which isnt too long ago not quite three years just around the time my honeymoon with the media was coming to an end the day melanie pullman told me about the lights in the night gomer climbed down from the digger it was not yet lunchtime done lol was surprised it was already over and he could still walk in fact the ground frost the wintry friction in the air had put an edge on his senses at a quarter of the bloody efflapure price gomer said and no fancy dials to check now if you go up the house get her to flush every toilet they got upstairs downstairs en suite the lot wanner make sure its coming through proper see gomer beamed he knew it would on the way here hed talked about his mistake concerning lodge and the fire and how the vicar had helped him get that into perspective gomer seemed very relieved this morning like a jack russell unleashed walking up the leafmatted lawn past the gomer parry plant hire truck lol saw smoke coming from one of the chimneys of what was a nice old stone house built at a time when nothing heavier than a horse would be moving along whatever had predated the a through a front window as he passed he saw mrs pawson hunched close to a woodburner in the inglenook she rose quickly had the front door open before he reached it is it finished she looked pinched and starved gomer thinks so hed like you to flush all the loos could i help she hesitated all right a bit snappy the downstairs ones just there off the hall ill do upstairs he flushed the downstairs cloakroom toilet and went back outside to wait for her he noticed the front door had two new locks bigcity style when she came down she was wearing a thick green woollen jacket and still looked shivery he smiled it should be fine anyway gomer wont leave until its all perfect oh mrs pawson shook her head absently as if hed said something unnecessarily technical i just want it to be working thats all then i can get out of here for good what do you think she looked at lol as though she wouldnt expect someone like him really to understand look if you need me for anything im booked into the royal in ross for tonight to see estate agents then im going back to london mr parry has my address for the bill you feel personally unsettled by all this shed turned away as if to go back into the house she turned back what do you mean by that well hes dead and she it wasnt as if she was murdered here was what he meant mrs pawson looked away from him along the drive towards the road there was a morning paper in the hotel lounge which i was silly enough to pick up they now think he had a sick fascination with frederick west they dont know how many other women he killed and his neighbours dont want him to be buried at their church is it so hard to see why this house is blighted for me gomer had talked about west on the way here telling lol about what had been in the attaché case theyd dug up at the back of the bungalow mrs pawson looked at lol did you know lodge only by by sight he was a nightmare she said a nightmare person she was holding the lapels of her jacket together across her throat and so was the woman she was with him when mrs pawson didnt reply and started to walk away then but he sensed a very real distress that didnt seem to fit in with the kind of woman she was and afterwards he talked to gomer about this and gomer agreed sam reached over his shoulder and pulled a looseleaf binder from a shelf behind him im not gonna make you read this i just want you to know it exists its the report of a sixyear study out of bristol university linking power lines to a bunch of different cancers depression and an estimated sixty suicides a year i didnt know about the suicides merrily said but ive heard about the other health scares its estimated that the deaths caused by power lines equate with the number of fatalities on the road but as only one in fifty of the population lives under power lines that makes the risk fifty times as big were talking heavy shit here reverend and its no surprise that governments and the power industry try to rubbish it i understand that but but where do you come in im getting there lets look at whats more or less proven magnetic fields reduce the bodys production of melatonin which is manufactured by the pineal gland at night and regulates mood people living under power lines suffer insomnia sleep deprivation and because of the reduced melatonin levels people living under power lines are prone to depression sure youll find wonderfully cheerful fit characters who spent their whole lives under volts some folk produce more melatonin than others however those with a tendency to depression may find they become very depressed and those already very depressed may become suicidal and people suffering from manic depression may become more manic and more depressed loosely whatever you got theres a strong possibility that electromagnetism will intensify it and a certain number of people are gonna develop a chronic condition that we called electrohypersensitivity eh thats where the whole body becomes allergic to electricity so you see the risks from power lines are many and varied and more varied than any of us couldve imagined he replaced the looseleaf folder on the shelf placed his hands on his knees and looked down gathering his argument when i was living near the nevada desert in the eighties the alternative lifestyle was getting jaded too many bad drugs too much paranoia the spark had gone out around the time my daughter got sick one of the guys in the commune started rambling about saucers coming in the night landing in the desert humanoids in silver suits who came and took him out of his bed and messed him around ten years earlier wed have been like hey cool lets all light candles get out there and welcome the mothership man in the eighties however we were suspecting he might be a little crazy a lot of it about alienabduction stories sure those were paranoid times the reagan years was it aliens or was it the government so when did you hear about melanie pullmans experience merrily asked aha he leaned forward who told you about that her family called in my predecessor suspecting their house might be haunted we actually have files and youve seen the file yes she told him about the red or orange light bathing the bed melanies belief that she was taken away by grey creatures with big eyes like mirrors and subjected to an examination that ended with one of them having sexual intercourse with her which she seems to have found not entirely unpleasant good sam hall said i mean thats right thats what she told me when was this year or so after she saw the priest id guess she told me hed said some prayers and threw a little holy water around but that it didnt help much long term so it happened again twice not precisely the same but similar enough as makes no difference this was widely known around the village hell no nobody wants to be thought crazy no it came out when i ran into melanie one day leaving the doctors surgery ruck you know him asshole of the old school anyway the kid looked like shit and the point is i knew where she lived and id heard she hadnt been well she lived on the former council estate yeah but whereabouts right in the arc of the turning circle at the end of goodrich close is where the damn pylon next one along to the one where roddy lodge died is almost in the back garden the lines are directly overhead plus youre in line with the tv booster across the valley and i wont go on but this is close to the centre of the hot spot defined by lodges garage and the old baptist chapel so you think merrily was getting an idea of where this was going she remembered canon dobbss conclusion that melanie pullman had undergone a genuine hallucinatory or dream experience had not been making it up you think that the effects of for instance sleep loss caused by electromagnetism might have been causing her to hallucinate like your friend under the power lines in the nevada desert which at the time we attributed to far too many drugs over the years but let me say first of all this is not only me theres been considerable research ok fringe research but thats how it usually starts which demonstrates a correlation between both alienvisitation experiences and some plain old fashioned hauntings and the presence of highvoltage overhead lines usually in conjunction with other radiation from tv transmitters mobilephone masts substations i could find you scores of examples well sure but how is it explained the effect of electromagnetic fields on the brain on specific areas of the brain irradiation of the temporal lobes for instance can promote a sensation of what you might call presence of not being alone stimulation of the septum area of the brain can produce intense sexual sensations which explains except that in melanies case there was also if i recall a vaginal infection mrs watkins sam spread his hands i wouldnt claim to be any kind of authority on womens clinical conditions however the growth on the body of various fungal bacteria of the candida type can i assure you be accelerated by exposure to a significant degree of electromagnetism you are free to check this out with whatever scientific or medical sources you may have access to can i have a cigarette depends what kind of lighter you have no im kidding help yourself if tobacco was all we had to worry about id be a happier man look mrs watkins this kind of stuff is not helpful to me or my cause which is why ive never made an issue of it tell the great british public they could be in for leukaemia or a brain tumour and youve got their full attention warn them of possible encounters with alien beings or a ghost in the bedroom they heave a big sigh of relief say phew so it cant be true about the cancer either believe me i do not need this shit i beg your pardon if that seems to be demeaning your profession it wasnt intended that way dont worry about it what happened with melanie she worked at a chemists in ross and i met her for lunch one day and it all came out for instance for some time shed been finding it impossible to watch tv and was going up to her room which made it worse of course her room was at the rear of the house backing onto the pylon wires zooming immediately overhead she couldnt sleep and you know the rest also by this time she was becoming allergic to her place of work all those huge bright lights in the drugstore i advised her to start looking for another job someplace darker at least and was she involved with roddy lodge at this time shed been with roddy bout a year see this was before roddys big change he hadnt been long in his own place and i imagine she was his first real girlfriend it was a case of like attracting like although he was maybe ten years older than she was theyd both had experiences they couldnt explain stuff they couldnt even discuss with most other people it mustve been kind of a relief to both of them when they found out they werent alone roddy being under the same power lines well lets not forget hed been around power lines all his life got some big ones going over the farm but when he moved he was right in the heart of the hot spot whatever was happening to him before mustve been intensified hugely once he was in that bungalow did they know this had they put two and two together i dont believe they had people often dont roddy for instance was convinced there was something wrong with his eyes took to wearing dark glasses and working at night when he could and im sure that relieved the symptoms to an extent no i told melanie what i knew and referred her to an alternative practitioner in hereford who wasnt as blind to all this as the medical profession seems to be i dont think she managed to persuade roddy to go too because things were becoming complicated by then am i making the remotest kind of sense to you mrs watkins i rather think you are youre making connections too many anything you want confirmation of i have whole shelves of reports i just want to think about this how much have you told bliss hell none of it guys a cop hes gonna believe lodges behaviour was conditioned by electromagnetic radiation does he care he just wants to know where the other bodies are buried and were you able to help him on that no sam stood up and walked back to the window with the view down howle hill towards the pylons and underhowle do i think melanie pullmans dead maybe but maybe not there was every reason for her just to get the hell out of here and not look back see she was coming to see me quite often those last few months reporting her progress shed taken a vacation with some relations up in shropshire well away from power lines done some walking up there cut out the valium of course when she came back home she switched bedrooms to a smaller room at the front of the house not directly under the cables gave in her notice at the drugstore she was feeling a little better even just knowing about it makes you feel a different person but electroallergy goes deep it takes a long time to get it out of your system if youre lucky enough to be able to do that totally theres good reason to think she just upped and left underhowle knowing there was no future for her healthwise in this place leaving all her possessions all her clothes maybe she went someplace else and felt so good she just didnt come back maybe she met somebody people do this kind of thing with far less reason than she had what about roddy i think she tried to help him i really do i just dont think he wanted to know besides he had a new girlfriend by then he had lynsey and he was changing boy was he changing would you mind if i told bliss about this he shrugged long as theres no comeback on me i think i can guarantee that merrily stood up so thats what you meant when you told lol about a spiritual aspect to all this uh sam turned his back on the view plucked at his icelandic sweater i guess i still hope it is im not sure i have a friend you met ingrid sollars at the hall sure you did well ingrid and i are very close friends but we dont always agree and theres stuff happening here sam shook his head i dunno what stuff could i go fetch ingrid merrily looked at her watch i have to go and see cherry lodge and then ive got to get back for someone can i call you tonight maybe sure sam followed her to the door this has become a weird place mrs watkins and more than a little sick parked outside the lodge farm merrily called bliss from the car and left a message on his voicemail cherry lodge in her army parka was coming round the side of the house carrying a paper sack of mixed corn been and seen them have you reverend she put down the corn sack freed from fog the farmhouse behind her looked less stable with rubblestone showing through holes in the rendering less fortified ill come straight to the point merrily said has anybody threatened you cherry lodge managed a tired smile merrily decided not to tell her about her own anonymous caller just i was told that people friends of melanie pullman had threatened to damage roddys grave if if there was one theres brave of them cherry pulled the sack of corn up against the wall do you want a cup of tea no thanks ive got to get back erm the other argument is that itll be an unpleasant sort of attraction to the wrong kind of tourists but the committee said that to you didnt they the wrong kind of tourists oh yes we had that cherry in your email you said how much roddy had changed when he went to live on his own you said hed become more confident did he change in any other way i mean for instance he went around all the time in dark glasses people saying he was a bit of a poser but could there have been another reason for instance sam hall thinks sam thinks a lot of things and some of them sound sensible and some sound like rubbish and i dont think he knows the difference what does it matter now roddy killed a woman only one woman as far as we know despite all this west rubbish and then he killed himself and if he was going to kill a woman and dont go quoting me then he couldnt have chosen a better one slut golddigger she kept coming back hed try and get away from her go out with other women but she kept coming back maybe god forbid he couldnt get rid of her any other way look merrily said ill have to ask you one more time because i dont really know how deep the feelings are down there but you do still want to go ahead with burial you wont opt for cremation perhaps a plaque in the church mrs watkins cherrys face wore bse and footand mouth and stupid eu regulations in layers of driedout anxiety what did she care about petty village vigilantes with a manufactured crisis if anyone vandalizes the grave its up to the police to deal with it anyone threatens us well deal with it and youre happy about tomorrow rather than friday were not happy about any of it cherry lodge said but if its what we have to do to keep it quiet its what well do what about flowers and things you got all that arranged flowers for roddy i dont think so merrily nodded you know my number dont take too much notice of sam cherry said and dont try and find excuses for roddy its not worth it now dont you want to know the truth i dont think we ever will know perhaps some of its beyond knowing you mean the ghosts the dead women i wont talk about that again it needed to be said thats all it was hanging over me hanging over the family and never talked about i just thought that now hes gone someone outside should know just to take it off us merrily nodded there was more than one level of exorcism but she no longer thought it was beyond knowing when she was on the a the other side of ross the mobile bleeped and she pulled the volvo into the kerb it was bliss and she told him what she wanted eh record of interview person interviewed roderick lodge place of interview hereford hq time commenced am time concluded am duration of interview mins tape reference no hhq interviewing officers di bliss ds mumford other persons present none merrily had phoned frannie bliss to ask if he had a copy of the actual tapes but transcripts was the best he could do hed arrived at the vicarage as the day was fading in hiking jacket jeans and a terrible mood this better be worth it thats all coming as it does on a day i just want to be over caffeine intravenous if you have it please merrily he hooked out a dining chair with his foot collapsed into it ive only seen the telegraph so far she said how i wish i could say the flamin same she poured coffee for him and sat down opposite shed changed into jeans and a black cowlneck sweater i thought you wanted it to come out about west not like this screwing up his eyes as if hed been hit in the face when i had some evidence when i could go in and say right dig there lads i agreed it was the best thing to sit on it meanwhile not to panic parents husbands what had happened was that bliss had asked andy mumford to keep his ear to the ground and one of andy mumfords contacts in much marcle birthplace of fred west had told him that roddy lodge had been seen there a couple of months ago with a woman answering lynseys description mumford had gone over there in his own time and talked to a few people testing out an idea of blisss that lodge might have disposed of a body in the area of freds old burial ground some kind of homage it was one of the blokes mumford talked to in the pub whod gone to the press hed had some money in the past for background stuff on the west family in these difficult times farmers are encouraged to diversify well i couldnt let andy take the shit for that had to phone fleming tell him it was me behind it honourable of you yeh what the japanese call the honourable way out and how did fleming react dunno merrily i was on the mobile and the signal was weak you know you got cut off question of postponing the inevitable im stuffed anyway bliss tapped the interview forms whats this about she got up and brought over the lamp from the window ledge you probably wont like it now you tell me you remember you once asked me if there could be a spiritual aspect bliss said i now know all about wests claims that he was involved with a black magic sect supplying them with virgins that was investigated normally youd treat that kind of crap with a big pinch of salt but this was a guy for whom no muck heap was too smelly compared with some of the things fred did to women black magic was cucumber sarnies on the terrace i may disagree there but thats not what i meant i think you said you talked to his gp dr ruck didnt speak to him meself but i gather he wasnt the kind to come the old patientconfidentiality he thought roddy was neurotic possibly depressive and prone to hypochondria what forever coming to him with headaches and various pains that kind of thing maybe the sort of symptoms he was exhibiting in the interview room what is this merrily she was skimming through the first transcript an interview laid out like a radio play di bliss roddy a dead woman now identified as lynsey davies was found in a truck registered to you and being driven by you how do you explain this defendant what you saying di bliss its a simple question roddy why was lynsey daviess body on your truck a body that was decaying having been in the ground for some time def she was cold down there look di bliss i see def told me she was cold so i went and fetched her out di bliss how do you mean she told you roddy def she come to me di bliss im sorry def come to me in the night look they comes to me in the night and im cold too hard and cold bliss hang on let me get this right youre saying this was after she was dead no for the tape please roddy dont just nod or shake your head you mean after she was dead def yes di bliss after you killed her def trying to trap me now aint you copper di bliss im being absolutely straight with you roddy you were found with the dead body of lynsey davies somebody killed her and as you seem to have buried her and dug her up again you will agree that its reasonable to suppose you also had something to do with her death how well did you know lynsey davies def her said i was satan give it her hard and cold like satan di bliss was lynsey davies your girlfriend def i aint feeling good got a headache di bliss can i get you a glass of water def got a headache cant think proper di bliss roddy youve seen a doctor and hes pronounced you well enough to be interviewed def cant think its bloody shitty in here di bliss this is not productive roddy i asked you if you wanted a solicitor and you said no giving me the strong impression you were prepared to answer my questions now why arent you doing that roddy whats up with you son def cant think in here im sure you said that once or twice he appeared to black out to faint merrily said he put his head down on the table yes he gave the appearance of having lost consciousness he gave the appearance of it frannie if this was the same interview room you took me into it was below ground level and lit by a fluorescent tube it had electric airconditioning it had a tape machine also a video camera an awful lot of electricity for a very small room even i found it unhealthy in there well you know bliss said wed naturally prefer to chat to prisoners in the police conservatory to a background of gentle fountains and aromatherapy candles but the uncouth ruffians are apt to throw up break things and wee on the walls humour me some more francis how would the interview room compare to say roddys cell which i think he kept asking to be taken back to how much power was there in the cell just the one ceiling light but you ever heard of eh frannie she rose up and dont tell me its a hospital show on channel four no i havent heard of it electrical hypersensitivity an allergy affecting people surrounded by electronic gadgetry or living in close proximity to highvoltage power lines and a confluence of transmitted signals such as from mobilephone masts tv transmitters satellite merrily probably only a very small percentage of people are affected to any marked degree but in some cases were talking about a serious chronic condition you might find for instance if you looked into it that roddy lodge was unusually sensitive to electric light and wore sunglasses even at nighttime you might find he was unable to wear nylon overalls because of the static or whatever and we already know about his mood swings miserable and withdrawn and then im number one im satan im the best drainage man in the known universe the biggest serial killer bliss smiled so this is your personal diagnosis roddy was suffering from a condition that appears to have gone entirely undetected by various doctors and psychiatrists but may be identified by priests merrily sighed i realize its something not universally accepted now tell me something i hadnt already surmised bliss leaned back locking his fingers behind his head like what other bullshit mr sam hall filled you up with jane put her head around the door then merrily hadnt heard her come in from school a long talk was way overdue hello flower you want some coffee no thanks sorry didnt know you were busy you can come in if you want jane bliss said this is nothing id be terribly afraid of a little child hearing its ok jane said with worldweary indifference i try not to be seen hanging out with the filth people might think im a snout her head vanished and they heard her going upstairs i love that kid bliss said shes just like you only more so thanks look dont get me wrong i even quite like mr hall the old shitstirrer and i think his intentions are good i even think theres probably a lot to what he says about the profusion of overhead power lines arguably causing ill health i just think that kind of wild speculation at this stage of the game about a man who isnt ever gonna be able to confirm it is a totally pointless exercise it does explain a lot of things though doesnt it it might even make sense to mr nye the lawyer who was convinced his client was in poor health so tell him im sure hed absolutely love to spend an hour or so at no fee whatsoever discussing his dead clients medical mythology it also explains why roddy blacked out which is commonplace apparently who says frannie look i had already heard of this but its something halls been researching for years here and in america i find it convincing or at least worth investigating but thats neither here nor there im not out to try to prove or disprove it im just saying it answers very plausibly a lot of questions no it doesnt merrily it just and it also explains why roddy lodge confessed to every putative murder you could lay on him aw come on eh is an acute condition it can apparently become entirely unbearable hed have confessed to strangling his own granny to get out of that interview room whose side are you on at all hed offer to show you as many bodies as you wanted just to get you to take him out of there all the people he hadnt murdered all right bliss finished off his coffee and laid down the mug lets look at this he wanted us to take him out of the horrible electronically charged interview room back to his nice country home under the big pylon which he then proceeded to climb he gave her a big smile go on you take it from there merrily didnt say anything shed put the same point to sam hall hed said that in his experience no two cases of eh were exactly the same he said allergics were often mysteriously drawn to the allergen in its most obvious form he said a certain frequency of the electromagnetic field might prove particularly addictive to a particular person he said this all needed much more research but it was one explanation of why roddy had climbed that pylon just like hed done repeatedly as a boy did you know that melanie pullman was a fellow sufferer blisss eyes narrowed with side effects you interested go on he said she told him about the side effects she brought out the transcript of canon dobbss report bliss read it slowly he looked up and didnt smile this is getting very silly merrily even by your standards now we learn she was taken by aliens could even be the same aliens that strangled lynsey and buried her under the tank she carried on in the face of it all i also gather roddy lodge had been having inexplicable experiences for most of his life and that his condition worsened when he moved to the bungalow where electromagnetic radiation levels were far stronger it seems likely their relationship him and melanie grew out of mutual support frannie bliss gritted his teeth making a hissing noise so they were both bonkers what does that tell us does it explain why he might have killed her youre sorry you got me into this now arent you i just dont understand why you suddenly care so much he said because im burying him and too many funerals today are superficial and meaningless and dont manage to lay anything to rest we talk to relatives and we gather up a handful of anecdotes about the deceased and reel them off then its on with the soil and bring on the next one i just think we owe it to them to try to understand what their lives were about god didnt that sound pompous in the dregs of the daylight she saw a shadow shambling past the big kitchen window not many people came round the back not even lol this was someone who liked to move softly like gods secret agent someone who even used spytype euphemisms for the negative numina of his trade volatiles insomniacs hitchhikers bliss had his back to the window and hadnt seen the shadow she stood up so how are things at home frannie crap thank you bliss said huws here owen he stood up quickly shit is there another door out of here sackcloth shed never seen huw like this before he was white with anger and he was wagging a forefinger under frannie blisss nose always feet first bloody great coppers boots no matter how long youre in the cid you never lose them coppers boots the finger trembling in the lamplight huw bliss was out of his chair again and they were nearly headtohead across the table its my career going down the bloody toilet pal not the most wellchosen response all things considered oh aye huws expression was not priestly never a thought for the parents of all them dead and missing girls lying awake night after bloody night wondering precisely what were done to their kids and how many times waking up in the dark heads full of cellars and concrete dreams full of blood and filth and sobbing and wondering how long it went on before they died how much of it they took before they wound up naked and dead under some some bloody septic tank for starters bliss said through his teeth lynsey davies wasnt in fact found naked you wanted a national scare big highprofile case to play with but not now for christs sake will you just let me will you both for gods sake shut up merrily said quietly youre scaring the cat she came and sat down at the far end of the long table away from both of them and me aye huw said looking at her at last as if realizing where he was im sorry and she was shocked at the sight of him at how much someone could change in six months or so he was wearing his clerical shirt the dog collar parchmented with age under a patched tweed jacket the effect was decrepit rather than casual his long hair was dry and salted with dandruff and there were lines she didnt remember down each cheek deep as sewnup knife wounds he was breathing hard papers came same day for once west west west they all want him to be another west and what do you want frannie blisss face was maroon under the freckles we let it lie we let the missing stay missing the bodies stay buried huw had shut his eyes was digging his knuckles into the table top he stayed like that for several seconds before breathing out and opening his eyes pulling out a rueful smile like an old handkerchief hello lass hello huw that woman huw said to bliss as if the last few minutes had somehow been wiped lynsey were there any bits of her missing bits bliss sat down again bones fingers toes like fred did to them aye what are you talking about merrily said all of the west victims bliss told her had several bones missing mostly fingers and toes but sometimes shoulder bones like he was keeping souvenirs another of the reasons the gloucester coppers suspected occult belief huw said a sense of ritual about it always took the same bones ive been reading as fast as i can merrily said i just havent got to this bit came to a lot of bones well over a hundred none of them have ever been found bliss turned to huw no roddy didnt go that far not with lynsey but then she wasnt your regular victim was she there were no regular victims wi west huws voice was as flat as hardboard again mostly they just ended up dead because there was nowhere else for them to go merrily winced what i mean is frannie bliss said roddy probably killed lynsey because she found out about him what hed been up to not just as a result of getting his rocks off west killed his own daughter heather because she said she were leaving the happy home huw said lost patience with her he turned to merrily do you remember donna furlowe no who was she huw mopped up some spilled coffee with his sleeve possibly to hide the fact that he wasnt replying what the hell was the matter with him ill leave you to explain huw bliss said and then merrily can tell you about this wonderful pseudoscientific theory which argues that far from being a psychotic serial killer lodge was actually a victim of his environment should comfort a lot of people huw looked up at merrily that old wolfhound look im going home now bliss said to try and get used to spending more time with me family who hate me nearly as much as me colleagues merrily had put the lamp back on the window sill it was all a little mellower in the room now huw was drinking tea dunking chocolate digestive biscuits in it his voice was softer a twentyfirstcentury plague village eh would it worry you to live there actually merrily said i was only thinking earlier how much more exciting underhowle was more progressive more alive than ledwardine but i suppose everything has its drawbacks i mean you can go on telling yourself its all overheated rubbish but every time somebody dies prematurely after living for five years under highvoltage power lines you immediately forget about all the people who spent half a lifetime underneath and made it to ninetysix and the apparitions the hallucinations the little grey men with big eyes used to be that electrical gadgets were affected by aliens now theyre saying electricity creates the aliens i can buy it huw said i can also accept that electrical stimulation of the temporal lobes whether its by a roomful of computers or whatever simulates the sense of presence you get in a haunted house but its not the whole story its just another one of the rational explanations we have to be aware of another mine in the minefield merrily sat back relieved she might have guessed hed know about it all he subscribed to dozens of scientific and esoteric journals his library filled four rooms of his rectory superficially its a fastchanging world merrily he brushed crumbs from his shirtfront your fellers right were surrounding ourselves wi transmitters and receivers weve got cctv in every town centre scores of technoindustries competing to sell us bits of tat that do some meaningless trick the only point of which is that the last bit of tat couldnt do it and nobody really wants to tell us what its all doing to our brains else thats another industry gone to the wall oh aye im perfectly willing to believe that a certain configuration of signals and electromagnetic fields in a small area is likely to set up a what was it hot spot however once you start spreading these stories the centuries drop away and you get into an essentially medieval situation were every bit as impressionable as folk were then this gets around therell be five times as many people think theyve got a brain tumour when its only a headache five times as many kids who think theyve got company at night when its only a bad dream or headlights on the window pane and if the rectors as unapproachable as you say who else do they go to with their fears so why she hesitated why have you come huw he dunked his biscuit merrily if you think i know what im doing youre wrong if you think im a balanced laidback old bugger wi a steady finger on the pulse youre wrong again you dont know owt about me really so tell me bag of nerves bubbling cauldron of hatred and regrets oh aye i reckon ive had a hatred of god sometimes as strong as anybody alive and donna furlowe merrily said who is she silence you remembered the name huw said only from when you said it earlier who is she she isnt huw said any more and jane listening at the door crept away thrown by that sentence i reckon ive had a hatred of god sometimes as strong as anybody alive the things the clergy said sometimes usually only to other clergy she didnt know huw owen very well suspected nobody did really shed still been a kid when mum had first met him last year oh yeah still a kid last year she understood that now jane went up to her apartment and sat on the bed probably mum would be shouting up for her soon flower im really sorry about this but how would feel about going to the chippy always chips these days since shed got bogged down with this thing at underhowle and now huw owen was involved which meant it was serious something huw didnt think a woman could handle because he was from yorkshire and sometimes he hated god and when yorkshiremen said hated there were no two ways about it if god existed it must be rough to have nobody who really liked you nobody who actually trusted you not to shaft them in the end jane looked up at the ceiling and she began to giggle with sheer sour despair you poor allpowerful sad git i knew her mother you see huw said merrily sat down huw was looking down at his fingers on the table hed pushed his mug away and then the biscuits her mother lived in brecon julia a white settler in mid wales she were everything i didnt like welloff widow of a bloke who ran a company that did up old country properties and flogged em off to folk like themselves rich and rootless desirous of a slice of countryside a view they could own julia had a lovely farmhouse down towards bwlch and she worshipped at brecon cathedral merrily suspected huw was a socialist of the old forgotten kind his contempt for the former bishop of hereford mick hunter and hunters new labour friends was memorable he leaned back the lamplight made his skin look like sacking i went into the cathedral one afternoon august thisd be funny really i hadnt intended to go in at all i were going for groceries at kwiksave only the payanddisplay were full height of summer hordes of tourists i werent up for carrying a bloody great box about half a mile so i decided to come back later parked up by the cathedral popped in the way you do or in my case the way you dont not often and there was this woman near the back very quietly in tears he looked across at merrily some of em they make a big deal out of it you know that they want a sympathetic priest to come over there there whats the problem this one was quite the opposite private tears you wouldnt notice unless you were a bloke on his own thinking what the bloody hell have i come in here for it was true a cathedral was the last place youd expect to find huw he might run into a bishop i left her alone how she wanted it you could tell stayed well away said nowt walked out merrily was picturing brecon cathedral dusky pink stone on the shaded edge of town near what was left of the castle unlike most cathedrals it was a very quiet place usually anyroad i sat on the grass outside very warm day birdsong very near fell asleep didnt notice her until she were coming past not looking at me like i were some owd vagrant i opened me eyes and before i could think about it i just said tell me to sod off lass if you like merrily was shaking her head who could resist that one it was no big surprise to learn that about fifteen minutes later huw and julia furlowe had been having afternoon tea together in a café in the watton her daughter was missing this was it her only child donna had just finished her final year at christ college brecon and was due to go up to oxford in october meanwhile shed had a summer holiday job at a country hotel in the cotswolds up near stroud although this was over two hours from home and donna had to stay there it was a good arrangement because the proprietors of the hotel were family friends who would keep an eye on her she was eighteen but to be honest her mother admitted in some ways immature and now she was missing shed gone shopping in cheltenham getting a lift with the cook arranging to meet him at a car park at fourthirty pm but when the cook came to collect his car ten minutes later than arranged she wasnt there when she didnt show up after an hour the cook called the hotel to find out if shed made her own way back when nobody had heard from her by nine that night they first called julia and then they called the police three weeks now and nothing no sightings well cheltenham in august what could you expect besides missing eighteenyearold girls it wasnt all that unusual not in the summertime try not to worry too much they said but julia knew that something must have happened they were close she and donna always had been especially since tim had died so suddenly never any suspicion that there was anything wrong with his heart hed still been playing rugby at fortyeight couldnt donna have fallen in love whirlwind holiday romance gone off with him the way young girls did absolutely out of the question was it possible donna might have been unhappy about going to oxford felt unable to confide this to her mother no no no how could she be so sure because they were close truly truly close the brecon and radnor express had carried the story huw must have missed it julia furlowe went to the cathedral every day to pray huw wouldnt have known hadnt been near the place in weeks middle of the following week hed driven julia down to stroud and cheltenham and theyd done the rounds with colour photographs have you seen this girl you wouldnt forget if you had lovely girl soft ashblonde hair like her mother julia furlowe fortynine a widow for six years one daughter missing a softspoken southerner exiled in wales alone now in a luxury farmhouse with a view down the usk where she painted local views in watercolour and gouache very accomplished and sold them in the local craft shops and i held back huw said as you would in a situation like that held back a long time longer than she were inclined to separate rooms the first three trips by the fourth it seemed ridiculous wed prayed together every night always went to the nearest church and prayed together knelt together and prayed to god for donna to be all right merrily met huws eyes his face was pale and roughened in the feeble light sackcloth and ashes we never lived together id spend a couple of nights at her place at bwlch either side of sunday what a strange bloody time that were love and sadness love and anxiety love and stress love and desperation we used to tell each other how it would be when donna turned up happen wi a babby julia were ready for that that wouldve been just fine i used to think i wonder what shes like when shes really smiling smiling from the heart without reservation they spent christmas together christmas the first christmas thered been no donna christmas morning julia came to huws church up in the beacons the locals knew by now knew who she was but said nowt a farmers wife said she was glad for them glad for huw a minister up here all alone it had never seemed right julia had cried a lot that night the next day she started a painting of the snow on pen yfan and then abandoned it saying she had to get home what if donna had come back what if she was coming back for new year donna always loved new year more than christmas as shed got older donna didnt come back for new year it was sometime towards the end of february when huw went over to julias place picking up her paper as usual at the shop in bwlch tossing it down on the long coffee table in the vast stone sitting room and julia had glanced at it and then picked it up and hed never forget this as long as he bloody lived julia had held the paper at arms length feeling in the pocket of her denim frock for her reading glasses and shed said almost vaguely shed said thats fred a long moment because huw had read the story by then and thought nothing of it except his usual tired disgust and julia hadnt the faintest idea what it was about shed just seen the picture some nights even now huw would lie in bed hearing her voice on the northeast wind from penyfan thats fred thats fred thats fred hed worked a couple of times for her husband huw said years before before theyd come to wales when donna was a little girl when they were living at highnam near gloucester you never forgot fred such a cheerful little man and a hell of a good worker nowt he wouldnt turn his hand to fred and always a smile for you always a smile for a lady and a big grin for little donna huws eyes were like glass oh dear god merrily said that were early days the first bodies had been found at cromwell street freds daughter heather and two other girls shirley and alison within a week or so hes confessed to nine more murders and the whole bloody nations agog by april theyre exploring two fields on the border of much marcle and kempley digging up his first wife rena two months later ann mcfall in fingerpost field you went to the police oh aye like the relatives of every other missing girl within a hundred miles of gloucester and when it come out that fred had worked for tim furlowe that he knew tims family see all these girls they werent random kidnaps he knew em all before even lucy partington the undergraduate who seemed like a random snatch off the street theres evidence he knew her slightly way back its me dont you recognize me worked for your dad but if donna was just a child the feeling was it happened the other way round donna bumps into him in the street in cheltenham he was always in cheltenham well not a face you ever forgot west do anything for you a soundtrack was playing in merrilys head traffic and the bustle and chatter of a summer pavement and oh gosh its fred i bet you dont remember me donna furlowe course i do donna well well well give you a lift somewhere the ole vans just round the corner huw leaned his head forwards digging his fingers into the skin of his forehead when he looked up there were red marks that was when the police asked me if i knew of any satanic groups i didnt so i went round all the local deliverance priests took some leave from the parish stayed in gloucester for over a month me and julia no more bodies but they always expected to find more but i think it was lucy partington did it for julia not like the others an intelligent cultured girl found in cromwell street with tape around the skull bits of rope evidence of you dont want to hear this lass i dont want to tell you she was martin amiss cousin wasnt she the novelist aye cultured lass artistic sensitive so the cops are saying now to west what about donna furlowe where did you bury donna furlowe he denies it he always denied it just like he denied murdering ann mcfall buried her but he didnt kill her he loved her she was his angel just let him bloody find out who killed her thats all he lied you see merrily he lied all along and all the time im saying to julia its coincidence coincidence thats all lets go home she wouldnt i wouldnt either if it had been merrily swallowed she found she was holding a hand to the neck of her black woollen jumper she wanted to get up and make more tea but she couldnt move we did leave in the end huw said we had to i had to go back to the parish and the deliverance courses were about to get started but it were never the same after that id go over to bwlch every other day stay the odd night shed keep saying i cant settle shep i cant settle always called me shep said i reminded her of a border collie always ready always on watch yes another christmas a couple of dozen halffinished paintings then a week later new years day fred west awaiting trial for a dozen murders constructed a rope out of shirts always a practical man and hanged himself in his cell at winson green having told his carer hed killed a lot more girls as many as twenty more girls no names it were summer again before we knew it this was when julia told me about the medium in brecon id asked her to marry me by then she said lets leave it a year see how things are and that shed been to a bloody medium its understandable kind of situation that sends most people to mediums i know that lass and all i could do was beg her not to you know the shite that comes through at these bloody sessions not to be trusted mediums not ever we had a row i didnt see her for a week i went back crawling beginning of august and stayed the night and when we got up the next morning there was a call from a copper in gloucester to say theyd found a female body butchered in field near lydbrook in the forest of dean merrily tried to say something couldnt she hadnt known hadnt recognized the name we saw some of the clothes she were still wearing clothes but there were thick brown parceltape round the lower part of the skull huw and bones missing finger bones and foot bones merrilys nails pierced her palms see wed read it all by then hundreds of pages already in the papers books being written rose coming up for trial on ten murder charges she mustve known oh aye we all knew by then exactly what fred west did to his victims him and rose we knew all the details fred abusing his children and watching rose with other men through a hole in the door taking in girls at first who were up for it they thought but not the things fred and rose did nobody were up for that then girls who werent up for it fred and rose getting off on the fear and she heard him at frannie bliss across the table cellars and concrete dreams full of blood and filth and sobbing can i tell you what it were like for julia then merrily can i start to tell you no need course not she started painting again within days painting donna from photographs but very pale paintings you could see the white paper through like she was trying to clean off the childs body i tried to get her to come to the cathedral she wouldnt but she was still going to the medium what could i say about that i couldnt bring her comfort the church couldnt do owt huw was feeling in an inside pocket of his tweed jacket bringing out what looked like an old tobacco pouch of yellow plastic he unwrapped it and took out a small piece of folded paper thick paper quality notepaper he unfolded it and passed it across the table to merrily she took it to the lamp ill keep it short shep im so so sorry about this but i do believe there is somewhere else you showed me that and that donna needs me there now she so needs someone to comfort her i feel this very strongly im so very sorry because i love you so much shep you know i do and its only thinking of you and sensing your arms around me thats going to give me the last bit of strength i need for this so please dont take your arms away and please please forgive me and please go on praying for us im so sorry merrily stood there by the lamp holding the paper feeling its texture the weight of it paper made to last she was thinking of all those times shed wondered if there had ever been a woman in huws life when he started to speak again she couldnt look at him it were me found her i think that was what she wanted thought i were strong owd shep seen it all shed left the farmhouse doors unlocked lovely balmy summers evening and an overdose of sleeping tablets huw i blinking back the tears that wouldnt help god his voice was down on the flagstones i went into me own church that night and screamed obscenities at god for the best part of an hour close as ive ever been to chucking it in they say it makes your faith stronger in the end and happen theyre right but you cant possibly know that at the time its not a time when faith makes any kind of bloody sense no she had to put the paper down wondering if hed brought it tonight specially to show her or if he carried it with him all the time in his inside pocket next to his heart the suicide note of a woman hed never really had and perhaps was already losing when she died dying of guilt and you know the joke huw said theres a joke with the lights of hereford city centre clustered in the rear view mirror merrily headed left by the belmont roundabout finding the ross road they were going to make a surprise call on the reverend jerome banks huws idea huw sat placidly in the passenger seat wearing his donkey jacket hands clasped on his knees no seat belt on wears his scar tissue like a badge no not like a badge at all like scar tissue the kind that was never less than inflamed she was glad she no longer had to look into his stricken eyes the joke merrily was that its possible donna wasnt down to west after all the bones aye that matched otherwise a few differences the home office pathologist were the first to question it he knew the west style by then see what kind of differences well there were nowt wrong with the hole west used to bury them in holes that were deeper than they were wide they werent graves they were holes practical like youd have for dead sheep huws voice was as flat as the road ahead nobody had ever just stumbled on one of freds bodies hed cut them up then bury them neatly efficient butchery economical disposal thank you ive read about that and donna had been cut up but with no great skill the head hacked off the legs broken the hands too one foot mutilated bones removed but not freds way was how the pathologist saw it too rough he figured therefore too frenzied but after donna had been in the ground for the best part of two years huw said there was no strong forensic evidence either way not much more than the pathologists feeling that this wasnt down to fred you can bet most of the coppers wanted it to be him mind you dont want more than one of these buggers do you not on the same patch so whatever investigation there was mustve been cursory wi over seventy per cent of the team convinced the case was already solved always somebody to say oh happen fred were in a hurry this time not his usual self especially under the circumstances circumstances down the callow pitch now and off into the country reminding her of that night with gomer when it all began experiencing again that feeling of being drawn in hed just had a rather difficult year merrily one of his kids had told a schoolfriend about the domestic arrangements at cromwell street and fred had found himself in gloucester court facing charges of tampering with a daughter three counts of rape one of buggery rose next to him accused of cruelty and complicity police and social services walking all over the beloved home kids taken into care so then fred has to discuss his married life in detail with the coppers my wife and i we leads a very full sex life nudge bloody nudge they got off though didnt they aye so near and yet so far in the end the victim wouldnt give evidence nobody would nobody wanted to break up the happy home so they got off the pair of em embracing in the dock picture of bloody innocence but the police had been inside number seen all the signs the sex aids the pornographic homevideos and while the other children were in care the social workers had heard the family jokes about heather who was missing run off with a lesbian fred said being buried under the patio it was the beginning of the end within nine months theyd arrested him for the murder of heather buried more or less where she was said to be buried not a very good joke any more so did fred realize the clock was ticking was he determined to get a last one in before the bells went off or did he just happen to run into donna in cheltenham and couldnt resist or did somebody else kill her you think donna mightve been killed by roddy lodge dont you that was what you told bliss and its no wonder frannies excited because if this was down to lodge it proves that were not just looking at another copycat merrily said no because while it might not have been a perfect match it was still very close to wests modus operandi including the bones and when poor donna was buried two years before the arrest and all the publicity the only way anyone could possibly have known about wests modus operandi would have been by actually knowing west there we are then huw said placidly so huw had come to take over agenda written now in neon capitals between the lines on his forehead huw was running a crusade on behalf of the parents of all them dead and missing girls lying awake night after night wondering precisely what were done to their kids and how many times or just for one parent one girl or just god forbid for his own redemption now huw wanted to talk to the reverend jerome banks to whom roddy lodge had gone with his hauntedbungalow stories and been turned away why and why had banks offloaded the funeral so fast why had he really done that huw wanted answers huw owen with his wolfhound hair and his slowburn stare scary before they left merrily had gone up to the apartment with the chip money in one hand jane at seventeen was becoming what in liverpool they used to call a latchkey kid this couldnt go on flower huw and i have someone to see wow jane said in her most bored tone really shouldnt take long but yeah yeah chipsll be fine unless you want to come along we could call somewhere for a meal afterwards jane had turned down the stereo and stared at merrily with that awful twisted little smile let me get this right youre offering me a night out with a couple of vicars talking shop discussing like gods work the kid had sighed shaking her head in slow motion merrily if you only knew how distressingly patronizing that sounded you used to be quite interested in aspects of the job interests change jane said or maybe we get people wrong like for quite a while i thought my mother had a normal interest in men now what does that mean jane had shrugged they passed a pub on the ross road called with an awful irony the axe and cleaver if there ever is evidence that lodge killed donna merrily said what could that mean it would seem to me to suggest there really might have been a group of them aye the cult that fred talked about and everybody thought he were just trying to spread the blame however when alls said and done if roddy lodge killed donna he didnt kill julia fred killed julia you mean just the thought of the thought of fred and rose and what theyd done to the others the images of his hands on donna julia was an artist she couldnt live with the images im so sorry huw been dreaming about her again merrily julia and her white portraits of donna keep seeing the white portraits ive got one at home i dont think shes at peace i dont think either of them are at peace no and wests still killing huw said he always has been you read about his grownup children attempting suicide and a man called terry crick in january he attached a hose to his car exhaust and killed himself with carbon monoxide couldnt live with the thought that he mightve stopped it they were mates you see back in the late sixties young terry bit of a hippy then and genial young fred do anything for you fred showed terry his abortion tools once very proud of his abortion tools was fred loved to tell women that if they ever needed help that way he was their man terry thought it were a joke huw until years later when he read about the case and remembered staying with the wests when they were in a caravan near cheltenham hearing fred and rose giggling in bed became convinced he mustve heard future murders being conceived didnt go to the police until it were too late couldnt go on living with the thought that he mightve prevented something people have been dying of guilt merrily i doubt itdve made any difference at all if terry crick had told the cops about fred west waving his abortion tools around just having a laugh fred wouldve said mucky owd tools like that whod believe it whyve you stopped merrily wrenched up the handbrake and switched off the engine i was trying to tell you bankss rectory is up that lane on the left i think you still want to go of course i still want to go be some guilt there i reckon dont you lets go and help mr banks get it off his chest they were parked with two wheels on the verge at the side of the a the old volvo shaded by high bushes still heavy with sodden leaves merrily said quietly one more time what are you doing here huw never before in all the hours shed spent with him had she felt the quiver of instability that was now so real it was almost shaking the car covering me back he said put it like that if you want call it selfishness call it me not wanting to take any guilt to my grave if more lives get lost why should more get lost huw leaned back against the passenger door if theres a group of people out there still and theyre taking lives or harming folk in any way its a police matter if theres a spiritual evil its ours accepted i suppose so i dont know anything about lodge yet but i know a lot about west a man driven by lust an uneducated man who arranged his life around the constant need for sexual pleasure no moral values no sense of remorse not a hint of basic decency a man who watched through holes in doors who had sex with his own kids because they were there in his house his house the house hed converted with his own tools a man who loved nobody yet loved things tools gadgets a man who possessed huw merrily wound down the window she wanted both fresh air and a cigarette and whats changed merrily he mightve gone physically but how many people have died since because the lamp of the wicked must be put out cold air on her face thats why youre here youve come with a view to snuffing out his lamp havent you start the car huw said roughly lets go and see this bugger banks dressed for dinner in a dark wool jacket over a white blouse her features sharp with suspicion mrs pawson was scanning the reception area at the royal hotel for whoever had put out the call lol stood up and walked over to her he didnt have the smallest idea how he was going to handle this but on the night before his first gig in nearly two decades fear was relative what do you want mrs pawsons voice was hard and brittle as dried nail varnish she was flicking glances to either side of him probably to see if there was anyone around she could call on if he attacked her have you lol looked around too saw two elderly women nobody else could you spare a few minutes mrs pawson didnt move whats this about its about lodge lol admitted ive not been able to stop thinking about what you said this morning and im sorry but i think there was more you werent saying and are you in fact something to do with the police though aware that mrs pawsons general experience of the drainage trade would not predispose her to be generous or open he still shook his head in that case she said i do not want to speak to you that man caused enough damage i dont want to discuss him youd better go lol nodded and had half turned away to leave when he suddenly turned back hed thought about this a lot after returning to the studio rehearsing a couple of songs in a desultory kind of way finding that even at the eleventh hour his heart wasnt in it mrs pawson had been perhaps the last person to have any business dealings with lodge and she was a woman on her own and something was not right you mentioned another woman he said when you said roddy lodge was a nightmare person i didnt think you were talking about getting conned over a septic tank and then you mentioned a woman and then he told her that hed been there when lodge had died standing underneath that pylon and that something like this didnt just go away he told her he didnt normally work with gomer parry and was just helping out because gomer had had a lot of trouble that he didnt imagine mrs pawson even knew about as it hadnt exactly been national news and then he told her he and gomer were both friends of the church minister whod landed the job of burying lodge he shook his shoulders helplessly and told her what a small county it was he apologized to her again mrs pawson looked him in the eyes you dont give up do you usually yes he said to be honest whats your name robinson laurence robinson if you dont want to talk to me what about merrily watkins the priest i could probably arrange that maybe i could bring her here she stared at him why do you think id want to talk to a priest i was thinking maybe a woman the woman who found the body in the shovel of lodges digger after he it was this that seemed to do it jerome bankss study had ordnance survey maps on the walls with coloured drawing pins marking his churches it was next to the living room and you could hear the sound of the tv through the wall his wife was sitting in there hed told her not to bother with refreshment this wouldnt take long jerome was irritated by their visit and was making no effort to conceal it my day off he said always take every second tuesday off everyone knows that the wrong attitude to take with huw tonight creature of habit eh something wrong with that ive always found people like to know where they are with their clergy no mysteries huw said none here merrily thought the rectory was a modern house on the edge of a small estate of neogeorgian detached homes west of ross there was a cold street lamp outside the study window only one hardwood chair in front of the desk and hed made merrily sit in it and she felt very small but aware that this probably wasnt going to be her showdown jerome banks surveyed huw both of them standing up they were about the same height but banks held himself straighter military backbone his checked shirt was crisply ironed and you could have sliced bread with the creases of his trousers we met before he had stiff sandy hair and a nose with a small red bump on the tip like a bell push cant see it somehow huw said no if youre who i think you are i agree its unlikely and if youve come about what i think youve come about i doubt theres much i can say to assist you what would that be you tell me mr owen well like a lot of people including the police im becoming a little concerned about events in and around the village of underhowle and in my experience its always best to have a chat with the lad on the ground we dont stick our noses in much these days the clergy but theres not much we dont at least hear about some of us stick our noses in further than others banks said agreed how long have you got before retirement jerome banks coloured obviously owen ive heard about you and your little deliverance empire your incantations and your thermos flasks of holy water your new medievalism and yes youre quite right i dont have long before retirement eighteen months at the most and i dont intend to spend any of that time kowtowing to the charismatics and the damn happyclappies merrily smiled huw scowled i dont clap much pal and im not happy what do you want i want to know about a few of the incidents thatve been brought to your notice but which you havent felt inclined to do owt about being as how youre not into new medievalism merrily sat still and said nothing she just wouldnt have dared i dont even know what youre talking about banks said but hed left too long a pause if you think ive been got at over the lodge funeral i can show you two dozen letters and a small petition all of them urging me not to bury lodge at underhowle and no letters at all in support urging merrily said no threats then ive had a threat huw looked at her had an anonymous phone call warning me to stay at home on friday you never said owt about that huw said you told the police as the funerals now tomorrow i didnt think it really applied if anyone had threatened me banks said i should have made a point of personally digging the grave why did you suggest merrily for the job banks waited a couple of seconds did i suggest her somebody did perhaps because her name had already been mentioned in connection with lodge huw nodded letting the silence hang until merrily began to feel uncomfortable look banks said im aware that theres a particular local activist in the underhowle area with a chip on his shoulder about highvoltage power lines and pylons being detrimental to health and possibly causing some people to have odd experiences i dont necessarily subscribe to any of that and if i did i should be obliged to conclude that it wasnt a matter at all for the church not even your particular outpost aha huw said youve had reports of odd experiences merrily said as you know people often say things they have difficulty justifying banks was gazing over merrilys head at his own and huws reflections in the window often because they want rehousing a better house think were all idiots this is hauntings huw asked as there are usually also physical symptoms ive tended to refer people to the doctor he cure them ive no idea i have heard of some people going to socalled alternative practitioners in ross and hereford the very people to deal with their alternative problems its nothing to do with religion and thats what you said to lodge eh the tip of bankss nose went white how bloody dare you look merrily stood up she was getting tired of breaking up huws fights mr banks you might not think much of what we do or try to do but if theres a remote possibility that it helps people to cope well just well muddle on if you dont mind if i told you what this was really about you probably wouldnt thank me and call me overzealous but i kind of like to know exactly who im burying isnt that the most important thing we ever do for someone are you trying to tell me my job not your job any more huw said you unloaded it be interesting to know why you know why matter of local politics so you ignored all the other complaints of psychic intrusion for purely political reasons and not wanting to encourage happyclappy hysteria you bastard huw beamed thats the first perceptive deduction youve made all night pal look merrily said we all appreciate that we the clergy come from different directions which is healthy and were not trying to cause trouble mr banks wed just like to be able to work out what were dealing with a bit of background in confidence would help she watched banks contemplating this working out where he stood all right he said and this is political one complaint concerned the old baptist chapel the one more or less adjacent to lodges garage disused previously used as a bottling plant for spring water which failed now being converted into a museum or some sort of visitor centre but still a baptist chapel in my eyes and i dont intrude on other denominations you were told the place was haunted i was told of disturbances but some looked to me to be of distinctly human origin for instance the firm working on the conversion had complained of equipment going missing nothing supernatural there probably find the items in various garages in goodrich close and that was it oh the usual noises smells i suggested they had the drains examined for blockages suggested they banks smirked hired lodge to look into it in fact i believe he owned the chapel at one time came with the garage all part of the bottling enterprise which i gather failed because of impurities in the spring water and did they hire him merrily asked i dont know the development committee had obtained some sort of grant to buy the property from lodge i dont really know i do know that one building firm apparently refused to work there after a while youd have to ask mrs sollars about that shes supposed to be in charge there erm when we spoke on the phone a few nights ago you said roddy lodge came to you with a problem the details of which you seemed to have difficulty remembering he was barking you said lodge told you he was seeing images of women in his new bungalow which i understand from relatives was nothing very new for him when he was a child he seems to have created projections of his dead mother or mothersubstitutes comfort projections maybe you or i wouldnt have been able to see them but it was all very real to him and when he moved into the bungalow the images hallucinations whatever obviously intensified whether through environmental effects or anyway they seem to have acquired a different status and this was what he told you about wasnt it banks turned away stood thinking then he went to sit behind his desk there was a regimental photo on it banks and fellow officers either side of an armoured car it disgusted me he said and after half a lifetime in the army as you can imagine im not easily disgusted he told you about having sexual fantasies involving women who were now dead yes how long ago was this about two years ago did he just show up and ask to talk to you no he i dont know whether i should be telling you this but he was more or less referred to me by his gp dr ruck this is the same man you refer people to when they complain of nocturnal apparitions or whatever hed gone to allan ruck with general complaints of debilitation headaches muscle pains and then hed starting talking about all this psychic malarkey i believe allan eventually sent him to a brain specialist but of course they couldnt find anything after that he could only suggest a psychiatrist lodge reacted somewhat aggressively to this ruck said then why dont you go and see the rector palming him off if you like did nobody even consider the possibility of anomalous electrical and give that maniac hall more ammunition anyway how could it possibly explain the sexual fantasies huw said electrical stimulation if ive got this right of the septum area of the brain i think what were suggesting merrily said is that if someone like roddy lodge who already has a wellestablished fantasy life moves into whats become known as an electromagnetic hot spot then the foundation the template for sexual fantasies of a very real and intense kind is already laid perhaps it all became just a bit too intense too intense to be pleasurable in the conventional sense and coupled with the debilitating physical effects of electrohypersensitivity well no wonder he went to his doctor the mobile shuddered in her coat pocket she thought jane tell me banks said what basic proof do you have of any of this mrs watkins none at all when do people like us ever have proof she pulled out the phone excuse me she went to stand in the doorway remembering banks telling her on the phone that hed actually offered prayers for the unquiet dead but roddy lodge had rejected the idea bumptious full of himself never seen the like i wasnt entirely sure to tell you the truth if he wasnt taking the piss it suggested that while roddy would have been very glad to lose the side effects he really didnt want to part with his ghosts which was perhaps why hed resisted melanie pullmans efforts to get him to talk to sam hall this is merrily she said into the phone where are you lol im out near ross thats brilliant you ill call you back ok five minutes so what advice did you give roddy lodge jerome huw said what did you recommend for his little problem cold showers banks looked down at his desk waited his customary two seconds before replying i believe i told him to in the modern parlance get a life huw smiled banks didnt he looked at each of them in turn as if to make sure they understood the significance of what he was about to say i suggested to lodge that instead of following his solitary pursuits he might consider making the acquaintance of real girls bringing his fist down on the desktop real girls the fist coming down twice like a mallet now do you see long old nights jane heard the voice from the kitchen and grinned with relief saw herself floating in slomo across the room and into the scullery towards the answering machine and the phone the light entering her eyes like turning up a dimmer switch and then then what er this is actually quite important eirion said so im going to hang on for about half a minute while you decide if you can possibly spare some time to speak to me jane didnt move had to admit that what she was missing most right now was having someone she could open up to someone she could lay her deepest most secret fears on someone who knew exactly where she was coming from and who was not her mother it was just that shed been trying to avoid considering the name eirion in this context even though there was no one else eirion said basically it relates to a website i found concerning the archangel uriel naturally he was uncomfortable too after what had passed between them he needed a pretext its something i thought you ought to know about i mean i dont know much about this stuff and i believe its very much on the iffy side of the scriptures and with people who do websites you get a lot of cranks and fanatics but the site gives a list of people throughout history who it reckons have become vehicles for uriel especially women and the thing is you seem to be one of them me jane said and simultaneously realized the truth this wasnt for her at all the bastard was addressing mum jane felt cold like marble wasnt exactly the first time theyd conspired was it the doorbell went meanwhile the treacherous git was still waiting for someone to pick up the phone she could hear his breathing in the speaker panting overweight jane straightened up raised a stiffened forefinger at the answering machine and went to answer the door hoping it was uncle ted or someone else who she could take down with her whose night she could ruin in the hall she was about to give the finger to the the light of the world when she met the eyes of the guy with the lamp saw how old he looked noticed his crown of thorns felt that it must actually hurt in a nagging chronic kind of way and didnt give him the finger after all it wouldve been gratuitous she was not gratuitous the bell went again jane turned on the porch light and opened the front door jenny driscoll stood there in a shiny waxed jacket with a white scarf half over her head virgin marystyle merrily felt in the driversdoor pocket and brought out her pectoral cross she slipped the chain over her head under the cowl of her sweater i cant believe we did that did what lass good priestbad priest her initial sense of triumph felt wrong now she started up the car and pulled away from jerome bankss executive rectory aye huw said one so seldom gets an opportunity for such finesse huw we practically bludgeoned the truth out of the poor sod doesnt matter how we did it wheres it got us apart from a hint on the baptist chapel not far confirms what you already knew lodge were a sick bugger on a number of levels but bankss professed sense of guilt thats halfarsed whos going to believe lodge got launched into a life of rape and murder by a mantoman chat with the rector im disappointed i expected summat better than this you can see why he wouldnt want it broadcast though she braked at the poorly lit tjunction with the a and why he didnt want to conduct the funeral if it were me id feel bloody well obliged to conduct it huw sank back and stretched out his legs merrily fumbled a silk cut from the packet could you pass me the lighter from the dash or can i use your halo cheeky besom he found the lighter and lit her cigarette this woman were going to see this is the woman whose septic tank started it all the tiered skyline of ross appeared part floodlit across the dual carriageway and the wye the herefordshire riviera behind it was howle hill the forest the dark country and as we dont want to scare her you can stay in the car mrs jenny box née driscoll said youre not expecting her back soon at all are you jane well she said she thought not driscoll sat with her white scarf around her shoulders and the cup of weak tea jane had made in front of her on the refectory table not quite the soft touch that jane had expected in fact knowing the womans background why had she expected a soft touch at all driscoll having come over from ireland worked with the hard cookies of the fashion world the flash cynics in television having been married for years to gareth box jane sat across the table uncomfortable why hadnt she just told the woman that mum was out and offered to pass on a message instead of thinking this could be heavensent and saying what gareth box had said she cant be long i suppose do you want to come in and wait getting her into the house just the two of them a cosy chat this woman mums lover wouldbe wouldbe lover oh christ get me out of this so is there something you wanted to say to me jane this softspoken softeyed softskinned woman sitting with her soft hands one over the other on her lap this very feminine woman very feminine like mum wasnt one of them supposed to be kind of butch something she wanted to say she said the first thing that came into her head the archangel uriel and what about her jenny box asked gently her of the four principal archangels uriel is the only one sometimes perceived as female in works of art mainly oh you dont know too much theology do you jane i know quite a lot about angels actually but thats not proper theology anyway the bible doesnt have very much to say about angels and certainly not uriel who only shows up in the book of esdras in the apocrypha which is like a bit iffy the bibles been censored more times than you or i will ever know said jenny box uriels the divine fire an energy of light and summer of warmth and so can only be female which i suppose was one reason she was pushed out of the picture for so long jane found she was clasping and unclasping her hands under the table she pulled them apart so like this would be the uriel youre supposed to have over the church she told you about that no expression not bothered she tells me everything were very close she jane hesitated sod it she told me about the money too ah yes jenny box said the money doesnt everybody always get so excited about money i mean like was it you who brought it mrs box raised a faint eyebrow an anonymous gift is an anonymous gift jane twas always my feeling that all donations to the church ought to be anonymous nobody can buy admission to heaven can they now youre pretty slick really arent you jane said jenny box laughed years around tv so hard to shed all right wheres your mother really jane shrugged awkwardly ross i think underhowle maybe i hoped to speak to her about that i read all the papers ive been up in london and i read all the papers on the train coming back thats more important than she could know maybe what her whole lifes been leading up to you know she smiled at jane yes im sure you do no jane felt a slow seepage of anger no i dont know actually oh i thought you said she told you everything but not as much as she tells you evidently the eyebrow went up again like a goldfish flicking its tail you never really saw an angel at all did you mrs box jane said because at this stage of the game there was really nowhere else to go mrs pawsons arms were down by her sides stiff lol saw the knuckles tighten on her small white fists oddly he found he was starting to like her she didnt seem neurotic she was really quite strong she probably would have got along quite well in the country in normal circumstances they were waiting in a carpeted creamwalled passageway people passing them on the way to dinner mr robinson im not usually a wilting violet and if i thought this might have helped someone i would have told the police i would have made a full statement but as you said hes dead lodge is dead and oh theyd both seen the discreet glint of the cross at the entrance to the passage and lols heart did what it always did when he saw merrily for the first time after he said ill go shall i leave you to it mrs pawson looked embarrassed no dont this is becoming surreal merrily smiled held out a hand im merrily a man and a woman had come out of a room to the right and mrs pawson looked in through the door this is empty now lets go in here they followed her in lol shut the door behind them it was a residents lounge narrow with pink and gold regencystriped sofas and the same extensive view as the one from the prospect how is this really going to help anyone lisa pawson said merrily walked to the window wonderful view there was a floodlit terrace and in the middle distance the lights of the traffic on the bypass she turned to mrs pawson i get the feeling weve both had slightly disturbing experiences with roddy lodge im supposed to be conducting his funeral and i suspect theres quite a lot that needs to be laid to rest mrs pawson was holding her blouse together at the neck as if it had suddenly gone cold in the room i was teaching in comprehensive schools for fifteen years and ive seen some very distasteful things but this i still dont see how it would help you to know about it merrily sat down on one of the sofas near the window if you had a missing relative a daughter a sister wouldnt you want to know whether thered been another fred west at work i mean in some places jane said there are legends of angels being seen like in the local folklore and apparitions of the virgin and all that but i mean ledwardine do me a favour immediately regretting the scorn but it was too late now you dont believe people see angels jane jenny box said depends what you mean by angels oh i think we all know what we mean by angels i think i know what you mean im entirely sure of what i mean and what i saw what i think is that you just saw mum you were looking for somewhere to live like that bit was probably true you were looking for somewhere to live and to like entertain yourself out of sight of the media and all the london gossips and then you saw mum eventually yes and you fancied her jane said jenny box didnt move but her eyes flickered jane was suddenly so choked up with horror at what shed said mixed with rage and hurt at the possibility of it being true that she could hardly get her breath thats something like blasphemy jane jane stood up its true though isnt it youve got like everything brilliant house successful business gorgeous husband and you have to come here and mess with peoples lives theres nothing angelic in any of this divine fire like the way i see it theres only one kind of divine fire as far as youre concerned jenny box was out of her chair now she was very pale her white scarf had slipped to the flags jane was in tears it didnt matter shed said it it was out her eyes were wet she wiped her sleeve across them and saw jenny box picking up her white scarf then the older woman was standing at the open kitchen door with the table and ten feet of stone flags between them jenny box said when did you see my husband how do you know hes back in london now we have the same houses but we dont live together did he come here no which means you went to him jenny box stood in the doorway and when she spoke all that fey lilt had been punched out of her voice and did he touch you jane as well as defaming me the best he could did he touch you what did you let him near you jane felt her mouth going out of shape its all right jenny box said calmly i wont distress you further im going now jane came round the table her fists clenched when she reached the hall jenny box had the front door open and was standing next to the holman hunt picture half under the porch light but blocking it so that it looked for a moment as if she was actually lit by the lantern that christ was carrying in the picture her face was as white as a communion wafer and she was muttering oh dear god dear god and pulling her scarf over her head it was as if they wanted me to know mrs pawson said from the first they both came to install it lol asked it was quite a warm autumn day she the woman lynsey was wearing a skimpy black top with nothing underneath it even when they were unloading the appliance from the truck they kept touching one another all the time what was she like merrily said quite a big woman not much over medium height but big bones she had black frizzy hair dark eyes she wasnt particularly goodlooking but she had a sexiness about her i suppose youd have to call it a sexiness that was not so much sultry as glowering the way she moved prowled even when she was working hauling these plastic pipes and equipment and she hardly ever smiled that was something that struck me and when she did it wasnt a very big smile and sly isnt quite the word it was as if she knew something you didnt lol noticed that mrs pawson kept glancing at one of the table lamps as if to make sure it was still on i made the mistake of asking them in when they first arrived they their glances were everywhere looking at the furniture which was fairly sparse at the time not exactly admiring things but noting them as if they were checking if there was anything valuable then he asked if he could go to the lavatory and i directed him to the downstairs washroom but then i could hear him walking about in the bedroom overhead meanwhile she started looking among the books and she pulled one from the shelf and she said john donne he was a sexy bugger wasnt he and gave me that halfsmile and then lodge came back down still smelling of that dreadful aftershave and before they went back out he stared at me in i suppose a rather blatant way and he asked me how i was getting on whether i was lonely without my husband long nights he said long old nights eh mrs pawson squeezed her arms together and began to rock slightly lol didnt think she was aware of it at lunchtime they would they had a van which she drove because hed brought the digger and it was parked at the back of the house with the rear doors facing the kitchen at lunchtime they went into the back of the van supposedly to eat their sandwiches but it became obvious very quickly what they were actually doing there was a single mattress in there no attempt to hide it no attempt at all to keep it quiet in fact they seemed to be making as much noise as they could as if they were oblivious of everything else like rutting animals the van was actually creaking on its springs mrs pawson stopped and looked at them perhaps to make sure that they didnt consider this was perfectly reasonable behaviour during a lunchtime break how many days did the work take lol asked the installation two im sure it could have been done in one but they seemed in no hurry about anything evidently merrily said naturally but now i was regretting id ever hired him did you say anything to them what was i supposed to say without sounding middleclass and sanctimonious and like a townie like some sort of buttonedup townie who didnt understanding country spontaneity what you wondered if perhaps this was how all healthy young rural workers its not funny no its not merrily said especially when you were on your own its insulting and its threatening anyway on the second day they left the back doors of the van wide open and i assumed they really were eating their sandwiches this time and i went out to ask i steeled myself to go out and ask if they wanted a cup of tea and they were both sitting there in the back of the van naked well she was almost she had her top off and her jeans unzipped he was stripped to the waist his belt undone merrily closed her eyes shaking her head i screamed im afraid one tries to be cool in this sort of situation but then lodge laughed he said what a hot day it was just cooling off he said i said something like youll have to excuse me and then she said in this very low throaty voice why dont you join us why dont you join us love do you good mrs pawson started to cough brought a hand to her mouth lol asked can i get you a drink some coffee no thank you ill be going in to dinner soon if i can face it so i said very coldly how long will you be before youve finished i could smell the awful aftershave and i was feeling sick and she said as long as you want as long as you can stand it and lodge said longer and he laughed and i ran back to the house and locked the door and stood over the phone for quite a long time wondering if i should call the police if what they were doing or what theyd said constituted any kind of offence they never came out of the van lol said no not at this time it could have been said that they were demonstrating nothing more than what you might call a lamentable lack of common courtesy but there was i really cant tell you an indescribable menace around them both a quite palpable sense of something predatory i know people will say this is all with hindsight what did you do merrily asked i didnt know what to do then i didnt go out again after a while they came out of the van and simply finished the job replacing all the soil they didnt come back to the house i felt i should have gone to the police or somebody but it would be my word against theirs a townie an incomer and of course i absolutely dared not tell my husband he never wanted that house never really wanted to move to the country kept talking about you know living among sheepshaggers i wasnt going to give him the satisfaction the next day i just had the locks changed and doubled did you see them again mrs pawson laughed harshly i went back to london that weekend to spend some time with our child gus we have a nanny who id hoped to persuade to come down here with us so that i could continue my work i do some proofreading for an educational publisher but she has a boyfriend in london and it anyway i came back on my own the following week to meet the surveyor wed hired mr booth who would subsequently point out the problem with the efflapure and point me in the direction of mr parry i was finding it hard to sleep and i remember getting up in the night to go to the bathroom and get a drink i she closed her eyes for a moment took a breath through her mouth im sorry but this is absolutely the first time ive talked about this to anyone take your time merrily said the bathroom overlooks the side of the house where the efflapure had been installed and when i looked down it was about half past midnight and a bright night with the moon almost full she was standing there the woman standing on the lawn under one of the apple trees just standing there quite relaxed with her legs apart and her arms folded dressed much as she had been the first time i saw her looking up at me with that same smile that said i know things you dont what did you do i was terribly afraid i thought at first oh my god theyre both here theyve come to rob me or or worse i got dressed in the dark very quickly i found the mobile phone and i keyed in so that id just have to press the button and then i ran into the front bedroom and looked out of the window went all around the upstairs peering through windows but there was no sign of the van or the truck or anything or anyone and when i went back to the bathroom she wasnt there any more merrily said softly almost casually when exactly was this do you remember it must have been at least a week after id seen them i remember there was a bill for the job for the efflapure waiting behind the door when i returned from london lol looked at merrily and saw her bite her lip the door of the lounge opened suddenly and mrs pawsons whole body jerked a man in a dark suit said cheerfully are you all right in there anything i can get you fine mrs pawson said everythings fine bit player in a fantasy the royal hotel was tucked into the side of the ross churchyard and they went up into it then followed the path down towards the plague cross the cross was edged with cold moonlight lol said you didnt really push her on dates no point i think we both knew what we might have been talking about merrily said if she knew for a fact that lynsey davies was dead by then how would that help her to sleep i slipped her a card on the way out whispered i could maybe help if anything happened again i dont think she wants to go down that road she just wants out no wonder shes staying in the hotel im not sure id want to be in that house on my own even now lol looked up at the plague cross the cross itself was quite small like a fist on the end of an upthrust arm representing the triumph of mere survival the picture thats coming over of lynsey davies is not really the image of a victim is it nothing ive heard about her so far makes her terribly endearing merrily said dumps her kids probably breaks up roddys relationship with someone who might have helped him and tries to lure an already nervous woman into threein avan sex do you want to know more about her would that help there was no one else in the churchyard the streetfront opposite now mainly offices was hushed but the air around them was vibrant with the sharp spores of frost lol why arent you rehearsing why arent you getting an early night before the gig because id start thinking it was important and if i start thinking its important im anyway theres someone here in ross who knew lynsey well someone gomer and i met on the tank dig if you wanted to come with me we could maybe i cant ive left huw owen in the man of ross trying to find a pint and a pasty were going over to underhowle hes decided he wants to be involved which is not frankly as reassuring as you might think she looked up at the cross so this is sams symbol the insidious wind which blows through skin and tissue and bones he said that its the only good line in his song and even that sounds more than a bit reminiscent of dylans idiot wind electromagnetic waves merrily said radio waves ghost waves alien waves soft porn blowing through the church steeple its a wonder any of us can breathe prof says were mutating into it one day well become electric beings just light and sparks thats a better line maybe ill use that instead merrily said huw wonders if theres the remains of some satanic cult still out there i wouldnt know what to do about it if there was its not even against the law any more killing people is and the known killers are dead so the police arent interested no listen lol turned away from the cross theres no good time to say this but i dont imagine therell be a better one he saw her stiffen he said when i was here with moira something happened merrily said sharply no maybe this isnt a good time if i dont talk about it now she didnt look at him sam hall was telling us about how the bodies were buried without coffins all that and later moira said shed experienced what she described as a loathsome curling sensation in her gut she talked in an oblique way about evil she lol shrugged thats it merrily looked at him and he thought she almost smiled thats it thats what you had to tell me i know how you feel about clairvoyance just thought i ought to tell you about this even if you scoffed but if you do accept this sort of thing you might think she was getting it not so much from the cross and this situation as from sam lol im worried about this thats all underhowle lodge west worried about you sorry also eirion came to see me last night on his own oh god merrily said theyve split up havent they she told you didnt need to i like eirion a lot the kind of guy she needs to meet in ten years time at janes age i suppose you need to split up a few times he may even be prepared to wait he lol breathed out he also said jane thinks im sleeping with moira cairns did he the way we musicians do when were not shooting heroin into our arms ive heard that too about moira and the heroin but i think thats exaggerated in your case look were ok arent we lol nodded he kissed her slowly both hands in her hair i hope and then they walked down towards the notverybright lights of the town jane snatched her fleece from the peg and ran out of the front door catching up with jenny box on the edge of the square im sorry jenny box turned her scarf fell away her redgold hair shone under one of the fake gaslamps mrs box im really sorry ok i should not have said that stuff jane its not my place to be judgemental im immature for my age and im probably becoming rightwing and moralistic and jane jenny box said if you want to continue the conversation fine do you want to come back to the vicarage jenny box looked around the square i think id rather walk if you dont mind sitting there facing each other across a table that can be a little fraught besides theres less opportunity for me to try and seduce you out here on the street im sorry jane said eyes still full of tears i dont know what to believe any more about anything merrily took the walford road out of ross turning left when the headlight beams penetrated the tight steel compound that was the base of the first big pylon in the great chain ive never come into the forest of dean from this end huw said always come down from gloucester before its strange like a frontier she drove slowly along the narrow valley road the full beams occasionally finding one of the pylons gripping the hillside like the skeletons of steelclawed eagles the forests a different country you assume it must have different laws and you wonder if you might be breaking one of them without knowing it you feel insecure bit shed told him about lisa pawsons unnerving encounter with roddy lodge and lynsey davies expecting him to make some reference as frannie bliss might have done to the couple behaving like fred and rose west but hed said nothing she hadnt told him about the postscript she wanted to ask bliss if theyd been able to ascertain roughly when lynsey had died merrily said im still not sure what were going for what youre chasing peaceofmind redemption or some kind of revenge huw did his small throaty laugh a smokers laugh which was odd in somebody who didnt smoke he didnt reply what a strange unfocused job this was no framework for measuring success not like frannie bliss walking away with a conviction a result most times you just came away confused the headlights picked up the base of the lone scots pine at the right turning for underhowle thered be a big sign here next summer perhaps the ariconium centre i went over to much marcle once huw said one fine afternoon october some weeks after julias death i went into the church a white feeling inside lots of marble nothing there nothing for me anyroad and then i went and sat inside the hollow yew tree in the churchyard where i know he must have sat because everybody has happen that were the problem every bugger had sat there at some time or other it was all smudged you were looking for anything that might be left of west so i got back in the car and i drove up on the kempley road to the fingerpost field and the letterbox field up near where the bugger lived where he buried two bodies happen more but twos all they found county boundary goes through there and he knew exactly where it was and he buried em both on the gloucester side because when it come down to it he never really liked much marcle on account of everybody knows your business in a village he liked the anonymity of the city so he planted em on the gloucester side so they could look down on marcle and nobody in marcled ever know how do you know that i know him huw said and under the flat ridge of his voice there was a kind of horror like the bodies under the floor in cromwell street when the cops took him back to marcle he said he could see ghosts in the fields said they came to him in his cell rena his first wife and ann mcfall anna he called her said he saw their ghosts but later he took it back said hed made that up and you merrily said softly did you see any ghosts huw sniffed stood at the top of fingerpost field thought what a lovely place it were with the view down to marcle church and across the valley to ridge hill i had a a rite in me pocket in a notebook a procedure a formal merrily slowed right down an exorcism didnt give it a title for fred west happen but you cant can you roddy lodges garage was on the right across its cindered forecourt shed been planning to point it out to huw and the message chalked on the door put him down a cesspit where he belongs but this was more important and she drove past you cant exorcize fred west because however much evil there was you cant cant exorcise a ghost she was going to say you could only exorcize a demonic presence anything that had once been human an unquiet spirit could only be directed back to its maker she shut up it was after all huw whod taught her this stuff sometimes he leaned forward scrubbing at the condensation on the windscreen sometimes i think in the modern church you can make it up as you go along whats this merrily what are all these lights who the bloody hell are all these buggers merrily leaned on the brakes but they were already surrounded lols pub crawl ended at an inn down by the river wye with a beer garden extending to the dark waters edge this was where he finally found the girl who had said her name was cola french down the far end of the bar was a group of people of varying ages but a shared selfconscious and slightly dated eccentricity there was a woman of late middle age in a purple bolero and black lipstick a bald guy in an elaborately torn biker jacket and bangles and a small round man with a long crimson beard who was doing the talking until cola french grinning poked him in the chest jaz youre a lying old bastard and you are a whore jaz said mildly and cola cracked up laughing then she saw lol standing near the doorway lol who didnt drink much never knew where to put himself and sometimes found the friendly english pub the loneliest place in the world hey cola said shit her hair was a dazzling white tonight with tiny gold stars in it she wore the same black fleece top shed had on the other day at the old rectory it was not yet eight pm and she seemed to be moderately drunk cola french the writer and occasional bookshop assistant whose tv play would have been perused by the great dennis potter himself if he hadnt snuffed it she unstitched herself from the bohemian tapestry at the bottom of the bar weaved right up to lol and peered into his eyes this guy who was in i dunno some pub said there was a bloke looking for me tell me it was you couldve been admitted lol whose quest had taken him to four other bars in ross soft drinks and suspicious looks that said if you only want a small orange juice and youre on your own what are you really doing here mate which is like serendi serendipitous cola said because you know what i know who you are she prodded lol once in the chest making a big gesture of it and then stepping away like shed identified him from a wanted poster she bent forward with a hand on each thigh and began to sing softly and its always on the sunny days you feel you cant go on on rainy days it rains on everyone and im running for the subway and im hiding under trees on fine days like these hey someone shouted if it was karaoke night itd say so on the bloody door cola said i grew up with that song my older sister had the album hazey jane two right she leaned right up to lol again shared with him some warm brandy breath right who told you he was thrown this did not happen nobody had ever recognized him it was all too long ago the bar was suddenly twice as full and everybody was looking at him and his body began to quiver with the need to run and keep on running ah cola tapped the side of her nose with a forefinger she took his arm and turned to the woman in the purple bolero deirdre if i do not shag this guy tonight then all life is meaningless right it all happened so quickly like a night raid the first banner screaming we dont want him then someone spotting the dog collar on huw a whoop going up a dozen lamp beams clashing in the air like random fireworks and then figures were running at the car some with placards brandished like shields others pointing the poles outwards like battle stakes merrily hitting the brakes when the windscreen was filled with a white board demanding keep satan out and faces bloated with selfrighteousness she looked around vainly for anyone she might recognize couldnt spot a sam hall or a fergus young or a piers connor crewe or even the fat man from the newsagents who didnt want his adopted village connected with a sicko burn him appeared in huws side window and there was the blast of a hunting horn sinister in the night a baying for blood if it hadnt been for the tv crew shed have locked all the doors she certainly wouldnt have wound down her window except for the young woman in the red jacket with the furrycovered boom mike amanda patel bbc midlands today is it mrs watkins could we have a word the light on top of the camera was full in merrilys eyes she was on her own huw had slipped out of the car without a word and moved away huw who had never been known to give an interview not even to the church times could you give me a minute to find out whats happening shed managed to drive as far as the community centre before the crush of bodies had forced her to stop there must be a couple of hundred people here men women kids ok look amanda patel said well come back to you in about five if you want to listen to what some of these people have to say and then respond to it is that ok itll be for the halften bulletin and breakfast merrily nodded no dog collar frayed old duffel coat she didnt want to do an interview at all and the bishop wouldnt be happy but it would look worse if she backed out and all they had was pictures of the volvo surrounded and her and huw blinking in the lights bemused ineffectual clergy the camera light swept from her face to illuminate a placard opposite roddys body out amanda patel was setting up a tall rangylooking guy in a furtrimmed leather jacket ok nick if you just stand yeah thats fine ok george right a giggle then into tvtone nick longton youre the councillor for this area why are you backing this protest well let me say first of all that im very proud to represent this village on the herefordshire council an example of the wonders that can be achieved when we all work together the people and the local authority merrily recalled fergus young this morning saying that five years ago the council had been ready to shut down the school and i dont want to see this place becoming notable for the wrong reasons nick longtons accent was not local i also have enormous sympathy for the relatives of people already buried in the churchyard who dont want to have to walk past the grave of a serial murderer but surely amanda patel said over muted applause roddy lodge in the eyes of the law is an innocent man because however damning things may seem amanda we know he killed one woman and dozens of the people here tonight heard him confess to killing at least two more it may be weeks months even years before more bodies are found and this is going to hang over everyone particularly the family of melanie pullman whom lodge named as one of his victims and it would be disgraceful if they had to keep walking past his name on a gravestone with some pious rest in peace carving on it what kind of peace will his victims be resting in but hes a local man isnt his family entitled to have him buried here in my view and the views of my constituents a murderer forfeits that kind of right nick said we dont want that mans body here amanda patel nodded and the camera light went out merrily was thinking how pompous councillors had become talking of their constituents having their own cabinet she felt annoyed stared at the flickering faces saw duplicity hypocrisy and the funfair factor how many of these socalled protesters were really angry or distressed at the thought of having a murderer in the churchyard how many of them wouldnt be secretly thrilled by the vicarious notoriety merrily saw huw beckoning to her from the village hall entrance turned to him and spread her hands helpless and then the light was back on her and up came the boom mike in its fluffy windmuff like an inquisitive woolly puppet deceptively friendly merrily watkins amanda patel said youre the priest sent in by the church to conduct the funeral service for roddy lodge after the local minister refused do you feel entirely happy about what youre doing nobody could really feel happy in this situation but everyone in my view is entitled to a christian burial i feel deeply sorry for people whose missing relatives were named by mr lodge but even if hes guilty which as you said earlier he is not in the eyes of the law he should be properly laid to rest dont you think it would be better if he was simply cremated thats not a decision for me its no secret mrs watkins that youre also the diocesan deliverance consultant the hereford exorcist roddy lodge referred to himself as satan does that have any bearing on why you were selected for this job erm well bbc news didnt believe in the supernatural and certainly not in connection with a hard news story no merrily said none at all amanda patel nodded mrs watkins these residents now supported as you can see by dozens of people from surrounding villages say theyre going to keep up a permanent watch and any hearse attempting to bring roddy lodges body into underhowle will be stopped even the regular gravediggers saying hell be refusing to dig a grave for lodge how do you feel about that merrily said i think youll find that any interference with the free flow of traffic is probably a matter for the police not for me however gravedigging is a matter for the church and im sure something will be sorted out so youre saying youre prepared to go ahead with this funeral no matter what happens like if somebody puts a bomb under the church amanda patel smiled in resignation and signalled to the cameraman to stop recording the light went out cheers amanda said people had started chattering again she heard a woman say of course half of them are lesbians as some of the protesters set up a chant roddys body out roddys body out it was unlikely especially with the tv here that this demo was spontaneous but who would have planned it perhaps the mediawise development committee merrily stood in the lane feeling furious a bit player in a fantasy several fantasies colliding like the torch beams like shortlived fireworks brief explosions in the commonsense night merrily a hand under her elbow she turned huw was standing under one of the globular lamps outside the village hall lets get out of here huw merrily huw said this is there was a woman with him flaking waxed jacket penetrating brown eyes in a faintly familiar windtanned face huw said ingrids going to show us the new tourist centre huw i just the baptist chapel you remember jerome telling us about the baptist chapel a place of considerable historic significance well worth a visit besides huw nodded at an elderly woman in a long purple mac advancing from the crowd you might not want to hang around here you the elderly woman pointed at merrily ive said it before and ill say it again youre the beginning of the end you are women priests only a woman socalled priest would bury the damned dont get involved lass huw murmured amidst the halfmanufactured excitement the chants of roddys body out there was an eyeofthestorm stillness around him conveying an awareness of being exactly where he needed to be good at men im writing a new play cola french said from the bed about a woman id be you know really scared of being you know what i mean a woman whose appetites are so extreme that wow its apocalyptic see we think of these largerthan life people as being like you know big movie stars and rock idols but thats so totally wrong in reality those guys are all dead lazy and boring and too vain to realize it she didnt seem very drunk any more now she was back home in this wellorganized bedsit with a computer and printer and bookshelves with so many books that they were stacked horizontally and a view over a car park to the tall steeple of st marys i dont include you among the boring rock stars of course she told lol you are very interesting youre among the exalted ranks of the disappeared kind of syd barrett she raised herself propped her head up with an elbow hes actually older than my dad the great syd barrett you cant be anywhere near that old im like amazed how young you look im even more amazed that you were wandering the streets the night before your big comeback gig looking for me gig lol said aw come on ive known about that gig for days its even on the net it cant be lol lol honey youve got a serious cultbase out there you know that god look at your face you didnt know didnt did you cola scrambled up and sat on the side of the bed the copper it was told me who you were mumford who came back to see piers so ok theres this website right devoted to the dead and the disappeared morrison barrett drake edwards et cetera and you as it happens and so i emailed them i said i have just seen the real lol robinson and he was working for this little guy who installs septic tanks and some dickbrain emails back and says youre talking crap because lol robinsons on at the courtyard hereford on wednesday night as support to moira cairns so there you cant win i cant anyway even bloody dennis potter dies on me this womans lynsey davies isnt it lol said huh the woman with extreme appetites the woman youd be scared of being hmm colas eyes narrowed what makes you say that lol shrugged he was sitting on a plastic pouffe at the foot of the bed his back to a chest of drawers supporting a lamp made out of an ouzo bottle the lamp had a red bulb and made the room look like an intelligent brothel the point i was trying to make cola said is that it usually isnt the famous people who become the most extreme members of the human race its the people with something to rise above thats what the plays about this woman who comes out of a council estate in the forest does surprisingly well at school even though she dont give a toss then drops out of college and goes on the game just because shes bored does the booze and the drugs and then goes on the game at the age of about seventeen or eighteen in ross cola exploded with laughter ross and make actual money at it listen i know some of these women theyre lucky if they can turn over a hundred a night in hereford hey she blinked you didnt go with lynsey ever did you at some time lol shook his head thats not supposed to be insulting by the way cola said because that woman could pull you know whered i put my cigs lol spotted them on the computer table with a book of matches he went over and collected them for her ta cola said well thats something a lot of people around here went with her that a serious question lol recalled her saying when they were digging up piers connorcrewes efflapure lets be honest she was good at men he went back to sit on the plastic pouffe its just i remember you saying when we were at the rectory that lynsey davies had this fierce determination to grab everything from life did i im kind of a writer too cola despite sunny days i remember these lines cola grinned and yawned and stretched yeah all right the plays about her shes the protagonist lynsey she wanted to grab things from life that maybe you arent supposed to and she scares the shit out of me still but you got to write about what scares you otherwise its all meaningless right why does she scare you still lol asked do i have to couldnt we just have sex please dont give me a hard time lol said i have a feeling this is somehow very important she lit up why because of the reason i cant have sex with you a woman right rueful smile through the smoke what else well im glad for you i read the stuff on the website and im glad for you ok cola rolled off the bed leaned across him to the chest of drawers brought out a wine case from behind the ouzo lamp but this is gonna fuck up your nights sleep even more sunshine believe me it had the feel merrily thought of some desperate ballroom in the depression where although it was semiderelict people still came to dance against the darkness how old huw asked about originally but it was completely refurbished early last century which i expect is why it avoided being listed ingrid sollars offered a smile to huw it was thin but it was a smile in the twenty minutes or so while merrily had been with the tv people he appeared to have sought out and charmed the formidable sollars so spiky and unhelpful to frannie bliss so thatd be what huw said a century or so after they broke away from the c of e they were a new and radical movement in those days mr owen and this was one of the earliest chapels nearly as old as the one at ryeford down the valley i expect youre surrounded by the things in your part of wales not like this huw said it was big bigger than most village churches in this area coming in through the door victorian gothic like the school so not the original one there had been that numinous vacuum waft you always got when a small door opened into a disused auditorium and then what merrily always thought of as the slightly soured stench of spent spirituality ingrid sollars said since it was abandoned as a place of worship in the s its seen service as a warehouse a kind of sports hall and finally a waterbottling plant another local enterprise that bit the dust huw said water from theres a spring virtually underneath is there not a terribly reliable one unfortunately mrs sollarss weathered face seemed more open than merrily remembered her dusty bun of hair less tight no one was surprised when the business failed because things generally did you see thats the story of underhowle a short wave of industry then a long slow bloodless decline we are we were hoping for a stronger foundation this time industry supported by education so youre the historian here ingrid huw said the curator i ran a small tourist initiative here years ago when my husband was alive had a few hundred leaflets printed we had trekking ponies at the riding school then making us probably the only tourist enterprise in the village they well i suppose the committee keep me on in recognition of that pioneering initiative and as the token local and how do you feel about them turning this place into a museum im in charge of the project she said as though this effectively prevented her from commenting im the keyholder so she didnt blink and i suppose i must be unhappy about it in some way or i wouldnt have let you in merrily took a proper look around the chapel walls had been replastered and an old gallery was being rebuilt presumably for museum exhibits but the altar was long gone and the pulpit of course there were large areas of shadow resistant to the naked bulbs hanging from the ceiling on frayed black flex the bulbs twelve of them were probably highwattage but you could see all their filaments inside the straining veins of light unhappy huw prompted mrs sollars didnt expand clearly wasnt going to without some more effort on their part it would be a matter of asking the right questions the lodge family worshipped here merrily said and i think it was once actually owned by roddy lodge both the chapel and the garage were owned by the bottling company and the whole lot was sold off when they went bankrupt at the time as i recall roddy lodge had his bequest which i believe was quite substantial his father had sold the land on which the council estate was built and he bought it for a silly price and then sold this building to the underhowle development fund last year not short of money are they merrily said theyre clever at attracting grants and christopher cody puts funding into it as some sort of tax hedge the fund is administered by his solicitor ryan nye who was also roddys lawyer i didnt know that ingrid sollars said but this is a small world the same fingers in many pies she paused as youll have gathered im rather proprietorial about this village my father was the last squire i guess youd call it that and he lost most of his money through unwise investment and my family moved away i was the only one who chose to stay found it hard to separate from my roots you might say ingrid sollars was very slim and merrily thought of a small tough thorn tree on a hillside bending with the wind my ambition was to see some stability here in my lifetime ingrid said i thought perhaps foolishly that this might at last be in sight but it seems it only takes one disaster merrily said tentatively this protest crass stupid the whole things entirely out of hand and likely to draw even more unwelcome attention to something that should have been allowed to die quietly but we live in times of gracelessness and excess there was silence echoes absorbed by the dust sheets on the flagstoned floor and others draped from the gallery like the frayed and mournful curtains in a dying theatre i suppose jerome phoned you huw said told you wed been to see him mr banks said that you were attached to what he called rather disparagingly the spook squad and that hed informed you about reports of an atmosphere here that his word or yours ingrid sollars hesitated mine atmosphere merrily thought yes and it was very cold her body acknowledged it she shivered inside the duffel coat huw didnt seem aware of the atmosphere he was walking around slowly looking down shards of old plaster cracking under his shoes so this is where some of the roman stuff was discovered notably a statuette of what we think is diana ingrid sollars said it was found by piers connorcrewe about a year ago and some pottery and the usual coins more here than other places thats what connorcrewe always says not that hes as much of an expert as he likes to think but bookshop owners are often like that dont you find merrily said to huw youre thinking this was possibly the site of a roman temple arent you because of the spring aye if not also preroman thats also what connorcrewe thinks i suspect hed quite like to knock this building down just to find out for sure it makes a certain sense ingrid huw said folks think churches were no longer being built on ancient sacred sites after medieval times all the mystics and the visionaries involved in nonconformism tend to get overlooked because of the puritan element merrily shivered again she didnt like this place with its hanging shadows and straining bulbs huw turned to ingrid was it you who went to banks originally could hardly go over his head i attend his services and he said what suggested it might be better if i consulted a baptist minister in ross nice getout but you wouldnt do that would you i was hardly going to bring in an outsider when was this lass five months ago something like that when the conversion work started for the museum when the first grant came through when the builders started asking me if it was haunted because footsteps when there was nobody there laughter sniggers they said and items disappearing tools although the doors were locked each night and there were no signs of breaking and entering and you said i said quite truthfully that i had no knowledge of the former baptist chapel being haunted and then there was the accident ah one of the builders was working near the ceiling up there i think in that top corner knocking away damp plaster when he claimed the hammer was snatched out of his hand he was so shocked that he reeled away dislodging his own ladder and falling to the ground broke a hip huw looked up bloody lucky it werent his neck after the first phase mrs sollars said the firm told us they couldnt fit phase two into their schedules for at least a year in other words they were pulling out merrily asked her what did the development committee have to say about that not the kind of publicity we need get another firm think back huw said it was converted into a bottling plant when oh quite recently it didnt take long for businesses to crash in underhowle early nineties any trouble then if there was i didnt hear about it merrily said the power lines go right over here dont they did they follow the same route then i dont think anythings changed mrs sollars said but i get all that from sam good old mr hall huw said and she glanced at him sharply i dont have to share his obsession mr owen but i respect his right to have one i see huw smiled so youve got new builders in now starting on phase two in a couple of weeks you felt anything in here yourself i dont come in alone unless i really have to and if you do theres an atmosphere ill go that far you have a feeling of being observed in what way she didnt look at him directly sam says thats a symptom of electrical hypersensitivity but i certainly havent exhibited any of the others i live like him on the hill well away from the power lines so what do you think it is lass i dont know but its not a good thing would you like us to say some prayers whatever you think might help huw said but theres summat else isnt there ingrid the wine case was sealed along the top with brown parcel tape cola set it down on the hessian rug by the computer table under the window slipped a fingernail under the tape and slit it open i want free tickets for your gig for this theyll be on the door lol said if he didnt make it at least shed enjoy moira nah i didnt mean that cola said i dont want anything theyll still be on the door they knelt together on the rug cola lifted the boxs cardboard flaps so you were actually there when roddy went to the angels i wasnt i waste all that time watching you not finding a body under pierss tank and then i miss the big one some writer ok here they are she took out some books trying to hide the first one but he saw it it was a childrens bible with noahs ark on the front scary lol said thats mine im embarrassed she held the childrens bible to her chest the second book was a thick black paperback but its spine was white with fishbone creases aleister crowleys magick then a hardback the secret rituals of the oto by karl wurtz cola let this one fall open to show lol some scribblings in black biro in the margins there were two more books on kundalini serpent power and sex magic you know about this stuff a little lol noticed that since shed opened the box all the bounce had gone from her voice like a rubber ball rolling away sex magic you use the buildup to an orgasm to channel and focus energy for a particular purpose and then boom i mean ive only been a little way along that road but it is scary you just have to look at some of the people who went in for it aleister crowley i mean that guy was a total shit he was a professional shit but shes like this is lynsey oh crowley he was a pioneer he knew about real freedom he didnt give a fart for anybody do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law brilliant she actually wrote it out do what thou wilt et cetera in big gothic letters had it as a kind of frieze over her bed the oto was the magical society founded on all that is that right ordo templi orientis something like that yeah still going i think lynsey studied everything she could find and she got quite a few people into it not the oto nah she wasnt in anything but she was into everything if you see what i mean into pushing out boundaries sexual boundaries overcoming your inhibitions and breaking through to like real enlightenment overcoming pain humiliation and well revulsion sometimes she paused looking at him almost shyly coprophagia you know what that is its er an old album by the who isnt it cola grinned not really was she lol said dont ask she gathered the books into a pile see i was always having to keep stuff like this for her since the day she had a row with this guy paul who she was living with and he burned some of her books she said she didnt mind when they had fights i mean actual fights blackeye splitup stuff but she drew the line at him messing with her stuff she had two kids i think it was with paul big guy jamaican smoked dope on an industrial scale if youd told me paul had done for her in a barney i wouldntve been that surprised his ma has the kids now which is just as well if she was still with this paul lol said where did roddy lodge come in the word with is relative cola dipped back into the wine case and brought out a cardboard folder i feel better for this really i still had this stuff when she died and i thought do i take it to the cops or what but i couldnt think how it was gonna help anybody and you know you had this idea for a play see you understand another creative person i still havent decided whether to do lynsey herself kind of documentary or have a character based on her youd have to tone it down either way people wouldnt believe the you know the appetite you said good at men you ever seen her look she opened the folder and slid out a photograph but kept most of it covered up so that lol could just see the top half of a woman with frizzy black hair and deepset eyes im not a man but i could feel it sometimes you know how well did you know her from the pubs and of course from the shop from piers piers was oh yeah payment for books was how it started piers likes to interface with his customers says a bookseller should be like a good doctor or a herbalist give you advice supply you with what you need to cure your mineral deficiencies cola tried halfheartedly to wink and her eyebrow ring dipped its a bigger shop than it looks some punters get to go up into the attic or down into the basement if you see what i mean sorry im naive lol said you mean for books or yeah books books too mainly books heavy books heavier than this stuff the other activities its the old rectory mostly he also does lol tapped the books this stuff sex magic mostly he just does sex but hes up for most things nice enough guy in a lot of ways piers easygoing and he doesnt ask for too much in some departments if you want the truth you could actually feel sorry for him with lynsey cause lynsey asked for a lot and didnt always ask you know lol said you have mixed feelings about having these books around dont you aw i just you know i didnt like to think where theyd been and when we knew shed died i packed them up i mean theres a lot of stuff in there a lot of notes she made i like to think ill get round to unscrambling it all one day but not yet its too soon and she put down the childrens bible this was i just felt i wanted something like a barrier you know it was all i could get in a hurry bought it from the secondhand stall on ross market religion and innocence put it on the top and sealed the box lets put them away lol said i was gonna show you this cola held up the photo again uncovering all of it this time see lynsey used to talk about this a lot there was a time in her life when she said she was like on this big high the whole time had the most fun you could ever have the most freedom shedve been about seventeen in the colour photo lynsey davies was sitting on the grass beside a van there was a man sitting next to her lynsey wore jeans the jeans were partly unzipped the man had a hand inside the jeans the zip around his wrist the man was quite a bit older than lynsey he had curly hair and a yellowy butchers boy grin for the camera a look what ive got grin oh my god lol said cola said you dont want to stay the night do you and her voice was quite small now no youve got a girlfriend im sorry im sorry too you actually dont know the half of it cola said do you want to know the rest i know someone who might yeah cola said and thought for a while she looked momentarily very young and uncertain perhaps this is best she handed him another book a white one without a dustjacket you better take this i mean take it away ive read it some of it i dont want to read it again it was a fat pageaday diary on the front was inscribed in black by hand the magickal diary of lynsey d it doesnt follow the dates or anything she just wrote in it when she had something to say i never gave it you if anybody asks i dont think i want it back she packed up the box and put the childrens bible on top before closing the flaps she looked up at him your girlfriend shes a priest isnt she lol nodded mumford told me cola said the copper thats why you got these out isnt it lol said cola nodded tell you what why dont you take the lot shell know what do with them she tried for a wry smile which soon faded ill hang on to the kids bible big shoes the air in ledwardine was damp and chilly and jane told jenny box that she felt old felt like shed been alive for ever and knew everything the world had to tell her and it all came to nothing all you needed to know was that everybody had a banal personal agenda and after a shortlived glow everything faded into grey disillusion and the realization that anybody anybody given the circumstances would shaft you to attain something really trivial and as there was no god to intervene on behalf of justice and balance you just went through life trying to avoid getting shafted and that was it you went through life that was it nothing nothing but going through life as soon as it was out gasped into the misty village night jane couldnt believe shed said it especially to jenny box this superficial pseudospiritual business person this daytimetv phoney she felt like one of the stupid punters on jerry springer or livetime coughing up great gouts of angst like phlegm for people to say oh how disgusting thank god im not like that but jenny box didnt react as expected didnt say this was a stupid attitude for someone so young at the dawn of everything on the threshold of the great adventure and all that crap it can be a bad time jenny said when i was your age most of the time i was in a state of confusion and terror id shut myself in my room whichever anonymous room it happened to be and id shiver and cry and take pills sometimes and then at some strategic point a kind man would come along and hed go there there ill look after you youre with me now and everythings going to be all right this was when you were modelling they were standing just under the fat oak pillars of the market hall which inhabited the cobbles like some giant fossilized crustacean i left home after an unhappy experience with the priest father colm i told your mother it was a friend of mine hed had his auld hands all over but i dont suppose she was fooled oh mum hadnt mentioned this the awesome injustice of it was that although they never talked about it and they still dont my family and the whole damn community held me responsible for the downfall of a good man that figured thinking back to what eirion had gleaned from the net jenny driscoll brought up in a rigid rural catholic community and then escaping into the heartless soulless media world of a foreign country looked like a girl who bruised easily jenny said modelling yes you can model for passing fashions or you can model for old old perversions oh i was a model all right i was styled for abuse jane looked at the pale face under the white scarf lustred by the haloes of the fake gaslamps romantic in a besmirched way some women are you know quite literally this was the heartless eighties and i became the image that fuelled the fantasies of thousands of men of a certain sort a woman with the frailty of a child doll turn her upside down and listen to her cry mama mama and then make it better and they do make it better for a while but when you stop crying it isnt long before they start to miss it and they have to make you cry again and again and they dont realize the crying mechanisms all worn out and thats how the doll gets broken does this shock you at all jane well i ah but youre a modern girl youve heard it all before maybe i just havent thought about it jane admitted not really like youre bombarded from all sides with statistics and reports and people opening their hearts and theres just so much of it that it all becomes a mush you dont really hear it any more no well the thing im trying to explain the times come when i have to explain it is how i came to fancy your mother i didnt think id be explaining it to you but no matter youre the one thats here oh jane said with a tightening of the gut they walked through the deserted nighttime village through the centuries from cobbles to tarmac down church street where lucy devenish the folklorist had lived in a black and white cottage and inspired jane in all kinds of ways before dying and then down towards the modern bungalow where gomer parry lived alone now since minnie had died alone at work without nev and without even gwynneth and muriel the diggers ledwardine itself remained unhurt by any of it an organism as mum liked to call it with the joins between the ancient and the new glossed over in black and white paint and the warm lamps in the windows melting their bits of night in many ways it was the ultimate place to live a nest but that wasnt why jenny box had come that was like shed told mum because of the angel and also it seemed exactly as gareth box had said because of the angel that was mum and yet it all sounded different as jenny box talked about men and women and the church all the men who directed the religions of the world waged the holy wars leaving the women at home because the women werent strong enough to fight or strident enough to preach well thank god for that because during the time they were left behind with only the small domestic things to exercise their minds women were learning to look inwards to journey inside themselves and reach the ocean of the spirit jane struggled with this it wasnt feminism as she knew it we find the strength inside ourselves jenny said and thats the only true strength all the rest is violence shed fled the church because it had been dominated for her by male violence and shed taken refuge in the new age all those hazy places jane had been because it was all basically goddessdominated and that was how vestalia had come about we mind the hearth is what we do the altar of the home its men you see who despoiled the old simple churches so you have areas like the bull chapel in the parish church here with the tombs of brutal men and their effigies reflecting material wealth and power id surely take a jackhammer to that auld divil now and throw the pieces in the river yes said jane whod often felt the same about the sandstone effigy in the bull chapel with its eyes fully open and its arrogant little smile but while bemoaning the way it had been dragged into the male world of warfare and brutality jenny had come to miss the church the weight of it the tradition the sometimes pure beauty of it and then something happened to beckon her back one day i was in north wales alone id had well call it nervous exhaustion and id been lent a cottage to disappear there for a while and this day id walked for hours on my own trying to cool my head and it started raining and i came upon this wee church not far from the sea and it was open and so i went in to shelter twas very plain no stained glass no statues no tombs no carvings the simplicity that was a big statement in itself a huge statement and for me it was as if i was coming home again you know i was enfolded by it i think your mother would understand shes been there well not there but like somewhere similar yeah a similar church on a similarly desperate day bringing away with her what shed talked of as the vision of blue and gold the lamplit path less a calling than a beckoning whisper at a time of personal crisis and the one aspect of mums religion that jane had always understood but had mum told jenny box about the experience and had jenny box now absorbed it into her own mythology uncertainty seized jane again was she being used in some way she glanced at mrs box walking with her head down hands in the pockets of her brown rainbubbled barbour talking about why when she came back it was not to the church of rome but to the anglican church that shed been taught as a child to despise you see the strange thing was the day i went into that little celtic church though i didnt know this until afterwards that was the very day the synod or whoever it was voted to permit the ordination of women so here was i feeling the call back to christianity and here was god meeting me halfway jane stopped in the street you mean you joined the anglican church because it had accepted women as priests jenny smiled at last and wasnt that the most significant development since christ himself was on earth there was a stage jenny box told jane when shed even wondered about becoming a nun but didnt think she could handle the discipline and no she didnt really see herself becoming a priest too much of a private person but when her marriage went the way of all her other relationships she didnt elaborate perhaps she didnt need to and she was looking for a permanent bolthole it was natural to seek out somewhere with a woman priest who looked like staying the questions started hammering inside jane no listen jenny box snapped i know it sounds like i was stalking her but it isnt like that i needed to know this was the right place the right home the right hearth what are you saying a car came around the corner from old barn lane sending up spray from the gutter and some of hit jane in the face like spit what did you do i just did my research was all if were taking on a new manager for one of the shops i like to know where theyre coming from whether they fit in with the ideology of the business you had her checked out theres an agency we use in london like jane wiped her face with the sleeve of her fleece you dont mean a private investigator obviously the agency we use doesnt work out here but they subcontracted it to a local man dont look at me like that jane i needed a priest ive always needed a priest someone who could guide me on my journey into the great ocean of the spirit maybe join me there dont look at me like that its not sexual and im not mad all right jane felt suddenly lightheaded not sexual holy god girl jenny box flinched and her features appeared suddenly blurred and oblique as though shed been struck does everything have to be sexual im on the run from all that my husband is greedy violent and worse gareth yes the charming gareth who likes young girls gets off on the vulnerable who only married me because when i was thirty five there was still something about me that looked eighteen but lets not go into that oh he has a very considerable charm does gareth and a wonderfully plausible manner and it worked on me for a long time im not easy for the charm but he was good at it and i thought he wasnt like the others but you see it took god to show me what i was doing letting them bully me jane hadnt i always been attracting the kind of men who loved to bully women and me turning it to my advantage i thought figuring i could get my own way in the end by letting them dominate me which is all fine and well until the day you say no just the once and then it starts to get ugly christ does it get ugly so if you ask me what i wanted from your mother i wanted a friend was all a friend to go with me on the spiritual journey it oh god jane looked away across the street and the things humphries found out the private eye all he told me jane were good things how she helped sort out that trouble in the village over the play the things shed done as an exorcist id never even heard of a woman exorcist before a woman appointed to deal with the devil himself well this was stepping into the big shoes and how she stopped this charismatic priest who was abusing women and then helping the mentally ill guy that kind of thing jane looked up mentally ill guy robinson oh right and when i saw her what kind of a person she was so unassuming i knew she was someone i wanted to help i swear to god its no more complex than that so whatever gareth told you and jenny began talking of this recent discord over the business vestalia how gareth box had opposed her attempts to introduce a christian dimension to try and reflect in a domestic setting the spiritual simplicity shed discovered in that tiny seaside church in north wales gareth saying this was commercial suicide at the same time knowing his hands were tied because she was both the creative force and the figurehead and now the inevitable split was looming and gareth was accusing her of being brainwashed by the church by this woman priest he found out about the money jenny said money it didnt strike jane at first the money in the sack well he was salting away what he could knowing he didnt have long before the golden goose flew the pen shifting what money he could get his hands on investing in other companies so i thought why not and here was merrily in a situation where male priorities were attempting to influence her better judgement penetrating the sanctuary and he found out and then he wanted to know about merrily this woman priest whod bewitched me so when you arrived at his door the bastard mustve thought twas his birthday in all kinds of ways he didnt touch me jane said quickly wouldve happened jane if not the next time you met then the time after that the older he gets the younger they get jenny box tightened her white scarf around her head and neck another destroyer starting off i suppose trying to get information out of you anything he could use against me to blackmail me or humiliate me and then hed release the poison like a serpent and then hed bide his time and he shell give it back you know jane didnt want to hear this the money she wont keep it now shell keep it jenny said no maybe you dont know her as well as you think you do i know him jane i know him better than i ever dreaded i would i know where he came from wed better be getting back its starting to rain again jane followed her in a fog of selfdismay vaguely lit by a kind of tentative elation a rare feeling when shed been so very wrong about so much she found she was almost relishing the cold rain on her face a cleansing she needed that she felt although she wasnt sure the feeling was going to last that she needed in some way to start again at the square jenny box pointed at a long blue and white car parked in the line of vehicles directly opposite the black swan there you are see thats my man humphries thats his car but ive seen it loads of times jenny box said rather sadly when he realized who i was he became most assiduous in his inquiries perhaps anticipating regular work in the future came up with a lot of stuff i hadnt asked for some of which was useful told me things about you for instance me jane didnt know whether to feel outraged or flattered about your dalliance in the various spiritual byways the man seems like a buffoon but hes surprisingly good at what he does garrulous asks questions without you realizing theyre being asked is he as obvious as his car twice as obvious he i wanted to know about underhowle all right when i read about lodge and when i heard on the radio news that merrily was involved i asked humphries to find out what he could from his contacts on an impulse i paid him to go to underhowle god what it must be like to have unlimited money did you tell mum what you were doing jenny box shook her head i dont think shed be too happy about that jane said do you well thats what i was coming to see her about things he uncovered things i shouldve known ive been more stupid than i can say do you know at all when shell be back could be anytime shes with huw owen hes a bit bonkers to be honest they could be there all night jane listen i hope ive convinced you because ive embarrassed the hell out of myself that i only want to help her well yeah but jane felt awkward its just the website uriel yes i sent your mothers name to be put on the uriel website for people to pray for her the uriel websites an international site for promoting womens spirituality nothing at all sinister i put her name on the site because it attracts a weight of prayer from all over the world and thats what shes going to need believe me its a deepembedded evil shes confronting and she needs the angels at her shoulder jenny box stood on the edge of the square the blur was gone certainty shimmered around her now so would you tell her to come and see me please before friday before she buries that man believe me therere things she very much needs to know sure but i wasnt kidding before whatever kind of lunatic you think i am i dont care this is an awful satanic thing and its close to us all well cant you no jane youve pushed me too far as it is i wont have this going out secondhand jane nodded soberly ok ill tell her to call you in the morning thank you jane im sorry ok theres nothing to be sorry about goodnight now god bless you thanks jane turned away to walk home past the forecourt by the entrance to the church and saw the steeple rising from the middle of the ragged apple trees and then she turned back and called out did you see it did you really see an angel jenny box stopped her white scarf slipping back jane it doesnt matter what i saw it was a personal experience a confirmation its nothing to do with anyone else im not claiming to be bernadette i dont care whether anyone believes me you dont understand what im asking do you jenny came up to her they were alone in front of the lychgate jane felt suddenly forlorn jenny reached out and took both janes hands in her own jennys hands were cold yes she said i saw it jane and she was beautiful a rainy night in underhowle huw concluded in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit we pray that this building might be free from all powers of darkness spirits of evil defend from harm lord all who enter and leave through this door the words dissipated merrily thought like the smoke of a single cigarette this was huw going through the motions never leave a possibly disturbed place unblessed ingrid sollars put all the hanging bulbs out of their misery before locking the victorian oak door with one of the keys on a jailers ring she pulled at the iron handle sometimes its come open in the night how do you mean merrily looked at ingrid scratched waxed jacket practical slacks a woman who looked like she could shoe horses and change oil filters how could that happen it just has im the one who usually locks it i dont make mistakes huw leaned an elbow on the small window ledge still happening not for some months but i still check rogue energy happen i beg your pardon a church or chapel this size is an amplifier for energy and when a place has been used for worship it accumulates when you take away the prayer wheres it go if its left derelict the energy might turn negative if the worships replaced by something antisocial or irreligious it definitely will merrily stared at him did he actually believe that a springwater bottling plant ingrid sollars said sceptically hmm huw inclined his head would you happen to know who the people are who ran this enterprise ingrid i do know them ingrid said guardedly theyre running a similar operation in the usk valley is it important think you could get them on the phone tonight i could try she opened the modern porch door outside it was raining in the distance merrily could still hear a chant of roddys body out it was irregular now and punctuated with laughter if you could do that huw said to ingrid happen you could find out the name of the contractor who did the conversion merrily said what meanwhile huw said theres the other thing come on now ingrid youve been on the brink of telling us ingrid sighed actually mr owen ive been hoping the person concerned would come over herself i did ask her people get coy sometimes lass who is it ingrid hesitated a girl schoolgirl parents know i think so wheres the problem then not like were the police is it merrily thought shed rather face the police than huw in this mood the mother wore a purple fleece top crushedvelvet trousers greentinted hair and a gold nosestud on a chain they were just having a bit of fun together she said youre only young once arent you you didnt realize how much things had changed merrily thought until you heard that from a parent the attitude seemed to be that they were going to do it anyway so why erect barriers she thought about jane and eirion perhaps the most you could ask for was that your kids should wait until the age of consent and that there should then be a degree of emotional commitment merrily wanted to get home she felt cold and anxious huw was clearly in no hurry so you found the door open he said to the girl he and merrily were sharing a red leather sofa in the front room of number goodrich close where the central heating could have sustained tropical lizards who wants to be a millionaire was on tv nobody had turned that down either i didnt want to go in right zoe franklin said but martin had been to the pub and he was feeling brave zoe was a seriousminded girl according to ingrid sollars doing alevel maths and sciences in ross university material not an imaginative girl that was what merrily thought ingrid had been trying to convey zoes longtime boyfriend had been martin brinkley two or three years older a junior bank clerk and a good lad generally if they wanted to keep people out why didnt they just lock it mrs franklin demanded shed told them that zoes dad and zoes brother curtis had gone on the roddy lodge demo pub more likely mrs franklin said ingrid had said that zoes mother wouldnt have minded much if zoe had stuck with martin brinkley got herself pregnant and forgot about all this university rubbish because that was likely to cost them wasnt it ingrid said zoes parents were what you would have regarded as typical underhowle parents typical at least of the prefergus era what had you heard about the place zoe huw asked i thought it was all stupid zoe wore jeans and a tshirt and an anxious expression its just one of those stories that goes around the school it was supposed to be haunted and they said that when the ghost was there the door would be open so if you tried the door thats the old oak door inside the porch and opened for you you could go in and something would be waiting there and what had people seen nothing really they just said you could feel it watching you what did you feel martin ill bet mrs franklin said and rocked with laughter you wanner make us a cup of tea mam zoe said patiently im here as your responsible adult jesus zoe said that was when the police had curtis in this is the church for christs sake please mrs franklin stalked out and zoe grabbed the remote and switched off the tv they wanted to sue the development committee because i had bruises they thought they could make some money out of it thats why i didnt say anything except to mrs sollars they didnt believe the other stuff anyway thought i was making it up my parents cant believe anybody actually tells the truth like i was going to come and see you tonight but i didnt want any of them to know the protesters merrily could stand the heat no longer and shrugged off her coat its all stupid zoe said its mr and mrs lodge who are going to suffer whatve they ever done to anybody it had been raining and zoe didnt fancy going on the back of martins motorbike in that kind of weather thanks very much and while they were thinking about what to do theyd gone into the chapel porch to shelter for a bit and martin had grinned and said i wonder if its open tonight it was one of those myths that took hold modern folklore almost always passed on by children martin brinkley had heard it from his younger brother who said hed heard it from a boy whod gone in with his girlfriend and shed been so frightened shed let him do it zoe had said dont be stupid and lets go and things like it that but martin had already had a pint in the pub with his mates and he was you know a bit skittish hed tried the door and would you believe it hey martin had gone in dont be stupid zoe had shouted from the porch silence martin hadnt come out dont be so bloody stupid zoe had cried and had taken a step inside and bang the door had slammed behind her and zoe had screamed and martins arms had come around her dont be scared im here and shed had to laugh and then theyd started kissing and you know well the door was open look and it wasnt as if there was anything they could damage in there the place was already gutted but it was dry and cleaner than zoe would have expected and it wasnt that cold and where else was there to go on a rainy night in underhowle so theyd fetched a rug from the box on martins bike though actually the truth was that zoe hadnt liked it in there from the first but what could she say without looking like a wimp why exactly didnt you like it lass it was as if the walls had eyes you know as if they were bulging inwards to make sure they didnt miss anything you could like feel it even though you couldnt see much just the light in the windows now i know that sounds stupid but at one point because i was so convinced someone was watching us i made martin put all the lights on even though people might see them from outside if it was me idve been hoping people would see merrily said yeah zoe smiled gratefully actually it was worse somehow with the lights on because of all the shadows which made it seem like the walls really were swelling she moved her hands in and out like an accordionist you felt there was something there inside there with us that wanted the lights on so it could see us so we put them out again you didnt actually see anything though merrily asked no what about the temperature did you feel it was especially cold colder in some areas than others say maybe i dont know really it was all cold i didnt want to stop there at all but martins putting his arms round me and hed rolled up these dust sheets which were fairly clean and oh i dont have to talk about this stuff do i of course not wed just like to know when anything happened that you werent expecting yeah well i wouldnt let him go any further anyway i said no thats it ive had enough this is stupid and i got up to go i remember getting up and then zoe closed her eyes for a moment and in the botanicalgarden heat merrily actually saw goose bumps appear on the girls arms i was just thrown back really roughly back on to the dust sheets thats when i got the bruises yeah and i wasnt afraid then so much as you know startled and angry im like geddoff you dull bugger merrily said did you when you were thrown back feel anybody actually touch you yeah i i think so but i didnt really have time to because i couldnt breathe you know i was choking there was suddenly this awful pressure on my throat what kind of pressure zoe huw said what did you actually feel zoe rubbed her arms i couldnt exactly say it was hands i couldnt say it felt like hands but i thought of hands i thought of these rough whats the word callused kind of hands and dirty and what i heard this was the very worst moment i can tell you i actually heard martins voice he was going like whats up with you what you doing and his voice was like a long way away i mean what five six metres and im trying to shout scream and all i could make were these little rattly noises like snorting and i was absolutely bloody terrified i bet merrily said i thought i was gonner die i thought i was gonner die there and then you believe me yes youre like a vicar too yeah mmm and ill tell you something else martin he ent got hands like that he works in a bank zoe nodded towards the door lowered her voice they still dont believe me not really sometimes i think i dreamed it you know that we fell asleep in there or something but i cant have i wasnt comfortable in there you know not from the start what happened in the end zoe merrily asked martin put the lights on and there was nothing there how far were you from the lights bout four metres could you still feel the pressure as he was putting the lights on when the lights went on i could breathe it wasnt martin it definitely wasnt martin and there was nobody else in there i swear to god did you have any marks on your neck zoe huw asked no well redness maybe but no bruises like youd expect listen can you tell me what happened ive heard some of this stuff mr hall talks about and im doing physics at a level so i mean ive been trying to tell myself this was all caused by electromagnetism and radio waves on my brain that maybe like he says there is some problem caused by like intersection of electrics from the power lines and signals from the tv booster and the mobilephone transmitters merrily looked at huw aye he said its possible then what are you doing here zoe said an old land rover was parked outside the house its lights flashed once and a rear door opened for them ingrid sollars was at the wheel sam hall next to her if this was daylight he said youd see the goddam pylon right at the back of the house and youd see the tv booster across the valley the existing mobilephone transmitters in the wood across there and the big new one ingrid switched on the engine creating foundry sounds this is the reverend owen sam and i really dont think he believes this begins and ends with electricity more sick people on this estate than you could otherwise account for how dya do reverend owen and melanie pullman lived right over there end of the turning circle the turning circle was jammed with cars so ingrid sollars had to reverse off the estate she drove them back into the centre of the village where a few people still hung around and the placard saying keep satan out was propped against a lamppost sam leaned over the back of his seat ingrid of course would actually prefer this whole thing to be down to satan ingrid pulled in behind merrilys volvo what he means is that ingrid would prefer it not to have been caused by something the removal of which would damage the progress of this village out of the dark ages we need communications and we need all those computers and we need the power to make them work at the moment a child as bright as zoe franklin is the exception in her age group in ten years time shell be the norm its the main source of argument between us sam said i dont believe this is progress if its gonna kill off half the people and give the rest waking nightmares thats a ridiculous exaggeration sure it is at present huw said you talk to the springwater people ingrid ingrid switched off the engine it subsided with noises like the collapsing of metal plates yes i did i said the development committee had limited funds and would very much like to know the name of the contractors they employed in the original conversion and they said they didnt have a phone number but they were pretty sure this particular contractor was no longer available i bet they couldnt remember his name either ingrid said what do you propose to do about this mr owen i intend to discuss it with my colleague here who i hope will allow me to be involved in tomorrows funeral tomorrow dont spread it around eh youre a bastard huw merrily realized she was driving too fast and her foot stabbed the brake the rain had stopped but the night clouds hung low and sombre as the lights of ross began to flower around them me mam never tried to hide it huw said placidly for a start you knew what zoe was going to tell us ingrid told me about it while you were messing with the tv people she didnt give me the name then though but you had to make the kid go through it again cathartic lass anyroad i wanted you to hear it you might notve believed me a few tools disappearing and a bloke punched off a ladder doesnt amount to much i wanted you to feel that sense of being watched and the rest of it it doesnt prove anything nothings ever proven merrily drove slowly through the medieval centre of ross behind the ancient sandstone market house the church rising on her left roofs glistening you even knew who the contractor was the good mumford and his contacts huw said ear to the ground that lad a respectable springwater firm would hardly like it broadcast nobody wants to be known as having employed him having been to the pub with him a time or two and certainly not you wasted ingrids time i wanted her to hear it and i wanted you to hear it from her because you didnt want me to think it was all down to you huw said nothing which it is of course who else cared enough huw said consider huw said consider cromwell street gloucester a street full of flats and bedsits and therefore young people in need of cheap accommodation coming and going moving out and moving in and the top rooms in number twentyfive were the cheapest of the lot police had actually traced about a hundred and fifty former tenants some of whom had paid no more than a fiver a week so it was a haven for itinerant kids some of whom might otherwise be sleeping in cardboard boxes in shop doorways some actually said it was the happiest safest time of their adult lives being in cromwell street being part of fred and roses big family with all that this involved looked back on it with real nostalgia strange and yet not so strange because it was an organism was cromwell street huw said and fred loved it for that it was endofterrace tall and narrow three storeys plus cellars plus attics built like a person and fred knew all its private parts where the wires went where the pipes went he liked to feel the presence of the bodies in there bodies live and dead bodies became part of the fabric of that place said huw who had studied it all in nauseating depth bodies not people because fred basically was not interested in people only their bodies cromwell street a bargain flophouse a free brothel and a burial chamber and fred loved it loved messing with it altering this and that contriving bodging he turned one room into a primitive cocktail bar the black magic bar they called it with optics on the bottles and a big mural of a caribbean beachscape it was the first real house hed ever owned got it for seven grand but it needed renovation it needed a builder needed him and hed keep working on it whenever he had the time extending it building new bits fabricating this concreting that building himself into that house putting his consciousness into it such as it was freds consciousness was basement stuff huw said fred thought about sex all the time talked about sex most of the time he was awake and if the walls in cromwell street all had eyes they were freds eyes eyes and ears microphones and speakers video cameras so fred could absorb the sights and sounds of sex squeals of ecstasy upstairs sobs of fear and despair in the cellars the dungeons cromwell street throbbed with it the house that fred built full of freds porno pictures freds porno videos freds tools and the dead and they knocked it down huw said that were all they could think of to do with it afterwards there was talk of having a memorial garden for the victims but nobody wanted to be reminded what had happened there so the council had knocked it down and built a walkway with street lamps so that nobody would know it had even been there so you could walk past where it had been walk over it as a short cut to the centre of gloucester theyd turned it into another small extension to the old roman street plan that still lay at the heart of the city one of the bestpreserved roman street patterns anywhere in britain glevum the roman name for gloucester meant place of light the darkest corner of the place of light gone but where had fred gone the man who was so attached to the flesh and to gadgets and tools and working with his hands the man with no morals no sensitivity no spark of spirituality a oneman definition of the term earthbound where was fred the man who remained unconvicted who had cheated justice who was said to have sat in his cell between interrogations and dreamed of cromwell street where was whatever remained of fred this is crazy merrily said is it you know about lodge youve been in his bungalow youve seen his facsimile of the black magic bar youve seen the buried cuttings and the photo of him and lynsey davies on the sofa posing like fred and rose all i know is lass there were too much holding him to cromwell street and they took it away first they took his kids away then they took the dead away and they took him away and he couldnt cope with that and then when he was dead and burned and sprinkled over much marcle they took the house itself away his creation huw merrily was finding it hard to breathe this is a notorious killer of the lowest kind who i dont believe you can lay a man like that so easily to any kind of rest i expected traces who in the end avoided the processes of the law i expected traces in the fields at marcle but i shouldve realized he didnt like it there because it was a village and everybody knew your business he liked to watch not be watched and now nobody can get at him merrily said all the relatives of the dead denied justice all the relatives of the missing wholl never know for sure never no huw said and nobody can get at him except she was gripping the wheel tightly with both hands except perhaps for you and i wonder what the christian deliverance study group would think of whatever you have in mind huw didnt reply merrily drove slowly over wilton bridge towards the bypass and the moon edged out for a moment and glimmered in the wye vampires the van pulls up in the tesco car park where it backs on to the bus station just the other side of the little wall and jane sees him getting out and she has to smile coming towards her pointing with his stubby right forefinger a loose semigrin on his face plastic carrier bag hanging from his left hand hes actually not badlooking in the right light for his age in this gypsyish sort of way in this earthy sort of way which youd probably call coarse if you were snobby and middleclass and buttonedup which jane definitely is not well well he says i thought it was you janes been waiting for her bus to ledwardine and its late and theres nobody else waiting in the north hereford queue and in fact she was beginning to wonder if shed missed it bugger going to be late so she needs to ring mum but shes left the mobile at home again and if she goes off to phone and the bus comes shell be stuffed how you doing then girl im ok fred you busy up to the eyes as usual look but that ent no bad thing looking her up and down with the old saucy wink youve grown ent you how old you now seventeen jane rolls her eyes over the hill he smirks in delight well

attached well shes probably ok now at this moment jane says doubtfully but shell be mad as hell if it turns out ive missed this bus and shes late for her communion class missed your bus is it bugger its ok therell be another three in about two hours well now hang on he purses his lips thinking just you hang on a mo jane ledwardine ennit im off up to wosser name weobley look so how fars that from ledwardine no distance is it if we goes back along the ole brecon road no time at all hey listen i got rose in the van too you ent met rose did you janes actually curious to know what freds wifes like the way he went on about her this great big bundle of fun always ready for a laugh day or night know what i mean but in the van when jane gets in its actually quite decent of him to do this she knows what hes like always on the go always another job lined up do anything for anybody rose doesnt seem like that at all bit frumpy actually got this kind of high whiny voice still she seems friendly enough in her way just not as instantly outgoing as fred as is often the case with wives of really extrovert guys freds leaning across apologizing to rose now i know you wont mind my love not really but we gotter drop jane off in ledwardine take us nmoren five minutes out of our way i promise you all right in the back there jane if you moves them tools in the black bag theres an ole mattress be more comfortable for you thats it the van rattling out of hereford now and into the country up towards stretton sugwas rose taking the occasional glance back at jane to make sure shes ok in the back theres a strong smell of oil in here and sweat a working van jane remembers the problem with fred is hes always working so hard he doesnt get that much time for baths as he was the first to admit when he was putting in their new shower at the vicarage oughter ave a quick one now jane test him out look you wanner get in there with me scrub me back hed said little grin and a wink to show he didnt really mean it totally faithful to rose is fred not that he dont get a few offers mind beggin for it some of these housewives have you up the ole stairs in no time at all you dont watch it so hows wossername the welsh boy irene calling back over his shoulder as he drives you still goin with him you know what they says about the welsh that true jane you found out yet i bet you bloody ave girl i seen the look in your eyes you all right back there sorry about the state tell you what ill move that ole the van stops jane notices hes pulled off the road and driven through an open field gate and looking between the front seats through the windscreen she can see that theres a thick hedge now between the van and the road and shes thinking why are we whats he stopping for they havent been on the road five minutes then the rear doors creak open and fred climbs in with her hes wearing his old overalls the smell of sweat is very strong now hes holding a roll of wide brown tape that hes pulled from the tool bag he isnt smiling any more hes got this intent look on his face like when he was sizing up the bathroom wall working things out there are little points of light so far back in his bulblike eyes its as if theyre actually shining from somewhere inside his brain what are you an amazed fear shoots up through janes body and with that first lilt of it in her voice she sees that something has happened the little lights have filled up freds eyes making them glow as if theyre veined with filaments and his teeth are bared the whole atmosphere in the van has changed become charged fred and rose connecting now like jump leads on a battery sparks bouncing between them then this great big bunched fist knuckles like ballbearings thrusts up like a greased piston on a machine and smacks jane thunderously in the mouth she can feel the blow echoing in her skull then theres this kind of timelapse and the next thing shes on her back tasting salty blood smelling this overwhelming sweat smell fred on top of her taping her wrists together his lips drawn back teeth set in concentration breath coming in efficient little spurts and then satisfied with his wristtaping hes saying you dint ave no dad to show you whats what did you jane me and rose gonner help you out now look be thankin us you will you and that welsh boy wossername irene show you whats what where the bits goes you little smart bitch merrily spasmed and jerked up in bed the light was still on and happy like murderers was spread spineup on the duvet it was ten past two in the morning and the experience had been so shatteringly vivid that she had to get out of bed and go rushing up to janes apartment to stand panting in the doorway listening to the kids breathing afterwards at the top of the stairs she felt so faint that she had to go down on her knees head in her hands her hair was matted her skin felt like latex and shed have to have a shower even if it sent the pipes into a strangled symphony under the water she relived the unspeakable through the split consciousness in the dream that had been scripted by her reading the absolute insanity of reading that stuff until sleep had blurred the filth in the dream part of her had been jane and yet she was there too invisible and helpless as janes mum knowing what jane could not know knowing what was going to happen what had happened over and over again fred and rose feeding off fear sexual vampires merrily thought about the mothers of the known victims all the stricken mothers who had to read about it had to know had to be there with their daughters at least once in the greasy bloodsmelling semensmelling darkness in fred and roses cellar which was not there any more a oneman definition of the term earthbound was it conceivable that whatever had been inside fred whatever had ignited the bilious filaments of evil in those eyes could be passed on could jump the way the electricity had jumped into roddy lodge from live coils around the insulators on the pylon into someone receptive and was it as some deeply troubled part of huw might need it to be something beyond the human wearing a clean white tshirt under her towelling robe merrily crept up the stairs to check on jane again the kid had seemed to be genuinely asleep when she and huw had arrived back at the vicarage just after midnight behind the front door theyd found a brown paper bag containing a white hardbacked notebook labelled the magickal diary of lynsey davies and a note from lol that said its all here you dont even need to read between the lines when shed shown huw to his room hed taken the diary with him she wondered what his nightmares had been like as she stood looking down at jane she thought the kids eyes opened briefly but then they closed again and she turned over onto her side and merrily slipped out she stopped by the top landing window with its view through the trees to the village square and the allnight lantern on the front of the black swan and then she knelt in her long white tshirt and prayed for guidance slow and intense from far inside herself inside her heartcentre in the emotional silences back there part six countless repetitive murderers have said that they felt they were in the grip of something foreign that something strange came over them which they could not resist at the time of the offences i dont know what got into me priests do know of course brian masters she must have known a hundred years from now we will look back at pylons as relics of the midth century it probably wont happen in five or ten years but eventually a new generation will come along change things and wonder why we did nothing denis henshaw professor of physics bristol university fun palace it was down at the bottom of ross town centre among a cluster of antique shops and still hard to find it had a door with no glass and one narrow window with no actual books in it just a small sign on a greying card piers connorcrewe bookseller frannie bliss found the discretion interesting porn gorra be how else is he gonna make any kind of a living word of mouth merrily said the internet you can turn over a weeks income on about four books if you know what youre doing so im told were not talking john grisham here are we bliss pushed at the door it didnt give try the bell frannie hard porn mark my words bliss pressed a black button in the white door ive been summoned by the way fleming merrily looked up the hill towards the market house where clouds were massing like bonfire smoke it was not yet eleven am it was only a matter of time he knew i was still around well obviously wants to see me in hereford at four this afternoon which is ominous anything heavy you say it late afternoon limits the victims options he thinks aw sod it ill go and get pissed instead im guessing formal suspension this time what sort of case have they got for that hes been heard to say if bliss wants to be a private eye im not going to hold him back any longer and hell have stuff going way back i never claimed to be the divisional mr popular what does kirsty say kirsty left last night merrily back to the farm with the kids frannie no the door opened a woman of maybe twentysix stood there sorry were a bit behind this morning she had short hair bleached white and a silver ring in her left eyebrow bliss smiled bleakly at her mr connorcrewe in is he like he hadnt phoned first to make sure of it hes unpacking some books upstairs if you want to hang around for a couple of minutes you trade collector bliss said beano annuals mainly yeah bliss flashed his card di bliss west mercia oh right she seemed unsurprised go through officer ta they went in merrily holding the plastic carrier bag with hereford cathedral on it the window had been deceptive the building was narrow but deep a darkening tunnel of shelves arrowed signs indicated two other floors the woman stood at the bottom of some narrow wooden stairs hey you know mumford so this is where he gets his first editions she grinned ill tell piers so its di bliss and er merrily watkins merrily said thinking cola french the whitehaired woman stopped on the second step turned with a hand on the rail and inspected her merrily wore her best coat over the black cowlneck sweater the cross concealed yeah the woman said sadly oh well and carried on upstairs leaving bliss peering curiously at merrily if you go straight down youll find an alcove on your left with some chairs cola french called back criminal historys right at the bottom but er theologys in the cellar bound to have read them all anyway merrily said what bothered merrily most was that she hadnt seen jane not to speak to shed overslept and it had been nearly nine am when shed staggered into the kitchen to find a note on the table mum ive gone just in case youre vaguely interested its lols gig tonight at the courtyard so ive taken a change of clothes with me and ill carry on to hereford on the school bus if you dont make it there later ill just have to thumb a lift back or something so dont let it interfere with your spiritual schedule or anything j and jenny box called shed like to talk to you you should she wouldnt actually thumb a lift of course merrily had said later to huw this is just a gentle dig with a bayonet huw said no for jane this is a gentle dig huw had refused to eat breakfast or to drink tea hed drunk one glass of water was this a fast purification in anticipation of what merrily had eaten half a slice of toast and felt guilty then shed gone into the scullery and looked up the number for ingrid sollars she had in front of her lols note which said the pcc mentioned in the diary is piers connorcrewe if you feel you have to go and see him please dont go on your own this morning lol had phoned filling in some gaps bless him the phone at ingrids place had been picked up by sam hall which didnt surprise her a lot merrily had asked sam some straight questions about his former colleague on the underhowle development committee before leaving the vicarage shed left a message on profs answering machine asking if lol or even prof himself could keep an eye open for jane tonight left a similar message on their own machine for the kid to pick up if she rang in just in case this situation proved more complex as now seemed likely piers connorcrewe plump and moonfaced and cheerful wore his baggy cream suit over a denim shirt with a frayed collar one of those men merrily thought who might greet you in pyjamas always confident that youd be blinded by the aura of his personality his intellect merrily watkins how nice and back in your role as consultant to the herefordshire constabulary bliss stood up di francis bliss we havent met no indeed im afraid i was working late the night you encountered the committee connorcrewe went to sit behind the desk which filled half of this dimly lit airspace between bookshelves he motioned bliss and merrily to a couple of battered smokers chairs the alcove seemed to serve as his office there was a phone on the desk a vintage cranenecked electric lamp and a large book on roman pottery well now he said if this is about what i think its about let me first apologize that the police were not informed about last nights demonstration however he opened his hands neither was the committee seems to have been entirely impromptu grassroots protest therefore any damage is not why were here said bliss weve come to ask your advice about a book whether you think its authentic that kind of thing piers connorcrewe inclined his big head to one side and raised an eyebrow bliss turned to merrily who placed her hereford cathedral carrier bag on the desk and extracted the white book the magickal diary of lynsey d piers leaned over and looked at it but didnt touch it and where did you acquire this inspector bliss pick it up if you like sir oh dear me no one never knows about journals like this bliss turned to merrily whats he mean by that mrs watkins i think he means there might be some sort of protective curse around it like king tuts tomb that sort of thing no problem then for a man like me with buggerall left to lose bliss opened the book turned it round to face connor crewe pulled the lamp over switched it on and directed its cuplike shade at the page the light illuminated one of the pages of complexlooking tables and correspondences all meticulously drawn in differentcoloured inks whats this about sir what are all these funny little squiggly things connorcrewe coughed those would be sigils inspector what one might call condensed spells configurations of particular desires alphabetically and numerically reduced to their basics for ah intensity of focus spells this is what might be described as someones magical wishlist would you be able to decode it yourself sir possibly to an extent given time youre an expert on the occult then in a largely academic way theres a very significant international trade in old books on ceremonial magic and ritual something no antiquarian dealer can afford to ignore you handle a lot of them it probably accounts for up to twenty per cent of my trade perhaps even more but you didnt want to handle this one connorcrew smiled when i said that i was being a little ironic the socalled magical diary because you knew where this one had been the magical diary is a very personal and private document often considered to be a magical tool in itself i see im not sure you do inspector but i dont suppose it matters in a strictly forensic sense so youve never seen this before occasionally one appears on the market but in the case of this one i can safely say no but you did know its owner oh did i my information is that she was a regular customer who even helped out here sometimes in one way or another connorcrewe flipped the book shut and glanced at the cover ah of course bliss smiled like a wintry sun you remember poor woman said connorcrewe what exactly was your relationship with the late lynsey davies bookseller and customer sleep with many of your customers sir connorcrewe sighed some merrily blinked inspector a bookseller is not like other retailers a good bookseller will very quickly develop an intimacy with his regular clients based on his feeding of their intellectual desires and if it should progress beyond that level well if theres an element of misconduct that might apply in the case of say a doctor and patient then im afraid im not aware of anything similar concerning the book trade youre a slippery bastard arent you sir bliss said connorcrewe frowned bliss said lynsey sometimes lived with you at the old rectory is that correct occasionally stayed with me would be more correct overnight quite a formidable woman thats fair comment been around i wouldnt doubt it bliss tapped the book who taught who about this stuff connorcrewe thought about it when she first came to me for magical literature i would say her knowledge was at best rudimentary but she had the persistence and it would seem the time to devote to the subject after a year or two i would say that her knowledge certainly her practical ability far outweighed mine practical ability merrily said mmm connorcrewe smiled at her with indulgence we may be getting into areas merrily that you as a christian would find repugnant let me remind you however that magic is an entirely legal discipline that functions these days all over the free world largely unhampered by the secrecy that stifled it for centuries yes i have practised magic its a wonderful mental exercise it expands the being bliss turned to merrily thats put you in your place vicar its no big secret inspector there are even a number of furthereducation seminars on ritual magic at various colleges but what youre saying merrily said is that while you have an extensive theoretical knowledge of esoteric practices lynsey davies was what you might call a natural connorcrewe looked pained she was a strongwilled woman who was able to summon to an enviable degree the kind of concentration required for the visualization exercises that are crucial to the successful practice of magic by successful bliss said you mean actually making things happen i would say rather helping to move events towards the most satisfactory conclusion frannie bliss nodded doubtfully but to go back to my earlier question where did she get it from did she suddenly show up at your shop and say here piers i fancy a go at that you gorra couple of basic primers on the shelf now look connorcrewe leaned back arms folded across his chest his normally generous mouth had shrunk into an expression of petulance ive been patient with you inspector bliss but i think that before i answer any more of these questions i have a right to ask you what this is all about mr crewe i thought this was understood im investigating a murder whose you tell me bliss said maybe there are some i dont know about lol had been aware of prof levin watching him for some minutes youre beginning to worry me prof said lol put the electric tuner back in its case the washburn was now in tune with the boswell hed keep tuning them through the day its the fear prof said lol had run through three songs in the studio the river frome song kivernoll and the acidic rocker heavy medication day he figured that was going to be enough this after all was a moira cairns concert he thought the songs which nobody would ever have heard before had sounded acceptable just wheres the fear prof demanded what have you done with the fucking fear lol looked up he was alone on the studio floor prof was up behind the mixing board moira had gone into ledbury to buy some things and bring back some lunch for them lol had been running through the songs and at the same time wondering what correlation there might be between magic and the side effects of electricity experienced by people like mephisto jones and roddy lodge this will do you no good laurence what wont popping pills so far in advance i was hoping you might make it without them but eight nine hours before you go on believe me this is not professional lol contemplated the ceiling then whats the matter with you prof came down to the studio floor he was wearing his king of the hill tshirt with a cardigan over the top its twenty years give or take since you last did this you were a boy then now youre a man approaching middle age my advice and ive seen this before with other people although not in such an extreme situation as yours is to do the screaming now but not so hard you damage your voice because if you bottle it up until just before you go on youre gonna balls this big time throw it all away pouf hey you listening to me lol said prof mephisto jones you think hed mind if i phoned him frannie bliss said i dont know much about sex magic but i do know that lynsey had quite a reputation locally as a bit of a goer which might explain what attracted her to this particular discipline as distinct from say transcendental meditation or the jehovahs witnesses stupid and simplistic assumption connorcrewe said bliss nodded do you know much about lynseys early life did you know for instance that she went to college in gloucester and then dropped out after less than six months and became a prostitute in the city i do a certain amount of business in gloucester connor crewe said not that kind not a career prostitute as such bliss said but she needed money and somewhere dry to sleep and eventually like many other hardup young folk in gloucester in the s and s she found this dead convenient place not far from the centre cheapest in the city it was said merrily was aware of movement behind the shelves either there were mice or cola french was listening specializing in accommodation for shall we say liberal minded young things bliss said the gloucester fun palace perfect refuge for a big girl who liked trampling on taboos inspector what are you we dont know how long she was living there but she seems to have fitted into the domestic arrangements all too well really took to it you know the atmosphere of tolerance merrily said you could form meaningful friendships there with one another and also with the proprietors if you didnt like the idea of that you probably left quite soon or or you stayed until someone dug you out bliss said sorry uncalled for but if you dont know what were talking about now you mustve been so stuck into the old books that you never read a single newspaper in the mids connorcrewes football face darkened if youre telling me that lynsey davies spent some time at cromwell street no bliss said im asking if you knew shed been at cromwell street the answer to that is no of course bliss said the vast majority of people couldve had absolutely no idea how far it went with fred and rose but we do know that one or two of the residents over the years had a strong interest in various occult practices of a kind probably not demonstrated at most colleges of further education so it seems not unlikely that it was there that lynsey was first introduced to the concept of sexual magic if she was there take it from me bliss said or take it from this he stabbed the diary with a thumb inspector bliss connorcrewes smile was like elastic overstretched i wouldnt take anything from that account my experience of magical diaries is that they contain a considerable amount of fantasy often less a record of what actually happened than a rather faulty memoir of what the diarist would like to have happened and i have to say youd have to be a strange kind of person sir to fantasize that youd been to cromwell street and had a sexual relationship with the mass murderer frederick west i have to say that i do not see what possible bearing any of this could have on the presumed murder of melanie pullman did i mention miss pullman sir no but so stop trying to change the subject you see my information is that for lynsey davies the period at cromwell street was the most exciting time of her life a lot of youngsters said something similar mustve been a terrible comedown when she had to leave then why did she well im only guessing here bliss said but id imagine that at some stage lynsey saw the writing on the wall not freds writing roses rose had lesbian tendencies and girls were often shared rose was a bully and this was roses house in lynsey youve gorra big girl with a forceful personality not the kind to be used as a plaything fred and rose i think its fair to say that under different circumstances it could just as easily have been fred and lynsey maybe there just wasnt room for two big insatiable women piers connorcrewe listened without uttering a word as if his interest was academic piers was useful sam hall had said on the phone because he had extensive marketing knowhow having been in publishing and of course he knew a great deal about ancient and roman history in the background merrily had heard ingrid saying brusquely man fancies himself as nero if you ask me so there we are sir bliss said for lynsey the end of a golden era the most excitement shed ever had and now shes got to go back to the boring old forest of dean as i understood it connorcrewe said she had a relationship with a man and at least one child which she seems to have rehomed like with kittens she was very good at that apparently then she came to work in ross as a barmaid i think where she pursued her interest in the dark arts acquiring some books from this little treasure house and usually paying im told in kind connorcrewes eyes flared thats irrelevant the point is you had a relationship with her founded on a mutual interest in the occult whether commercial or private and she spent time at your old rectory full of bedrooms which in a strange kind of way mustve rekindled a few happy memories for lynsey perhaps sparked a few ideas connorcrewes hand came down hard on the desk that is an utterly outrageous piece of gossip in the village of underhowle said bliss mr connorcrewe and his house parties and all those young guests i think i ought to telephone my solicitor dont you the ubiquitous mr nye sir who is perhaps not quite as young as he looks and probably likes a good party himself and is doubtless well acquainted with the law relating to slander bliss looked blank what did i say i think you accused me of allowing lynsey davies to use my home to recreate whatever filth took place twenty years ago in cromwell street i think thats your dirty mind at work sir but if you say so anyway ms davies soon became interested in another property bliss flicked over a couple of pages in the magical diary in between the impenetrable esoteric formulae the text was an uneven record of what lynsey considered to be significant episodes in her spiritual development these entries at least were very clear handprinted and phrased in a schoolgirlish mixture of the colloquial the portentous and the breathless prose of the romantic pulp novel we have been bound together by the stars and i knew we would meet again and so it has come to pass saw him in ross yesterday after ten years and it turns out hes working locally and he took me to see the place which he says he has already become attached to i was immediately picking up a powerful energy there and feel certain its on the sight of pagan roman worship with blood sacrifice we could do really incredible stuff there the two of us to reawaken the power it is just mindblowing how things work out just when you need a buzz in your life whos she talking about here mr crewe once again why would i know because if she was in underhowle i think youd have known about it and what she was doing i take it you know which building shes referring to i can only guess the baptist chapel where i understand you yourself have discovered roman remains was it you who told lynsey it was the site of an ancient roman temple i may have done its an interest of mine and was it an interest of hers she was interested in anywhere she thought might have been used for ancient and mysterious rituals she was romantic in that way merrily thought about jane who would also have been fascinated would have once she said lynsey seems to have been very excited by the idea that the site was used for blood sacrifices did you tell her that i doubt it i told you my interest is largely academic it may have been say a mithraic temple but nothings been found there to suggest that so why would i have told her something for which there was no archaeological evidence you might just have enjoyed getting her excited bliss said mildly and connorcrewe came out of his chair i have taken enough of this mélange of illinformed speculation and cheap innuendo he gripped the desk leaning across so you can either get to the point or get out frannie bliss didnt move imagine how lynsey feels when she finds that this ancient site of pagan rites and blood sacrifice is currently the workplace of her favourite builder sex maniac amateur abortionist and who knows what else she knew about him anyway the man whod given her the times of her life ten years earlier and this time no wife around just the two of them connorcrewe sat down with his arms folded gazing beyond bliss at the walls of books i know nothing about this bliss said the indications in the diary are that the atmosphere of the place sparked something off between them see this was a woman fascinated with the high priest of sex magic the late aleister crowley selfstyled great beast of the s or whenever it was who he faltered who merrily knows more about than me especially after last nights lengthy examination of the diary with huw crowley was another guy you could learn too much about merrily sighed he and west were both obsessed with deviant sex she said the difference is that crowley was an intellectual who had consciously made himself into what he was embracing the dark whereas west like lynsey was a natural a man with absolutely no moral sense a man who didnt even recognize what was taboo as long as he got off on it it was all right didnt philosophize about it just did it bliss added and it was west we have to assume who enabled lynsey to to free her dark side merrily said exactly filthy mind filthy hands perverse and insatiable said bliss and here he was again ten years on working on his own in this magical place obviously with the keys to the premises and now heres lynsey in there with him dont tell me you didnt know about that piers i swear connorcrewe was pale now but it might simply have been outrage i swear to god i did not know that man had even been in underhowle and i did not know about him and lynsey what sort of people came to your parties piers certainly nobody like him so you dont know what went on in the chapel while it was being converted into a bottling plant as ive already stated when the water venture failed the chapel was sold to roddy lodge and then lynsey started going out with roddy while still giving her address as the home of paul connell father of two of her children and while maintaining a friendship with you and even working here sometimes she was easily bored enjoyed variety why do you think she became interested in roddy lodge presumably because he was quite well off how should i know shed often latch on to men oh piers please she was initially interested in lodge because he was the new owner of the chapel which was now more important than ever to her after whatever she and fred did there all right connorcrewe said as if suddenly weary she did ask me if i knew lodge and whether he had anything in mind for the building i understood hed simply bought it as part of the deal for the old garage bliss was silent thinking merrily said whose idea was it to buy the chapel from lodge and turn it into a museum we we all thought it was a good idea but i imagine it was cody who said why dont we buy it both he and lodge were enjoying their wealth the ability to buy and sell and as codys solicitor was now representing the development committee it made it bliss looked up mr nye it simplified things connorcrewe said something here stinks like the inside of an efflapure bliss said but well let that go for the present what were roddy and lynsey doing in the chapel i wouldnt know that i never went in there i did ask lodges permission once to do some minor excavation of the area immediately around the chapel this was after id made some small finds coins and things in nearby fields and was roddy accommodating he even lent me his small digger to put in a couple of trenches did you find anything i found the statue of diana as we like to call it eight inches long headless not terribly well preserved but what it tells us about the site is significant right abruptly bliss stood up thank you very much sir for the moment merrily could almost feel the heat coming off bliss as he stood on the edge of the raised area around the market house in the heart of ross with traffic edging past down the hill and the rain starting he was stabbing at his mobile as if it was a detonator frannie she said why dont you just tell fleming if youre right hell see it as a selfless gesture from someone he thought wasnt capable of one but if youre wrong and he finds out he stared at her like shed suggested that he throw himself under a truck he put the phone to his ear and waited for nearly half a minute before snapping it shut in irritation yeh yeh im dog meat im already dog meat now wheres gomer merrily where can i try does he have a mobile merrily sighed he could be on his way to underhowle as the local gravedigger was refusing to dig one for lodge i thought id better make provision hes meeting huw over there about nowish the tip of blisss tongue crept to a corner of his mouth you little beauty merrily so what happened with kirsty first things first bliss said coldly void now were moving frannie bliss said in fact gomer was the only one of them moving walking slowly head down across the acre of land that ran parallel to the paddock behind roddy lodges bungalow like he was dowsing but without the divining rod planthire instinct merrily and bliss were standing up against a rotting fivebar gate snatching lunch from a bag of vegetable pasties shed bought from a healthfood shop in ross the rain had stopped but the wind was rising the sky was sepia and flecked with shrivelled leaves it was pm the stone chapel stood in front of them like a beached hulk against the light in front of the chapel stood gomers truck with the minijcb on the back piers connorcrewe had grudgingly given them permission to excavate here no real choice with bliss in this mood yet had elected not to join them which i find very odd merrily said when bliss mentioned it in passing smug publicschool twat bliss finished his pasty in a small triumphant cloud of crumbs probably gone to alert mr nye think about it merrily said if you were any kind of serious student of archaeology and the police were coming to dig up your prime site if you couldnt stop it youd at least want to watch wouldnt you so you could jump in the trench and check out anything that looked interesting in the way of archaeology prevent anything being despoiled wouldnt you bliss watched gomer bending down patting the grass so so why isnt he here did you hear him once asking you to be very careful with that digger maybe he assumes hes exhausted the site well yeah thats one possibility she looked over at the back fences of the houses in goodrich close about two hundred yards away the village sloping up behind them to the parish church which was actually only a couple of fields away the other is that he couldnt care less because there never was a site not quite following you bliss said i think merrilys implying an element of fabrication lad huw owen drank spring water from a small plastic bottle he hadnt eaten merrily felt guilty about this although huw had insisted she should eat the site of ariconium was always said to be at weston underpenyard right she pointed down the valley i mean they havent found all that much there either but that was where the evidence always pointed now when i was talking to sam hall this morning he said piers was not popular in weston which piers would always laugh about saying weston was a pretty place that had never deserved ariconium anyway underhowle however he faked it bliss stood away from the gate how would that be possible what about all the bits of pottery the statue the bits of roman pottery and mosaic are not that hard to come by lots of them about and not too expensive piers does antiquarian books and hes surrounded by antique dealers not too much of a problem to pick up a few odds and ends then either pretend to have found them or bury them for someone else to find not much of a problem convincing people either when everybody local wants to believe had me going huw admitted i were quite ready to believe the chapels on the site of a roman temple complete with spring and of course it might be exactly merrily said it might be even if they had an archaeological dig there that found nothing that still wouldnt disprove it let me get this right bliss said youre suggesting the whole ariconium things a scam to give underhowle historic status the roman town never was underneath here i think sam hall suspects it ingrid sollars too obviously and she knows about local history but if were only talking a couple of miles and if it isnt harming anyone and it helps put underhowle back on the tourist map all down to connorcrewe one of his academic jokes a few finds a lot of informed conjecture and theyll have their visitor centre with audiovisuals and maps and computergenerated mockups put together by real experts at codys all very stateoftheart are they even breaking any laws not if you ignore obtaining large sums of money in the form of substantial grants by deception bliss said might have some difficulty proving it but when all this is over we can try really really hard i could be totally wrong the fact that its even occurred to you a little priest who tries to think well of us all might suggest otherwise bliss looked across at the village scattered down the hill like the crumbs on his shirt these obscure little places do attract them dont they connorcrewe a liar cody with form merrily blinked form its not exactly in his brochures and i didnt of course tell you this but he did a little time detention centre as a teenager street crime in london car theft mainly finally earning him nine months in a grownup prison bloody hell merrily said which of course was where he learned about computers discovered a wondrous natural aptitude came out directly into software making more out of it than crime ever paid and then when he got into the hardware too it was probably expedient to move to somewhere he wasnt known hed got relatives in the forest and so yeh andy mumford it was stumbled on that one one day if he gets really big itll be part of the cody legend but not yet ah well huws smile was sour for every sinner who repents and becomes a millionaire the moralitys skewed merrily said but its a flawed world look at what codys done for underhowle in terms of jobs and morale and education huw nodded at the hillside where the mobilephone transmitter poked out of its clearing and health a very flawed world merrily acknowledged sadly huw turned his face into the rising wind and gazed down the valley where the roman road had led from ariconium to glevum the city of light the way marked now by electricity pylons and spirits merrily thought uneasily she could almost see the cracks opening in the façade of underhowle in the soil and the tarmac like ruptured graves on judgement day gomer came over right then folks three places i can see theres been a bit o digging nothing recent mind how not recent bliss asked not since summer cant say nmoren that so i got two hours for you boy he turned to merrily that all right with you vicar i been up the churchyard with mr owen yere lodge plots out on the edge where it joins the field and the grounds soft reckon i can do the grave by hand less noise ennit if youre sure hes sure bliss confirmed right he dug into a pocket of his hiking jacket and presented merrily with his mobile if you wouldnt mind holding on to that for me ive asked mumford to try and get me some more background on lynsey davies since shes now centrestage so to speak so if he calls ill take it if its any bastard from headquarters you dont even know where i am he clapped gomer on the back lets do it son were looking for a body female maybe more than one and what are you looking for huw merrily screwed up the bag that had held the pasties and stuck it in her pocket she wished all this was over the digging the exposure the secret funeral looking for an end lass she realized she didnt want to know what he meant frannie bliss was helping gomer bring down the mini digger a grownup yellow tonka toy with caterpillar tracks here was gomer starting to work again resilient his demons dealt with not entirely satisfactorily but no longer burning inside his head but frannie was like a failing footballer at the start of a winter game jumpy rubbing his hands dangerous merrily said what happens now all down to you huw looked her in the eyes an old wolfhound trusting deceptively trusting she was fairly sure now that huw must have had a hand in setting her up for the lodge funeral a quiet call to the bishop a favour called in huw by virtue of what he did a responsibility that few would shoulder could quietly pull ropes that made bells ring in cathedrals huw had unfinished business and he was looking for a way in and she was it the female deliverance minister the vulnerable one who relied on guidance family wants a small funeral huw said quickie no hymns no eulogies everybodyd like that you could give em their quickie and walk away let underhowle get on with its bright clean future full of new jobs and computer literacy i could do that what should i do modern world lass he went on as though he hadnt heard her and not even your parish its jeromes good old turna blindeyefortomorrowweretiretotheseaside jerome youre just the hired help the dishrag yes thanks now what do you think i should do id think about the full requiem she stared at him a requiem eucharist for roddy lodge are you serious this was not the roman catholic church not high anglican we dont do requiems in this area except even for the seriously devout and huw regarded her solemnly the yellow digger trundled slowly past gomer in the saddle bliss walking in front like he had gomer on a rein the unquiet dead merrily said ah yes the insomniacs huw agreed huw this is an actual funeral at night exactly huw said things need to be laid to rest anyroad if these lads find a body the whole placell be alight by then i dont know in deliverance a requiem eucharist was employed to unite a disturbed earthbound spirit with god who are we talking about roddy lynsey or or the whole village if you like and the evil thats come into it for most people merrily said nothings come into this village but progress therefore good and what do you think i dont know she gripped the top bar of the gate with both hands it was greasy with lichen youre like sam and his death road youre following a black trail all the way from gloucester and i dont know how valid that is i dont know if it exists you always told us to question everything question question question so now im questioning you like how objective is this in her coat pocket a phone began to buzz she pulled out two her own and frannies hers mrs watkins female youngsounding my names libby porterhouse from the mail on sunday i know youre rather busy at the moment but i wonder if we could have a chat not what she needed but if there was one thing you learned about dealing with the press it was never to say no comment express interest surprise ask some questions of your own but never let them think you had any reason to be unhelpful well ill tell you what i can merrily said but im not sure im the best person im just the hired help on this one ah we may be talking at cross purposes libby porterhouse said i know youre involved with this serial killer funeral row in the wye valley but this is something entirely different im with features and im doing quite an extensive piece on jenny driscoll what about her i understand shes a friend of yours we live in the same village and that shes given you a large sum of money id like to ask you about that and a few other things get your side of the story story how long have you known jenny driscoll merrily said its just that im standing in a muddy field with some people well if you tell me when its best to call you back i really dont want to keep hassling you and i truly think when you know about this that its something youll want to comment on for your own sake oh god can we leave it till tomorrow if youre not carrying the piece until sunday what about tonight ok ill see what i can do merrily said remembering the note from jane but not jenny boxs number merrily rang directory inquiries and asked for box ledwardine it turned out as expected to be exdirectory damn nothing else she could do from here problem huw said parochial she rang uncle teds number what the hell kind of story had the mail got she remembered james bull davies womans got a bit of a crush on you after all pretty common knowledge no answer at teds she shut down the phone and stood staring across the scrubby field to where gomer was shovelling out his first shallow trench bliss walking alongside now peering down the chapel behind them was black and formless ring the brother eh huw said close to her ear tell him you think a requiem would be best for all concerned and as nobodys going to know times no longer of the essence huw she said did you set me up for this funeral banks genuinely didnt want to do it i realize that merrily huw said youve not been at it long but of all of them youre the one i trust most you dont make assumptions and you never just go through the motions and youre never too sure of yourself never afraid to say when you dont understand i dont understand merrily said huw looked away ive said enough dont want to influence you im already influenced i think you and frannie are letting personal issues block your objectivity personal grief in your case sometimes you have to follow your heart you never said that before thats the opposite to what you told us on the course she stood in front of him her back to the digger you never said that before happen i never knew it christ huw her shoes were sinking into the mud you cannot exorcize him even if you think hes here even if you think hes in that chapel you cannot do it because no matter what kind of pond life he was he was of this earth what if there were summat else there was nothing else she thought of the missing builders tools the callused hands around zoe franklins neck the walking definition of the term earthbound the lamp of the wicked and the hunger of the dead it was soiled lust of the worst kind a depraved appetite that could only be sated in the end by causing extreme mortal fear and what happens when the bodys gone and only the appetite remains in a black void what is that and what happens when there are human beings out here amongst us who actually aspire to the black void people who are by whatever means prepared eager to call it into themselves merrily closed her eyes she felt the cold mass of the old baptist chapel very close behind her almost as if she was carrying it on her back she could hear the digger coming towards her and then the shuffling metallic scraping of the blade in the earth at least do the requiem huw said she nodded and brought out her phone execution there was a low rumbling the wind on illfitting leaded windows in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit amen no need to raise the voice above normal not for a congregation of nine including the two undertakers and the corpse under lights that were dusty orbs yellow going on brown merrily walked over to roddy lodges coffin im convinced that neither death nor life nor angels nor rules nor things present nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of god in jesus christ our lord it had been well after dusk when a white van had been driven to the church door george lomas cheerfully overweight with rimless glasses and his son stephen stocky and hedgehog haired had slipped roddy inside like contraband only ninety minutes later than planned no disrespect but it seemed like the best way mr lomas had whispered to merrily shaking hands in the porch i panicked a bit after that demo last night didnt want no scratches on the hearse so i phoned the lodges suggested we put the whole thing back until everybodys home from work watching telly didnt nobody tell you im afraid not merrily had said coldly to mr lomas whose bill might reasonably be expected to reflect the unorthodox hours lols concert she could have wept from the glass wall beside the stairs you could see most of the city glowing just below you and you wanted to walk out into it like some glistening sea maybe ill go out for some air lol said prof leaped up and put his back against the door of the green room youll stay where you are you paranoid bastard its ok lol said loads of time he wasnt due to go on until halfway through the gig and then only if it feels right moira had said as if it ever could the courtyard all glass and lego was set at right angles to the road in the citys recreational quarter opposite hereford uniteds edgar street ground lol had driven himself there in the astra prof driving tight behind him the whole way to make sure he didnt take a detour via birmingham manchester cardiff when hed driven into the car park the lights in the glass front were scary making it seem very public like a bus station within a couple of hours he was supposed to be standing alone on a stage inside that glass palace with the lights burning down on him only a guitar to protect him and a crowd four times the size of the one which had watched roddy lodge die screaming encouragement whynt you jump moira had the dressing room immediately behind the stage and lol was changing here in the green room with a washbasin and a kettle the washburn guitar the boswell guitar and prof levin hopping about like a surrogate nervous system why you got to keep messing with that mobile just switch it off if he calls now youll have to say youll get back to him in the morning lol had left two messages for mephisto jones maybe mephisto was sick struck down with an electric migraine then half an hour ago merrily had rung upset close to tears she wasnt going to make it in time probably wasnt going to make it at all he was almost relieved and he told her that and she said if you run away now dont you dare run away hed gone down to the booking office to leave a message there when a jane watkins arrived to pick up her ticket tell her to wait for lol robinson afterwards then hed changed into black jeans and a fresh alien sweatshirt with no holes in it remembering how king charles i had worn an extra shirt for his execution so that at least he wouldnt be trembling with the cold sitting on a stool in the green room lol had a terrible feeling now ominous whats wrong moira had drifted in the beautiful folkrock goddess in her long dress of midnight blue lowcut a silver pendant was trickling like water between her breasts as though it was part of the same stream that began in her long dark hair talk him through this moira prof said i have to go check things in the booth lol smiled uncertainly at moira so youll do half a dozen songs ending with tower and then i kind of creep on and we do bakers lament then you play for as long as you feel happy about and ill come back as and when piece of cake laurence piece of cake he said and felt that flicker of separation putting him minutely out of synch and for a moment he was watching himself looking at the beautiful woman in midnight blue and silver knowing now for certain that it wasnt going to happen for him that this was her concert and hers alone and nothing else was going to happen oh it will happen moira said and he didnt even wonder how shed plucked that thought from his mind because he might actually have said it while he was out of synch anything could have happened his head was full of storm clouds a possibly important thought came to him then wafted past like a pale moth and he put his head in his hands for a moment to try and catch it but it had gone and he heard moira saying who the hell are you cola french was standing in the doorway the golden stars in her hair and a small black hat with a feather howd you get in moira growled friends cola said and lies i tell a lot of lies she looked past moira at lol i lied before lol i lied when i said i wasnt involved lol was on his feet then his phone buzzed lynsey and piers and roddy and the whole bit cola said but when i heard the copper with piers and your lady this morning at the shop im thinking i cant sit on this shit any more aye well you can sit on it a wee bit longer hen moira said and as lol watched her shepherding cola french into the passage he heard in the phone its jones here that lol robinson another voice one of the courtyard staff said ten minutes moira we meet in the name of jesus christ who died and was raised to the glory of god the father grace and mercy be with you there was a muffled gonging from one of the cooling radiators under those opaque glass globes it looked as cold inside here as it was starting to feel no warmth for those who would mourn a murderer it was a boxy place the church of st peter underhowle so regular and heavy with dark wood that it might have been a victorian magistrates court a jerome banks kind of church merrily wearing her monastic white alb was not comfortable here we weve come here to remember before god our brother roddy to commend him to god our merciful redeemer and our judge to commit his body to be buried and to comfort one another there were two rows of pews to her right the lodges on the left ingrid sollars and sam hall ingrid wore a brown shawl over her ravaged wax jacket sams silver ponytail was tied with a thin black ribbon the lightpine coffin rested on a bier like a hostess trolley lomas and son sat two rows down behind the lodges inflating the congregation by twentyfive per cent almighty god you judge us with infinite mercy and justice and love everything you have made in your mercy turn the darkness of death into the dawn of new life alone at the bottom of the nave hunched like a night watchman was huw hed phoned banks himself to arrange for the sacrament merrily didnt trust him the word agenda hung in the air above him in mystic neon and the sorrow of parting into the joy of heaven through our saviour jesus christ meanwhile gomer was out there working by hurricane lamp at the bottom of the churchyard tony lodge had shown them the spot to the left of his parents grave about ten feet from the boundary hedge a line of laurels screening it from the rest of the churchyard seeing the spot had made merrily wonder why anyone had thought it worth objecting this would be a grave youd need a map to find it was fortunate in a way that the funeral had been delayed because gomer had also made a late start this was due to his stoical digging around the baptist chapel uncovering nothing but stones at fourthirty frannie bliss pale and sweating had still been refusing to give up raging against the dying of the light try here try back there its gorra be here or it all falls down and then in agony dont let me down gomer until gomer exasperated had snatched out his ciggy im tellin you boy you blew it there ent nothin buried yere but clay at flemings secretary had rung wondering where bliss was merrily saying isnt he there already i hope hes not had an accident like she was mrs bliss poor woman by then frannie so convinced earlier that hed be making the triumphant call that would bring fleming and his team down here with a small army of socos and the home office pathologist had been close to tears hed said he might come up the church later merrily hoped he wouldnt rage and despair were not helpful at a funeral the reflection of the cold globe above it wobbled now in the steel plate on the coffin merrily imagined roddy lodge lying there in the merciful darkness sealed away from a hostile world of electric lights televisions mobile phones radiation the schedule for common worship suggested this was the most suitable time for the first hymn hymns were useful they gave you a break time to gather your thoughts for the next stage which was your tribute to the deceased for which she wasnt ready there were some things still to work out it was important to at least approach the truth but there would be no hymns tonight there was no organist she imagined seven strained voices raised in stilted intimacy under the dismal hanging lamps no hymns she was grateful at first when the side door opened and gomer slipped in he didnt come any further just stood by the entrance still carrying his hurricane lamp and when she raised a questioning eyebrow at him wild white light flared in his glasses warning warning warning would you excuse me one moment merrily moved down past the coffin and followed gomer into the porch closing the doors against the wind gomer coughed this yere grave vicar problem with him ent entirely vacant oh this sometimes happened a graveyard was crowded underground there was slippage it would happen tonight how far down is the other coffin gomer said thats the point ennit this one dont have no coffin put it out of your head all right moira picked up the boswell guitar by its neck and handed it to lol i told the girl youd talk to her afterwards shell find you now lets get this stuff on stage mephisto jones had said hed been out all day helping a friend to do some fencing on his farm then hed called in for a beer on his way home he said he was feeling good at the moment on nights like this feeling stronger he wondered if it wasnt time to come back to england give it another try yeah he remembered prof of course he remembered prof lol had made himself sit down and ask some questions about the symptoms of electrical hypersensitivity telling mephisto about roddy lodges death on the pylon at one point prof had looked in his bald head shining with sweat shaking both fists hed be well out of it mephisto had said wouldnt know who he was any more he said he was satanlol had recalled makes sense mephisto had said i used to think i was the walking dead but you know what they said about satan now lol and moira carried the guitars down the passage under muted lights and out onto the stage where black curtains concealed the auditorium sounds of mass movement out there this wasnt a big theatre but it still felt like standing on a cliff top overhanging a vast city they put the guitars on stands the curvedbacked boswell the washburn and moiras thinbacked martin there were voice microphones and guitar mikes at waist level check the tuning moira instructed and lol went through the motions while she fingered a couple of chords on the martin provoking a whoop from beyond the curtain she put the guitar down placed both hands on his shoulders gripping hard and hissed shes no gonnae go away shell find you but you have to do this first ok a young guy in a black sweater appeared whenever youre ready thanks moira nodded rustling chatter laughter from behind the curtains an audience hundreds of people anticipating an experience will your wee priest have made it he shook his head shes been delayed i lied when i said i wasnt involved lynsey and piers and roddy and the whole bit what were the implications here what could he do about it tonight moira would play for maybe fortyfive minutes then hed shamble on do his forgettable best shuffle off an hour lost maybe more on the other hand if he were to shuffle off now it wasnt as if hed be letting moira down probably the reverse appearing with substandard support didnt help anyones reputation and he certainly wouldnt be letting the audience down but how easy would it be to find cola french and then get out of the theatre they came to the black curtains at the back of the stage the main curtains had opened now and he could see the audience in the steep theatre could see that it was almost full that all the boxes set into the walls on either side seemed to have been taken the house lights went down the chat sank as sweetly as the ambient noise being lowered in the mix of a live recording the mike stands and the guitars stood in pools of golden light and you could almost hear the steel strings vibrating in the air silence like a gasp four hundred people out there anticipation then moira said ok off you go he spun in shock and she stepped behind him to cut off his retreat and the curtains either side of her were execution black i thought with you needing to get away you could go on first after all moira said lols lungs made like a vacuum pump moira pushed him hard just get the fuck out there eh robinson mephistos blues gomer had left an earthen step inside the grave and he went down onto it but he held the hurricane lamp away so that merrily couldnt see ent terrible attractive vicar gomer admitted doesnt matter she stood on the slippery rim of the grave and leaned over the wind pulling at the hood of her alb and rattling the laurel bushes the church crouched above them with its stubby belltower and the lights from inside were dull and unhelpful the smell was mainly of freshly turned earth and clay but it was still the smell of mortality her foot dislodged a cob of soil and she stumbled careful vicar im ok go on lets have a look she drew a breath gomer flattened himself against the side of the grave and lifted the lamp so that it lit up the interior of the grave like an intimate cellar deep gomer said cold earth preserves em better see merrily looked down into an absence of eyes decay was a corrosive face pack in its nest of claycaked hair the face was like a childs crude cardboard mask the emptiness of it all emphasized by the mouth the way the jaw had fallen open on one side into a last crooked plea and all of it made heartbreaking by the rags of what looked like a red sweatshirt and an uncovered hand with its dull glimmer of rings she had to be fully six feet down some gravediggers today didnt go that deep she could have ended up with a coffin on top and never have been found merrily stepped back making the sign of the cross there was this gomer climbed out he held up the lamp and opened out his other hand cleaned him up a bit vicar sos you can see she saw an angel an angel on a chain if he was still round the neck see idve left him on but he was lying on top he was loose like somebodyd put him in after the body the angel was no more than an inch and a half long with wings spread and hands crossed over its lower abdomen which protruded as though it was pregnant in fact there was something curved there like a small locket or a cameo any idea what he is vicar she felt a sadness as sharp as pain think i just might valuable it was to someone merrily said lol felt like he was dying his recent past laid out before him in a mosaic of faces he stood there frozen gazing into purgatory a warmcol oured vault with boxes set into the sides like the balconies of apartment blocks or the doors in an advent calendar the house lights had come up again because somebody thought he wasnt ready some technical problem maybe and now he could see the individual faces in the mosaic he saw in one of the boxes al and sally boswell al in his romany waistcoat and his diklo sally in that long white dress with the embroidery around the bosom the dress that was so much a part of her personal history the two of them sitting in their box gypsy aristocracy as if this was a ceremonial occasion for them al whod given lol the boswell guitar had come to hereford to see it abused the boswell guitar was behind lol on its stand he had the washburn hanging from his shoulder it felt unresponsive like a shovel he saw alison kinnersley this woman whod originally gone with him to ledwardine and then left him for the squire james bulldavies and his farm and his horses bad for you lucy devenish had told him sternly wrong type of woman entirely james was there too in a tie a malemenopausal stooge said lucy devenish whos known only two kinds of women garrisontown whores and countyset heifers lols hands felt numb as he stared into the huge cavernous silence and all the people stared back at him with a tremulous fascination that apprehensionturningtoanticipation which had been so palpably apparent when roddy lodge was high in the pylon reaching out to the insulator the killing candle lol saw jane close to the front jane watkins who one day before he knew her mother had come into the cluttered folklore emporium ledwardine lore when he was minding the shop for lucy what the hell was his first song supposed to be oh god the amplified silence boomed in his head how long had he been standing here like this how long before they started the slow handclap how long before someone pulled the curtain what was he supposed to do directly opposite him was the glassfronted control booth where prof levin sat prof was standing up very still his hands theatrically over his eyes like this was some greek tragedy then lol saw eirion on the far left probably the only person in that audience not staring back at him because he was looking at jane who was looking at lol hands clasped face taut with anxiety suddenly all she sees is darkness doom nothing nothing amazing out there any more there was an unexpected prickling in the corners of lols eyes he hadnt mentioned the gig to the boswells wouldnt have dared it must have been prof but who had told alison and bulldavies and surely that was who could possibly have told sophie hill who was sitting with a man who must be her husband very near the back presumably in case the sound level proved insufferable hey man where you been a lone male voice curling out of the third row nervous laughter from somewhere the sweat in lols hands felt like cold honey he whispered into the mike away the whisper was as crisp as an iceberg lettuce and huge how sound systems had improved when you reckon youll be back then the guy in the third row said well i dont really know lol said it depends on remembering what the first song is and then suddenly he did his fingers finding the riff into the mike he said tuesdays on victoria ward we always hated tuesdays and he must have sung it kind of because the lights went down and some applause bubbled up the last face lol saw before the whole audience went into deep shadow was janes she was slumping in her seat with her head thrown back and he could almost hear the whoosh of breath coming out of her as he did the number did the number leaning on the guitar now as he went into the chorus someones got to pay now dr gascoignes on his way and its another heavy medication day wondering for the first time whether it might have been wiser to change dr gascoignes name nah stuff you dr gascoigne you coldeyed sadist lol discovered he was smiling the people out there the unknown faces must have thought it was part of his act faking disorientation only a real professional could do that and get away with it lol felt he was floating and when the song was over someone at the back started shouting sunny days and there were ragged handclaps in support well he wasnt going to do that trite crap not in a million years definitely not when he reached the chorus he was staggered at the number of people singing along and its always on the sunny days you feel you cant go on on rainy days it rains on everyone but im running for the subway and im hiding under trees on fine days like yes sam hall held the angel under the brassshaded pulpit light its whats known as a bioelectric shield pendant thats what i thought merrily said jane my kid was looking for one i just couldnt remember what it was called the two of them were up in the pulpit voices lowered the service had been suspended what else could she do there was no way this coffin was going in that grave a grave that before the night was out would be surrounded by what bliss called the durex suits in here sam put a finger on the cameo part that had made the angel look pregnant we have a bunch of crystals quartz maybe some malachite that are supposed to interact with the bodys own energy field to deflect electromagnetic radiation often worn by people who work with computers and have you seen one before in underhowle yep so when you said melanie pullman was getting nothing but valium from dr ruck and you suggested she should consult an alternative practitioner in hereford about her eh was this this was one of the items they got for mel told her to wear it day and night for a short while she was a familiar figure in the village with the angel around her neck in fact you can ask bliss about this but i think when she went missing the description the police put out suggested that she might well be wearing it sam gave the angel back to merrily where did this come from reverend excuse me mrs watkins down in the nave mr lomas was tentatively on his feet i dont like to interrupt look merrily flashed a warning glance at sam and went down to talk to the undertaker taking mr lomas over to the door where gomer was waiting telling him thered been an unforeseen problem with the grave that it wasnt empty mr lomas nodded not entirely surprised hed been here before what do you want to do then mrs watkins i dont suppose its a problem easily dealt with until tomorrow which might cause another problem here mr lomas nodded at the coffin you want us to take him back or you could lock him in here for the night and well be back tomorrow tony lodge came over hed overheard cant be nobody else in that plot reverend it was a field twenty years ago our field thats how we got the family plot extended we gave the field to the church sloping graveyard ennit gomer said knowledgeably hed replaced half the soil over the remains for concealment slippage see likely there was coffins under that field when you was still ploughing him god god god cherry lodge was out of her pew is this bloody nightmare never going to end dont you worry mrs lodge george lomas said well get this sorted in the morning no problem well sort out another plot but you cant do that by torchlight he looked at merrily leave him here then is it merrily looked at tony lodge who looked noncommittal i suppose so yeah ok thank you mr lomas and so the lomases left and then there were seven with gomer seven and a corpse merrily looked at the four mourners all of them on their feet faces waxy under the sour cream lights i dont really know what to do now she was aware of huw owen moving quietly up the aisle sam hall said you can tell us about the body thatd be a start she nodded well its a woman as youve gathered and it isnt in a coffin oh god almighty cherry lodge said roddy merrily hesitated roddy dug graves for the church sometimes didnt he they always had a regular gravedigger tony lodge said but when the ground was difficult or they hit rocks theyd call the boy in with his digger ingrid sollars came over to inspect the bioelectric angel she took it out of merrilys hands held it tenderly in her own it is melanie then merrily nodded looks like it im afraid who are her nearest relatives her parents moved six months ago into ross theres an aunt over at ryford was this still around her neck it was lying on her chest whoever buried her evidently put it there you can see the chains broken did it snap when she was being strangled well thats the end of it far as im concerned tony lodge looked at the coffin with contempt then down at his feet let him be cremated empty his bloody ashes in the gutter huw owen said quietly you can do what you like after the requiem but finish it now before you leave him in here for the night before the place is swarming wi coppers he looked at merrily take it from me lass you mustnt do half a job on this her heart sank he was right she turned to gomer do me one last favour frannie bliss is probably down in one of the pubs if you could give us say twenty minutes and then go and find him put him in the picture and make his night gomer nodded opened one of the double doors and stopped there was a group of people packed into the porch seven or eight of them merrily closed her eyes maybe they would go away this is so utterly contemptible fergus young said who would have thought the church would lie and cheat and conspire lol didnt know if it was any good but hed done it as his eyes adjusted he could again see jane in the front row and he was convinced at one point that she was crying during the song hed written about her mother when the longing was becoming acute did you suffocate your feelings as you redefined your goals and vowed to undertake the cure of souls it was somewhere between this song and the next that he caught the mothlike thought that had glided past him in the green room and he held it fluttering in his mind along with something mephisto jones had said what happened i was getting blackouts more frequently and theyre not ordinary blackouts you come round and youre out of synch dont know where you are or what youve done it was like a song already mephistos blues the idea rocked him so hard that he muffed the tidy bit of elizabethan finger style at the end of cure a signal that it was time to go thank you lol said bemused i mean you know thanks for having me he nodded to the audience turned and left they were stamping furiously by the time he reached the wing of the stage stamping for moira probably moira was hugging him back what one more ive got to go moira im so grateful to you for this but yeah yeah now get back out there this is how its done dont you remember anything and you forgot kivernoll he shook his head his whole life had changed but tonight that wasnt very important he had to find cola french its organized moira said one more then you can go something else hit him i need to collect jane dismay shes got no way of getting home ill see to jane god help me moira turned him round and pushed him hard in the small of the back go when lol went back it was like hed won the war he picked up the boswell of which he was unworthy right he told them localknowledge time the boswell eased her curvy back into his stomach he did the unsurprising aminor finger style intro exorcizing alison kinnersley under mountains of winter where the river of gold defines the valley something delicate splintered there he glanced over to where alison sat with james bulldavies but couldnt make either of them out this was a song that had come out of the alison period towards the end when james was making his move lol and alison had driven up to the black mountains on the welsh border and thered been an outburst and crying and somehow a reconciliation as they were motoring back down into the golden valley and lol had seen a name on a sign in a nowhere kind of place with flat fields and a roadside barnconversion in progress and the place was called kivernoll approaching the chorus he heard a rustling behind him and moira was there a graceful ghost in midnight blue and the response to this from the audience was like a wall of heat kerrys gate the tears abated cockyard found her smiling from abbey dore to allensmore by kiverno and then moiras voice was lifting the line from under him oh oll dropping away leaving lol to sing unaccompanied we were on a roll he knew that she was introducing magic to an undistinguished little song and that this was approaching the best he would ever achieve and when it was over he just shouted into the mike moira cairns and ducked out it was over this time and moira was mouthing good luck and lol was out of there leaving the guitars on stage down the stairs and into the huge glassed area all lit up a bar to one side a bunch of people in there he needed to get into the auditorium find cannot wait for the album cola french had come up behind him give me a lift home shed evidently been waiting for him moira had organized her she followed him out into the blustery night to where the battered astra was parked the way he always left it close to an entrance vaguely pointing outwards this is yours its quite safe jesus lol was fitting his car key into the door when a man said lol robinson the night blared white three times he was blinded he stumbled against the car sorry about that mate the man said thanks a lot all the best cola said does this mean were an item lol stared after the photographer fifty yards away by now walking fast he thought he could rule out the hereford times it couldnt even be mistaken identity the guy had known his name in they got into the astra he drove to the roundabout and then over greyfriars bridge on to the ross road cola said im not even called cola french its just the name i write under but if your name was tracey gilbert how would you play it you said youd lied when you said you werent involved lol drove south from the city not too many suburbs this side you were soon out of the street lights what did you mean shes pretty cola said stepping over the question shes not what i imagined no what did you mean not involved in what all right that copper the liverpool guy he asked piers what kind of people went to his parties like what kind of people would do sex magic like he thought it was all black robes and manacles and blood sacrifice well yeah some of that though you dont realize when you start you think its just games risky games but still games and you were involved in that it was like how can you be a writer if you havent lived at first and then you think do i really want to be that kind of writer and thats when you know its bad i dont mean bad i mean evil theres a difference isnt there i mean ive been bad lots of times but i dont think ive ever been evil because thats a thing in itself isnt it a commitment no going back so when did you get out when i knew where it was coming from of course i mean shit cromwell street i read about it i went and got the books from piers youre joking she was hunched up in the seat as though she was very cold see he did a lot of stuff nobody could explain hed travelled a bit been to sea mixed with all kinds of weirdos picked up stuff he maybe didnt understand west lol put the heater on sometimes it worked yeah he had all these weird ideas that were maybe just an excuse for kinky sex there was all this stuff where he was trying to like mix his sperm with the sperm of these other guys who were giving it to rose i wont go into details but it was like he was planning to create some kind of superrace situation genetic experiments well you dont have to be a bloody biologist to know what kind of bollocks that is i mean its a joke right in the scientific sense where did he get it from where did he get those ideas lol said you mean it only makes sense at all from an occult viewpoint something like that and lynsey yeah cola said i think you could say something made a sick kind of sense to lynsey requiem merrily was sure she heard this you were warned from one of the men in the porch just like that you were warned some urban lout with a degree in computer science introducing pseudogangland into rural village life she didnt recognize his face couldnt even see it properly but she thought she recognized the voice from the phone muffled under a handkerchief if one of you was the threatening caller she said tiredly i took your advice you said if we held the funeral on friday id regret it this is wednesday at night piers connorcrewe said youre actually holding a clandestine funeral at night hold on threats fergus youngs sharpened voice raised a silence he turned to his companions what does she mean he turned to merrily wed just concluded a meeting at the village hall with the mp to discuss aspects of possible government funding when we saw lights in the church are you saying youve been physically threatened as well as connorcrewe and chris cody merrily recognized the fat man from the post office and stores who had said we aint rolling over for this one no way she didnt know any of the others it was just the one call she said it doesnt matter im not making a thing about it it does matter ferguss long face hardened he wore a dark suit and a tie tonight we dont descend to that level were not thugs does anybody here know who was responsible for that richard not me fergus the post office man said but i know a lot of people were upset when lodge got tied in with fred west fergus already taller than the rest of them seemed to rise up further his chin jutting well i would like very much to know who was prepared to risk tarnishing this communitys reputation we are civilized people we are educated people we do not issue anonymous threats to members of the clergy or anyone else bizarre it was the first time merrily had seen him behaving like an oldfashioned headmaster he treated the kids at school as equals but seemed about to threaten these adults with mass detention unless the culprit confessed she was worried if it emerged now that melanie pullmans body had been found the entire village would be up here within ten minutes melanie left to rot in the soil while her murderer lay here in state the subject of a requiem eucharist no less how did that look huw owen met her gaze and looked thoughtful for a moment then he smiled stepped to the doors and just when she thought he was going to slam them in ferguss face flung both of them open like the church was a bingo hall gents huw owen my name the church in its oldfashioned way didnt feel it were appropriate for a lady minister to conduct the funeral service for a murderer not on her own in such a hostile community im backup look i apologize fergus said tightly however this remains a betrayal of our please huw lifted his hands let me explain all weve got here is a simple memorial service something the diocese feels is essential to clear the atmosphere surrounding a chain of events going back oh quite a long way he stepped back into the nave richard from the shop saw the coffin bloody hell he is here huw went to stand by the coffin and put a hand on it almost affectionately first i should tell you that without wanting to appear to bow to any kind of pressure particularly the kind of drunken behaviour we observed the other night mr lodge here has now said hed be quite happy for this lad to be consigned to the flames cherry lodge looked up at her husband as if afraid he was going either to deny it or change his mind but tony lodge said nothing fergus looked at both the lodges and smiled stiffly we all know underhowles emerging from half a century of hardship all we want is for it to be known as a decent and progressive place not some sinister haunt of darkness and perversity famous for its murderer im sorry if that sounds blunt blunts my language lad huw assured him lets all be blunt now were here as christians and all we want is to send this lad to his maker not as you seem to be insinuating in a furtive way but along a path lit by truth and honesty hes avoided earthly justice but thats not the end of it as far as were concerned as you can imagine merrily thought god hes good huw stepped away from the coffin rubbing his nose we didnt want a circus and we didnt want the press lads here and we honestly didnt think it were likely that any of you would want to join us however seeing as you are here there was some shuffling richard mumbled something about having to get home for a phone call at ten and he started backing towards the door some of the others hadnt even bothered to come in ingrid sollars said personally i think it would be very appropriate if the members of the development committee as representatives of the future of underhowle were to assist mr owen and mrs watkins and the lodge family to draw a line under this whole miserable episode there was silence huw waited smiling his placid benign priest smile very well fergus said why not thank you lets end this discord wonderful huw went over to the doors we have any more committee members chris cody came in looking uncomfortable he wore a dark brown overcoat that almost reached the stone flags a leather cap that he pulled off connorcrewe still in his cream suit shambled in after him scowling merrily noticed gomer slipping out huw pulled the doors to and rubbed his hands bit parky in here but thatll sharpen our senses wont it take a pew where were we up to merrily well we merrily stood under the pulpit as cody and connorcrewe went to sit in the pew behind ingrid sollars and sam hall and fergus sat alone behind the lodges as you can see this is rather an unusual service with so few of us we decided to dispense with the hymns but well be taking communion later perhaps huw could get me out of this again aye huw took up a position across the chancel arch to the left of the coffin happen we should explain what were at to god eh lets start with a prayer cherry lodge was the first to kneel connorcrewe the last connorcrewe kept his eyes open which merrily knew because she didnt close hers either nerves she was aware that at some point huw had switched off the lamps at the bottom of the nave so that this small but significant congregation was pooled in light while the shadows behind suggested there were others back there in the darkness huw began softly lord we come here tonight in all humility with a full awareness of our own ignorance we come here on behalf of certain sad unquiet spirits on either side of the divide we come to seek healing he paused then his voice roughened but we realize that before there can be healing there must be knowledge of the condition secrets must be laid open there must be truth help us to find that truth hold up your lantern for us throw its light into the blackest dingiest corners of human experience where only the lamp of the wicked flickers with its bilious flame help us through jesus christ amen there was a hollow hush they were all watching huw even piers connorcrewe but huw was looking at merrily your show lass i believe you were about to address the subject of our friend here roddy cairns was nauseatingly wonderful of course eirion was right eirion was always right about these things and one day she would tell him but anxiety brought jane out before the end slipping up the aisle during the climactic applause for something epic called the comb song and standing at the back examining the entire audience row by row left to right mum was not there check again her gaze tracked systematically along the backs of heads right to left this time definitely not there it was nearly ninethirty pm at first it had been anger nobody should have missed lols totally mesmerizing electrifying comeback least of all the woman purporting to be in love with him it was just a complete total insult but in the electric brightness of the foyer she admitted that mum was not like that never had been mum always felt responsible emotions cocktailed inside jane making her feel slightly queasy she could hear the music cairnss voice all smoky smooth she thought shed spotted eirion in there worship ping maybe she could crawl down the aisle throw herself at his trainers she went to the entrance and pulled out her mobile sometimes mum would leave a message for her on the answering machine she put in the number hello this is ledwardine vicarage she keyed the code waited heard several bleeps merrily this is ted didnt even listen to that one flower this is me right look im really really sorry i missed you this morning no excuses apart from being completely knackered and if this all goes as badly as i suspect its going to and god forbid i dont make it tonight ive told lol so please look out for lol afterwards ok im sorry yeah she hung on in case mum had called back with an update bleep merrily its jennifer box its i dont know what time it is its dark please help me hes defiled the chapel hes defiling everything hes the evil you are fighting and dear god hes coming back merrily stood there behind the lectern with her prayer book on it the lectern which stood to the left of the pulpit was a dark mahogany stand with a brass eagle wings spread to hold the heaviest old bible apart from in the oldest churches the lecterns like this one were always too high for her she was very aware of the gravedirt on the hem of her alb earlier before gomer had come in with his lamp shed planned to address the subject of roddys afflictions the multiple pressures on him of which perhaps no one here was fully aware hoping that by the end of it shed at least have planted the seeds of understanding and something would come of it one day it was different now the atmosphere was charging up soon arc lights would be burning in the churchyard tapes would go up police would guard the site until dawn then statements would be taken theyd all be making statements in the search for a kind of truth that perhaps wouldnt be the truth at all and there would certainly be no sympathy for roddy lodge she became aware that she was clutching melanies angel very tightly in her right hand it felt almost hot truth directness simplicity i because of the height of the lectern she was almost speaking into her prayer book i met roddy lodge just the once i was with my friend gomer who was convinced roddy had started a fire that killed his nephew roddy was manic dancing about as if he was on strings he was talking a lot of rubbish about all the famous people hed installed drainage for all lies while there on his trailer not ten yards away lay the decomposing body of lynsey davies merrily looked up registering the surprise on the faces of people who at every funeral theyd hitherto attended had listened to all the bad stuff being swept under the pews gomer was wrong as it turned out roddy lodge didnt start the fire he was nowhere near there that night but roddy had a reputation as a liar a crook and gomer and there isnt a nicer more wellmeaning bloke in my village had demonized him the way that first this village and then maybe the whole country has done since demonization a lot of it about a monster she tapped the coffin lid theres a monster in here what do we do about him she stared at them helpless i thought i wouldnt have anything to do with roddy lodge ever again but then another friend a detective from hereford said roddy remembered me from that night and wanted to speak to me well that never happened in the end hed acquired a solicitor who didnt want him to speak to me or anybody else and yet allowed him to make a very wideranging confession i gather a few of you know him mr nye ryan nye she looked at chris cody hed taken off his leather cap his onceshaven head had grown into a tight lightbrown bristle yeah we we figured lodge ought to have a brief he looked a lot younger somehow a street kid the tearaway whod discovered a massively lucrative talent wed used ryan when we was buying the chapel off of roddy we put work his way when we can you sent him to represent roddy we yeah we figured he needed a brief merrily nodded mr nye stopped me talking to roddy and i was glad were trying to build a spirit of honesty here so yes shamefully i was glad i didnt have to talk to a monster i knew he was a monster because id seen his bedroom plastered with pictures of famous women all dead with parts of nude pinups added obscene degrading sick a monster my mate the detective wanted to dig up every efflapure in the county fully expecting bodies underneath some of them and im thinking yes its possible she wondered where frannie bliss was now how hed react when gomer told him about melanie the sensible thing would be to call headquarters which meant she and huw didnt have much time and with a eucharist to organize and then the next night roddy wanted to come home so they brought him back hed confessed to three murders all the murders that my friend the detective had put it to him that hed done why was he so keen to confess to come back here and show the police where hed buried the bodies had mr nye told him it was for the best why would mr nye tell him that she looked at chris cody who looked perturbed well mr nye isnt here so we cant get any enlightenment there but there was another good reason why roddy lodge found hereford police headquarters with its mass of equipment its radio transmitters and especially its almost subterranean interview rooms an unbearable place to be because roddy had become electrically hypersensitive he had to get out of there and he didnt care what it took merrily moved out in front of the lectern feeling more confident but there was more to it than electrical pollution there had to be she talked about roddys childhood his isolation in an allmale household his manufacture of a series of mother substitutes the peculiar comfort he found in the realm of the dead nothing essentially morbid in it a way of coping a world he felt he could control can we say he was psychic can we say he actually began to see the dead had he developed what some people like to call mediumistic faculties sam would say he was simply the victim of hallucinations caused by the effects of force fields on the brain all i know is that it was something he was allowed to grow up with something that was never discussed she didnt look at tony lodge this wasnt an inquisition tony lodge didnt say anything we do know that roddy was becoming disturbed by his condition because he went to see the doctor who like most gps seems to have believed in neither psychic powers nor eh and who referred him to the rector who gave him some advice which was well meant ingrid sollars made a small contemptuous noise in fact there seems to have been only one person with whom roddy lodge was able to discuss his condition and that was melanie pullman a girl who was also experiencing problems of an apparently psychic nature which sam believes to have been a result of living very close to power lines and other signals ive had access to some background on melanie pullman on balance the evidence of some electrical stimulation of parts of the brain does seem in her case to be the most persuasive explanation but melanies not here to discuss it merrily heard the muffled clunk of the door latch and saw figures moving in the shadows gomer and frannie bliss nobody else my feeling is that melanie was good for roddy the evidence is that they had a close relationship she was probably his first real girlfriend there was nobody else in roddys life at that time as far as i can tell its true cherry lodge was leaning over the prayerbook shelf her face was flushed he was never any kind of a ladies man he wasnt smooth and he wasnt that bright if you want the truth never a girlfriend when he was young tonyll tell you tell them tony grunted embarrassed him women did when he was at home afterwards he embarrassed us all the tales and the sports car nobody in our family ever had a sports car what changed merrily said what made him in a woman we call it promiscuous but in a man its a bit of a lad i mean when he was with melanie he wasnt like that was he she was a nice girl tony said quiet nicelooking i never knew what she saw in him a soulmate perhaps then why did he he turned his face away merrily said quickly sam hall found out about melanie and tried to help her with some success i think and melanie in turn tried to help roddy maybe she encouraged him to go to the same alternative practitioner whod given her a device to wear around her neck to ward off electromagnetism but roddy didnt want to know i wonder why not frannie bliss slid into a pew halfway down the nave where the shadows began i think we both know that dont we merrily she nodded as the other heads turned whats happening frannie nothing special bliss said coolly thought id see how thingsve changed in the socalled church of england before i made any kind of move merrily saw piers connorcrewe bounce a disdainful glance from bliss to her you two lovers or something i think we should be told uncalled for piers fergus young snapped fergus im so tired of these shallow nitpicking people why do we even care about the mental state of the waste of space in that box as for this bloody little woman trying to find a new role for the ailing church in some sort of spiritual criminal profiling merrily said what did lynsey davies say about roddy lodge piers did she think he was a waste of space i suspect not get off my back mrs watkins i think lynsey found him extremely interesting because of what he was ie someone apparently in daytoday contact with the dead of whom he had no fear whatsoever and because he was the owner of underhowle baptist chapel which for her had become a kind of shrine she looked at huw but he didnt react the angel was almost burning in her hand there was a problem of course roddy had a steady girlfriend with whom he had a lot in common and melanie who seems to have suffered for years from eh was suddenly thanks to sam discovering a possible cause and a possible solution she looked at sam guessing that she was reaching a conclusion hed come to several minutes ago he left his pew and went to stand in the aisle slowly punching a fist into a palm she was trying to persuade roddy to go to the same alternative practitioner to understand what she was now convinced was the real nature of the problem maybe she wouldve succeeded maybe shed have helped him if she opened her hand and let the angel dangle on its broken chain if if lynsey davies hadnt killed her first sam said merrily looked down at her prayer book or persuaded someone else to do it the makeover ah yes moira cairns said like shed just remembered something vaguely distasteful hi jane i dont understand jane stepped away from the box office dismayed this woman says lols gone cairns was looking smaller and somehow younger in jeans and this big hebridean sweater her hair tied up the makeup washed off aye she said he had to leave leave the big star gone off with some major international promoter some record company exec goodbye to the old life hello hotel rooms hello groupies jane bit her lip feeling isolated among the crowd in the foyer probably the only one of them who was here alone and now would leave alone come to support lol and hed triumphed and gone shed twice called mums mobile to tell her about that call from jenny box if she didnt already know about it nothing switched off i said id run you home cairns said autographing the sleeve of an old vinyl album some sad git had brought along sorry about the shaky bit she said to the sad git must be ma age you look younger than ever the sad git said going off and cairns blew him a kiss jane looked down at the poisoned blade of betrayal what give me five minutes ok cairns said jane said tightly i can get a bus of course there was no late bus to ledwardine midweek and she caught herself making swift glances to either side maybe eirion he must still be around he couldnt really have dumped her just because shed come on like somebody spoiled and bitchy he wasnt like that he loved her or what she used to be hed loved what she used to be eirion would have come here to see lol and moira no reason to seek out jane it was over or i can get a taxi ive got enough money moira pulled a bunch of keys from her jeans and tossed them at jane grey bmw right down by the bottom entrance ill be there in about five minutes i just have to see prof ok and she turned and walked off the smug bitch leaving jane standing there holding the keys jane spun away with a semisob and walked out of the building into the squally air gulping it in looked up in despair at the night over hereford saw a faded cluster of stars small holes in worn denim gas balls in a barren universe none of them wanted to know her now not eirion not even lol she was spoiled and peevish and stupid she was negative shed grown up a negative person in a negative world this floating cyst of dying matter about which everything was known a world that had peaked some time ago and all scientists were doing about it was shrinking it more rapidly while finding ways of keeping you alive longer so that you could go on and on being crapped on halfway across the car park seeing a couple of guys in their twenties watching her she caught herself actually starting to think of the several individuals who would be twisted with guilt for the rest of their lives when she was found raped and murdered behind one of the warehouses off the holmer road or just killed in a cursory way by some heroin addict for her mobile in the end she just found moiras bmw and let herself in and locked the doors to keep out the junkies and the rapists then she made another fruitless attempt to call mum and tell her about jenny driscoll who had been so anxious to see her before the funeral on friday possibly because of something this guy humphries had turned up in underhowle but the funeral had happened it was all over mum should be home now should be home jane rang home and listened to all the messages again ending with dear god hes coming back like gareth box was some kind of rapistslasher poor driscoll she wasnt crass and superficial just damaged and likeable really another emotional refugee although it was still hard to know how much of what she said you could seriously believe the angel stuff im not claiming to be bernadette i dont care whether anyone believes me and then i saw it jane and she was beautiful was that the final confirmation that mum was the angel yet nothing sexual could you believe that you certainly believed it when she said it last night you grabbed it gratefully squeezed it to your bosom oh thank you thank you but now how did you feel about jenny driscoll with hindsight jane said oh god god who did not exist who just served now as an allpurpose expression for dismay confusion exasperation contempt and fear by now any semblance of a service had evaporated there were eleven people and a corpse under the icecream lights and no reason for anyone to be here any more not even the corpse yet nobody was trying to leave merrily saw frannie bliss placing himself next to the church door needing to contain everybody while he worked it all out examining the cards in his hand rearranging them wondering which ones to throw away it was like this if lynsey davies had killed melanie pullman it threw up a new and plausible motive for roddy to have killed lynsey a god forbid normal motive arguably a hotblooded killing lodge had discovered that this warped and dangerous woman had murdered his girlfriend the kind of killing then for which had he lived to appear in court he might well have ended up with no more than a couple of years in prison if lynsey davies was the only one hed done if the serial killing was something happening only in the dark mind of lynsey davies did you confess just to get it over to get the police off your back the heat from your brain merrily put her hands either side of the pine coffin just where roddys head would be cooled at last she saw him scaling that pylon gripping the steel skeleton of his personal tormentor swinging up into the rigid spindly arms of kali the destroyer with the killer candles in her fingers sam hall was at the foot of the coffin and their gazes met what now she didnt know if roddy was going to the crematorium there didnt even need to be a funeral from over by the door frannie bliss called do we want to take this further i dont think im in any position to demand that everybody stays but if i phone my boss which is what i ought to do i can guarantee a long night for some of us piers connorcrewes big pale body twitched are you going to tell us exactly what youve found found mr crewe sam hall said merrily you just raised the possibility that lynsey davies had someone else kill melanie you want to explain that well she moved away from the coffin i think if we look at what we know about lynsey i know a bit more now in fact bliss said andy mumford finally called its not much but it might make you think he moved away from the door resting a foot on a pew seat hands on his knee some of it we knew but theres no harm in going over it again lynsey like roddy actually grew up in a nonconformist household on the edge of the forest drybrook or lydbrook one of those places her old feller was a coalman one of the blokes who carted the sacks about rather than ran the yard and he was also the caretaker at his chapel there were four kids and lynsey was the eldest and the old man used to make them go twice on a sunday to chapel strict very strict he still alive sam asked no neither parent but mumford talked to a sister who hadnt seen lynsey in years but did remember things like how she was once suspended from school for bullying and how much she hated the chapel figures sam said actually it wasnt that simple bliss said funny these are things youd never bother going into when somebodys just the victim even less important when youre just a victim one of several when we say she hated the chapel we mean the organization the religion the actual building this stark old place with the dr phibes harmonium she bloody loved that used to pinch her old mans keys and go in with her mates at night playing merrily said presumably you dont mean the harmonium bliss did his acid smile i think the games got more adventurous the older she became and then one day the sisters not sure what happened it being a serious scandal at the time and a great embarrassment for the family one day traces of these activities were found by the cleaner as a result of which mr davies lost his position as parttime caretaker and he was not a happy man and he held lynsey responsible mumford wasnt sure what mr davies did to lynsey but there was certainly a long period of fear and loathing in that household bliss said the sister had told mumford they didnt see much of lynsey once she got into her middle teens but there was a teacher who thought she was an intelligent girl with prospects and suggested shed be better away from home persuading the parents to let her go to this commercial college in gloucester possibly even arranging a grant either way mr davies was probably glad to see her go bliss said and i think some of us know the rest so there you have it an intelligent girl raised in a strict household starts to rebel against it from quite a tender age though tenders not the word for lynsey is it the suspension for bullying the hints of early sexual adventures all hinting at the bad things to come and the use of religious premises in a sexual context merrily said dead right and were all looking at you mr crewe cause of all the people here were thinking nobody knew lynsey as well as mr crewe connorcrewe didnt look back at him ive told you all i know you said you didnt know about lynsey being at cromwell street i wonder if thats true if you want to accuse me of anything huw owen said as francis has raised the issue of cromwell street i think we can all agree that his original theory of lodge as a west obsessive has been turned on its head it was lynsey who was obsessed bliss shrugged thank you lad huw went to stand at the lectern nobody likes to think of anybody especially a woman becoming so corrupted inside as to find inspiration and energy in a situation as foul as that but we have to face it just as we had to face the fact that the number of lives destroyed by twenty years of carnage in cromwell street far exceeded the number of lives lost which itself may be a lot bigger than the list read out at the trial of rosemary west im sorry fergus young looked like a man whod been containing himself for as long as he reasonably could i dont see the relevance of this its frankly obscene theres no proven link between underhowle and anything connected with west and i really dont think we should manufacture one lodge and davies are both dead gone finished no lad nowts finished if you dont see the living darkness at the heart of this living darkness fergus stood up his hair springing that is such nonsense thats defamatory nonsense huw held tight to the wings of the brass eagle see i dont usually talk like this to lay folk it doesnt help but im looking at a woman who was drawing energy from a black hole a place from which all kindness tenderness pity and moral awareness had been sucked out drawing energy from that can you understand merrily said softly i think we should look at what she was creating with melanie out of the way shed begun to reorganize roddys life perhaps starting with something fairly innocent like setting up his sitting room as roddys bar like the one at cromwell street and then redecorating his bedroom cherry lodge whispered yes there were two bedrooms in that bungalow the one roddy set up for himself which was a bit oldfashioned and the one i think lynsey created for him with black sheets and eroticized pictures of beautiful women who also happened to be dead reflecting the connection he was perhaps already making between sex and death but brutalizing it i suppose like she was trying to turn him into somebody else fergus said somebody else work it out lad huw owen told him its preposterous she also revamped his social calendar merrily said poor jerome banks thinks he was the one who encouraged roddy to go out and find some real girls in fact lynsey was building up his confidence and also turning him into a predator like people train hawks she looked up at the sound of piers connorcrewe edging out of his pew making for the door ive heard enough bliss stood in his path i dont think so piers are you actually attempting to detain me i have some questions up your arse with them inspector ive had quite enough of you for one day its just that ive been wondering if lynsey or somebody else other than lodge killed melanie pullman who buried her ive just recalled you saying this morning that roddy lent you his digger to put in some trenches near the chapel only i was watching my good friend mr parry today you could take a digger as i presume roddy often did from his garage to this churchyard along the path through the fields in what ten minutes bit longer at night youre insane its just a thought piers neither you nor lynsey would want melanie buried near the baptist chapel if there was ever any chance of a real archaeological dig nowhere safer for a body than a graveyard and whod be next in there tony lodge well not in the near future we all trust and hope and anyway as soon as they saw bone down there itd be whoops thats another one slid down the hill better move on a couple of yards unless they found this merrily held up the angel bit of a give away was to us anyway the angel shone with a coppery light brighter somehow than the lighting globes yeh thats odd bliss said i cant explain why they didnt take that off her dispose of it a discreet cough from gomer likely dint see him ennit if her weared him under her clothes next to the skin like mabbe he wouldnt be visible at night if they was in a hurry but then the clothes starts to rot up he comes thank you gomer he knew as well as she did that it couldnt have happened like that because the fabric of the clothes had not rotted the angel shone from merrilys hand and burned with a soft heat a witness perhaps it had found its own way to the surface what do you think piers bliss asked what should i think i have no proof youve found anything at all bliss said steadily you planted her pal lets start with that see where it gets us you dare to accuse me of that in front of all these witnesses im feeling lucky bliss opened the door into the porch go on if you want you go home and have a couple of glasses of your favourite fifteenyearold malt and a good nights sleep or maybe youd prefer to lie awake all night and think about it work out your story bliss was winging it merrily thought he wouldnt even have seen what was in the grave or perhaps if you want to be less public about it you could drop in at police headquarters tomorrow bliss held open the door and froze he took a cautious step back then relaxed smiling thinly ah mr laurence robinson as i live and breathe merrily almost ran down the aisle lol stood in the doorway smiled bashfully at her the way he always did when she was in uniform but the slanting alien eyes were watching sardonically from the region of his chest merrily stopped if youve come to collect the little woman she may be a while yet bliss let lol in and closed the door who the hells this connorcrewe was looking limp with unease now lol said nothing he went to stand with gomer in a shadowed spot under a stone plaque commemorating ald joseph albert persham if you drop in at headquarters bliss said to connorcrewe we can fingerprint you take a little dna swab and that should put you in the clear you dont frighten me in the least connorcrewe said youre an ambitious little bastard but of limited intelligence he dont need intelligence chris cody was leaning wearily against a pewend rubbing his face and then looking over his fingers at connorcrewe and for what its worth he frightens me you got no idea have you piers you dont know what these animals are like mate merrilys hand closed around the angel she was staring like everyone else at this slightly built man in an oversized overcoat who could buy and sell all of them and the church around them cody shook his head like he was sick of the whole thing its a murder inquiry now they lose all sense of proportion on a murder specially if its a woman or a kid theyll lie theyll plant evidence theyll have you on a fucking sandwich mate youre this upperclass bastard whos been to fucking oxford they love nailing a nob chris what on earth are you connorcrewe was sweating you go out there cody said youll find another twenty coppers lined up like bleeding dominoes im telling you soon as i knew they had the body im like you know this is it we been set up we walked into it merrily exchanged glances with frannie bliss the tip of an angel wing was piercing her palm and she felt almost faint but bliss was deadpan entirely relaxed as if hed been expecting this and wondered why it had taken them so long but he hadnt inside hed be as shaken as she was she looked around for huw and found him sitting on the chancel step leaning forward with his hands in prayer position between his knees not looking at anyone listening bliss said who killed melanie mr cody cody looked at piers connorcrewe and shrugged lynsey of course he said oh yeah and fred west moira cairns drove quite slowly out of hereford her face lightly tanned by the dashlight hands low down on the wheel relaxed like they had been all night like she was totally unaware of the tension in jane he was awfully good yes like i was scared out ma mind when he first went out there but jesus once he was into it it was like this was the second week of his longawaited world tour and i guess the reason for that was he had something bigger on his mind mmm a long pause as cairns let this huge lorry come growling past for christs sake and youre thinking lol and i are making out yeah sorry well im sorry too if thats way off cairns said but i couldnae think of a better reason for you behaving the whole time like a wee pain in the arse you know its the way i am jane said i am a pain in the arse and then as cairns slowed right down for the whitecross roundabout she said are you er no were not oh wheres eirion jane dumped me for being a pain in the arse something like that uh huh moira cairns drove in silence for maybe half a mile the road was quiet too then she said but when lifes such a bitch and the worlds this big kidney stone floating in a universe of liquid manure wheres the point in not being a pain in the arse jane turned her head and looked directly at cairns neither of them was smiling jane moistened her lips have you been speaking to eirion not since the night the both of you were there at profs and eirion was doing most of the talking then why just wondered they hit the countryside and she turned away to look out at the empty fields opening up on the left all the way to the black mountains tell me something jane does it make it worse when your mothers a priest of god how do you mean well shes up in the pulpit telling a dwindling audience about the kingdom of heaven and youre thinking whats this shite i wouldnt say that to her or at least no more than twice a week thats not exactly but hell if its what you think jane said anguished its not what i used to think but in those days youd had no real experience of life right jane slumped it was like all her thoughts and fears had been laid out in this smorgasbord situation and the cairns woman was collecting a slice of this a segment of that on a plate and poking them with her fork but not actually eating anything next right she said and as they made the turn at the sign pointing to weobley she rallied hit back with the big one do you believe in god they must have driven for nearly a mile before the reply came they were passing through a wooded stretch no visible sky the headlights on full doesnae mean i have to like the bastard what god whatever heshe is if it thinks you can take it its likely to give you a hard time you want a nice life the best way is to turn up for the weddings and funerals and dont even think about any of it the rest of the time but that or of course the other way is whenever some shit comes at you you say ah well its the will of god that works that saves a lot of heartache so your philosophy is what you just heard it i dont think i believe you but once in a while i forget and i stick my head out the trench then slam two black eyes chipped teeth nosebleed and when people say youre psychic aw now jane you know what a pile of crap that is jane said cant you go any faster probably would there be a good reason to i dont know jane said you could try telling me chris cody looked over at connorcrewe theres no point now mate he folded his arms his back braced against the pew end and addressed bliss one night piers asked me round and there was four of us piers and me and lynsey and this woman who worked for piers down the shop and after some stuff lynsey says what would you like most in the world apart from this and she pulls up her anyway thats how it started the magic bliss smiled i dunno what i was expecting black robes and upside down crosses maybe but it was nothing like that well candles bit of atmosphere and a circle bit of mumbojumbo but nuffing you couldnt live with the others had done it before but lynsey said that wasnt a problem she said outsiders could bring in new energy lynsey was in charge oh yeah piers was im sorry mate like a bloody schoolgirl when lynsey was there sometimes you felt shed got more testosterone than any of us anyway we were pretty smalltime at the factory then struggling you know and there was this contract i was after to run a system for this new stationery manufacturer over at tewkesbury and lynsey asks me to describe the place and talk about it and then refine what i want into this like single image image huw said from the chancel steps im not telling you what it was cause im superstitious wasnt then but i am now the four of us had to fink about the image and then we sat in a circle naked almost touching but not quite and then for gods sake connorcrewe snapped they can imagine the rest and you got the contract merrily said oh yeah first of many that year before i went home lynsey told me some fings i could like practise fings i could do he grinned uncomfortably you know on me own to build up the visualization skills in connection wiv anyway the next time i went no the time after that roddy lodge was there i didnt know who he was but there was a hell of a i mean it was incredible powerful you know it was like youd taken somefing acid or somefing at one stage i couldve sworn there was other people wiv us big black figures weird this was still at the old rectory nah this was in the chapel the old baptist chapel i didnt like it at first in there it was a bit cold im like whats the point of this then i found out chris cody shook his head roddy and that chapel crazy energy you know you come out you felt you could do anyfing was roddy on his own bliss asked no melanie nah i didnt know about melanie then but a few months later we goes along to the chapel i mean im well into it by then i had a few qualms now and then but bloody hell anyway i get there and roddys on his way over and theres this girl like clinging to his legs and that screaming at him like does he want to destroy himself dont he realize what hes getting into and shes crying and screaming and hes trying to ignore it and hes pulling away but in the end shes making so much of a scene he has to go back wiv her and he dont come in that night at all and you could really tell the difference wivout him there somefing missing you know i cant put this into words but somefing definitely missing merrily glanced at the coffin and caught ingrid sollarss look ingrid was sitting straightbacked on the edge of her pew as if she was on horseback there was a couple of other times roddy didnt show chris cody said and we knew she was getting to him wearing him down one night we couldnt get in shed been up and locked the chapel which was becoming our place by then essential we all knew it was moving now like big time and we was scared of losing the momentum one day piers says why dont we buy it off of him with your money of course bliss said yeah well id got a bit by then and this was important like it was all tied in wivout what we had going there wouldnt be no money the energy we was generating you know i mean i know what it must sound like coming out wiv all this in church and everything but it didnt feel bad it didnt feel bad not then bliss said and you thought it might be better given his domestic problems if the chapel wasnt owned by roddy lodge wasnt as if it was worth much and i felt it was putting something back so we got nye to arrange it and the development committee was up and running and we put in for grants turn it into a museum course wed still use it lynsey said thatd be cool surrounded by all these ancient ritual artefacts and that bliss looked across at ingrid sollars did you know about this no she didnt cody said nor did fergus and i bloody wish i never had now why bliss asked innocently you were doing all right look id probably stillve been doing all right i realize that now but lynsey was charismatic she could make you believe anyfing especially when it was all so intoxicating like it was around this time that roddy gets the contract with efflapure never looked back lynsey magicked it truth was lynsey knew this guy who was a director of efflapure and she rigged it probably blackmailing the guy over something knowing lynsey i found out later but roddy never knew he fought shed magicked it for him magicked it bleedin hell aye huw said thats how it works they operate outside the rules all the rules sex drugs blackmail you can never work out where it begins or quite where the evil seeps in so you fixed up to buy the chapel bliss said yeah id just do fings on a whim then i was flying man what was roddys relationship with lynsey around this time merrily asked oh like he was hypnotized it was pretty much like you said she was giving him the makeover and melanie she went away for a few weeks she was ill and she went away and lynsey just moved in wiv roddy and she had him i mean really had him in her hand and then this complete makeover we didnt know what was happening then but i never seen a bloke change so fast and then melanies back looking really well you know fresh i mean she was a nice girl and like the vicar said she was on at roddy to get treatment we didnt know what that was about but lynsey did and thats when fings started happening like very fast we me and piers we get summoned to the baptist chapel by lynsey yeah when you was summoned you went mate you didnt get her angry you couldnt predict what she was gonna so we went it was one afternoon and roddy was out on a job for efflapure and lynseys there alone except for this big thick plastic sack lynsey and a sack like shes just collected the rubbish for the tip never forget that fucking sack tied up with orange baler twine she opens it up so we can see in jesus melanie bliss said cody rubbed his eyes worst fing ive ever seen how bliss said strangled froat was all black you know tongue out stiff rigor mortis and the fucking smell and lynseys shouting at us come on move yourselves get this out and i knew if we didnt help her i mean you didnt know which way shed go she wasnt safe merrily came closer and realized he was rubbing his eyes because he was crying cody looked at her she said she done it for fred west she said fred west had been wiv us from the start when we was doing the business the rituals fred fucking west over our shoulders she said he huw owen spoke over merrilys shoulder liked to watch apocryphal as they filed down the hill into the halflit street sam hall said maybe we oughta be chanting a litany like in the darkest hour of the plague when the minister led a procession through ross huw who was leading them rounded on him its not a school outing best if we dont even talk he was afraid of shattering the spell merrily thought dissolving the horror before its time to keep this little ragbag congregation he needed them all to accept the continued reality of the evil needed to keep the lamp of the wicked held aloft lest anyone should start to see this as no more than a sordid tale of smalltown ambition and sexual games gone catastrophically wrong she was still holding melanies angel like a talisman apprehensive he might know what he was doing but was he the right person to be doing it oh yes theyd been in the wrong place huw had known that from the beginning lodge leave him be lass whos he harming now well do the chapel huw scenting the enemy lol walked beside merrily she sensed a calm around him which meant the concert had either been a big success or a monumental failure hed whispered that moira was taking care of jane moira jane and moira a police car slid past towards the church cody and connorcrewe had already been taken to hereford in separate cars bliss had not arrested either of them simply asking with a certain savage courtesy if theyd care to discuss it in more depth what would the charges be accessories to the concealment of a murder cody said he and piers had taken the body through the fields in the early hours on a trailer pulled by a quad bike maybe they could simply have shopped lynsey cody said and still saved their business lives all theyd done was participate in what would be known as sex orgies no big deal these days even out here in the sticks merrily suspected that lynsey had had more on them than they would ever disclose bliss had seen them into the cars then hed made a short call and cut the connection and waited within three minutes the phone had buzzed bliss had listened with a foxy little smile and then said no real need for you to turn out at this hour boss then cutting the connection again hed said ruefully flemingll be here in just over an hour gomer had stayed behind with bliss to show the durex suits where to dig as she walked towards the crossroads with the old duffel coat over her alb merrily was still hearing done it for fred west wiv us from the start fred west several years dead who liked to watch it was all that huw had needed they were passing the school now fergus young held up his long head his hair high in the wind and didnt give it a single sideways glance how much had he known he must have known something at the bottom of the hill past the steelshuttered post office and stores and the head office unisex hair salon cherry lodge waited for merrily and whispered we wont come with you if thats all right nobody could expect you to i feel somehow empty inside now cherry said do you know what i mean these were the very people who came to our door asking us to see some sense not damage the community merrily squeezed cherrys arm at least you know now why they were so keen to prevent roddy going into that grave it didnt take much to spark a protest not with people like richard the newsagent around a word here a word there a suggestion that the value of your property might be damaged and if you want to arrange something at hereford crematorium soon as you like id be happy to do it properly thank you cherry said we might sleep tonight eventually merrily raised a hand as the lodges walked away following their lamp up the narrow lane to their bleak farm on the hill above the place that was or wasnt ariconium what would happen to all that now the plans the reconstructions the suspect artefacts and the audiovisuals underhowle where nothing succeeded for long by the grimy gleam of the last street lamp she saw the face of ingrid sollars and wondered about all the things ingrid must have chosen not to see for the sake of progress and yet in this light you might have thought ingrids expression was actually one of relief but then ingrid couldnt know what huw had in mind as he brought out a stubby torch to lead the rest of them past the darkened community hall and out of the village towards roddy lodges garage and the track to the old baptist chapel no wonder he didnt want to talk to anyone jane saw jenny box as soon as they came into the square at ledwardine it was just on closing time at the black swan and some people were leaving urged into their vehicles by an irritable wind jane saw james bulldavies and alison kinnersley who she was sure shed spotted at the courtyard could have got a lift with them if shed realized in time she saw jim prosser back from the eighttilllate and she saw her appalling exschoolmates dean wall and danny gittoes going into the swan in the hope of a last pint and then between the rainy haloes around the fake gaslamps she saw jenny moving across the square not from the pub but from the other side from the direction of her home chapel house jenny box with her scarf over her head like the virgin mary and that flickering flinching blur passing across her face as she paused on the edge of the cobbles as if looking for a light in the vicarage before turning back moira stop moira braked whats wrong its her jenny driscoll where just going the woman with the white scarf over her head uh huh moira said she doesnt know this car did you see what the look on her face that look she has as if her expressions out of synch with her feelings moira pulled up on the edge of the square where you werent supposed to park in the last fifteen minutes jane had just kept talking without thinking like someone did when they were drunk talking about jenny box and the angel which seemed to have brought everything to a crisis telling moira cairns what shed never told anyone about the night shed drunk wine with gareth box and fallen under his spell and the spell of the house autumn wine and firelight the sheer intoxication of it the first time in weeks that shed found any texture in her life and then about last night walking these streets with jenny how weird that had been discovering that she actually liked this manipulator this hatefigure finding that she could understand jennys aching need for a true spiritual refuge somewhere she could feel safe from abuse safe from hypocrisy not daring while she was saying all this even to look at moira cairns who had been after all the other significant hatefigure in her recent life jane moira cut the headlights seriously what do you think is happening here i reckon gareth box is in her house and shes afraid to go back there she said hed defiled her chapel how i dont know it was only a message on the machine shes obviously looking for mum but theres nobody in at the vicarage she doesnt know about this funeral you see she thought it was on friday shes confused messed up you could see that ok moira said why dont we just make sure first that your mum really isnae back yet jane salvaged a smile before you stick your head out of the trench that your house just behind those trees all right ill find somewhere safer to park and ill wait for you here and then what might be a wee bit premature to call the police well go knock on this womans door right jane slid out of the car she was aware of the sharpness of the wind and the shape of the cobble under her shoe texture when they reached the chapel merrily was thinking question everything the feeling was confirmed once they were inside the wooden porch and ingrid had pulled her keys out while huw put down his bag of wine and wafers lurched ahead with his torch and tried the door which thank god stayed shut you wanted it to be open didnt you merrily said in dismay just like in the stories huw didnt reply he levelled his torch beam at the lock so that ingrid could fit her key he wanted it to be open he wanted someone waiting there for him from just outside the porch door someone said hesitantly would this be the one about how if you find the door open and you go in somethings lol merrily stared at the compact silhouette against the sludgy sky its just that ive had another long talk with the person who started it all lol said who was asked by lynsey davies to plant the story as an experiment she had to sit in a café in ross where the schoolkids go and tell the story to some friends in a very loud voice that actually happened mustve been all over the school by goinghome time lol said what happened after that was that lynsey would borrow pierss keys some nights and go down and unlock the chapel door so that you know sometimes it was locked and sometimes sometimes kids like zoe franklin and martin brinkley would be able to walk into the hollow vastness of it and the air would be vibrant with the power of suggestion could it be that simple ingrid sollars sounded relieved id never have admitted it but that scared me if i had to come down here after dark id get sam to come with me she looked over her shoulder at lol im sorry i dont even know who you are this is lol robinson merrily said comfortably him and me were like you and sam only even more secretive she started to laugh huw snarled shush he turned the handle and slammed his shoulder against the door that changes nowt he went in roughly the door juddering lights ingrid followed him in and snapped down the switches the filaments in the hanging bulbs strained to reveal what they could of the former underhowle baptist chapel in all its shabby splendour and of the reverend huw owen who with his dusty scarecrow hair and his liverspotted dog collar was looking suddenly like the minister it deserved in fact huw said what the lads just said makes it worse the bitch was trying to feed it he looked around the hackedat walls at the dust sheets hanging from the gallery then he moved into a shadowed area the size of a carport and came back dragging a plywood tea chest which he upturned and placed at the opposite end to the gallery kicking shards of plaster into the corners altar he said the door just opened as soon as jane touched the knocker the door fell away under her hand into the oaky darkness and she stumbled forward into chapel house moiras hand came from behind took hold of janes arm above the elbow and pulled her back all i did was touch it i know moira said soberly why would she leave it open i mean even in ledwardine she wouldnt jane she wouldnae do that as theyd walked across the square from the lightless rectory just a minute ago jane had seen jenny box at the top of these steps at the door of chapel house she must have rushed in leaving the door unsecured but there were no lights on inside the wroughtiron lantern over the adjacent alley also remained unlit just like the other night if you want the absolute truth jane moira said i do not like the feel of this jane held on to the railing and glanced back down the steps just a few doors away the black swan was fully lit a couple of men chatting by the entrance a car door slammed on the square the whole situation was absolutely normal look she said were going to look stupid if we start raising the alarm and then its nothing its not like this is some remote shush a minute moira slipped inside can you hear something i wont hear a bloody thing if you dont just stay there all right what are you doing im trying to ok cmere a minute jane stepped into the darkness she thought for a moment that she could smell the beautiful sensuous scent of apple wood but then she couldnt whats that moira said oh there was this gilded sliver in the middle distance low down in the darkness dont move hen she could hear moiras hand sliding about on the wall and then the lights came on subdued concealed lamps sheening the old oak panels something was lying on the floor jane clutched moiras arm its a rug moira said rolled up but whats that alongside the golden bar was a slit in the floor a light on underneath it trapdoor jane whispered that has to be her chapel down there moira called out hello you left your front door open nothing moira went and tapped on the trapdoor hello down there mrs box theres a ring handle yes jane i can see the ring handle moira sighed and pulled it the trapdoor came up as easily as the front door had opened as if it was on a pulley system uncovering a mellow vault of light ill go down jane said she knows me you bloody well will not go down moira called out hello you ok down there mrs box she pulled a face and put a foot on one of the stone steps be careful aye moira went down she wasnt creeping she was clattering which was sensible if jenny was holed up in there expecting trouble best not to scare her moira was down there like for ever or that was how it seemed jane looked out of the front door could see the tail lights of a car on the square could hear voices yeah cheers someone shouted and a car horn beeped situation normal jane was about to go down the steps when moira emerged right jane she said briskly lets go yeah with no makeup you could tell straightaway how pale shed gone jane said oh shit what jane moira pointed at the front door out what lets keep this nice and quiet huh well talk about it outside jane slammed the front door shutting them in something welling up in her chest no i want to know whats happened to her moira sighed isnae her its its him i guess gareth big moustache yes staring at moira jane moved towards the steps moira pushed down the hatch and stood on it i really dont think so i its not that i dont think you can take it because im sure youve seen dead people before no just she had her hands on janes shoulders i dont think we should touch anything jane looked back at the closed front door and pulled away from moira ran to another door flung it open saw the cold green tint on leaded glass the room shed been in with gareth light from the hall showed that the fireplace was dead she backed out went to the foot of the oak stairs and shouted up jenny leave it moira hissed for christs sake shes beaten the guys head in with a bloody great iron cross and theres blood over three walls now will you just open that front door and get the jenny jane ran up the stairs jenny huw stood in front of his teachest altar with the chalice on it and the saucer of wafers and addressed the five of them ingrid sam fergus lol merrily were asking god to cleanse this place of evil over his head a pale bulb burned coldly on a black flex i want us all to be quite sure what were about merrily said i honestly dont see how we can be sure aye huw looked down at his shoes all right ive an axe to grind as merrily knows a woman who became a very close friend of mine lost a daughter it were thought to frederick west donna furlowe found not in the garden or the cellar at cromwell street or under fingerpost field or letterbox field but in the forest of dean was it west or an imitator or was it a person or persons who believed they had let him in merrily saw that theyd instinctively formed a semicircle around huw at one end lol looking a little shivery in his alien sweatshirt and pensive at the other the lanky darksuited fergus young look huw pushed out his hands i dont know who killed donna could very wellve been lynsey davies and one day somebody might find the finger bones that were taken away from her and they might find them here and then well know but until then all we know is the source and the source is the evil that was nurtured in west and in rosemary west im inclined to say that that were a demonic evil and may eventually have to be dealt with as such but not yet merrily said not until we know huw said nothing lets be sure about this huw youre saying that the malign earthbound essence of west with his beloved cromwell street removed from the face of the earth was invoked here ingrid broke the semicircle to approach huw can i say something aye lass lets have a debate weve got all night mr owen i told you that the people who ran the bottling plant were evasive on the phone last night about the name of the contractor it was worrying me so i rang them back this afternoon last night i spoke to the man today i got the woman and a rather different story she implied that the contractor was in fact a relative who did the job for cash in hand and that was why did you believe her i saw no reason not to i can see every reason sergeant mumfordd certainly heard the rumour about west working here huw merrily said youve just heard how another rumour was spread for gods sake it could be apocryphal maybe he was never here this psychotic woman for all we know she might never even have been at cromwell street so many people here have just lied and lied a moments silence huw shrugged all right how would you play it lass merrily shook her head it was one of those situations when this game of deliverance the whole of religion seemed too full of holes and traps to be worth the candle she looked at huw tiredeyed and robbed of redemption and then fergus young said do i understand that in the absence of a person to exorcize of this evil your options are limited one way of looking at it huw said fergus moved out and stood in front of the altar and took off his jacket he was wearing a white shirt i think youd better exorcize me then he looked at lol i suppose he knows why fuse your dreams dont you the tall guy challenging lol it was like being pushed out on stage all over again except that the lighting was a little more primitive and although everybody was staring at him it was clear that nobody was expecting to be entertained lol had been waiting for this he could perhaps have made it happen earlier but it had been a long night and hed been hoping it might have been taken out of his hands perhaps it had this fergus young had authority lol had never seen him before tonight but he recognized the aura and it had often in his past been around men in suits followed by lesser men in white coats it was the aura of pseudosanctity it is tracey youve been speaking to i assume young said seeking absolute confirmation tracey lol said and shes saying i was there werent you she was very mixed up that girl i think scared to death might describe it better lol said i realize cola had said in the car on the road to ross that theres no way of concealing that it was me who told you all this but just make sure it isnt for nothing you know what i mean so lol was relieved that fergus young had raised the issue before he himself was forced into it like being pushed out onto the stage now he had to follow through three of them cola had said lynsey developed this bond between these three which was all to do with ariconium which had become a kind of dream place like utopia atlantis it was very strong it gave them focus fuse your dreams she was saying fuse them inside me ariconium lol said it became an excuse for everything you did sam hall was shaking his head how could it be anything good built inside lines of pylons this cage of steel shot through with beams and rays oh for christs sake sam fergus snapped do you never get beyond that drivel look i want to say id have gone with the police with piers and chris but i guess they thought there was a chance of keeping me out of it as the one who must be seen to have integrity the figurehead if i could survive this i suppose there was a chance of pulling it together the eschools the book i was writing and that piers would publish ariconium everything lol looked at merrily small and wideeyed the old duffel coat hanging open over the alb with the muddied hem she clearly hadnt been expecting this but he thought the older woman seemed less shocked in a way it all began with fergus cola had said he was in a sad state it was his first school as headmaster and they were gonna close it down and he reckoned he wasnt well in enough to get another school and his wife was into the status you know oh he was a real loser fergus the night he showed up on pierss doorstep the way people did the way piers encouraged them to your booksellers your counsellor shrink priest all rolled into one what an ego and fergus would come up some nights to get away from his wife and drink too much and this particular night we were there lynsey and me all of us at a bit of a loose end and lynsey suddenly springs up with her eyes all glittering and shes going lets do something about it its like chris said it was incredible how she seemed to turn things around fergus said how ideas came to you that were clear winners came to all of us in reality i suppose it was just because it brought the three of us together people who could help each other and the community coming together in that spirit of release outside the rules and when we managed to pull the school back from the brink of closure and turn it into something extraordinary it was suddenly it was something bigger than all of us he turned to huw owen whod started to say something huw hadnt taken his eyes off fergus young since hed used the word exorcize i suppose youd say there was something slightly faustian about it and perhaps youd be right but we didnt feel that at the time it was release and not only sexual to us she was an extraordinary woman who seemed able to open doors one hadnt even known were there and look at what we achieved look at it look at what we achieved for everybody but look how it was achieved merrily said bleakly look fergus said when we found out about her past associations we i was determined to get out of it any way i could i think when they thought they were all on top of the situation and maybe they didnt need her any more that was when they got you know a little blasé a little well you didnt ever diss that woman lol not if you valued your peace of mind what she had was hard won and nobody was gonna you know nobody so maybe that was when she started to be less circumspect and she was involving roddy by then and roddy was this real wild card and that was when i started to try and get out of the circle keep different company cause i could see it going pearshaped in front of my eyes i knew what she was and where shed been and they couldnt see it not for a long time they were just too high on it all huw owen said you were here in this chapel after lynsey davies killed melanie with the other two yes fergus said therefore you were part of the coverup i ferguss mouth tightened come on lad if you were sooner or later one of the others is going to spill it to the police you think they wont shop you but they will like young cody said its a murder inquiry now fergus said we all decided to keep quiet about it for the good of the community huw said we were doing great things we had an energy was she blackmailing you in the end lol suggested thats nonsense really rubbing their noses in it lol cromwell street the whole bit where shed come from and therefore where they were coming from what they were by association now part of it must have seemed very dirty and repugnant maybe piers could take a little of that but im not sure about the others i mean chris was a street kid but bloody hell as for fergus a primaryschool head a man in charge of developing the minds of little children but she knew that i think she knew what it would do to fergus and thats why she was concentrating on him when we found out about her fergus was saying im not even going to try to tell you what that was like for me lol said but your whole future and the future of the community was somehow mortgaged to her now i mean if she did something again if she killed somebody and this time she got caught it would all come out fergus shook his head wasnt so much her we were worried about as him lodge she was going round with him looking for opportunities for him like mrs pawson lol said he saw merrilys face twist i dont know anything about that but there were other instances they were becoming totally irresponsible the pair of them like delinquents undisciplined they thought they were protected invulnerable protected by us in a way because we were at the centre of the establishment especially chris and me lodge by this time was becoming quite mad and his condition was worsening hed be having blackouts all the time but he didnt realize or he didnt care because in other respects he was having the time of his life number one merrily said lol said satan and sam hall looked at him and so he gave them the explanation of this that hed had on the phone from mephisto jones sometimes with eh you experience dramatic temperature changes particularly at the extremities hands feet genitals holy shit sam hall said in the days of the witchhunts when women would be made to confess to having intercourse with the devil theyre supposed to have said that they could tell it was him because his penis was so cold merrily was nodding yes and in roddys first statement to the police he said lynsey liked to call him satan because he was hard and cold and therefore i mean maybe she convinced him he could have relations with any woman he wanted particularly if she was dead maybe in his dreams i dont his electric dreams sam said its quite obscene fergus said everything we had going here was threatened by this unstable odious little twerp his fantasies and his his keeper yes im afraid we were all immensely relieved when he killed lynsey getting rid of both of them two people who were beyond the pale seemed like a kind of cleansing we could move on now and if thats a terrible admission to make im facing the truth im facing my demons not really though are you lol was thinking and maybe sam wasnt fooled either i wouldnt rule it out fergus that one of you somehow got it over to roddy that lynsey murdered his girlfriend melanie how far off the truth would i be there fergus reared up no certainly not being glad at what happened even grateful is one thing but actually conspiring to make it happen no i couldnt do that you know me you must realize how deeply deeply sorry i am for ever becoming involved in something so ultimately obnoxious i only ask you to believe that it began at a difficult time emotionally for me and that i did not know the kind of psychotic individual we were dealing with and i want to go on serving this community because theres so much for me still to do you know that ingrid sam you know that we mustnt fall back lol looked at him standing there in his white shirt the local hero regrettably a little tarnished by an unfortunate choice of friends in adverse circumstances but humbly seeking redemption here i am baring my back for the lash fergus turned to huw i would like to take communion from you i would like to confess to pray for absolution i would like you to exorcize me huw didnt respond lol felt suddenly very very tired and he just wanted to get this over mr young he said why dont you just tell them how you killed lynsey jane went timidly into the bedroom the only one with a light showing under the door on the bedside table a small table lamp with a parchment shade was spreading a honey warmth the bedlinen was all white there were magnolia rugs on the oak floorboards a plain wooden cross hung on the white wall over the bed under oak beams stained almost black there was an overwhelming silence in here as thick as candle wax jenny wore a long white nightdress with a high neck she lay on her back with her hands loosely clasping a small white prayer book crossed over her breasts her eyes were open but there was a glaze on them a blur she would always be blurred there was a carafe of water on a bedside table and a glass and two small brown bottles with their tops off designer death jane thought cynically for just a moment before she began to cry quietly going down onto her knees and touching one of the hands which was like porcelain and cold dont jane moira said softly dont touch a thing shes not a thing jane said no im sorry jane looked up at moira i dont understand shes so cold shes been dead quite some time jane since long before we got here no she couldnt be we saw her on the square on the cobbles she there was silence the leaded window was greygreen and mysterious in the subtle lamplight with just a faint reflection of the room of jane herself kneeling by the bed but jenny box was invisible in the reflection and even in reality remained amorphous and indistinct no moira said gently we didnt see her you did janes voice rose querulous you mustve seen her no janes voice almost vanished oh god she breathed oh my god but what if he was wrong this had been kicking at lols insides ever since hed watched lodge up there edging towards inevitable death since the night hed lain in bed with merrily and said how can anybody feel sorry for a man who killed women that sense of lodge as just another loser whats it like hed asked mephisto jones how long does it last oh man complete disorientation mephisto said you dont know where youve been or what youve done its not like drink not even quite like dope youre well out of it well out of it the final piece had dropped into place just now in the church when the computer guy had been spilling it all to bliss the thing was lol hadnt been able to see either of those two in the role but this one this one he could see cola trying to conceal the fear had said just make sure it isnt for nothing he looked up at the visceral hanging bulbs so reminiscent of the dull lights in the hospital corridors of his twenties and at the drabness of the place above all he hated drabness his own song was raging in his head now someones got to pay now dr gascoignes on his way he looked at fergus and saw dr gascoigne whom all the nurses loved he took a breath the air here smelled foul to him now he said to fergus you said roddy lodge had blackouts more and more often he must have had them in front of you a few times maybe during magical practices especially in this chapel right under the pylon right here in the middle of the hot spot how long was he out of it usually five minutes ten longer i never studied it fergus said distantly we tried to help him lol said why dont you take us through lynseys last night you were there what are you talking about youre absolutely crazy fergus said cola couldnt i know cola wasnt there i didnt get this from cola she probably doesnt even have an inkling i dont know what youre talking about fergus turned to the others whats he talking about lol exploded oh you fucking do know i get so pissed off with people like you teachers shrinks he squeezed his eyes closed and heard fergus saying whats the matter with him is he on medication lol felt a merciful warmth and when he opened his eyes merrily was next to him and she was holding his hand pressing something hot and metallic into it holding his hand closed over it holding him together he put his arm around her he needed help he instinctively knew the truth of it but he couldnt make that final leap blackouts huh sam hall was rubbing his white beard lol remembered sam on the night of the execution shit coming off of the power lines hes gonna be disoriented by now his balancell go completely cant they see that warning the police about what might happen empathizing with the man on the pylon sam help me lol said roddy lodge wasnt a killer he probably wasnt a very nice man especially in the end but he didnt kill this melanie and i really dont think he killed lynsey davies either but when he shook his head trying to clear the fog sam said youre saying that when he came round from a blackout resulting from heavy electrical bombardment he mightve thought he had yeah yeah lol breathed and he felt the breath coming out of merrily too if you i mean if there were certain people who knew hed often have blackouts in a certain situation say like in here they were coming more and more often i think mr young just said but if they were all ready for it ready for the next one to happen and there was another person among them whom they very much needed to kill theyd wait till roddy was out of it and then do it sam hall started to smile and when he came round with the body at his feet theyd say jeez look what you did you crazy bastard or maybe theyd just go out and leave him to come round on his own and find it he might not remember theyd even been here too are you both mad fergus young cried and lol could hear the strain the striving for effect i tell you though sam said killing like this by strangulation not everyones capable of that that is ultimate contact killing intimate killing i never did think roddy lodge could do that but this isnt getting us anywhere is it huw owen said almost brightly this is all daft speculation he looked at fergus you meant what you said about being cleaned out lad fergus glanced suspiciously from side to side what kind of setup its entirely up to you huw said nobody ever gets forced lol looked at fergus the head teacher the goldenhaired golden boy of underhowle the local hero the man who wore the admiration of the community like a halo and fergus looked down at huw and smiled ruefully rather set myself up for this one didnt i he shrugged all right do what you want huw shook his head regretfully not me lad im too close to it he turned putting out an open hand in invitation merrily sacrificial huw moved rapidly setting up candles on the packing case and lighting them sam and ingrid stood quietly with lol against the wall while fergus prowled restlessly like an actor waiting to be auditioned going over his lines when merrily caught his gaze once he smiled and shook his head its a farce we both know that minor exorcism merrily murmured to huw you reckon aye but you cant mess about hes not going to sit still for the whole bit have to compress it a little is he a christian ask him no dont bother youll find out huw you tricked him he tricked himself huw said now put the lights out merrily took off her coat knelt at the packing case and prayed the cold seeped through her alb and it felt as though her back was naked she was aware of huw standing behind her as if trying to shield the fragile candle flames from an unfelt wind she said the lords prayer muttered st patricks breastplate and wondered what this spontaneous makeshift ritual without any of the important preliminaries could possibly achieve was this huw grabbing his last chance while fergus was relaxed enough or hypocritical enough to throw himself at the mercy of a god in whom he had probably never believed huw whispered call him merrily said fergus huw and lol had dragged over one of the rubber mats and then folded a dust sheet and laid it on top lol squeezing her hand and leaving something in it where do you want me fergus said might be as well if you just knelt if thats not too uncomfortable i try to keep myself flexible merrily good fergus knelt she stood she still didnt have far to gaze down on his open bony face his wideapart brown eyes had he was any of this even conceivable she saw how long and bony his hands were knuckles like ball if you could move a little closer to the altar she wanted it so the two candles lit the upper part of his face so that she could see his eyes it was always going to be the eyes very quietly huw was removing from the bag two items the white diary of lynsey davies and a small picture the miniature in its slender frame and he was edging silently along the dust sheeted wall towards the entrance he could leave this to the lass he had to huw crept away to be on his own he hadnt eaten for more than a day now hed awoken at five am in the dark and had spent nigh on three hours in meditation at the window his room had faced east she were thoughtful like that the lass and before the dawn came hed established inside himself a centre of calm to which periodically during the day hed returned his head was light now filled with this quiet incandescence that was still linked to his spine as he padded down the body of the chapel arriving at the side of the door standing there with his back to a hanging dust sheet looking down to the altar at the opposite end of the chapel where between the shapes of the people gathered there he could see the candlelight as remote from him now as starlight he placed the diary on the flagstones at his feet and held the miniature for a few moments in both hands too dark to see it but the image was clear to him he could see the face of donna furlowe sketched by her mother in pale grey pastel on white paper so that it was like an imprint on a sheet or a shroud huw knelt and clasping the picture to his heart held it there behind his hands as he put them together to pray with the bulbs out there was a vague ball of light around them merrily could barely see anyone else our father she said the lords prayer the old exorcism for the second time slowly and she could hear the others joining in a grounded echo she saw that fergus was mouthing some of the words but not all of them as if finding them difficult to remember he looked briefly puzzled merrily said deliver us merciful lord from all evils past and present and to come and grant us peace in our day keep us free from sin and safe from all distress fergus knelt with his heavy proud head raised up like the prow of a viking longboat his eyes closed where was he where were his thoughts taking him merrily floundered sought out huws shadow couldnt see him anywhere but she thought she heard his whisper confession yes she thought of course almighty god in penitence we confess that we have sinned against you through our own fault in thought word and deed no penitence no regrets course there wasnt he was what he was no getting round that hed scratched it out on the wall of his creampainted cell at winson greenfreddy the mass murderer from gloucester gloucester not hereford them days was long gone hed picked gloucester made his home there made it hisself filled it full of hisself and what hed took bringing bits of gloucester home some nights hed go back to number not to the place it was now look emptied and gutted by the bloody coppers but what it used to be full of sweat and heat vibrating with it him too he was strong then at his peak ready for anything work hard play hard that was him now hed lost a lot of weight didnt feel too good no more not here in this shithole no privacy nothing to see nothing to watch nothing to watch here but him people looking at him all the bloody time having a laugh the laughs echoing across the exercise yard build us a patio fred ho ho days fading into more days going nowhere never going nowhere again never working for hisself again no more building things with his hands nothing to do with his hands no more no women no more women ever no wife when they was in court she wouldnt look at him after all hed done for her trying to keep her out of it telling the coppers she didnt know nothing and she ent talking to them neither and him hes talked enough all hes got left nows his secrets the who and the when and the where the howmanytimes they dont know next to nothing when you works it out ent got the half of it and thats all right by him freddy the mystery man freddy the mass murderer from gloucester and huw stood there in the gutted chapel and he could hear the voice well enough but he couldnt feel anything no energy all he was getting was the husk in the prison cell on new years day the day the prison officer couldnt get the cell door open because of what was hanging behind it from a rope made out of versions differed a prison blanket or prison shirts this was the very worst crime to be committed against the relatives of every missing girl in britain allowing him to do it letting fred escape with all his secrets why hadnt they the police the prison authorities put the psychology together realized just how depressed he was likely to become without the anticipation of gross and grosser sexual excesses to heat his blood had nobody guessed hed become empty a husk insubstantial enough to hang maybe they had maybe they just bloody had hed heard of coppers whod cheered when theyd heard about the death at winson green a banner going up nice one fred something as inane as that and now nobody would know the who the where the how many lynsey had written her secrets down in the magickal diary but amiable garrulous fred had been barely literate and rose was saying nowt freddy the man of mystery and those who followed him lynsey and the others the unknown others whod lived in cromwell street or had just dropped in for an hour or two and would never be identified now out there with the virus inside them huw stared into the darkest corner of the chapel listening for the remains of the laughter and the sniggers the sound of a hammer thrown from a ladder clanging on the flags he heard nothing but the drone of merrilys ad hoc ritual useless in itself it was all useless there was nobody watching nothing worthy of a fight huw held the pastel drawing of donna by julia close to his aching heart thinking of all the relatives and friends and lovers of longmissing girls and women who did something like this every night and he broke down at some point ferguss eyes opened and merrily came in at once with the ritualized question what do you want from god in his holy church fergus unprepared made no reply at first while she waited she could hear the wind outside coming down off howle hill sam halls line came into her head insidious wind where was sam she couldnt see him where was lol all she could see were ferguss eyes looking into hers i want fergus said what i deserve he smiled at her merrily felt a hollowness in her stomach she gripped the angel pendant and felt the weight of her pectoral cross do you renounce the devil and all the spiritual forces of wickedness that rebel against god fergus kept smiling sure do you renounce all the evil powers of this world that corrupt and destroy what god has created i yes fergus said of course do you renounce all sinful desires that draw you away from the love of god when he hesitated merrily saw that he was looking at her breasts then he looked up oh yes he said the heat from the pendant went right up her arm she looked into his eyes then and knew what a cliché that was seen it in his eyes windows of the soul all that stuff in ferguss eyes she saw nothing at all a void an absence it was like opening the doors of a lift and finding that you were looking directly down the shaft the absence that could now only be filled with life and energy when his hands were exploring you when the eyes were lighting up like little torch bulbs when he was swimming towards you through a pool of liquid lust merrily knew that she was seeing what lynsey davies had seen been surprised and probably delighted by in the second before he came for her with what a thin belt was the pathologists suggestion according to bliss but no belt had ever been found perhaps it was roddys fergus bending over the unconscious roddy as if to help him sliding the belt out of his trousers and then subduing lynsey with his fists she saw blood jetting from lynseys nose and then the image cut to the belt each end wrapped around one of ferguss hands and then its length pulled tight around lynseys throat silence soaked her head and then over it she heard quite clearly and crisply show you whats what where the bits goes you little smart bitch do you renounce yes of course i renounce everything fergus smiled is that it thats up to you she said oh im sure that will do fergus stood up thank you merrily i imagine we all feel so much better for that and he walked out of the glow and into the darkness laughing ingrid sollars said laughing at us didnt you feel that i didnt feel anything there wasnt anything to feel merrily turned to the altar and saw that the candles had gone out but her eyes had long since adjusted it seemed much lighter in here and she could see ingrid and sam and lol quite plainly were we all expecting a confession hes not that dumb sam said all the people who know the truth are dead hell i can see it all now the panic roddy musta been in a killing he didnt recall a body on the floor right here whats he gonna do maybe they even advised him fergus and piers you cant bury her here buddy all these excavations were gonna have must surely be someplace youve been working lately where you could stash her mmm merrily walked away looking for huw whose idea this had been and what a pointless exercise she was disappointed in him which she knew was wrong he was just a man with a burden perhaps what she was really avoiding was her disappointment in god into whose hands this had been placed in the hope of a solution and there was none not really no one had been redeemed cola french sam hall mused i recall her now shed stay some weekends with piers i guess came along to the village hall with him sometimes bright kid but what i wondered lol he looked around whered he go lol merrily could see him across the chapel quite clearly silhouetted against a dust sheet hanging from the ceiling silhouetted because there was a blush on the cloth a warm glow inside it lol was gathering the cloth into his arms and pulling on it whats happening ingrid said when the sheet came down with a shower of dust and plaster fragments merrily saw it had concealed a gothic window that was both tall and wide and had plain glass in it and what she saw through the glass explained why it was now so bright in here cherry lodge was wearing her old parka and her hair was matted to her forehead she was panting there was a pile of old tyres beside her and she lifted one quite easily and threw it into the flames we piled some tyres all around first she said i didnt want to see him go up did i a tractor was parked at the edge of the field not far from the end wall of the baptist chapel it had a trailer attached and there were more tyres on that left over from the footandmouth pyres cherry said railway sleepers wouldve been better but there was no time for that see i dont know whatll happen if it goes out before hes all gone the flames with the wind under them now lit up the pylon at the bottom of the field when merrily and the others had first come out of the chapel it had looked as though the pylon itself was alight as though the flames were filling it up inside turning it into some metal wicker man of the new millennium sacrificial fire it had taken merrily a long time to work out what was happening here ingrid sollars had been the first to realize showing no shock at all mr lomas she said drily would be most offended underneath the stench of diesel and burning rubber merrily detected the worst smell of all barbecue roast pork nev she coughed into a hand and wondered if gomer was here among the small but swelling crowd the bonfirenight crowd the villagers who would never in a million years have turned out for roddy lodges funeral the policeve sent for the fire brigade cherry lodge was smiling tired but triumphant too late now oh theyll probably think of something to charge us with but were only doing what they all wanted arent we my fault merrily thought should have made sure the church was locked she saw lol coming back from the chapel with huw they walked across to the other side of the fire where there were fewer people and merrily was sure she saw huw throw something greywhite into the flames the diary after we left you we went straight back up to the farm we did and piled the tyres on the trailer with the diesel cherry said a wild exhilaration there now and we built up the pyre and then we went back to the church and just wheeled the coffin out on mr lomass bier and loaded him on the trailer and brought him back here nobody noticed the police werent out in force yet just a couple down by the grave your idea merrily asked bit of both he was very bitter tony was about that protest with the banners and the placards lived here longer than any of them and he gets treated like dirt very bitter he was and at roddy too of course let him be cremated empty his bloody ashes in the gutter catharsis merrily thought a hand on her pectoral cross and the lodges didnt yet know that he was probably an innocent man redemption really she looked away in the top corner of the field where it was separated from the land that extended behind roddys bungalow was that a woman standing alone there against the wire fence arms folded very still watching roddy burn or was it just a fence post with an old fraying rag caught in the wire so that it blew back in the wind like hair epilogue the skin was softly sepiatoned the crowsfeet delicately faded out there was an ethereal light around the head angel of our days it said above the picture of merrily she shuddered i cant even think where she got this one from of course itll never be wiped now jane said you realize that youll go on for ever making rings around the world nothing goes on for ever merrily said certainly not on the internet thats true in fact said eirion whod brought along the printout when somebody stops paying for the site itll vanish overnight you dont know jane said odd things happen merrily saw eirion giving her his famous smile and guessed that they were holding hands under the table odd things happen when did the kid last say something like that how quickly they recovered the elasticity of young skin whereas crows feet only got deeper she stretched her legs under the table it was the first time shed felt able if not to relax at least to sag like spending a few moments on a plateau where you could lie on your back and not see the abyss maybe this was the most she could hope for the feeling of not for a while having to look into the abyss on the printout underneath her picture she read the archangel uriel is at this moment working on earth through her servant the reverend merrily watkins deliverance minister for the diocese of hereford on the border of england and wales it is very unusual in the uk where the womens ministry is itself so very young for a woman especially one so youthful to be elevated to this most important and spiritually crucial role we ask for your prayers to aid merrily in what we believe to be the summit of her endeavour the task for which she was chosen above all women we believe that a satanic male maleficence lives on and will be passed on again unless merrily watkins is permitted to exorcize it at the laying down of roddy lodge in the village of underhowle herefordshire you are requested to commence your prayers for merrily now by the grace of god amen it was signed the daughters of uriel and the tone was ludicrously apocalyptic and yet i failed her merrily said dont let anybody say otherwise i did not get any of this right you didnt know jane said you couldnt have known all the praying i do youd think theredve been a little divine intervention merrily said bitterly dont jane said sharply no im sorry maybe there had been how could any of them know jane said just because youre a priest it doesnt have to happen through you the other thing happened through lol i mean didnt it it was lol who exposed that guy yes merrily smiled and lol hated every minute of it merrily had watched fergus or had seemed to in that frigid flicker of transition between man and monster yet he was not a monster he was the best head teacher theyd ever known in underhowle he treated kids like equals and he was endlessly enterprising and affable with everybody only occasionally displaying the steel cord under the velvet which was so essential to a good school director yet already according to frannie bliss the stories were filtering through including the rumours about why ferguss marriage had failed not because his wife had found out about his evenings of recreational release but because of what hed become between the sheets at home a gradual diminishing of tenderness the parallel escalation of sexual violence this indictment had come from ferguss motherinlaw who had thought him such a wonderful man that at first shed accused her daughter of simply being inadequate to his healthy masculine needs how easily and efficiently hed lied exactly the way west had lied revealing nothing until it had already been found out bliss said that if the killing of lynsey davies had not happened exactly as lol had suggested he couldnt have been far out the way frannie saw it the three of them had probably agreed to wait for roddys next blackout and then go for it lol had told merrily about lynseys resonant instruction to the three of them fuse your dreams inside me it would be important for all three of them to kill her fusing the guilt but when it came to it frannie reckoned cody and connorcrewe would have chickened out maybe they didnt have quite enough to lose frannie wanted fergus for this one hed said on the phone that theyd now be turning major heat on cody and connorcrewe he was confident that before the day was out one of them would have pointed the finger and then hed start on fergus huw had gone home to the beacons but he and merrily had arranged to return to the baptist chapel tomorrow possibly with jerome banks and a chalice of harveys spanish red and some white wafers a full exorcism of place would not be underplaying it meanwhile huw had been learning more about lynsey daviess past and was wondering how much of a coincidence it was that donna furlowes body had been found close to the hamlet where lynsey had been born near lydbrook in the forest had donna been killed by lynsey and fred west had after all known the girl or was it as the police had suspected too late in his murderous career for it to be down to fred lynsey and somebody else then not roddy lodge that was more or less certain now lynsey on her own or with another of her old cromwell street friends not long after huw had left gomer had arrived with a man who was as close to a cube as anyone merrily had seen jumbo humphries had parked his blue and white cadillac on the square parallel to the market hall the only spot where it was unlikely to cause an obstruction jumbo had curly hair and stubble and he talked a lot he was from the southern end of the beacons or the top end of the valleys however you wanted to look at it and he talked fast and emotionally a wonderful lady she was mrs watkins a delightful woman i cannot bring myself even to think about it asked myself a thousand times i have since i yeard what could i have done how could we have helped her any of us how could we have saved her jenny box jane said now im not sure anyone could have saved her really im not just saying that ive been thinking about it all day she never told you anything straight out did she she was like so diffuse is that the word i mean sometimes you looked at her and it was like part of her had already left the building you know what i mean yes diffuse gone with the fairies flying with the angels merrily blinked back tears oh god if id only gone to see her yesterday morning instead of what you couldnt do everything maybe if id gone to see her i mean youve hardly slept this week as it is jane leaned over the table both hands around her mug mum it was so strange so unearthly being in that room and her laid out like the lady of shalott i cant when shed come out of chapel house with moira cairns eirion had been there on the square having discreetly followed them back planning only to hand jane the daughters of uriel printout and see what happened then in the end hed stayed all night had been with jane when dci annie howe had arrived with the ubiquitous andy mumford and the scenesof crime investigators a big overtime night for the durex suits theyd all listened to the message on the vicarage answering machine hes defiled my chapel the only interpretation they could put on this was that the chapel had been defiled by gareth boxs body and his blood why hed gone down there why hed even returned from london remained a mystery all that was known for sure was that jenny had smashed him savagely around the head and face with the heavy gilded iron cross that had stood on the altar theyd found jennys bloodstained clothes in a bathroom shed evidently stripped off everything taken a shower and then dressed in that long white edwardian nightdress and gone to lie on the bed with her prayer book her bible a carafe of water and two bottles of sleeping pills andy mumford had called back at the end of his extended shift and merrily had told him about the woman from the mail on sunday whod wanted to speak to her about jenny box mumford already knew about it the mail had been cooperative it seemed that gareth box had supplied them with a large package of background information and a long unattributable interview with himself the proposed end product a definitive profile of jenny driscoll demonstrating conclusively that jenny driscoll had become mad the paper had been told of her gift of eighty thousand pounds to a woman vicar with whom she had become obsessed a vicar who incidentally was having a secret affair with a rock musician who had history box apparently had said that while this little detail might not turn out to be appropriate to the story it might if mentioned make the vicar more amenable to a frank discussion of jennys stalking of her and jenny found out about this merrily had said she killed him and then herself because she found out he was trying to destroy her in the press for whatever commercial reasons thats why we dont know mumford had said but its not the weakest motive ive ever come across but then there was the other thing reason ive called see mrs watkins jumbo humphries had said is i thought i ought to let you know this small thing bugger means i thought he oughter let you know gomer said on account of all that stuff about you he pumped out of me unbeknownst for this lady what you have to understand see jumbo said is this issue of client confidentiality couldnt breathe a word of this while the client was alive and i wouldnt be able to tell you now but for cept for me twisting the fat bastards arm gomer said grimly well yes except for my friendship of many years with mr parry now youll know that i was retained initially through marquis and co the london investigation bureau working on a regular basis for the vestalia company however mrs box so satisfied she was with my services that she asked me to undertake separate inquiries on a more personal basis which of course i was delighted to do this all come about because of the name of a midlandsbased company which sheve noticed in the newspaper in relation to this underhowle business see the name being efflapure see gomer said urgently see merrily blinked well overburdened with information the reason this name struck a chord jumbo humphries said was that although the business side was something she left largely to her husband she was vaguely aware of some investment heve made in this very company efflapure bloody hell merrily said as you say my inquiries at companies house and other sources revealed that mr gareth box had invested substantially in efflapure and was until his death of course a director see gomer said this feller was keeping lodge in work maybe im tired merrily had said but i think theres something im missing eirion finally dragged himself away around six leaving merrily and jane alone in front of the sittingroom fire youre ok merrily asked the kid yeah were ok jane slumped down on the sofa it was dark outside the fire of logs and coal was the only light in the room i feel like ive been away i feel like im still away strange days merrily said head resting on a cushion i dont know what to say its like when lucy devenish died it wasnt real then and this is different obviously because i didnt really know jenny driscoll but i did you know we just walked the streets in the rain for less than an hour and i knew her maybe you had more in common than you imagined she said she was talking about you and she said its a deepembedded evil shes confronting and she needs the angels at her shoulder what did she mean she couldve meant anything i dont really know flower there are lots of things i wish i knew merrily closed her eyes thinking of melanies angel all the little connections you could make if you wanted to what will you do with the money jane asked if it turns out that its mine to give i think im going to find out which charity is supporting research into electro hypersensitivity cool jane said yes im sure ted will agree if threatened will the paper still do this story theyve got a much bigger story now havent they i mean you and lol i think thats very unlikely but i dont really care i think its time me and lol came out as it were youre just saying that because hes this big star now well he is in hereford and then the world jane said i think i saw jenny boxs ghost merrily opened her eyes and sat up it was when we got back here moira and me jenny was walking across the square she mustve been dead some time by then jane gazed into the fire moira didnt see her at all moira didnt know her merrily said softly you couldnt miss her who else walked around with a big white scarf over her head and her face unclear like a face in motion like a face painted by who was that guy francis bacon yeah of course were you scared no not then i didnt know what i was seeing are you scared now a bit when we found her dead it was it was like somebody had played this awful trick on me but afterwards i mean its awesome isnt it its bloody awesome mum the implications you know awesome yes it is sometimes and im sorry mum jane said im really so sorry it was after nine when frannie bliss arrived jane had gone to bed merrily had fallen asleep on the sofa she staggered to the door and brought him back into the lounge you look terrible she said and you look all sleepy and sexy and i didnt say that im a married man just have you even seen kirsty today nope do you have a job bloody right do you want coffee i dont think i will heavens merrily said have we entered a parallel universe the fire had burned low bliss sat down on the sofa ive nicked fergus you sure of him no but by god ill try i want this man so bad i cant breathe when i think about it handle him carefully merrily ill handle him like with those little plastic tongs they give you to shovel a scone onto your plate in these self service joints i er lol lol did well six numbers and an encore you know what i mean yes he did merrily shovelled a little coal onto the fire and poked it until a few small flames appeared i think he was probably the only person who from the very beginning had a strong feeling that roddy lodge was innocent and he didnt let it go it was a new lol lot of changes bliss looked very tired lots still to understand lots we never will listen he moved to the edge of the sofa couple of things you were in from the beginning so im telling you one melanie pullman missing bones oh god two toes and an ankle bone from the left foot theyre definitely not we went down another metre nothing so whats it tell you i dont know merrily i dont know what it tells us the other thing is this he brought a folded sheet of paper from his inside pocket its a photocopy one of the photocopies i showed you before neither of us noticed this but then why should we merrily unfolded the paper and held it close to the flames inside the house of horror exclusive former tenants talk for the first time about real life in twentyfive cromwell street by gareth box christ she said frannie leaned back in his chair box started his career in the gloucester office of the three counties news agency yeah i know three counties they dont pay much but its good experience for a young reporter you get to see your stories in the big papers usually under somebody elses byline but its a start also the big papers get to know you you can make an impression but he wasnt at the news agency when he wrote this was he no he was in london by then working on a national but in quite a lowly position but then the west story breaks and he gets them to send him back to his old hunting ground and he comes up with some heavy dirt he knew exactly whod been in cromwell street when all the murders were happening all the torturing in the cellars he knew exactly who to go to for the inside stuff his paper was very pleased with him never looked back within a year hes an assistant editor in features and writing jenny boxs column and the rest is as they say but you think the real history young reporter in gloucester in the late seventies finding his way earning peanuts in need of some cheap accommodation merrily there is so much so much gossip about that place and he may not have been the only young journalist to have spent some time there there are as im sure youve heard even suggestions that some lads who dropped in for an occasional legover had to take off their dark blue trousers first but box yeh were pretty sure about him oh god frannie merrily was wide awake he was also a director of efflapure yeh and lynsey davies knew somebody at efflapure and was thus able to bend somebodys arm to put the area contract roddys way he did his acid smile the old cromwellians eh and he liked young girls bliss nodded you knew all about that mrs box didnt leave a note and its always nice to know why they do these things isnt it the general feeling is that he only married her because well because she was famous and earning more than him but also because she still had the look of a teenager whod been given bad drugs and then beaten up yes by midmorning annie howe even had the names of four of boxs exgirlfriends all with bad memories and a fifth whod disappeared some time ago merrily poked mindlessly at the fire a deepembedded evil she looked up you think he killed you really think box killed one thing you learned at cromwell street frannie bliss said was how easy it could be and he knew lynsey and youre thinking about donna furlowe she nodded and wondered how much jenny box had known and what else jumbo humphries had been able to tell her the enormous holistic connections her mystical mind must have made as she waited for gareth box with the iron cross held high dont you sometimes feel frannie said when these horrible little coincidences occur that theres a wider plan and it isnt always constructed by somebody with our best interests at heart i dont get paid to feel that merrily said uncomfortably that night she prayed by the landing window overlooking the square she didnt see a woman out there with a white scarf over her head but she found she still had melanies angel and she slept with it under her pillow closing credits nobody who has studied the cromwell street case believes it was satisfactorily resolved or even in the end fully investigated there is a limit to police resources estimates of the number of west victims still undiscovered range from ten to more than forty all over britain there are relatives of missing women and girls who are unlikely ever to know whether their worst fears are justified the idea that the guilt extends beyond fred and rose is not new but is still rarely spoken of researching this book i was told more unpublished west stories than i could reasonably use the black dai story is true a thirtytwoyearold man was jailed for life on december the terry crick story is also true i owe particular thanks to wests official biographer geoffrey wansell who knows more about cromwell street than anyone should ever have to for information about the west case electricity

thanks also to gruff rhys of super furry animals for permission to quote lines from the excellent album rings around the world i leaned heavily on three books on the west case an evil love by geoffrey
