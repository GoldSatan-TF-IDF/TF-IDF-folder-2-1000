charles todd wings of fire the bodies were discovered by mrs trepol widow occupation housekeeper and cook to the deceased it was not a morning of swirling sea mists and gray drifting sheets of rain although afterward mrs trepol remembered it that way in fact the clouds had lifted in the night the sea was gleaming in patchy may sunlight down below the headland the house cast long shadows across the wet grass and an unseasonable warmth already touched the light breeze as she came out of the wood at the side of the big kitchen garden her eyes jealously studied the cabbages in their neat rows measuring them against the size of her own deciding that hers still had an edge weil of course they should shed always had the finest garden in the village and hadnt she proved it with ribbons won at every harvest festival the onions were tallersurely they hadnt been that high on saturday but anyone could grow onions her peas were already straggling up the sticks shed set beside them and growing peas was an art no sticks stood beside these sad little stalks shed be cooking hers before these saw their first blossoms old wilkins who had kept the halls gardens and stables since the lads had all gone off to the war knew more about horses than vegetables not that he didnt crow over his work your carrots look a mite small mrs trepol hed say hanging over the rock wall by her front walk compared to mine that is or them beans is spindly put em in late did ye nosy old fool her complacency restored she went up the three steps to the kitchen door and let herself in with her key as she always did not that this was her day to clean mondays normally were her day off but tomorrow she wanted to visit her sisternaomis husband had offered to take them both to market in the morningand miss livia never minded if occasionally she shifted her time the long stone passage was cool and quiet at the end of it she took off her coat hung it on the peg as she always did pulled her apron over her head then stepped into the heart of her domain and noticed at once that the breakfast dishes usually neatly stacked on the drain board hadnt been brought down she looked around the kitchen saw that it was much as shed left it on saturday evening not even a crumb marring her scrubbed floor saw too that no one had opened the curtains oh my dear she thought pityingly miss livia mustve had another bad night and shes still asleep going up to the back parlor she found that those curtains were also closed and for the first time she felt a tremor of alarm mr nicholas always opened them at first light to watch the sea hed said once that it made him feel alive to see the dawn come and touch the water miss livia must have had a terrible night then if hed missed the dawn on her account mrs trepol had never known that to happen in all the years shed worked in the house mr nicholas was always up at first light always she went out into the hall and looked up the curving stairs mr nicholas she called softly ive come is there anything i can do would you care for a cup of tea the silence around her echoed her words and she felt very uneasy now surely if he was sitting by miss livias bed hed have heard her and come out to speak to her unless something was wrong with him she hurried up the stairs and went down the passage to mr nicholas room tapping lightly on the panel no one answered after a moments uncertainty she turned the knob and opened the door the bed was made from the look of it it had not been slept in mr nicholas could always make it neatly but never as smoothly as she did this was her work saturdays work she went back down the passage and knocked lightly at miss livias door again there was no answer she opened it gently so as not to disturb miss livia or mr nicholas if hed fallen asleep in the chair by his sisters bed and peered around the edge that bed too was untouched the coverlet was as smooth as glass like mr nicholas and there was no one in the chairs suddenly very frightened she listened to the house around her surely if miss livia had been taken down to the doctors surgery in the night thered be a message left in the kitchen but this wasnt her day mr nicholas wouldnt have known she was coming in well then someone would have mentioned it at services on sunday morning eager to gossip going to the long study at the end of the gallery which mr nicholas and miss livia shared mrs trepol knocked and waited then reached for the knob as she had twice before and then fright turned suddenly to terror she quickly drew her hand back bringing it to her flat chest almost protectively her heart thudding uncomfortably beneath her fingertips she stood there for several seconds staring at the shut door her voice refusing to call mr nicholas name her hand refusing to reach again for the brass knob whatever was behind that door it was something she couldnt face not alone not with her heart hammering like it was going to jump out of her chest and run away she turned and fled down the stairs stumbling on the old worn treads nearly falling headfirst in her haste thinking only of the safety of the kitchen but not stopping there rushing down the passage on into the early sunlight and back the way shed come toward the village and dr hawkins only then did she remember her coat but nothing would have taken her back into that house shivering on the verge of tears driven by uncertainty she ran heavily and awkwardly through the gardens heedless of the cabbages and towards the copse of trees where the path to the village began what was left of the family gathered in the drawing room for a drink when everyone else had finally gone home but conversation was stilted uneasy as if they were strangers meeting for the first time and had yet to find common ground the truth was they felt like strangers in the circumstances unsettled uncomfortable isolated by their thoughts then stephen said abruptly why do you suppose they did it there was an odd silence no one thank god had asked that all the long day not through the services nor the burials nor the reception at the hall afterward where friends and villagers had mingled talking in subdued voices remembering olivia and nicholas recalling some small incident or ordinary encounter a conversationall safely in the past avoiding the how and why of death as if by tacit agreement avid curiosity dwelt in their eyes but they were sensitive to the delicacy of the situation suicides no one had spoken of the poems either susannah said quickly what business is it of ours theyre dead let that be the end of it good god nicholas and olivia were your brother and sister half brother and sister she retorted as if that might distance her from real pain all right then half brother and sister havent you even wondered about it dont you feel anything i feel grateful that they could be buried with mother in the family vault susannah answered thanks to the rectors kindness in the old days it wouldnt have been allowed you know that suicides werent buried in the churchyard much less in the crypt and wed have been ostracized along with them its still bad enough god knows london will be an ordeal facing all my friends knowing pitys behind their sympathy she stopped unwilling to lay her emotions out raw and painful for the others to paw over i dont want to talk about it what weve got to face now is whats to become of the house daniel said id always understood it was left to the survivors to sell he glanced around the room susannah rachel stephen himself he was susannahs husband but hed always been treated as one of the family that had been a source of great pride to him with feelings running so high over the troubles in ireland he might have been seen as less well acceptable socially without the trevelyan connection behind him not that the trevelyans were so high and mighty but they were old blood respected his eyes moved on cormac olivia and nicholasd left cormac out of their wills daniel had found himself wondering sometimes who cormacs irish mother had beenif it had made a difference cormac was a fitzhugh but not a trevelyan not rosamunds child nor wed to one of rosamunds children nor like rachel a cousin on the marlowe side rachel said yes thats what id been told unless they changed their minds at the end as theyd changed their minds about living she took a deep breath and refused to think about it and instead found herself listening again to the sounds of the house since shed walked through the door two days ago shed felt it swallowing her drawing the very breath from her body frightening her with a stillness that wasnt stillness stephen said moving his cane along the pattern of the persian carpets intertwined medallions well i for one know what i think we should do we should turn this place into a memorial a museum in livias memory susannah stared at him in surprise cormac said dont be ridiculous its the last thing shed have wanted olivia spent her entire life hiding from people do you think shed be pleased to have strangers wandering about in here now he moved gracefully around the room tall and oddly beautiful in a very masculine way it isnt up to you stephen retorted he tried not to watch he tried not to resent that grace and couldnt help it the war had left him with half a foot and this damned cane trenchfoot and gangrene for gods sake not honorable wounds no more long walks over the downs no more tennis no more dancing no more riding to hounds he could still bowl at cricket but awkwardly terrified hed lose his balance and fall flat on his face all the same cormacs right rachel said i cant imagine this place a museum livia would feel it was a betrayal think of the cost daniel added youd need money for upkeep repairs staff a trust of some sort olivia may have been famous but she wasnt that rich in her own right i mean we could afford it stephen persisted or perhaps the national trust would be interested not without a handsome endowment cormac replied stopping by the windows his back to them it would take more than three quarters of your inheritance what are you saying that we divide up the furniture the sideboard for me the piano for you and whos going to take the grandfathers clockthen sell the house and grounds pretend olivia and nicholas never existed that the familywhats left of itdoesnt care stephen was steadily losing his temper you want a museum to your own memory not hers susannah said suddenly its your immortality youre thinking about dont pretend it isnt mine yes yours the wars changed you stephenand not for the better oh ive heard you at dinners since she was found out simpering when someone asks who the love poems were written about you think its you her darling her favorite there was heavy sarcasm in her quiet voice hed been mothers favorite too he was susannahs twinand always so much more than her equal well what if they were written about me ive as much right as any of you to think what i please youre greedy thats what it is wanting the money wanting every penny you can squeeze and thats why she left her literary estate to me a pity she didnt include the house as well who died last rachel put in diffidently not sure she wanted to know if it was nicholas then its his will were haggling over not hers they were the same everything to each other and if that failed the poems to stephen and the house to the four survivors jointly cormac told her over his shoulder there was no resentment in the level voice that he hadnt been included id hate to see daytrippers wandering through here susannah said staring like spectators at a hanging then eating their pasties and cider out on the lawns overlooking the sea she shuddered its horrid more horrid if this place is lost stephen declared shes a major english poet for gods sake when was the last time you were in stratford or wordworths home in grasmere rachel asked empty musty travesties of houses like mummified bodies on view because of vulgar curiosity i dont want to see this place kept like a waxwork long beyond its usefulness genteelly crumbling at the edges i wantto be finished with it or is it yourself youre thinking about stephen demanded is it your own secrets they might find browsing around in here rachel looked at him coldly whats that supposed to mean that all of us have private lives and one day biographers will be delving into them laying them bare in the name of scholarship to learn more about olivia how she lived who her family wasthats the lot of ushow she came to be a poet in the first place thats a dreadful thought daniel exclaimed there were skeletons in his family closet that he wouldnt care to see rattled name him an irishman who didnt have them the price of fame susannah said sourly her fair pretty face twisting into a grimace and an even more cogent reason for stopping them in their tracks by selling the house none of us ever expected to live here anyway olivia knew that she could have arranged for her own museum if that was what she truly wanted she didnt there was another silence then cormac used to board meetings and finding consensus used to making choices said right i take it youre three to one for the sale of this property stephen can do as he pleases with olivias personal papersmanuscripts letters contracts and so on that ought to satisfy inquisitive scholars sad to say i doubt theres much of a literary estate she was young and poets arent prolific no rachel thought watching him youve already gone through her papers havent you you were here first did you take any of them i wonder were you afraid for your reputation in the city or were you merely curious about your stepsisters secrets livia seldom wrote to any of us she said aloud or to anyone else as far as i know perhaps stephen might want whatever letters weve kept of hers for the collection but not nicholas letters not those did she keep a diary daniel asked and as every face swiveled to stare at him he added well surprising numbers of people do lonely people especially invalids he stopped no stephen said shortly im sure she didnt you didnt know her any better than the rest of us did susannah retorted not after you were grown she could have kept twelve diaries and who would have guessed i came home more often than the rest of you put together what four times a year at most five it was uncomfortable here you know that she didnt want us to come shed made herself a recluse yes and nicholas too he was as set in his way as she was and they were only in their middle thirtiesits unnatural i remember the last time i was here daniel said you could tell she couldnt wait until we were gone we brought in the real world susannah agreed life she lived in that strange halfworld of hers i never understood why she wrote such bleak poetry well not counting wings of fire of course scent of violets and lucifer gave me the creeps i can tell you but then she was a cripple theyre often dreary people anyway suffering and wretched i suppose her mind dwelt on such things she wasnt dreary rachel said suddenly and she wasnt truly crippled i think we bored her dont be silly daniel said thats ridiculous her family its true for the past six or seven years ive had the feeling she didnt need us that her life was full that she had all she wanted right here i dont know how nicholas put up with it all these years susannah said glaring at rachel id have gone mad livia told me once that he was paying a debt stephen remembered out of nowhere odd thing to say wasnt it i asked what sort of debt and she said a debt of blood he got up and limped over to the drinks table and poured himself another whiskey cormac said oh for gods sake and sat down again impatient with the lot of them i dont want to stay the night here susannah said looking up at her husband as she changed the subject well find rooms at the three bells dont be morbid daniel told her mrs trepol has already made up our rooms here im not morbid this place is morbid its like a hothouse where something unhealthy thrived and it was never that way while mother was alive she glanced up at the elegantly framed portrait over the hearth rosamund beatrice trevelyan whod had three husbands and children by each of them loving them all with equal devotion stared back at her with a half smile that captured both serenity and passion the artist had found more than just beauty in the face hed painted mother had such life such warmth there was always laughter brightness here and thats all disappeared itit drained away without our knowing it after she died ive come to hate the hall i never actually realized that until now and after dinner were leaving ill go with you if you dont mind idrather not stay either rachel said but for reasons of her own there were ghosts here she knew it now she whod never believed in ghosts in her life believed in them here not things in sheets that moaned and rattled chains those she could handle these were different you havent decided cormac began sell susannah said and daniel nodded after a moment rachel sighed and with a single movement of her head acknowledged her agreement over my dead body stephen promised in the courts if need be but ill fight you this house ought to be preserved selling is the soundest move you could make cormac said put it off and youll find yourselves taking a loss thats a majority then when the wills are read tomorrow you should instruct chambers accordingly as to the furniture you might draw up lists of what you each want and if there should be any conflict were not touching a stick of furniture until this has been settled stephen said stubbornly his jaw tight and his face flushed let chambers work out a compromise agreed what you dont want personally you should put up for sale with the house i think itll bring far more that way people with money enough to buy country houses these days dont have the proper furnishings to put in them he looked around thoughtfully ive been considering a place in the country myself i wonder with a shrug he let the thought die then said i suppose its nostalgia i spent a good part of my own life here too i want mothers portrait susannah said immediately and theres the wedgwood coffee service id like to have that as well it was grandmother fitzhughs her husband added id like to have the trophies for the horse races rosamunds stables won those ought to stay in the family anyway cormac said i havent any right to ask but id like the guns the ones that came from ireland with my father and his collection of walking sticks they belonged to him before he married rosamund so in a sense i have some small claim on them susannah turned to rachel is there anything you particularly fancy rosamund had loved rachel like one of her own they all had nicholas had been deeply fond of her you could tell that and they always said richardsusannah shivered and refused to think of richard rachel looked down at her hands and the glass of sherry they were holding i dont know yes i do she lifted her eyes and regarded all of them i dont have any claim on the cheney side of the family but id like nicholas collection of ships the ones he carved if no one else wishes for them her glance reached stephens furious face and then she realized how callous it must sound to him four people coolly coming to terms over the household goods of the newly dead her face flushed they havent been decently buried for more than three hours stephen said youre ghouls its revolting practical thats all daniel answered just as well to have it all straight in our minds what about you nothing of mine is leaving here he gripped his glass tightly and nothing of olivias is to be touched do you hear me nothing then thats settled susannah said with satisfaction and very amicably she smiled up at rosamunds image again mother would be proud of us not quarreling whos left to quarrel rachel said pensively except for you and stephen she added to herself the youngest the fitzhughs i barely remember anneonly that she and olivia were so much alike that the adults couldnt tell them apart and i could now olivia is dead as well the end of the marlowes and both of the cheneys are gone too richard and nicholas rachel threw off her deepening depression and pulled herself back to what stephen was saying not yet it isnt settled stephen fumed if chambers wont stop you ill find my own lawyers bennet will act for me dont be an ass stephen cormac said without rancor youll still lose and more to the point so will the family the courts will agree with the majorityonce the familys dirty wash has been thoroughly aired in all the newspapers do any of us want that mrs trepol came to the door to say that dinner was waiting she looked tired and sad stephen put down his drink and made to follow her will they agree with you he asked over his shoulder shes o a manning remember thats bound to count for something and the fact that none of us is going hungry you dont destroy a national heritage as easily as you might a mere family estate putting down her glass on the small walnut table beside her chair rachel watched them walk out the door of the drawing room and across the hall to the dining room shed never seen stephen so angry or so determined she had a very uneasy feeling that it just might come down to a court matter and in the end hed win stephen somehow stephen always seemed to win even as a child hed been the luckiest of them all cornish luck rosamund called it hed survived four years of bloody war with half a dozen medals for bravery and a reputation for wildly daring heroics devil fitzhugh theyd called him at the front lucky fey the old woman in the woods would have said ian rutledge returning to london in late june found a mixed welcome at scotland yard warwickshire had not been a complete triumphthere were those who believed the outcome was more politically sound than judicially defensible and others saw in his success a taste for notoriety chief superintendent bowles himself had set that rumor flying not a welldefined closure would you say field day for the press of course name in all the papers id not care for that sort of thing myself but some do rutledge himself still mentally and physically drained by events in upper streetham was glad enough to be relegated once more to the mundane while he tried to heal it didnt last as long as hed anticipated there had been a series of brutal knifings in the city and the newspapers were attempting to resurrect the old ripper killings making farfetched comparisions in order to expand circulation people had tired of the peace which had brought more misery to the country than any sense of enormous victory they were tired of grimness and stoicism of poor food no jobs strikes and unrest and there was even a boredom with the struggle to revive the england they remembered before the kaiser played for power in europe any news that didnt have to do with the strife of ordinary life that could be parlayed into sensationalism was followed with the frisson of fear that comes from knowing that youre safe even while the tigers noisily devour your neighbor superintendent bowles on whose turf the knifings began was already scenting a powerful public upsurge in attention and never one to shirk the glow of reflected glory he took over the cases himself and that soon meant allowing rutledge into the investigation as well because of the need for manpower it was not something bowles relished and he put off any briefings for three whole days then fate stepped inhe had extraordinary good fortune he told himself it was a sign of his righteous natureand offered a partial solution he grabbed it with both fists and had soon twisted it around to his own satisfaction then with energy and a sense of mission he went to find inspector rutledge it was a warm day in early july the sun flooding the dusty windows and collecting in pools on the dusty floor of the small office rutledge had been allotted beautiful day damned shame to be shut up inside and im off to the city and conferences for the rest of the afternoon rutledge looking up from his paperwork said the ripper hed been expecting bowles to send for him yes theyve all but called him that havent they certainly drawn every parallel they can think of although this fellow doesnt gut his victims just all but flays them theres so many cuts on the body still its bloody enough to make the innuendos successful but thats not what i wanted to talk to you about its this he tossed a heavy sheet of paper on rutledges desk and it settled upside down on the dark green blotter rutledge turned it over and saw the crest at the top home office yes well thats where it came from but if you want my own interpretation it originated in the war office or the foreign ministry read it rutledge scanned the typed lines it said in the flowery phrases of a man asking a favor he didnt care to ask that scotland yard was kindly requested to look into a trio of deaths in cornwall that had been ruled a double suicide and an accidental death the local people had not seen fit to pursue the cases further but now information had come to hand that these were possibly not in fact what they appeared if an officer could be spared from the yard to travel to cornwall and quietly go over the evidence to be sure that ail was as it should be the undersigned would be very grateful rutledge considered the letter again then regarded bowles what cases and what new information it seems bowles said availing himself of a chair that a certain lady ashford who is somehow related to all three deceased parties felt that there had been a hasty judgment and insufficient consideration had been given to the likelihood of murder sounds like the old bitch got left out of the wills and is now raising holy hell with some lord or other of her acquaintance and hes palmed her off on another lord in the home office whos now palming her off on us worse luck suddenly realizing what hed just been saying bowles amber goats eyes flickered in his irritation hed lost sight of his goal rapidly mending fences he added it means of course that whoever we send out has got to mind his manners with the local people and still satisfy this lady ashford that her fears are groundless or if they aren t reopen the cases as soon as possible and deal with them before we all get a black name for sheer incompetence he gestured to the letter hes important this secretary if we dont please him well never hear the end of it from upstairs rutledge read the letter again theres a henry ashford in the foreign office he said thoughtfully very highly placed he had gone to school with ashfords brother trust rutledge to know bowles scowled yes well thats as may be and you want me to go to cornwall its the kind of thing you can handle bennett now hes available but hes as clumsy as hell when it comes to soothing ruffled feathers in little old ladies however good he is in whitechapel and theres harrison i could spare him but hes not got the patience to pussyfoot around anyone elses investigation hell go in with the notion theyre in the wrong and before you know it the chief constable will be demanding his recall and the home office will be wanting to know what we thought we were about choosing the likes of him he sighed youre the best ive got simple as that and what about those murders in the city rutledge asked he was beginning to know his man bowles wanted rutledge out of the way well i dont think well solve them overnight and if you dont stay beyond a week then ill have you to fall back on when i need you a week you didnt spend a week exploring the closed cases of the county constabularies did that mean that bowles felt there would be a reopening of the investigation something to keep rutledge out of londonmore to the point out of the cityuntil bowles had caught his own man suddenly rutledge realized that he didnt care either way going to cornwall would be better than being cooped up at the yard with time on his hands and hamish growling from boredom at the back of his mind he turned and looked out at the sunshine the report you asked me to do is finished i can leave this afternoon if it suits you bowles stared at the other man was he too willing was he intending to be down in cornwall and finished with this matter before the weekend or did rutledge know something that he didnt about the london killings and was all too pleased to be excluded from them that would be a fine kettle of fish sending rutledge out of harms way just as the roof started to fall in here suspicious he said well id not rush the investigation if i were you itll all be to do over again if we dont satisfy this sod in the home office i wont rush it rutledge was still looking out the window his mind already on the road west stirring to life hamish a voice from the past said its a bonny day im not the man for four walls and a door which made them seem to shrink in upon him shivering rutledge turned back to bowles what do you have on these cases precious little his lordship didnt deign to send us more than this he passed over several sheets copies of death certificates for olivia alison marlowe spinster nicholas michael cheney bachelor both dead by their own hands the dates were the same this spring and for stephen russell fitzhugh bachelor death by misadventure a fall three weeks ago while he rutledge was still in warwickshire seems ordinary enough in both cases it is but as far as were concerned the home office like god is never wrong it was four oclock in the afternoon before rutledge was ready to leave for cornwall but the days are still long in july and the warmth of the sun was soothing in the trenches during the great war hed hated the hot days of summer when the smells of urine and corpses and unwashed bodies overwhelmed the senses and sickened the mind you cursed the germans for making you stand in your own stink never mind that they were standing in the lines smelling their own one sergeant who swore hed never bathed at home in wales laughed at the raw replacements who gagged and puked calling them sodding poufs for their sensitive noses blankets coats shirts trousers socks they all were unspeakable in summer and worse in winter when the wool never dried hamish chuckled missing it are ye no rutledge said tiredly unable to forget aye hamish answered with relish from the dark corners of his mind thats the game man you cant run from it the doctors at the clinic had told him that it was natural for him to hear the voice of corporal macleod shot by a firing squad just before the shelling that buried the salient smothering men and mud and corpses alike with such force that that it had taken hours to dig out the barely living rutledge among them hed suffered several wounds shellshock and severe claustrophobia but the doctors at the aid station had pronounced it fatigue given him twentyfour hours to sleep it off patched him up and sent him back to the lines experienced officers were in short supply he couldnt remember much about the year after that only hamishs voice keeping him at his postharrying tormenting haunting him until he was sure that others must have heard it too hed lived in agony at the thought of seeing the owner of that voice in the dark of the night or a star shell burst or among the rotting corpses that sometimes twitched from the maggots inside them somehow he must have carried out his duties well enoughno one reported him and his men left him alone too exhausted and worried and frightened themselves to care about anything except survival and the dreaded next offensive a long war the road to salisbury was not busy and in the air flowing through the motorcar sweet scents of wildflowers and ripening corn and the early haying followed him through the countryside it would have been faster by train but he hated the small compartments crammed cheek by jowl with other people while his heart pounded with fear and the palms of his hands were damp with the sweat of being hemmed in and unable to fight his way out finding an inn twenty miles beyond salisbury he stopped for the night ate a dinner of baked mutton and potatoes with green beans on the side and slept ill in the small airless lowceilinged room hed been given the next day he picked up a line of squalls along the devon border riding the winds over the coast and disputing with the sunshine for dominance twice he nearly missed his turning as the rains poured down and half an hour later the roadsides steamed as the sun broke through again hamish kept up a running commentary as they drove through villages that brimmed with life waysides still thick with late wildflowers and tiny isolated cottages with thatched roofs or rampantly blooming gardens so different so different from the devastation in france sometimes small herds of dairy cows being driven down the road from one field to another blocked his path or fat gray geese waddling between rain puddles and village ponds or carts pulled by patient horses in no hurry to be anywhere the drivers turning to stare with intent interest at his motorcar between the deep hedgerows he was often the only human being in sight although birds darted in and out and butterflies danced across the bonnet the peace spread through him soothing it was late in the evening when he reached borcombe tucked into a deep valley that ran down to the sea below a long headland the rain had stopped but heavy clouds still obscured the sky and lights from houses and a busy pub already glistened across the wet pavements though the time was only a little after nine it was a smallish village and he quickly found the house he was looking for on the corner of butchers lane home of constable dawlish pulling up before the white picket gate he opened the door and got out stiffly taking a moment to stretch his tired legs and massage aching shoulders then the door was opening at the top of the stone steps and a man in shirtsleeves was staring out inspector rutledge yes he opened the gate and went up the short flagstone walk constable dawlish they shook hands on the threshold and dawlish ushered him into a small warm room off the entry hall let me take your coat sir a bit cool for july isnt it its the rain i expect have you had any dinner yes thank you but i could do with some tea kettles on the boil now sir dawlish gestured to the dark red horsehair sofa youll be comfortable over there and ive got all the papers about the case in the folder on the table beside you inspector harvey is sorry he cant be here but he had to go along to plymouth theres a man there fits the description of one weve been looking for talked three widows out of their savings well manage well enough without harvey at this stage rutledge replied taking dawlishs measure he was tall and thin a young man with old eyes on the somme were you he asked hazarding a guess part of the time i was over there three years felt like thirty yes it did mrs dawlish small and plump came in with a tray of tea thick sandwiches and dainty cakes she smiled shyly at rutledge as she set the tray on a second table by the hearth but well within reach of the sofa and said help yourself inspector theres plenty more in the kitchen and then she whisked herself out of the room the perfect policemans wife ill read these reports tonight rutledge said as he took the cup dawlish poured first id rather hear your own point of view dawlish sat down and frowned earnestly at the cup in his hands well to tell the truth i dont see murder anywhere in this affair two suicides and an accident thats how it seemed to me and to inspector harvey as well there was no note with the suicides but i was there i saw the bodies and youd have a hard time inspector setting up a murder to appear a suicide so fine as that the bodies the room their faces we dont know why they decided to kill themselves thats right enough but miss olivia marlowe shed been a cripple and must have suffered something fierce from it the housekeeper said she had many a bad night and mr nicholas cheney hed done naught else but care for her all his life except for the war of coursehe was gassed at ypres and sent home i suppose he felt there was nothing left to him if she went first too late to his way of thinking to start again with his damaged lungs or maybe he wouldnt have wanted to some people are like that theyre content with what they know however bad it is and fear what they dont know however good it might turn out he was young younger than she was by four years he could have married had a family of his own but im wandering from the facts rutledge shook his head no no i want to hear you knew these people after all and you saw the bodies relieved that the gaunt man from london wasnt pushing to have his own way willynilly dawlish nodded well then i accepted what i saw for what it seemed there was no reason to do otherwise and you cant make up a case for murder when theres no cause no evidence to base it on so the family was notified they came and buried their brother and sister it was as simple as that but then they were clearing out the house to ready it for the marketand its a handsome house theyll sell it easy even out here in the middle of nowhere there was money made on the war and a lot of it wants to be respectable money now there was no bitterness in the quiet voice and only a hint of irony that those who had done the fighting werent the ones who had made their fortunes from it the house might bring in enough to kill for possibly though itll require a good deal of work to bring it up to being a showplace again theyll have to consider that in setting the price and whatever they do get it has to be split among the surviving family it took more than a fortnight to clear out the housejust of personal belongings and the like theyd all stayed to do that except mr cormac whod had to return to the city part of the time but was back that last weekend at any rate that last day when they were leaving mr stephen the youngest went head over heels down the stairs and broke his neck but there was no one who could have been responsible for that as far as we can tell they were all outside at the time he called out the window and said he was on his way down and the next thing you knew hed fallen mr cormac went in to see what was keeping him and set up a shout at once no time to push him no time to do more than find him from what the others said its a long sweep of stairs the treads worn and he went down with enough force to bruise the body so he wasnt dead to begin with and then just tossed over a banister besides hed called down every one of them heard him he finished his first sandwich and reached for another dr hawkins said he may have been hurrying and with his bad footfrom the warjust missed his step the others were that upset theyd been so impatient with him and they are these others its a complicated family sir theres cormac fitzhugh now hes very well thought of in the city he was there hes mr brian fitzhughs son born in ireland before mr brian married miss rosamund miss susannah was there shes twin sister to the man who fell miss susannah and mr stephen were mr brians children by miss rosamund you see and miss susannahs husband daniel hargrove was there and of course miss rachel shes a cousin on the marlowe side of the family miss olivias cousin to be exact miss olivias father was a marlowe miss rosamund miss olivias mother was married three times and had two children by each of her husbands but theyre all gone now except for miss susannah shes the last of the lot marlowe cheney or fitzhugh this rosamund the motherand stepmotherof all these children rosamund trevelyan sir whose family has owned the hall since time out of mind her fathers only child a lovely lady sir quite a beauty in her day theres a fine portrait of her up at the house if they havent taken it away yet if ever a woman deserved to be happy it was that one but sorrow seemed to be her lot still to her dying day nobody ever heard a harsh word from her at her services the rector spoke of the light within and she had that he smiled wistfully so few people do shesin one way or anotherthe key to this family then and to the house aye thats true enough miss rachel now she was miss rosamunds first husbands mece captain marlowe that was olivias father miss rachel has been in and out of the house all her life mr hargrove miss susannahs husband first came here when he was going on twelve id say miss rosamund had a string of race horses most of them irish bred and more than a few bought from the hargrove stables fine animals they were won dozens of prizes as a lad i won more than a bob or two betting on them myself who inherited the house when rosamund died the house belonged to old adrian trevelyan like i said miss olivias grandfather he left it to her not her mother no reflection on miss rosamund you understand but he wasnt best pleased with her choice of third husband and therere some who say he left the house to miss olivia to keep it out of fitzhugh hands not to speak of the fact that miss olivia was a cripple and it was more likely that shed have need of a home unmarried and not apt to be i doubt anyone in the familyand certainly no one in the village knew she was to become a famous poet poet olivia marlowe aye o a manning she was known as ive never read any of her poems well not much in my line poetry but the wife has and she tells me it was very pretty pretty thought rutledge was an understatement for o a mannings work haunting lyrical with undercurrents of dark humor at times and subtle contrasts that caught people and emotions with such precision that lines stayed with you long afterward like personal memories shed written about the war too and hed read some of those poems in the trenches marveling that anyone could have captured so clearly what men felt out there in the bloody shambles of france could have found the courage to put it into words he hadnt known then that o a manning was a woman but of course the wings of fire poems were different and perhaps it was those that dawlishs wife knew love poems and unlike the poems shakespeare had written to his dark lady these were light and warmth and beauty intermingled with such passion that they sang in the heart as you read them wings of fire had touched him in a way that few things had hamish growled his voice a low rumble in the back of rutledges mind thought of your jean did you as you read those lines shes no worthy of that kind of love my fiona was she gave me the book before i took the troop train to london they found it in my pocket wet with my blood when they dug out my corpse nearly choking on his tea rutledge coughed and said leaving the suicides for the moment none of the four at the house that last day had anything to gain from killing stephen fitzhugh as to mr cormac fitzhugh nothing he has no rights in the house miss rachel and mr and mrs hargrove will receive a larger share of the sale now but we looked into that their finances are in order and theres no reason to think they needed the extra money where moneys concerned people will do strange things all right i think youve told me all i need to hear for the moment where am i staying ive put you at the three bells sir not far from the church you cant miss it thank mrs dawlish for the tea rutledge collected the papers on the table and added a good night it was raining again and he dashed to his car reaching it and climbing inside just as a winddriven downpour swept over the headland and rattled against the picket fence like distant machine gun fire do ye think it was witchcraft that made yon woman write as she did hamish asked still intrigued with olivia marlowe she knew the war too well man its unnatural it wasnt witchcraft it was genius he answered before he could stop himself it was a habit too hard to break responding to hamish rutledge got out as the squall passed started the engine and drove too fast though the slanting rain the inn came up before he expected it and he nearly skidded as he came to a splashing stop in front of it beyond it he could see the spire of the church rising like a spear against the backdrop of storm clouds and windtossed trees with your luck youd survive the car crash and live in a chair for the rest of your days with no one but me for company hamish pointed out and rutledge swore the inn was small swaybacked gray stone under a dark slate roof that seemed to be slowly pushing the whole building deeper into the earth from sheer weight he was expected and the landlord gave him a room overlooking a small cultivated enclosure in the back more a tangle of overgrown roses and rhododendron than anything that could be dignified by the name of garden he unpacked with swift efficiency and in ten minutes was abed and asleep he was never afraid to sleep hamish couldnt follow him there but jean could in the darkness hours later the wind shifted and the seas breath drifted in the halfopen window bringing with it the softness of summer rutledge stirred turned over and began to dream of the woman hed lovedand whod wanted no part of the shattered remnants of the man shed promised to marry jean who in her own way haunted him too she touched his arm and led him down a path he remembered and for a time he thought it was real that she was there beside him her hand warm in his her laughter silvery in the stillness her skirts brushing lightly against him and nothing had changed breakfast was hearty the next morning the innkeeper inquisitive rutledge parried his questions and left after his second cup of coffee out on the street he turned and looked at the sky a habit drilled into him by war when the direction of the wind could mean the difference between a gas attack and none he thought it was going to be a fair warmish day in spite of the mists that twisted like wraiths around chimney tops and trees and he decided to walk there had been a set of keys in the folder constable dawlish had given him and a sketchy map it gave no indication of distances a countrymans map it was very early and although a few people were already in their gardens getting a jump on the day the streets were still quiet a smallish village with only one main road coming in passing the church and running downhill between the shops to catch up again with the tiny river bor close to where it met the sea houses jostled each other as they spilled down the valley sometimes roof to porch or separated by lanes and rock gardens a glimmer of water at the bottom of the road marked the sea he thought though it was just as likely to be the little river the ironmonger was busy setting out barrels and a plow or two the sounds of childrens laughter floated from somewhere and there was an elderly woman limping down the other side of the street he crossed over and stopped her closer to she was truly a crone bent with age gray hair bundled into an untidy bun at the back of her neck a black shawl that was so old it was nearly gray over her shoulders and a gnarled cane that seemed to be no more than an extention of the gnarled hand that held it please he began not wanting to startle her but she looked at him with sharp watery eyes that seemed to see himand through him stranger in borcombe are ye she demanded looking him up and down if youre wanting the constable hell not be about for another twenty minutes at best startled rutledge said actually you want directions then to the trevelyan house can you tell me how to find it are ye a walker lad it had been years since anyone had called him lad yes yell need to be follow this road for a mile more or less yell soon come to a parting of the way and yell take the right fork follow that as far as it goes and yell see a pair of gates and a drive leading uphill when you come to the top yell have the way fine from there as directions wentif they were correctthey were as clear as any hed ever been given the crone chuckled hoarsely ive lived here eighty year and more it was as if shed read his mind hamish stirred uneasily and the womans glance seemed to sharpen but she said nothing limping on her way as if the conversation had come to a satisfactory conclusion he watched her and she seemed to know it old as she was he thought a woman feels a mans eyes hamish laughed youve no spent any time in the highlands man was all he said to that rutledge set out following the womans directions along the narrow hilly road hed traveled the night before finding the fork between curving fields of late hay he walked on past a cottage or two and small patches of farmed land and beside a long sweep of rough pasture within half an hour he had reached the gates dark with age and damp leading through tall wet stands of rhododendron backed by taller trees into what seemed to be a sea of mist but as he followed the rutted drive curling uphill he came out into sunlight and brightness and there at the end of a graceful sweep of lawn stood a house set in formal gardens protected by the slope of the headland beyond it was an old house the architectural history of four centuries locked in its embrace rutledge could trace a tudor core with restoration georgian and victorian additions but there was also an older battlemented gateway near the stables that came from a dimmer past the great palaces of the english nobility blenheim and hatfield longleat and chatsworth spoke of power and money this house whispered of longevity and old bloodlines of timelessness and pride and peace he stood there looking across at it imagining its past and searching for a key to its owners what he felt was sadness no that wasnt it it was a stronger emotion something about the place that tugged at him hamish on the other hand didnt find it to his liking theres too many dead here he said uneasily and they dont lie quietly in their graves rutledge chuckled id haunt the estate too if itd been mine i wouldnt go peacefully to the churchyard in the town not with that view for beyond the headland he could see the sea already in the clear and gleaming in the morning light whitecaps dancing in the sun there seemed to be a small strand where the land ran down to the sea then turning to his right he could see the distant roofs of borcombe damned if the old crone hadnt sent him the longest way around you could walk from the last house he could see in the village into a copse of trees and out of them into trevelyan land in what ten minutes say fifteen all the way to the house he unlocked the door with the key that dawlish had given him and stepped into the wide front hall where the curving staircase swept down from a gallery above the hall itself was old with a massive stone hearth at one side and great oak beams that were black with age and smoke encompassing the hall and the long gallery that ran at the top of the stairs it was here then that stephen fitzhugh must have fallen to his death rutledge walked to the stairs and began to examine them carefully the uneven treads the dark oak of the banisters the ornately carved balustrade if you fell to the left from the top he thought considering the possibilities youd come straight down avoiding the curve if you slipped on the right youd glance off the curve slowing your momentum certainly but with force enough to do damage anyway but no one had said in the inquest which direction stephen had been coming from his left or his right along the gallery the report rutledge had read over breakfast indicated that stephen fitzhugh hit the balustrade somewhere at the curve broke his neck and rolled the rest of the way to the hall either dead already or nearly so the doctor had noted the imprint of the carving on the back of stephen fitzhughs neck just below the cracked vertebrae that had killed him hawkins had also included a description of the amputation of the foot that had made the dead mans balance uncertain at best and possibly in this situation prevented him from recovering it quickly enough to save himself from a nasty fall the mans cane had been found at the curve jammed into the balustrade on the opposite side of the stairs an accident it would be hard to quarrel with the inquests results the house was cold no fires lit with no one living here and he kept his coat on as he walked through it slowly carefully a handsome home not a baronial palace the formal roomsdining room drawing room a large librarywere well furnished with heirlooms but looked as if they had not seen company for some time everything stood in its proper place no magazines strewn about no flowers in their tall vases no sunlight pouring through open drapes no dogs lolled on the hearth rugs he remembered as a child being taken to a stately home and a womans shrill echoing voice declaiming here the family entertained three prime ministers six members of the royal family and the queen who was particularly fond of that blue silk chair and he had twisted about seaching in vain for them until his father had told him to stand still and pay attention a back parlor overlooking the gardens and the sea and the kitchen quarters below were more ordinary as if people actually lived there mussing up the carpet with their shoes wearing out the upholstery with their bodies reading the books on the low shelves or cooking at the big stove washing up at the stone sink sitting down to peel potatoes in one of the old brown wooden chairs he returned to the staircase generations had come down them gone up them and no one had worried about them until now hamish stirring restlessly in the back of his mind whispered i didna like this business leave the dead in their graves man upstairs were the bedrooms they were beautifully proportioned with tall windows and handsome fireplaces but oldfashioned now as if no one had worried about the faded hangings and the worn carpets preferring the familiar to the new he found the upstairs study where the suicides had occurred thanks to the floor plan that dawlish had sketched for him it was a long room windows looking out over the sea and over the gardens a room of light and the warmth of the sun neither a mans nor a womans but used comfortable ordinary nothing here to tell anyone where a famous poet worked except perhaps for the typewriter sitting covered on a table by the seaward window a guide would have to make do with the collection of books on either side of the table set neatly on their shelves here the poet found her inspiration among the works of but did she who could know nearby was another table where someone had been carving the hull of a great ship lay white and unfinished among the scraps and curls of wood it was a scale model of an ocean liner rutledge thought looking at it and there were others in a long case beneath the garden windows intricately fashioned miniatures he recognized several of themthe olympia the sirius the lusitania whose work were these nicholas cheneys had they been a hobby for its own sake or did they represent a love of the sea that had been repressed to this room he crossed the room to the couch against the wall where the bodies of brother and sister had lain side by side in death their hands touching as if for comfort as the darkness closed in why had they died i dont like it here man hamish said if youre going to investigate a murder get about it murder sometimes has its roots in other places than the few feet of space where it happened still why here why on that night hello a voice calling from the hall below startled him badly he walked out to the gallery at the top of the stairs and looked down there was a woman at the foot of the stairs the front door open behind her and she was looking up anxiously as if almost afraid of what might walk out of one of the rooms there to confront her inspector rutledge he said moving towards the steps i arrived last night and came to have a look around constable dawlish provided me with keys oh she said smiling up at him with relief on her face i thought i heard voices when i walked in i didnt know who might have found their way in the press has been very troublesome she was slim perhaps in her thirtiesit was hard to tell her oval face pink from walking her light brown hair curling ridiculously around it escaping from the knot at the back of her neck not pretty yet very attractive she waited until he had reached the hall and said im so glad theyve finally sent someone from scotland yard im rachel ashford the one whos been fighting to get these deaths reopened lady ashford her smile changed my husband is dead his brother has the title now sir henry did he tell you that lady ashford wanted to reopen the investigation how very like him youre peter ashfords widow rutledge asked surprised i was in school with him peter died in the war trying to take mount kilimanjaro out in kenya im sorry i hadnt heard so much for bowles titled old bitch but it was a shock peters death another name added to the long list of friends gone more than once hed felt the guilt of surviving as if it was somehow obscenely selfish when so many had died after a moment he made himself go on and you believe the investigations done by inspector harvey and constable dawlish were mishandled yes why becauseoh because of intuition i suppose she made a wry face at him and i cant help but feel that coincidence can only be stretched so far three deaths in the same family in little more than a month ii knew livia and nicholas they werent at all what the papers say an invalid and her devoted keeper its wrong the notion that they could have killed themselves because of ill health i understood that olivia manmarlowewas crippled and that nicholas cheney had been gassed in the war well yes she said defensively certainly thats true since you put it so baldly olivia lost the strength of one leg in childhood from the crippling disease she used a chair for a long time then nicholas carved a brace for her and after that she could move about as she pleased it was wonderful i can still hear her laughter when she first tried itwe were all outside her bedroom door while nanny put it onand she began to laugh and nicholas was jumping up and down beside me shouting encouragement and rosamund was crying and richard was pounding on the door he was so beside himself with excitement her voice faded and she looked up the stairs defensively as if afraid shed hear the childrens voices again if she killed herself rachel continued after a moment it wasnt because of her leg she accepted it she lived with it shed come to terms with the painit wasnt something that drove her to despair and suicide the sunlight pouring through the open door failed to reach them or warm the vastness of the hall but he could hear birds somewhere singing if she had wanted to kill herselffor whatever reason rutledge said why would she allow nicholas to join her in death why not see that he survived and got on with life however hard it might seem to be at first why not kill herself in her bedroom with no one to see she pressed her fingers to her eyes as if they still hurt from crying or to hide them from him ive asked myself that a hundreda thousandtimes since then they were very close olivia and nicholas id have said if anyone had ever thought to ask me that she would have jumped into the sea in the night rather that let him die with her it doesnt mean that perhaps in the first shock he might not have wished to follow but nicholas had a cool head a clear mind he wasnt the dramatic overly emotional sort of man who could leap into the sea himself the next morning when she was already dead dropping her hands she said painfully if you understand what im saying he did though hamish was grumbling that it made no sense yet they died together yes and thats what put me off in the very beginning i didnt say much to the others they wouldnt have wanted to hear me worrying over what couldnt be changed or making it worse by starting a fuss over it but the more i thought about the circumstances the more i was convinced that something was very wrong veryunusual do you think one of your cousinsincluding stephen could be capable of murdering olivia and nicholas for whatever reasons she stared at him stunned oh god no susannah and stephen couldnt have killed either of them and daniel what on earth for rutledge smiled where theres murder theres usually a murderer but not one of us she cried alarmed how often had he heard the same cry when hed begun an investigation into suspicious death murder possibly but not one of us a stranger a madman an envious neighbor or colleague the woman down the road but not one of us then the fingerpointing began as suspicion and fear and uncertainty and old memories came to the surface who then he asked gently thats why i called henry and begged him to ask the yard to come down here and look into the deaths someone who could be objective someone with the experience to judge what had really happened not a village policeman who preferred the safest answer to embarrassing the family any more than it already was i mean suicide is unacceptable enough murder would be well a family calamity she looked at him seeing him for the first time the thin face the haunted eyes intelligence too but something more she couldnt quite put her finger on it there were no photographs upstairs do you have any of the family that i could borrow for a time he was mainly interested in olivia marlowe the woman behind the poems but it helped often to see the faces of the dead if you were late at the murder scene wed taken them all the house will be put up for sale soon and we didnt want to leaveive just come to fetch the ships she said flustered ii havent had the courage yet to go in there where theywhere it happened there are photographs in my things ill find them where are you staying the three bells he said curious about her reaction what can you tell me about stephen fitzhughs death she shivered not looking over his shoulder at the stairs though her head had turned that way it was awful he was lying at the foot of the steps his eyes wide a little blood i couldnt tell if it was from his ear or his mouthsmeared across his cheek cormac said he died as we watched but i saw nothing change didnt hear a sigh oror anything and i was kneeling there beside him my hand on his chest calling his name it wasive seen men die before i was in london when the zeppelins came over i was there when they pulled people out of one of the buildings but this was stephen she collected herself with an effort and turned towards the open door id better leave now she said ruefully men dont like it when women start to cry and ive found it hard sometimes he let her go watching her slim figure hurry down the drive and turn towards the sea so that was lady ashford born rachel marlowe and cousin to the people who lived here peters wife widow he remembered peter tall and fast at games levelheaded and very good at whatever he did hed had a gift for languages he could pick them up with apparently no effort and speak them like a native all that wasted in an obscure action on the flanks of a mountain whose one claim to fame was that queen victoria had had two mountains in east africa and had given kilimanjaro to the kaiser next door in tanganyika whod had none bloody silly thing to do in the first place and englishmen had died trying to retake it from the germans under that master strategist von lettowvorbeck who knew how to pin down men who would otherwise have been fighting in france rutledge turned and went back up the stairs to the sitting room standing there with his eyes roving the furnishings the books the wooden ships that nicholas cheney carved he had left more of himself here than the poet after all two people who died together for no apparent reason no expression of regret no apologies to the living no explanation of the deed no excuses no last confessions no lines of bitterness meant to hurt the survivors just silence hamish uneasy and sensitive to the unsettled atmosphere of rutledges mind called to him to leave to wash his hands of this case and go back to london rutledge gave up trying to hear the stillness and walked out into the gallery again on his way to olivias bedroom a voice down in the hall said harshly what the hell who the hell are you rutledge looked down not seeing anyone at first then finding the tall man who stood just in the shadows of a doorway inspector rutledge scotland yard he said ive a key from constable dawlish and im here on official business who are you officialwhats happened the other man demanded sharply the inquiry into the deaths of miss marlowe mr cheney and mr fitzhugh is being reconsidered by the yard rutledge said and started down the stairs the man in the doorway was handsome in a way that few men are reminding rutledge of greek statues that same mix of perfect body and face and mind that the golden age admired most and yet there was something about him that was pure irish was this daniel hargrove the husband of susannah fitzhugh before he could test that the man said im cormac fitzhugh a member of the family no one has told me of any renewed inquiry neither the local police nor the familys solicitors what are you doing here surveying the scenes of death rutledge responded coming to the last step and staying where he was hed dealt with officers of this mans ilk accustomed to giving orders and expecting instant unquestioning obedience to them hed never liked such men hamish growled bloody arrogant bastards the lot im putting a stop to this right now youll hand over your keys if you please and leave the grounds at once there will be no reopening of any affairs to do with my family im afraid mr fitzhugh that you have no say in this business its a police matter at the request of the home office you have no option but to cooperate he paused unless of course you have something to hide in any of these three deaths fitzhugh looked as if rutledge had struck him i wield considerable power in the city thats as may be rutledge answered him it doesnt count here im afraid yes ive something to hide fitzhugh said shortly changing directions so quickly that rutledge was nearly caught off guard my stepbrother and my stepsister killed themselves it isnt something im happy about but it was a choice they both made the reasons behind their deaths were extremely personal and since theres no question that suicide was the cause of death laudanum to be precise selfadministered i see no reason on earth why their unhappiness must be dragged through the newspapers it serves no purpose and it will hurt my cousin my half sister her husband and me for the delectation of a public who couldnt care less about my family but who thrive on titillation my god look at what theyre already doing with these knifings raising the spectre of the ripper as if it was something to be proud of not buried and forgotten rutledge agreed with him there but said nothing after a moment cormac fitzhugh sighed and then added more reasonably theres no hope of deflecting you from this investigation sorry none he made no mention of the fact that the conclusions might well be the same as those the inquest had reached or that so far hed seen no evidence heard no new information to do more than he was already doing asking general questions rutledge was more interested in where the other mans mood was taking them cormac seemed to argue something with himself and reluctantly to come to a decision all right then come in here we neednt stand in the hall like unwelcomed guests he led the way into the drawing room looking with distaste at the closed curtains and the empty space over the mantel where a large portrait had hung im not used to the house like this it was never empty in my childhood nor dark and dreary and full of sadness but then my childhood has vanished taking the memories with it i suppose sit down man rutledge took the chair across from his and wondered what this polished denizen of the city was about to tell him in such confidence it wasnt what he expected ive never told anyone of this if you speak of it ill deny i said it now ill claim that you made it up in a desperate need for promotion or to build your reputation whatever fits do you understand me i can do you considerable harm professionally rutledge got to his feet the yard doesnt respond to threats this isnt a threat god damn it im trying to protect my family and have every right to do that what im about to tell you is disturbing unproved and frighteningly true but the murderer is already dead and theres no use in punishing the living is there what are you talking about rutledge asked as hamish growled a warning cormac fitzhugh took a deep breath hed judged his man he knew he was right and he got on with it olivia marloweo a manningwas a brilliant poet and a woman to whom life was a thing to be possessed to be lived and worshipped and enjoyed she was also a coldblooded murderer rutledge stared at the mans face at the conviction and the pain there he himself felt the shock the onslaught of an unexpected grief he hadnt known the woman at all but hed known her poems how could a soul that produced wings of fire be capable of wanton killing because hamish shouted at him she knew the depths as well as the heights a man can reach and its uncanny i want no part of her fitzhugh was watching him acknowledging his reaction his eyes were a very fine grayblue in this light clear and straightforward now you know why id stoop to any threat to protect what ive told you youve told me but you havent convinced me rutledge heard himself saying fitzhugh got up and went to the lacquered cabinet against the wall that led to the hall and opened it rummaging around inside he found two glasses and a cutglass decanter of whiskey i dont know about you but i need this he held up the second glass raising his eyebrows rutledge nodded talking as he poured the whiskey and added soda fitzhugh said i think she killed nicholas that it was a murder and suicide not a double suicide i dont see nicholas cravenly taking the easy way out she must have tricked him although to be truthful the gassing left him with a cough and rawness in his lungs he may for the first time have really understood the pain that olivia felt all those years i dont know its hard to fathom i have to believe it was suicide but i cant help but feel when im honest about it that she planned his dying whatever he himself decided in the end she was prepared to take him with her shed never been alone it may be that she couldnt bear to be alone in death who knows what was in her mind he brought the whiskey and soda to rutledge and sat down with his own taking a long draught as if to dull the pain rutledge drank a little of his waiting looking at the room again this time seeing the chinese silk on the walls the lovely proportions of the fireplace the molded medallions on the ceiling the polished wood of the floors dark now and lifeless as olivia was lifeless none of this could touch her but there was still her reputation i do know for a factfor a fact mind you although theres no proof whatsoeverthat olivia killed her twin sister anne anne died at eight fell from an apple tree where we were all playing i wasnt part of the family then my father had come here with horses hed sold to rosamund rosamund cheney she was her second marriage her first husband captain marlowe died out in india cholera when he went back to wind up his affairs out there she married a close friend of his james cheney at any rate nicholas was a child at the time im talking about his brother richard still in leading strings wed all gone out to the orchard to play and i started climbing trees throwing down apples they dont grow very well here small and sour but as children we didnt care olivia said shed climb as well and found a tree of her own he swirled the whiskey in his glass staring at it as if it might have more answers than he did i was still in the other tree when anne climbed up after olivia nicholas was just under their tree holding on to the trunk and looking up at themprobably wishing he could do the same but his legs were too short to reach the first branch anne wassometimes stubborn spoiled a little i think she reached the branch where olivia was sitting and said these are my apples now you must find another tree looking at rutledge again he said olivia refused she was never one to give way when it was wrong thats not fair shed say and stick to her guns through whatever battle followed i admired her for that what happened rutledge asked as he stopped again get on with it man they argued anne insisted and olivia shoved her out of the tree she hit a branch coming down thats what saved nicholas but it tipped her on her head and when she struck the tree trunks main root which was just showing above the grass it fractured her skull he shivered god when i saw stephen lying at the foot of the stairs i thought hed done the same thing he drank more of his whiskey then said i was out of the tree id climbed in an instant skinning both knees as i came down though i didnt remember that until much later and i got to anne first she was dead i looked up at olivia and she stared back down at me there was nothing in her face i was the hirelings son then the horse trainers brat i played with them i ate with them sometimes but i wasnt one of them so i ran for help and never told what id seen just that anne had fallen while we were climbing you never spoke of it to your father he was already besotted with rosamund cheney he wouldnt have believed methat one of her precious daughters could have killed the other one hed have called me a troublemaker and boxed my ears instead the lucky thing is anne didnt fall on nicholas there might have been two deaths that day instead of one they were both some distance up she and olivia it was a long way to fall i thought olivia was crippled how is it that she could climb so high she was but the bad leg followed her braced her as her arms pulled her higher into the tree coming down again was more of a problem but olivia wasnt one toto be denied a normal life we pushed her chair everywhere to the waters edge to the orchard to the cliff down to the village sometimes an interesting story but as you said theres no proof no it could still do a great deal of harm all the same and theres richard the one in leading strings yes thats right he was lost on the moors when he was five there was a family picnic and he and olivia went for a walk she came back without him and although we searched until dark and again through the night with lamps brought from the nearest houses we never found him or his body he had simply disappeared and you think olivia killed him somehow hiding the body god knows speculation was rampant some said the gypsies had taken him he was a handsome child very fair and more like rosamund than nicholas who was dark others believed hed fallen down one of the old mine shafts the point is olivia had walked away with him and olivia came back without him he may have wandered into one of those bottomless pools on the moors or he may have been thrown in the pool nearest the picnic was dragged with no luck i wouldnt have thought about olivia killing himif i hadnt been a witness to annes death and that left only the two you see olivia marlowe and nicholas cheney james cheney died soon afterward cleaning his guns that was the verdict at the inquest i often wondered if it was grief over richard that made him careless he was distraughtthey had to lash him to a horse to get him off the moors rosamund rosamund was always a pillar of strength ill never forget her tramping through the darkness lamp in hand determined silent tears on her face but not a single word did she speak i went with her i thought if anyone could find the boy she might she had this streak ofi dont knowintuition she hadnt wanted to go on the picnic but there were guests from wells and james thought it would please them that haunted him to the end theres still no proof rutledge said as hamish took up the theme of intuition rutledge had nearly lost his own in the aftermath of war and in the struggle to regain his balance now he fought against the deep voice in his head reminding him of the last time hed used that intuition warwickshire not a time he wanted to dwell on instead he said to fitzhugh you tell me these things but they could all be lies someone else could have done the killings or they could have been accidents misfortunes not murder fitzhugh drained his glass then rose to set it on the mantelpiece as you say but for gods sake man bear it in mind what ive told you and dont be the hero dont drag olivia marlowe or o a manning or any of the rest of us through the tribulations of exposure if im right and nicholas died at olivias hand let it go down as suicide can you do that much for us and stephen fitzhugh your half brother he lost half of his foot in the war he fell down worn stairs but it was my fault if you want the truth when he stuck his head out the window to say that he would be no more than five minutes i was impatient i had a train to catch and i told him that hed damned well better make haste or we were leaving without him and he did make haste and he died im still waking up at night in a cold sweat trying to call back those words but he was the only family member who was against selling the house as i understand it now it can be sold without any problems and im very likely to buy it cormac fitzhugh said reaching for rutledges empty glass and setting it beside his own thats what brought me down this morning id toyed with the idea im looking for a house in the country but i was thinking of something closer to town than this now i feel guilty about the house as well letting it go out of the family i cant follow stephens plan i cant turn it into a museum for o a manninggod the scholars would have a field day if they stumbled over what ive just told you olivia would not only be famous shed be notorious rutledge stood up which window did your brother call from before he fell fitzhugh stared at him blankly which window it was from the room that had been fathers to the right of the stairs do you want to see it no thats not necessary not this morning ive taken enough of your time ive work to do in the village will you be staying here in the house if i can find mrs trepol and persuade her to make up my room he grinned im not useful in that regard horses i know and contracts and how to handle stockholders at a meeting sheets and towels are beyond me what do you do for a living i have a business in the city fitzhugh enterprises made my fortune in iron and steel branched out into other interests oil the navys looking into that he smiled immense charm irish charm changing his face they call me a war profiteer in some quarters because i made money on the killing but the men in the trenches when the first tanks came over the barbed wire didnt worry about their cost only about what they could do to the germans i saved lives if you come right down to it were you in the war as well as profiting from it the grin faded oh yes inspector i was that surprises most people i was one of the code breakers i have a skill at mathematics that certain people at cambridge remembered quite well i dont think i could have gotten into the real fightingi was more useful where i was boring work you never knew whether what youd just decoded was the most important secret of the campaign or the least important you just did your best like everyone else rutledge closed the front door behind him and stepped out into the drive the sunlight now was brilliant the mists gone the sea such a deep blue it hurt the eyes to look at it he walked down the drive and took the path towards what turned out to be a shingle strand long and narrow and swept by the tides in every gale but this morning busy with gulls and choughs and a pair of ravens that were squabbling over something the water had brought in it appeared to be what was left of a fish the headland shut out the wind and there was unseasonable warmth by the water and a stillness of the air that reminded him of france just before the artillery barrages began he stood there looking out to sea watching a wisp of steam that came out of wales and sailed below the horizon to faraway ports it was peaceful here but there were straggles of rocks again to his right jutting out where the land began to rise once more tumbled and rough and watersprayed he wondered if in the past wreckers had stood here with their lanterns and lured ships onto a stormy shore cornwall had always lived from the sea one way or another shadowed the headland on his left was massive and dark white water creaming at its base and the house was invisible from here only the line of the roof and the clipped lawns foretelling its presence there was the sound of footsteps on the shingle behind him and he turned to see rachel ashford coming towards him he waited for her and she said has he gone yet cormac fitzhugh no i left him in the house chewing her lip for a moment she thought about it well ill just have to wait until tomorrow wont i for the ships then she looked up at him shading her eyes with her hand i know she said answering what she read in his face i wasnt actually ready to fetch them anyway its just after a moment she went on in different voice youve been in there what did you feel she meant the study upstairs and he couldnt pretend to misunderstand he said looking out to sea i dont know but hamish said very clearly the lassie didnt ask for lies startled rutledge turned back to her and said what makes you think theres anything to feel it was her turn to be evasive iyou dont make decisions like that and expect no trace of them to survive im not fanciful you know but when i go inside that house i hear the silence and i cant tell what its whispering to me but im frightened would you like me to fetch the ships for you put them out in the gallery where you could box them up without going inside the study he couldnt have said afterward why hed volunteered to do it except that he could sense her pain and pain he understood surprised she said would you i couldnt impose on mrs trepol or ask the others theyd have laughed at me but if you couldwhen cormac has gone itit would be very kind of you he couldnt stop the next question it came out more bluntly than hed intended because he knew it disturbed him deeply do you think olivia marlowe could have murdered her half brother then killed herself for an instant he thought she was going to faint her face turned so white and she took several gasping breaths as if to steady herself he reached out to catch her arm but she shook him off youis that what you feel in that room no its a policemans curiosity exploring the possibilities after all you sent for me to do that color flooded back into her face and she swallowed hard that was very cruel she said voice low and husky i cant picture in my wildest fancies any reason why olivia would harm nicholas or why he would harm her and yet the very question had struck a chord in her one shed shut out of her mind with all the strength of her will until hed put it into words they walked back to the village together in a silence that brooded between them like a summers storm building and darkening but not breaking the shortcut through the copse was cool and dim after the sunlight hamish was rattling on about women about the moodiness this one evoked about his relief at leaving the house and grounds of trevelyan hall rutledge ignored him he was still trying to deal with the concept of olivia marlowe as a killer and damning cormac fitzhugh for putting it into his head no it wasnt olivia marlowe that disturbed him he rutledge knew very little about olivia marlowe it was o a manning he knew and the poetry had touched his own spirit in the darkness of war standing before god rutledge would have sworn that o a manning was not a murderer could not have been and yet cormac fitzhugh had no reason to lie no reason to twist the truth no reason to know that rutledge the man not the police officer had seen something fragile shatter as he spoke as if shed sensed something of the turmoil in rutledges mind rachel touched his arm and stopped what is it whats bothering you i dont know he told her truthfully i think ive come to cornwall on a useless errand better london and boredom than this youve only been here one day she said gravely how can you know that or did the yard send you here just to please henry ashford a gesture that was never intended to dig very deeply into these deaths the old proverbto let sleeping dogs lieflitted through his mind instead he said to her out of nowhere except that they were taking the shorter path to borcombe who is the old crone i met in the village this morning she must be eighty by the look of her stooped but with extraordinarily clear eyes and a perverted sense of humor if he was any judge rachel frowned ah you must mean sadie im not really sure what her last name is shes been here for so long that shes justsadie the old rector mr nelson whos gone now said he thought shed been a nurse in the crimea and it turned her mind but she has a healers touch it might be true enough midwife confessor horse doctor comforter prescriber of herbs the villagers may go to her more often than to dr hawkins witch she chuckled a low husky laugh that was at odds with her personality as hed come to know it sensual almost and yet full of an appreciation of the ridiculous i suppose shes been called that too no if shes a witch its a white witch not a black one ive never heard of spells put on anyone or people dying under her care well they die yes but of their ailments no love potions no sadly not she said a twist of pain in her voice that came out of nowhere as if she sensed hed heard it she said smiling i went to her once begging a potion i was madly in love and i didnt know how to handle it i thought she might give me something to put in his soup or his breakfast porridgewe were too young for goblets of wine but i grew up on the stories of tristan and isolde i knewthought i knewthat such potions worked she was very gentle but she told me that love couldnt be bought he thought she was belittling herself and what had actually happened but said nothing it occurred to him to ask her about anne but it was not the time then she mentioned the name herself it was anne whod read the old cornish legends to me her grandfather trevelyanrosamunds fatherhad compiled a collection of them it was famous in its day and theres a letter in the house from tennyson telling him how much the book stirred his imagination while he was writing idylls of the king i could quote long passages from it by heart well we all could nicholas especially youd have thought watching our theatricals that he was the poet he read so beautifully tell me about anne anne my goodness theres nothing to tell anne died when she was eight or nine she was olivias twin and they were so much alike to look at them that you couldnt believe it but oddly enough they were quite different in natures anne was the sort of child whod never met a strangershe could cajole anyone into doing anything except livia of course stephen remindsremindedme of anne the same golden charm livia was i dont know one of those people who lived in her imagination and found it rich enough that she didnt need other stimulation she was quiet and thoughtful and very much her own woman even in childhood how did anne die she fell out of an apple tree in the old orchard it isnt there now rosamund had the orchard cut down but it was beyond the back garden sheltered by brick walls we were all playing there nicholas and olivia and anne and i and she reached too far for an apple lost her balance and came down on a root id never seen a dead person before i was terrified out of my wits i thought she was teasing playing games with us was cormac there rachel frowned i dont remember he may have been it was nicholas i remember most kneeling beside anne taking her hand calling to her crying because she wouldnt answer him and olivia having trouble coming down from the tree because of her leg this was before nicholas had carved a brace of course anne fell no one pushed her she looked at him surprised no why should anyone push her she was up in the tree picking apples and then she reached too far we were all children we would never have dreamed of such a thing but children killed it was something that hed learned in london his first year at the yard they came out of the woods into a lane that joined the main street of the village where houses clustered together under slate roofs that looked like quicksilver in the sun lead in the rain there were gardens behind every gate crowded with vegetables and flaming with color rachel stopped i go this wayim staying with a friend on the outskirts she shaded her eyes again with her hand and said you didnt mean thatabout going back to london youll stay and see what you can find ill never persuade henry to appeal for help again he laughed probably not remembering the heat in london the cramped little office bowles pretensions and the squalid knifings that had somehow captured the imagination of the city he found himself saying no im not going back yet ill be here for several more days she left reassured and he turned towards the three bells but noticing the shingle on the front of the doctors surgery he opened the garden gate and went through to knock at the door a young woman with pretty strawberry blond hair opened the door and said ah youre just in time if you want to see the doctor five more minutes and hed have gone through to his luncheon mrs hawkins he asked guessing yes and if youll just wait here a moment she answered leading him into a small sitting room fitted out with bits and pieces of worn furnishings that had been relegated here from the rest of the house ill tell him youre here the name please rutledge gave it to her and she disappeared through the door beside him a moment later she whisked back into the waiting room dr hawkins will see you now she held the door wide ready to shut it behind him rutledge went through into the tidy surprisingly bright surgery dr hawkins he said to the short thickset man behind the desk he was not as young as his wife but not much beyond thirtyfive he thought indeed and what can i do for you this morning his eyes raked rutledge from crown to toe seeing more than rutledge cared to have him see having trouble sleeping are you no im having no trouble at all as it happens rutledge said stiffly im inspector rutledge from scotland yard oh lord and whats happened now it isnt what is happening now that concerns me ive been asked to look into the deaths of three of your patients stephen fitzhugh olivia marlowe and nicholas cheney hawkins stared at him then threw his pen on the desk with such force that it bounced and nearly rolled off the edge those deaths are history closed the inquest agreed with my first impressions and my considered opinion an accident and a double suicide surely youve read the medical report i have and its very thorough all the same there are questions i must ask and that you are required to answer i know damned well what im required to do hawkins said irritably and ive done it his eyes narrowed and he looked at rutledge with sudden suspicion you arent planning to dig up the bodies are you thats all i need right now in what way look ive been a good doctor here i took over from my wifes father whos nearly gaga now war finished him too much to do too little energy to do it ive built a decent practice and im being considered for a partnership in plymouth i learned my craft in the war doing things id never thought in school id be expected to do sew up the dying send the living back to the front find a way to keep the shellshock cases from being shot for cowardice he saw rutledge flinch and added with relish and even deliver fortyseven babies to refugees who had no place to sleep themselves much less with infants to nurse ive paid my dues ive earned the right to move on to better things and if my future partners get wind of the fact that three three of my cases are being exhumed under scotland yards eager eye ill be dead stuck here forever no chance at plymouth no hope of london in the end the fact that scotland yard has an interest in these deaths in no way is a reflection on you the hell it isnt for gods sake man i filled out the death certificates it has everything to do with me then youre convinced that theres nothing in either of the suicides or in the accident that could warrant further police interest thats exactly what i am convinced beyond any shadow of a doubt it hasnt occurred to you that something in the pasts of these three people might change the circumstances enough that what appeared to be suicide was actually murder and suicide to use an instance i came across recently hawkins threw up his hands murder and suicide youve been drinking i can smell it on your breath enough to be having delusions no im as sober as you are rutledge said reining his temper in hard not bloody likely when you suggest such things as you did just now i walked into that study and found two people on the couch a man and a woman their hands were touching his left and her right in the other hand each held a glass there had been laudanum in the glasses and it was on their lips and in their mouths and in their guts enough to kill both quickly and several times over miss marlowe had had poliomyelitis and contrary to what people tell you paralysis is not painless she had been given laudanum by my fatherinlaw and by me as needed until this spring shed used it responsibly no indications of addictions or abuse but its as painless a death as you could wish for if you have to go out i cant blame her for choosing it and i saw no evidence that either one had forced drinking it on the other no bruises about the mouth or tongue none on the lips nothing else in their stomachs to arouse suspicion double suicide thats precisely what it was no more no less nothing in their stomachs to suggest that one might have secretly given an overdose to the other before swallowing his or her own draught its hard to introduce laudanum secretly into clear soup spring lamb roasted vegetables and potatoes people of their sort usually drank wine with meals and coffee afterward the state of digestion tells me that they lived for enough hours after their meal that it couldnt have been in their wine or their coffee id say they swallowed the laudanum some time after midnight as if theyd sat up talking about it and then decided to do it or possibly around dawn theyd been dead for some time when mrs trepol discovered them on monday morning over twentyfour hours now my own meal is waiting and if youll excuse me ill go and eat it my advice to you is to return to london and do something useful there theres very little crime in a place like borcombe we havent needed the services of scotland yard in living memory and i doubt if we will in the next twenty years rutledge left the doctors office thinking over what hed been told that morning damn all if you came right down to it no crimes no murderers no reason for a seasoned scotland yard inspector to waste his time here but just what yere good fornithing hamish declared what if warwickshire was only a bit of luck and none of your doing what if you failed there and havent had the sense yet to see it what if yere failing now because you havent got the skills to tell whether theres murder here or no that house is haunted man and if you dont find out why yell be defeated by your own fears after lunch at the three bells rutledge felt restless and uncertain he told himself it had nothing to do with hamishs remarks or the frustration he felt over where to turn next cormac fitzhugh had seemed to be so certain of his facts rachel ashford was unsettled by the notion of murder being done even though shed called in the yard herself hawkins was not cooperative and the police in borcombe had no reason to stir up the pot for murder when their investigation had ended so creditably he thought about it for several minutes staring out his window towards the sea then picked up his coat and went in search of the rectory it stood foursquare beside the church gray stone with white trim at the windows and doors but built more for long service than for beauty the rector wasnt in his office but the housekeeper sent rutledge around the back to where he was pottering about in his garden it was a big garden green and prosperous with roses by the house and the scent of wall flowers coming from somewhere sweet and elusive the rector was middleaged a man more accustomed from the look of himto working in the ground than preaching from a pulpit he straightened up when he saw rutledge coming across the strip of lawn between the vegetables and the flowers good afternoon he said neither effusively nor coolly but with the manner of a man whod rather be about his own business just now than gods inspector rutledge from london he replied mr smedley aye thats right the rector said with a sigh and put down his hoe no keep working if you like id prefer to stay out here and talk than go inside the housekeeper if he was any judge had long ears it isnt a matter for a priest so much as a question of information that i need well then if you dont mind he picked up his hoe and began to chip at the weeds between rows of what appeared to be marigolds and asters next to a line of sweet peas im here because london has a few remaining questions about several deaths in may at trevelyan hall the rector glanced at him with a smile so gossip was right this morning and youd hardly set foot in the place yes but the questions im about to ask you arent for the ears of gossips good intentioned or ill i want to know about the people who died the woman and the two men what they were like how they lived why they should die so close together the rectors back was to rutledge now as he turned to come down the other row ah well thats a long story do you know much about the family about the grandfather who owned the hall about the daughter who had three husbands and six children only one of whom is still living about the cousin and about the stepson who lives in london and made his fortune i could have learned all this from the shopkeepers and the housewives on their way to market i need more to satisfy london that alls well and why should london doubt that the home office has been going through reports they like to be thorough three deaths in one family in such a short time raises doubts none of those here i can tell you that much i dont know of any questions raised when olivia and nicholas were discovered nor any gossip thats flown about since and in a village like this its your surest sign that alls well as for the death of stephen fitzhugh the man fell in an empty house all the members of his party outside and accounted for unless you believe in ghosts i dont suppose theres much to be suspicious of in that strange that you should mention ghosts rutledge said idly im told the hall is haunted and not by anything that can be exorcised by the church the rector straightened again and looked at him who has told you these tales a scotsman for one rutledge answered the rector smiled theyre great ones for the sight the scots has he also told you whether murder has been done touche has murder been done nowor in the far past not to my knowledge the rector said and i include the confessional in that answer no one has confessed to me and no gossip has reached me the house has seen a good deal of sorrow in its time but show me a house that hasnt been touched by grief especially not with the war and the influenza epidemic youll see the wounded for yourself we were spared the sickness herethe worst of it anyway we lost only three souls to it but even three is too many in a village this size tell me if you will how a woman like olivia marlowe who was reclusive and knew very little of the outside world could write such poetry he went back to his hoeing theres a question only god can answer but who says she knew very little of the world ive read the poems they speak to me of a frightening knowledge of the human condition of the human soul and yet she never spoke of her writing to me and i never asked her questions about it come to that we only knew at the very end that she was o a manning itd been kept a dark secret even from her family id say nicholas knew and that was it but if she had such understanding and such spirit why keep it secret well inspector i take it you have no secretspainful or otherwisethat you prefer to hide from the world not immoral secrets not terrible secrets perhaps but those that wound your spirit which was too damned close for comfort rutledge began to reassess his earlier opinion of the priest hamish was murmuring viciously rubbing salt into the fresh wound but then it was always fresh her paralysis then she found it confining smedley said pensively but never a cross to bear what she feared most i think was to be judged on that account and not on her work youve read the literary magazines since the news broke i suppose everyone scrambling to understand the woman and not the verse delving into her life as if it held answers making an issue of her condition was she ugly misshapen did she not know how to dress well to do her hair talk to people is that what she ran away from and buried in her genius mr smedley began to laugh before rutledge finished his catalog i have a very poor opinion of the women youve known inspector if thats how you judge the fair sex even as a churchman i know better than that then describe her to me rutledge said irritably smedley leaned on his hoe and looked op at the dormers of his house for one thing her mother was beautiful rosamund in olivia it came out in other ways you found you couldnt forget her yet you couldnt say why that was she had lovely eyes inherited from her father i suppose her strength may have come from him as well although rosamund had great strength too transport olivia to london and except for the useless limb shed not be that much different from any young woman you found there shed have had more than her share of beaus if the men in the city had half the sense they were born with no olivia wasnt ugly or misshapen she dressed like any other countrywoman no floating scarves none of those shiny black gowns or exotic feathers no literary pretensions at all a warm manner a pleasant nature but never serene serenity had not been granted to her he shrugged her hair always one of her glories was darker than rosamunds that shade of brown that turns to gold in the sunlight more like her fathers george marlowe was a very fine man rosamund adored him and she was bereft when he died in india she told me herself that they feared for her health and sanity for a time her courage saw her through and her faith rutledge felt his confusion deepen did everyone see olivia in a different light and if they did where was the real woman i was surprised when she took her life smedley said after a moment olivia i wouldnt have expected it of her for nicholas to follow her seemedoddlyreasonable enough i cant tell you why it just did but for olivia to die by her own handit shook me deeply it was as if a bedrock from which i drew my own strength had suddenly been shaken to its roots and crumbled i wept he said as if that still surprised him and left him uncertain of himself i wept not only for myself and for her but for what was lost with her going she was the most remarkable woman ive ever known or ever hope to know and nicholas he was an enigma smedley replied slowly in all the years id known him i never really knew the man he had great depths great passion a wonderful mind we played chess and argued over the war and discussed politics and i was never allowed behind the wall of his patience when rutledge didnt respond smedley added almost to himself i dont know that nicholas wasnt my greatest failure when rutledge walked into the dark narrow lobby of the three bells the innkeeper handed him a small package that had been delivered earlier rutledge took it through to the public bar where he ordered a pint and when it came sat staring at the package for another several minutes before opening it faces somehow lent reality to facts there were photographs inside as hed expected with a note please id like to have these back when youve finished with them there was no signature but he knew theyd come from rachel ashford he tried to see rachel and peter together to imagine peter marrying her and failed not because she wasnt the sort of woman peter could have loved but because peter as he remembered him in school must have been very different from the man whod died on kilimanjaro just as he rutledge had changed out of all recognition from the boy whod had so many fine dreams and plans for his future taking the photographs out of their wrapping and spreading them out on his table he looked at them not sure what he was going to see not certain he wanted to see them now there were several older ones rosamund trevelyan at twentythere were names and dates on the backshining with youth and beauty and some inner peace he looked at her more closely yes there was strength as well and a sense of laughter in her eyes anne and olivia standing amid the roses in the back garden so alike that there was a question mark on the reverse by their names two girls in laceedged white dresses with long sashes and ribbons in their hair smiling shyly for the camera pretty girls with tumbling curls and the shape of rosamunds face if not her beauty the same girls again this time a little older with a small boy and another child in a long dress nicholas and richard nicholas was already tall for his age dark unruly hair and dark eyes although in the photograph you couldnt tell if they were brown or dark blue another one when richard was five and nicholas was seven or eight on the moors with their family richard was now a boy with a wide mischievous grin and gleeful eyes a born troublemaker some would say ready for any game was that how hed been lured away nicholas frowning at the camera was intense chin up eyes defiant but he was smiling in another photograph with olivia nowanne would have been dead several yearsand rosamund holding a pair of twins in her arms all but invisible in swathes of christening robes susannah and stephen but rosamund still seemed no more than a few months older than the girl shed been at twenty with a tilt of her head and a smile in her eyes that any man might respond to lovely vivid with spirit olivia on the other hand was nearly in her shadow a slim girl with long hair that curled around her face nicholas beside her with his arm protectively around her rutledge looked again at olivia this was the budding poet this was the woman who had left her mark in words and yet there was something about her something in the shadows that drew him back to her face wishing it was larger clearer unforgettable the rector had said but what a man with cormac on one side and the twins now walking at his boots holding on to his legs and grinning shyly at the camera brian fitzhugh his elder son and his children by rosamund brian wasnt handsome and yet he had an attractiveness that came from his smile cormac on the other hand was remarkably handsome already a slim boy with grace in the set of his shoulders and strength in his eyes who knew himself and felt no doubts about where he might be going the twins were as fair and pretty as cherubs with rosamunds beauty and only a faint shadow of their father more in their sturdy build than in their features her liveliness in their faces the last two were of men an older bearded man straight and broadshouldered beside a younger man in uniform captain marlowe rosamunds first husband with her father adrian trevelyan trevelyan wasnt smiling as most of his generation seldom smiled for the camera but marlowe had been laughing when this photograph was taken catching him with its reflection in his eyes and giving remarkable spirit to his face rutledge could understand why rosamund had fallen in love with him they must have been a handsome pair the other man tall standing alone beside a horse was james cheney nicholas father and rutledge didnt have to glance at the back of the photograph to identify him his son was his image darkly attractive and yet a quiet introspective man rutledge looked at the collection again and thought of the faces all dead now but two cormac and susannah one who belonged and one who didnt the elderly barkeep came over to ask if hed like a refill for his glass and looked down at the photographs the trevelyans he said aye it were a grand family that one i remember the old master not one to trifle with but the fairest man i ever came across doted on his daughterwell she were a beauty and no question there but a lady and you recollected your manners around heri but one to say thank you and please as if youd done her a favor not a service now that one a gnarled finger pointed to the captain he died out in india of the cholera and mr trevelyan he claimed hed lost a son and miss rosamund was so ill of grief the doctor feared for her life there were some saying she married mr cheney hoping to forget but there was love there as well i saw them together often and there was love but mr fitzhugh surprised us all marrying miss rosamend he wasnthe wasnt quality like her irish gentry he said but whos to know still she was happy enough and she doted on the twins a good mother two of her children died young aye they never found the little one there was a tramp through here not many years back that reminded me of richard cheney same devils look in his eyes that boy was afraid of naught and tempted god and satan with his antics ran away from home twice nearly set the hall on fire one guy fawkes night with a bonfire in the nursery i was a groom at the hall then when they kept so many horses and hed beg to ride anything with four legs another customer walked into the bar crutches still awkward under his armpits a leg missing the barkeep heard the uneven thumpthump looked over his shoulder and said right with you will he turned back to rutledge they say miss olivia wrote poetry but i dont know not in a womans line is it howd she know about the war then and the suffering somebodys got it all wrong he went away to serve the other man and then to speak to a pair of fishermen slumped in the corner benches arguing dispiritedly over what had become of the pilchard runs that had once been cornwalls fishing wealth and what to do about the outlanders from as far away as yarmouth their big boats overfishing cornish seas rutledge was left looking down at the faces that stared unseeingly back at him remembering what the barman had said was that the key was that why nicholas had had to die too because he wrote the poetry that had made o a manning famous rutledge shook his head it wasnt what he wanted to believe the next morning rutledge kept his promise to rachel ashford and accompanied her back to the hall the sun was brilliant blindingly bright at sea and touching the land with colors that vibrated against the eye they walked through the copse again coming out to stand for a moment looking up at the house it was shimmering like some mythical castle on a mythical hill and rachel said odd isnt it how very impressive the house is and yet if you look at it architecturally there must be a hundred homes in cornwall alone that are as fine finer even this one is old and rambling and very small by most standards but i love it with all my heart peter said she stopped cleared her throat and went on peter said that it was in the stone that sparkling quality and the angle of the sun caught it sometimes yes that could be true rutledge said hed thanked her for the photographs when she came to the inn and promised to return them before he left cornwall but he hadnt told her any of the thoughts that had rampaged through his head most of the night until hamish had clamored for peace after that hed slept but fitfully it had seemed that he could hear the sea from his room and the wash of the waves kept time with his heartbeats she looked at him youll be leaving soon i can feel it with nothing done about my problem i cant find anything to keep me here he said look rachel he realized he was using her given name but somehow mrs ashford was not how he thought of her theres neither proof nor evidence to show that somethings wrong im wasting the yards time if i pretend there is rachel sighed yes i know would you be happier if i did find something that olivia was a murderer that nicholas was and as for stephen i cant see that theres anyone to kill him if everyone is telling the truth and you were all outside at the time he fell you talk about nicholas and olivia she said harshly walking on but not about the living about me about susannah and daniel about cormac you told me yourself that you couldnt accept the possibility that they were murderers are you saying that you might have been the killer no of course not iall right if you want to know cormac came to see me last evening he wants to buy the house out of guilt he says because he cant do what stephen wanted and make it a museum but in a way it stays in the family a compromise we get our money and he has a country home and stephen is somehow pacified pacified it was an odd choice of word yes apparently stephen had this silly notion that hed been the inspiration for the wings of fire poemsthe love poemsand susannah said the museum was really to his glory not olivias it was cruel but she was furious with him for making such a silly fuss when everyone else had agreed on selling thats the point you see wed always more or less expected the house would be sold when olivia and nicholas died but adrian trevelyan had made certain in his will that cormac couldnt inherit the house he left the house to olivia not rosamund to prevent it you know that for a fact well i was a child inspector but a child hears things a child is sometimes very quiet in a corner and the adults forget heor sheis there and they talk and that child listens sometimes it doesnt mean anything sometimes it does but i have a clear memory of adrian speaking to rosamund when james cheney died wed just had the reading of his will and so i knew what a will was and adrian said i wont be here to see you wed again and she said i dont think its likely that i shallill never find another man like george marlowe and i wont be as lucky as i was with james and adrian replied youre young you have a zest for living youll take another husband and i wont be here so im changing my will my love and taking the house from you do you mind if i give it to olivia ive loved her and her father in her since she was put into my arms as a newborn id like to think of her here moving through my house loving it after im gone youve got the house george left you and nicholas will have james olivia has no other home may never have one to my disappointment eavesdropping rosamund asked for several days to think about it and i never heard the outcome until adrian died and his will was read i knew then what theyd decided between them thats why cormacs suggestion upset me i couldnt tell him what adrian had said could i that house has always been a haven of warmth and love and now were all quarrelling over what becomes of it spoiling it every time im reminded of stephens death i remember that he died still angry with us for not doing what hed asked of us rosamund had another home yes in winchester in the close actually it was george marloweshe bought it himself my own father inherited the family home where he and george had grown up george was the younger son and chose the army and nicholas had a house in norfolk ive been there a very pretty place and so he could have left trevelyan hall if hed been unhappy here and gone elsewhere to live or assuming he married and didnt want to bring his bride to the hall he could take her to his own home they had reached the drive now and rachel turned away looking towards the headland i dont think nicholas would have married and left here but if in fact he wished it he could have after a moment she said quietly yes which might have given olivia a motive for killing nicholas he looked at rachel suddenly aware of something that he hadnt felt in her before you were in love with nicholas werent you most of your life no i was fond of him but love her voice died away and the lie with it did you ever love peter rutledge asked harshly feeling the pain of a man hed known somehow mixed with his own peter deserved better she whirled on him what do you know about love yes i loved peter he was wonderful gentle and kind and ive missed him every day since he sailed for africa but loving him isnt the same as being in love with nicholas is it dont she cried and ran up the steps to the door fumbling to unlock it through her tears i wont listen to this go away ill take care of the ships myself i dont need you or anyone else he came up behind her and quietly took the key from her im sorry he said gently i shouldnt have said any of that to you but i brought you here didnt i she said as the door swung wide and the house seemed to be waiting for them it was a mistake i see that now just go back to london and leave me alone if cormac had spent the night here there was no sign of it rutledge made tea in the kitchen and brought it to rachel in the small parlor that overlooked the sea he had opened the drapes when he took her there to alleviate some of the air of grief that the darkened rooms seemed to evoke she was not crying now but there was a bleakness in her face that made him feel guilty as hell she took the cup with a nod then began to sip it as if she needed it badly he walked to the windows his back to her and looked out at the sea as nicholas had done every dawn since childhood although rutledge wasnt aware of that but rachel was she concentrated on the tea with fierce attention but the tall figure of the man before her no more than a silhouette was like a knife in her heart afterward they went up to the gallery there were boxes shed left in one of the bedrooms and she fetched those while he went into the study opened the cases and brought out the finely wrought ships models they were of such perfection that he could see the tiniest detail clearly and he marveled at the patience and workmanship that had gone into them but then the rector had spoken of nicholas patience he gave her the first one the queen of the sea at the door of the room and she took it the way a priest takes the host with trembling fingers he made a point not to look at her face her eyes she knelt and began to wrap it carefully in cotton batting then just as carefully lowered it into a box filled with torn strips of newspaper he went back for the next and brought that to her as well the olympic he remembered when she was launched the sister ship of the illfortuned titanic there was also the german deutschland and her sister the kaiser wilhelm der grosse and the earliest of the great liners the sirius handsomely afloat on a beautifully carved sea with dolphins at her bows and the acquitaine launched in time to become a hospital ship in the dardanelles he wondered how many ghosts had followed her home to england the mauritania had served off gallipoli the sister ship of the lusitania sunk by a german uboat in was it the ships or the sea that intrigued nicholas cheney he asked as the last of the liners went into her paper and batting slip he hadnt told rachel how empty the cabinet looked without them as if something that was alive in the room had been taken away both i think he told me oncewhen we were childrenthat hed grow up to be a great sea captain one of his ancestors was an admiral on his mothers side and had fought at trafalgar i suppose that was what put the idea into his head there was a small boat down on the strand that he used from time to time sometimes olivia went out with him sometimes i did he was a different man on the water ii dont exactly how but it was there she closed the last box and with his help taped the tops of the others as well then together they carried them down to the hall but at the stairs she stopped and looked back over her shoulder with such haunted eyes that he turned away and made a show of shifting the boxes in his arms hamish in the back of his mind stirred restlessly and ominously he was sensitive to lost lovehed died before returning to his own rachel left before rutledge did and when he came out shutting the door behind him he found himself face to face with the old crone whod given him the longer directions to the house on his first morning she stared up at him and grinned what had rachel called her he couldnt remember ye found your way i take it both ways actually she cackled is miss rachel still here no she left some time ago and youd not be knowing would ye of any old rags miss olivia was leaving for me theyd not be in those boxes yonder in the hall no mrs ashford packed those this morning shes coming to fetch them in a cart later and none in the kitchen by the back door not that i recall she sighed i saw the devil yesterday and wasnt asking the likes of him for rags but miss rachels a lady shed not turn me off rutledge smiled she might seem sharp as a tack but her mind wandered ill ask her when i see her next the old woman leaned back and looked up at the house i was here the day mr stephen fell you were what i was here she said irritably id helped mrs trepol with the clothes she was taking for the church bazaarbags of them there were and miss susannah asked if id like the rags for my rugs he looked at the gnarled hands you make rugs are ye deaf then young as ye are she retorted tartly tell me about mr stephen he suggested hastily he was in the house looking for something searching high and low i dont know what it twas but he was in a taking over it said hed find it or know the reason why he shouted at mrs trepol asking her if shed moved it and she were near to crying telling him shed never touch his things and then she was going out the back door and i heard mr stephen on the stairs a racket and him yelling damned foot and i knew the gabriel hounds were here again riding high through the passages and down the stairs like the demons they are i turned away afeerd of em what you heard was his fall then and he was alone except for the hounds they were baying at him sharp and shrill and angry did you say anything to mrs trepol or anyone else there was naught to say outside mrs trepol was marching along the path with her back stiff with hurt and inside the family was crying out and making fuss enough without me mr cormac caught up with us going for the doctor but didnt say what was amiss i didnt like the look on his face i can tell you cold and dark but youre a healer he said or so ive been told in the village didnt you go to see if you could help stephen fitzhugh she gave him a look of disgust i heal god willing but i dont raise the dead from their sleep but you couldnt be sure i told ye londoner that id heard the gabriel hounds thats all i needed to know theyre never wrong ive heard em afore when there was death walking the land in this house in the woods wherever evil strays she turned and walked off hobbling on her stick leaving him to hamish who was trying to force words into his mind but what the hell were the gabriel hounds shed talked of some family banshee ive been trying to warn you hamish said grimly what they were the souls of unchristened children a child who dies before hes blessed by the church unshriven not wanted by godnor by the devil i dont believe a word of itthats highland nonsense he said aloud before he could stop himself the old woman turned and looked at him and silently crossed herself he felt his face flush in the bar after lunch was an elderly man in an old but fine suit and collars and cuffs that gleamed whitely in the dimness several people had clustered around his bench talking quietly and nodding at whatever he said in response a half dozen men stood around outside in the sunshine playing keels their shadows flicking across the dusty glass of the windows four other men sat around the hearth reliving the war two had lost limbsan arm a foot another wore an eye patch except for the women speaking with the doctor it was a male enclave the barkeep said thats the old doctor the fatherinlaw of dr hawkins penriths his name those that dont hold with the new ways of dr hawkins still come to speak to him but his minds going these days shame but there it is age catches us all in the end the barkeep must have been as old if not older than penrith rutledge looking across at the bearded doctor smiled to himself at the comment then went up the stairs two at a time to his room to get the photographs rachel had sent him when the doctor was finally sitting there alone rutledge joined him and bought him beer before opening the subject of the trevelyan family sorrowful history the trevelyans had penrith said tired old eyes looking up at rutledge i saw them through most of it and held their hands when they mourned old adrian died in his bed as he should but not the others sad sad it was i did what i could young hawkins doesnt understand about that hes not a village man i was rutledge used his handkerchief to clear off a space then took out the photographs and made a fan of them on the table what can you tell me about these people what light there was from the narrow windows fell across them gently touching their faces ahmore secrets than i want to remember thats the gift of old age inspector you begin to forget and in forgetfulness is peace but id like to know their secrets to satisfy myself that alls well that there was nothing donenow or beforethat should have roused suspicion the old man chuckled suspicions a doctor always has suspicions hes worse than the police but sometimes theres more compassion in silence than in words when you cant undo the harm thats been done sometimes you bury it with the dead james cheney killed himself and i said it was an accident cleaning his guns why burden rosamund with more grief than she already had the boy was lost there was no bringing either of them back father or son and olivia was in such a state that i thought shed lose her reason swearing shed never let richard out of her sight except to look at a plovers nest shed found and nicholas saying that it was his fault he hadnt watched out for either of them when hed known he ought to and the servants crying and no man about the place but brian fitzhugh to see to the burying fitzhugh was there when cheney died oh aye he was hed come and goabout the horses they raced miss rosamund and her father winners the lot of them good bloodlines like the trevelyans and now only miss susannah is left and shes more irish than cornish if you dont mind my saying it what do you know about cormac fitzhugh nothing the old man said finishing his beer he never needed me for any doctoring not a splinter in the foot nor fall from a horse when they sent him away to earn his own living i was glad miss olivia said one day shed write some poems about him i paid no heed to it then i thought it was girlish foolishness romantic nonsense rutledge stared at the watery eyes in the bearded face was the doctor trying to say that the love poems were written by olivia to cormac fitzhugh that they had nothing to do with her half brother stephen whatever hed tried to believe tired from a restless night rutledge sat in a chair by his window and let himself drowse he was just into that soft floating ease between sleeping and waking when he heard sharp taps a womans high heels coming briskly up the stairs and then sharper taps as she rapped on his door jerked into wakefulness he straightened his tie ran a hand over his hair and went to open the door rachel he thought hazily come to fetch her photographs but it was a tall slim blond woman with angry eyes who stared up at him when the door swung wide inspector rutledge she said crisply looking him up and down yes he said im rutledge id like to speak to you in your room if i may the parlor is not private this time of day when he hesitated she said im susannah hargrove stephen fitzhughs sister he stood aside and let her come in gesturing to the chair hed drawn up to the window he stayed where he was by the door on his feet she ignored the chair instead she rounded on him like a battleship bringing her heavy guns to bear my brother cormac telephoned to my husbands office in london and left a message that youre here to reopen the matter of my familys recent losses his secretary passed it along is that true or did she get it wrong im afraid it is true he said gravely which is not to say that scotland yard wont come to the same conclusions in all three deaths yes im sure it willtoo late too late for us the family i mean well be dragged through the newspapers our dirty linen hung out for all to goggle at and then when you are quite satisfied youll beg our pardon and take the train back to london as if nothing had happened its bad enough inspector to have to smile at people who know very well two members of your family killed themselves if the police start whispers of murder well all be disgraced im expecting a child in the late autumn i wont have it brought into the world in the midst of a nasty police matter he fought back a smile at her vehemence and said only ive said nothing about murder to you or to your half brother why else would scotland yard give aa damn about some obscure village matters if there werent suspicions on somebodys part is it because olivia was famous is that why youre here to bedevil us tears overlaid the anger in her eyes but she held them back fighting hard when he didnt immediately answer she turned her back on him and stared out the window i knew that was what it must be i told daniel it could be nothing else why did olivia have to do something soso selfish if she wanted to end it all why did she have to leave shadows on the house on us i grew up there too i dont deserve to have my memories my very childhood turned into something hostile and empty and grotesque and if you have your way we wont even be able to sell the house and be rid of it she whirled around and stared at him i hate that house now i want it sold and all of the past ripped out of it by new owners who dont knowdont carewho we were she swallowed hard then the tears came who will buy it she demanded huskily if there was murder as well as suicide there well have it hung around our necks like our sins for the rest of our lives he pulled out his handkerchief and held it out to her but she ignored it fumbling in her handbag for one of her own ive just lost my brother she said brokenly and now this and the doctor said i wasnt to be upset if you dont believe murder has been done why should you hate the house so much he asked in an attempt to distract her what has it donewhat has been done there to distress you she made a dismissive gesture with her hand it isnt what was done its whats been lost rosamundmy motherheld such light in her hands and the houseall of uswere touched by it and then she died and it was all changed all different alli dont know dark and dreary and full of olivias obsessions obsessions about what how should i know olivia was a woman who lived in her thoughts in her feelings im not like that i feel i cry i laugh she was silent i didnti couldnt understand her itsunnaturalin a woman to write as she did i still dont think of her as that poet i think somehow they must have got it all wrong do you believe nicholas cheney could have written those poems she stared at him tears drying on her lashes nicholas iit hadnt occurred to meto any of us do you think it was nicholas truly he said carefully i dont know enough about your family to offer that as a possibility im just answering your question about olivia marlowe her face fell oh do you know why nicholas and olivia killed themselves susannah shook her head ive lain awake at night wondering why anyone could do such a thing i was her sister half sisterbut she never said a word to me about her feelingsabout despair desperation youd have thought but she didnt and nicholasits like a betrayalto go off like that and leave me alone just before stephen died mother betrayed me tooive always suspected feared down deep inside that she killed herself too pain welled in her eyes deep and terrifying whats wrong with my family im the only one left nownot counting cormac one day will something awful happen to me will i leave this child without a mother and without anyone of its own to love cormac was that wayalone he never had any one else however beautiful he is cormac is terribly alone and i dont want my child to grow up in that kind of world rutledge calmed her down as best he could asking her if shed like him to summon dr hawkins but susannah shook her head no i dont need a doctor i need a little peace and if youd only go back to london and leave us as we were id be able to forget you said that rosamund might have killed herself did you mean that metaphorically in the sense that she killed herself with worry or ignored her own health didnt take proper care that sort of thing or that she took her own life deliberately and knowingly she died of an overdose of laudanum dr penrith said it was a mistake that in the night shed accidently miscounted the drops she was supposed to take but i was afraid her strength had run out her laughter i was afraid that she was tired of facing the next morning and the next night she was afraid to marry again even though there were any number of men who would have been glad to have her she said shed buried the last man she loved she would never do it again that there wasnt enough left of her heart to put into another grave her solicitor mr chambers was rather like james cheney strong steady a good man i thought she was fond of him and most certainly he cared for her but it wasnt enough she wasnt susannah took a deep breath i cant talk about it any more daniel is downstairs hell have fits if he sees me so upset daniel would do anything to make me happy it isnt fair to worry him like this she asked to use the water and his basin to wash her face and he went to find the linen cupboard in the passage outside his room to bring towels for her she thanked him looked searchingly in the mirror when shed finished and said will you give me your arm down the stairs i dont mind going up them but since stephens since then ive had a thing about coming down them about falling i dream about it sometimes my foot slipping the weight of the baby she shivered you were all outside when he fell yes impatient in a hurry not thinking about his foot i remember saying to rachel that stephen could be so tiresome at times all this bother just for some old books he wanted to find as if he couldnt come back anytime for them and then cormac went inside shouted to us to come at once and it was already too late i felt so ill i thought i might miscarry he took her down the stairs and she leaned heavily on his arm as if clinging to life itself but once in the passage outside the bar she smoothed her skirts gave him a relieved smile and walked with absolute assurance through the door to where her husband was waiting daniel had some remarks of his own to make about rutledges presence in borcombe hinting darkly at the government having ignored olivia until it was too late and now wanting to seem efficient and solicitous its a nasty business inspector to destroy a family for political gain rutledge let him have his say and finally they left in a new motorcar murmuring something about friends in the next town who would be waiting upon them for dinner over her shoulder susannah gave him a last pleading glance before turning to answer some question her husband had put to her it was very late and rutledge unable to sleep finally got up and dressed and let himself out of the inn in the darkness of a fading moon his pockets filled with candles and matches from his room he tramped through the silent streets where not even a dog roused up to bark at him but there was an owl in the darker woods who spoke softly as he passed death omens owls had been called but hed always found a strange comfort in their lonely sounds there was no light in the house no indication that cormac was in residence deep in his own thoughts and problems rutledge hadnt considered that impediment but somehow he knew that the house was empty the instant he put his hand on the latch and turned the key stepping inside and closing the door behind him he fumbled for a candle and the matches it flared brightly startling himin the trenches it could bring a snipers bullet in its wakebut he managed not to drop it hamish grumbling with dislike waited until hed lighted the candle and said try the library first not the study shed not keep them there but rutledge knew that the study was where he was heading and he climbed the stairs slowly quietly to walk along the gallery and stop for a moment to listen to whispers that seemed to follow him it was only the sea and he recognized it at once but a shiver passed through him all the same he thought of rachel and her ghosts what was there in this house that had marked it so strongly he opened the study door and was surprised that the moonlight poured so intently through the rooms windows no one had closed the curtains here and he stopped to count back yes there must have been a full moon on that saturday night olivia and nicholas could well have died in its light for it would have poured through these windows like a silver sea hamish unsettled and arguing fiercely with rutledge blotted out the sounds of the waves coming in against the headland but they were there an undercurrent that somehow soothed as if the vastness of the sea dwarfed human griefs and sorrows and pain who had been the first to die he wondered again looking at the couch in the candles faint glow the man or the woman the killer or the victim or were they bothsomehowvictims after a time he went over to the bookshelves by the typewriter and looked through the volumes there surely the others had had their own copies they wouldnt have needed to take hers the candles light moved along the shelves stirred by his breath and there on the spine of a slim dark blue book were letters that gleamed like molten gold wings of fire he pulled it out then began his search again a winedark volume like blood in this shadowy corner and written in silver lucifer the one his sister frances had said set london on its ear trust her to know what society felt about the new the different the timely soon afterward he found light and dark then the scent of violets and when hed nearly given up shadows the candle was dripping hot wax on his fingers he swore collected his booty and stood up something seemed to move in the darkness and in its wake stirred a faint scent of sandalwood and roses he froze but it was only the silk shawl over olivia marlowes typewriter disturbed by his movements slipping softly off the cold metal and brushing his arm laughing to himself at his own susceptibility he who had lived among the dead in france he pulled the shawl gently back into place and went out of the room closing its door behind him the gallery was quiet and empty the hall as well there were no ghosts here and yetthere was something that stirred hamish into scottish complaint again ignoring him rutledge went down the stairs blew out his candle and opened the door into the soft darkness beyond where something stood in the drive like a being out of hell and regarded him with a stillness that made hamish yell out a warning rutledge accustomed to night forays into no mans land where the danger was much more real and often silently swift held his ground and said what is it you want but he could feel his heart thudding from the surprise the rector said its you then inspector what the hell mr smedley lowered the blanket hed thrown over his nightclothes and head and said i saw lights moving about in the hall i didnt stop to dress i came at once i wanted to know who or what was walking about here was it you or are you here on the same errand id been told that mr fitzhugh had decided not to stay at the hall after all i thought it was still quite empty i came for some books rutledge said hearing the defensive note in his own voice i thought they might help me in my understanding of the poet ah yes the poems he sighed come back to the rectory with me man and well sit down like decent christian folk in good light rutledge chuckled locked the door and followed him down the drive youre a brave man to come looking for intruders in an empty house he said catching up pshaw smedley answered im not afraid of anything the human mind can conceive one recognizes the face of evil in my profession just as you do in yours but youll notice that i did not walk into the house and i came armed from the folds of his blanket he produced a very businesslike heavy iron poker that gleamed darkly in the pale light of the moon what happened to turning the other cheek rutledge asked amused smedley laughed the shadows of the copse fell over them its all very well in its place you understand but i dont believe our lord intended for us to turn the other cheek to criminals after all he threw the moneylenders out of the temple and you believed that there was a criminal in the hall tonight i most certainly didnt expect to find scotland yard creeping about the premises but the house has much thats valuable in it and we have our share of tramps and goodfor naughts coming around the saddest are the men who cant find work and have too much pride to beg weve done what we could as a parish but i dont think i could fault a man who was desperate enough to steal for his familys table not to condone it you perceive but to understand what needs drive him you have an unusual christian charity well i didnt enter the church for sake of my pocket but because i have a hunger in my own soul and has it been satisfied ah yes it has though i must admit that the perplexities have multiplied more than id expected find one answer and open the door to a hundred more questions now if you please well walk silently here old mrs treleth has a small dog that takes great pleasure in keeping her neighbors awake if he can pounce on the smallest noise as an excuse they walked quietly out of the wood down the lane to the main road and then turned towards the church mrs treleths dog continued to slumber by the rectory gate rutledge said ive disturbed your sleep enough for one night ill go along to the inn indeed im wide awake and youll pay for it with your company smedley said lightly come along quietly youd not be any happier than i if we wake my housekeeper shes worse than the little dog god forgive me they made their way to his study with a minimum of noise and the rector said pulling his blanket more closely around him as im not dressed for the church i feel no qualms about a wee dram of somethingshall we say strengthening as a devon man may i offer you a cup of our finest cider there was a gleam in his eye rutledge said straightfaced id be delighted devon cider could kick like a team of army mules deceptively smooth on its way down and building a fire in the belly that was unexpectedly hard on the head hed had calvados in normandy that did the same and wondered if the two had common roots smedley returned with two tall cups and a cold jug he set them on the table between his chair and rutledges and said you can put those books down im not here to wrestle your soul for them as a matter of fact i have copies of my own your midnight foray was unnecessary ah but i would have had to ask for them rutledge said with an answering grin and i preferred not to do that to draw more attention to this investigation than its already created so its an investigation now no rutledge said shortly im still considering the options smedley quietly chuckled acknowledging that hed touched rutledge on the raw and handed him his cup then his face changed and as he pulled the blanket around him more comfortably he said well i dont know any answers its between you and your conscience when you find yours what do you mean by that smedley shrugged we must all decide how to use the knowledge we collect in life in my work and in yours as well im sure there are painful decisions to be made and painful choices theyre never really the same are they decisions and choices why did you suddenly want the books because when i came down to cornwall i didnt know that one of the victims was o a manning only that a woman named olivia marlowe was dead now i think the poems must have some bearing on her life if not her death id like tounderstandboth women if i can have you read them before the poems oh yes i read scent of violets at the front my sister sent me a copy it frightened me in a way that someone else saw and felt the things that haunted me and i never had the courage to write about even in letters home he couldnt have said to jean or to his sister for that matter worldly as frances was what it was like to live in the nightmare of war his letters had been light giving a superficial account of suffering and not the bedrock he thought frances had guessed but jean had preferred the lies hamish stirred but said nothing about fiona and wings of fire have you read that theyre extraordinarily moving those poems where did olivia marlowe spinster of this parish learn so much about love a question ive asked myself over and over again cormac was the only man she saw much of who wasnt a part of the family i know stephen claimed that shed taken her fondness for him and extended it to the experience between a man and a woman it may be trueshe was capable of that leap of understanding if anyone was and stephen was the kind of childthe kind of man who endeared himself to everyone ive forgiven him sins that id have turned another lad over my knee for committing told myself he was fatherless and young and meant no harm but i loved the boy as id have loved my own son for the goodness in him and the light he was very like rosamund and i know my own weakness in that direction too he frowned perhaps thats what olivia saw in him rosamund he sat in silence drinking from his cup and letting the sounds of the house creak and breathe and whisper around them comforting sounds then he said and the last collection the lucifer poems have you read those not yet hed been in hospital when they came out last year its a very interesting study of the face of evil olivia understood that just as well as she understood love and war and the warmth of life as a priest i found it disturbing that she should know the dark side of man so much better than i that she should believe that god tolerated evil because it has its place in his scheme that there are some who are not capable of goodness in any sense the lost the damned the sons of satan whatever you choose to call them exist among us and cannot be saved because they dont have the capacity for recognizing the purpose of good as if it had been left out of the clay from which they were formed rutledge thought about a number of the cases hed worked on before the war and some of the acts of sheer wanton viciousness that hed witnessed in france he believed in evil and in the capacity of man to be evil in a sense evil paid his wages he wasnt as sure as smedley was that everyone had a capacity for good smedley drained his cup id not like to think that olivia marlowe knew such a being as she describes actually knew him id not like to think that id met him on the streets of borcombe or along the farm lanes or in one of the towns on market day i would have trouble with that rutledge finished his cup as well and felt his head beginning to spin he had a hard head for liquor but cider could leap out of the jug at you when you were tired and unsettled and had an empty stomach you dont think olivia herself was capable of such evil smedley stared at him you must lead a drearier more despairing life in london than most of us can comprehend he said to ask me that but i wont answer you directly ill tell you to read the poems yourself and then decide he stood up gathering the blanket about his burly shoulders i think i can sleep now he added and ill be surprised if you dont as well leave the books until morning youll be glad of that advice believe me rutledge took the advice along with the books went home to bed and fell asleep almost at once he wondered on the brink of sliding into the depths if hed have one hell of a headache tomorrow he did but whether it was cider or lack of sleep that pounded through his skull he wasnt sure breakfast and several cups of the inns violent black coffee seemed to help he realized that it was sunday morning and that the village of borcombe was on its way to church services or a day of leisure suddenly rutledge didnt care about murder or the poems or about the job hed been sent to do he sent a note by the boot boy to rachel ashford although he himself had no idea where she was staying he trusted to the village intelligence system that worked more swiftly and more thoroughly than anything the allies had devised during the war the boy said instantly he knew where she could be found and pocketing the coin rutledge had given him he set off at a trot ten minutes later he was back with a reply and had pocketed his third coin of the morning two from the london gentleman and one from the lady rutledge opened the envelope and read the brief lines at the bottom of his own scrawled request id love to sail ill join you in twenty minutes ask the innkeeper if we might use his boat i know where its kept so he went in search of the innkeeper and received permission to take out the saucy belle with mrs ashford although he hadnt sailed since before the war rutledge had some experience and thoughtcorrectlythat rachel might have more she came to the inn wearing sensible shoes and a pair of what looked like mens tousers cinched tightly at the waist with an oversized belt her eyes smiled as he looked at her but she made no explanation whether these were peters clothes or borrowed from someone else they walked together down the road towards the sea and the small assortment of boats there rutledge had a basket over his arm courtesy of the three bells and a generous bribe to the cook rachel said after a moment youve more foresight than i have i was so glad of the invitation to sail i didnt think of food or is that a mans thing peter was remarkably good at foraging he said hed learned it young rutledge laughed he was always hungry at school i never knew anyone so good at scrounging his mother sent him generous boxestins of canned goods and packages of cakes and biscuits the scottish shortbreads usually lasted the longest i remember they sometimes took the taste of the woolens in his trunk but we never minded that when they were finished we were desolate until hed convinced some other boy to share hidden rations they had reached the overturned boats on a small shingle strand that was just above the reach of the tides thats the belle she said pointing to a red dinghy that looked as if it could use a fresh coat of paint and perhaps more than a little caulking rutledge considered it dubiously are you sure it wont sink beneath us oh no she assured him its quite sound he just hasnt had it out much this summer his son fred didnt come back from the navy torpedoed in the north atlantic fishing hasnt been all that good anyway cornwalls going to have a bleak future economically trade gone and the pilchards as well everyone is complaining so were the hopeful gulls wheeling overhead between them rachel and rutledge dragged the belle down to the water and clambered in rachel watched him critically he grinned at her you dont trust me i see that it isnt a matter of trust but of selfpreservation ive still time to leap overboard if youre a rank amateur likely to do us a mischief but he knew what he was about and soon had the little boat out of the shelter of the rivers mouth and into open water the sea was smooth this morning wind ruffling it much farther out where whitecaps danced lightly but in the lee of the land it was easy to row as far as the small strand below the hall beyond to round the headland and then back to the strand again where they pulled the boat up and splashed ashore rachel turned to him her face aglow with something he couldnt read until she said i havent done that in ages its wonderful to be on the water again peter was a landsman he didnt know stem from stern but nicholas loved to sail to be out in all weathers to feel the tug of the sea under the hull and the fierce pull of the wind when he went off to war he had his heart set on the navy but they wouldnt have himno experience they said and so he wound up in flanders in the mud and the horror and the killingand the gas the glow faded and she turned to reach for the basket as rutledge made the boat fast to some rocks tell me about your cousin susannah mrs hargrove she straightened up and stared at him the basket in her arms is that why you brought me here she asked quietly to pick over my memories and then make your decision about returning tomorrow to london no he said curtly you mentioned the family not i she came to see me yesterday thats why i asked she looked away from him then set down the basket and began to climb the slight rise that led from the strand to the lawns he followed her at the top she stood looking across at the garden front of the house shes very much like stephen but a paler versionnot quite as handsome not quite as charming not quite as lively not quite as loved i think rosamund somehow loved him best because she saw in him her own immortality herself young again and ready to go on with life or perhaps he reminded her of richard i thought about that sometimes myself she loved olivia because she saw george in her and nicholas because he was soso very like his father in his appearance i mean inside nicholas had rosamunds strength rosamund never showed favorites at least not openly but in her heart of hearts who knows tell me about her husbands george was a wonderful man exciting and very masculine james was a fine man with depths and intelligence and a sense of humor and brian fitzhugh loved her so much she couldnt help but love him back but he was a weaker man she turned to look at him strain in her face does that answer you susannah said something about a mr chambers who was in love with rosamund and would have married her oh yes tom chambers was a very near thing and i think he could have brought her out of her loneliness and depression she was beginning to feel that too many of the people she loved had died that it was somehow because of her her fault i dont mean she told us that in so many wordswe sort of pieced it together among us which is why mr chambers mattered a new love a new lease on lifesoon shed be happy again and then one night she took a little too much laudanum to help her sleep and died before morning susannah is afraid that her mother deliberately killed herself but she wont accept that she turns away from it in fear rachel stared at him in surprise does she susannahs never spoken of that to me or to anyone else as far as i know are you sure i mean could it simply be the strange fancies of a woman expecting a child she was quite upset if its a fancy shell make herself ill before she delivers i think judging by what little i saw that shes terrified it might be true why rachel shook her head rosamund took too much joy in life to kill herself i find it hard to believe such a thing myself you said just now that she was depressed yes but were all depressed at some time or another we all go through dark periods when living seems to be harder than giving up have you never felt that death seemed a friend you could turn to gladly hamish answered her first bitterly not for me did it come in friendship id have lived if i could rutledge turned away afraid she might read hamishs response in his own eyes were talking about rosamund he answered lamely no rachel said firmly rosamund couldnt have killed herself nicholas would have known nicholas would have told me without waiting for rutledge to respond rachel added with false briskness do you mind while im here i ought to see if wilkins kept his promise to water the urns on the terrace he sometimes forgets she set off towards the house a deprecating glance apologizing to him for not suggesting that he come with her but she needed time on her own to try to recover some of the promise of the morning shed already dealt withor tried to deal withenough grief as it was she couldnt bear to think of rosamund as a suicide not the woman whod been the very symbol of serenity of brightness and vitality not the woman whod been such a strong influence in her own childhood it was impossiblea contradiction but she hadnt been able to comprehend nicholas choosing his own way out of whatever it was haunting him either shed finally asked for scotland yards help because she couldnt tolerate the uncertainty the doubt and now this man from london was making things worse not better talking about murder questioning the very bedrock of the hall the woman whod been its soul its center shed approached henry ashford out of personal desperation and theyd sent her a man who didnt care about nicholaswho felt nothing for rosamund or even olivia he was dredging up more pain more hurt more doubtdredging up all the things shed much rather forget forever he wasnt here to answer her need he was too busy with his own londons and shed never expected that to happen while she still walked in the terrible darkness of nicholass death she could feel herself hating rutledge blaming him it was wrong of course and she could tell herself that as many times as she liked but deep inside she found herself wanting to lash out to hurt him as hed hurt her for planting seeds that might grow hamish was scolding him for upsetting rachel but rutledge himself was glad enough for a brief space to think he turned and walked up the lawns towards the headland mind busy with the complexities of this case that wasnt a case and with rachel who had loved nicholas cheney whether she believed that or not the wind came bounding over the cliff face ruffling his hair and tugging at his trouser legs as he moved higher along the grassy edge that rose at a fairly steep angle the closer he came to the top below him the sea rhythmically threw itself at the rocky face whispered softly and then came back for another try farther out there was a fishing boat moving slowly across the water trailed by a half a dozen gulls he could hear their cries echoing against the headland turning he looked back at the house it rose above the colorful gardens with comfortable grace first to a lawn that was reached by a broad flight of italianate stone steps and then by way of another flight to the terrace enfolded by the two short wings that looked down on it rachel was moving about there now where great stone urns spilled over with flowers trailing blossoms and vines like bridal bouquets it was a peaceful setting not grand but beautiful he turned again this time to look towards the village half hidden behind the copse that separated it from the grounds of the hall past the church tower he could just see the upper floor of the rectory its windows dark blue squares in the sun why had the rector been stirring at such a late hour of the night much less looking out his windows and could he see the hall from there could he have caught the movement of a candle in the study on the upper floor an interesting pair of questions something had brought the man out of his bed and into the dark woods in such haste that hed not stopped to pull on his trousers or a coat hed simply thrown a blanket around his nightclothes and taken a poker from the hearth a poker for a living threat not a dead one rutledge crested the headland and moved a few yards down the far side looking towards a meadow that he thought might well have been a walled orchard once the land still rough and hummocky where the trees had been cut down but the roots and stumps left for the grass to swallow with time yes now he could see the faint line of foundation that marked where a wall had run it was here then that olivias twin sister had died out of sight of the house the stables and the gardens behind a wall of brick and leaves hamish was insistently calling his attention to something and he glanced down at his feet there was what looked like a large scorched patch of earth as if someone had burned something here not recently not within the past few weeks the grass was already growing greenly through the blackened stubs and the fine ash was like a film on the ground evenly spread about no chunks no remnants of anything identifiable scuffing the surface with his shoe rutledge thought it might have been paper rather than wood or rags that had fueled the fire it had burned so thoroughly or else whatever was not consumed had been taken away he knelt looking more closely his fingers probing and found something caught in one of the clumps of grass just outside the circle it looked like a bit of faded ribbon blue perhaps or pale green it was hard to say after days of wind and sun and rain draining it of most of its color and closer in there was a thick edge of harder stuff that might once have been heavy leather like the end of a belt casting around for anything else he discovered a small decorative silver corner thin and blackened but still possessing a fine tracery of celtic design from a picture frame a book a locket odd things to have cast into a fire still squatting in the grass he realized that he was just able to see the roof of the hall but there was not even a glimpse of the village except for the battlemented top of the church tower in the other direction fields and woods at his back the sea whoever had worked here knew heor shewas out of sight of watchful eyes if you lived at the hall and wanted to burn something he thought to himself why not in the grate or the stove in the kitchen or in the basket in the kitchen garden where trash was usually sent to be incinerated to come out here on the headland and build a fire with the wind clawing up over the cliff must have been a damned nuisance trying to keep the flames from leaping out of control to keep bits of paper or cloth from blowing every which way in a flurry of sparks trying to prevent your eyebrows and fingers from being scorched as you worked over the blaze feeding it then pouring water over the lot to make sure it was dead before leaving it unless unless you had something to burn that you didnt want anyone else to see or find the remnants of in the ashes of the hearth or smell in the passages of the house smoke hanging heavily like a confession to come out here in the daylight or the darkness where the smoke and the smell and any remnants that the fire might accidentally leave wouldnt be noticed or rouse suspicion indicated a need for privacyor secretiveness he stood up wondering who had used this patch of ground rachel was coming towards him just closing the last garden gate and he hurried to meet her not wanting her to see the burned spot hungry he called when she stopped to wait for him starved she answered fetching up a smile it was almost natural what were you looking at so intently i called and you didnt hear me did you it was lost in the wind i was wondering if that meadow over there might have been an old orchard yes actually it was she didnt pursue that train of thought but said instead its sad to think of the hall being sold of strangers living here i thought you were in agreement about selling the house that only stephen held out against it oh i think it should be sold theres nothing left here now of what we loved as children and trying to keep it alive artificially as a museum would be much worse than strangers moving in i mourn the past thats all she looked over her shoulder as they walked down the headland towards the beach again as if hoping the house itself would tell her she was wrong after a moment she added more to herself than to him i expect the best course after all is for cormac to buy it which keeps the hall in the family in a roundabout way and well none of us feel guilty about choosing strangers over olivia although it seems selfish to make poor cormac the familys sacrificial lamb she smiled ruefully have you ever noticed how many times feeling guilty shapes human decisions rather than love or pity or avarice or whatever else one might have felt instead a wretched way of getting through life isnt it he grinned down at her in my work feelings of guilt can be usefulsometimes even solve the crime for me but there had been other times he could have told her when remorse and guilt never entered into the picture a killer caught by some tiny mistake he made not because of any human emotion driving him careful elusive cold rutledge found himself thinking that this new ripper wouldnt be such a man he was lashed by such savage desires he could tear flesh like paper and hed grow more and more careless as the fires consumed him as well as his victims the picnic basket was bountiful pasties wrapped in napkins beer for him a thermos of tea for rachel an assortment of biscuits in a small tin and a packet of cheese with a fresh loaf of bread there were plums in the bottom in another napkin they did it justice although rutledge was preoccupied and rachel found herself making selfconscious small talk sticking with topics that couldnt lead herand the inspector back to the hall or its inhabitants discussing her interest in roman ruins in england was easier then she found herself wondering aloud why hed chosen police work when he might have gone into the law like his father i remember my father talking about briefs a barrister defended the accused he said and a kc defended the law and if the victim was alive he might present his evidence about the robbery the assault the trespass but if he was dead he was the primary cause of the case and had no role in it except as proof that a crime had been committed he grinned at her that seemed very unjust to a small boy burning with a sense of right and wrong that was entirely his own i felt the victim should be heard that his voice as well as his lifed been taken from him i believed that the truth mattered that protecting the innocent mattered it seemed to me the police must be concerned about that if the courts were not but that wasnt true either why not because he said looking away as i learned soon enough the primary task of the police isnt to prove innocence its to prove guilt something in his voice at the end warned her not to pursue the subject she glanced up and saw cormac fitzhugh coming towards them across the lawns she said quickly beginning to gather up the lunch things and put them back into the basket are you leaving for london in the morning no he answered not yet ive a few more loose ends to clear up before im satisfied but i promise ill tell you when im finished here thats fair enough she answered and stood up brushing the sand from her trousers by the time cormac had reached them she was already walking away along the strand towards the headland cormac called a greeting and looking at the boat on the shingle said as he reached rutledge i see you talked the landlord out of his boat for the day i wish id thought about that myself then his eyes following rachel where she was already out of earshot he added ive been worried about her she took nicholas death hard following on the heels of peters rachel is too levelheaded to deny theyre gone but theres an emptiness she doesnt quite know how to fill lately shes even avoided me and susannah as if the living remind her too much of the dead he shook his head i know how that is i bury myself in my work and let the days run into each other you arent staying at the hall id asked mrs trepol to make up a bed he said wryly then couldnt face the silence friends at pervelly are putting me up is that where mrs hargrove and her husband are visiting cormac turned back to rutledge surprise in his face is susannah down here daniel swore he wasnt letting her leave london again until she delivered but shes always been more strongminded than she looks if she wants something he cant stand in her way for very long shes probably staying with the beatons she was in school with jenny beaton jenny throckmorton she was then your sister didnt want to hear of the investigations being reopened either she said there was enough disgrace in a double suicide she didnt want her child born into a family where murder was suspected cormac grinned pregnant women are often edgy im told youve never married he walked away his back to rutledge and picked up a stone to skip over the incoming waves no he said finally i havent married like rachel i have scars that havent healed hamish rumbled uneasily and rutledge tried to ignore him he said i havent found any evidence of a crime being committed here but id like to know why nicholas cheney died to understand why he amended i cant quite accept your suggestion that olivia didnt want to die alone cormac came back to where rutledge was standing the whisper of the water running in was louder as the tide turned god knows he said tiredly it might have had something to do with her poetry or what nicholas knew about her about her life or what she thought he might do afterward after shed gone or it might have been sheer bloodymindedness if she wanted her secrets kept why leave her literary papers to stephen and surely you knew nearly as much about her history as nicholas did possibly more killing him didnt seal her secrets in the grave ah but she knew i was making a name for myself in london that id go to any lengths to avoid scandal that might hurt my reputation in the city it wasnt very likely was it that id be eager to rattle any family skeletons theres a passage in one of her poems about secret histories kept to the grave last defense of master and slave gainst the final onslaught of heaven and hell a resurrection where the soul will tell what the tongue and the mind in dreadful fear had hoped against hope that none might hear he shrugged the transfer of thousands of pounds is made on my handshake the agreement to contracts and the trust of banks and investors im as good as my word and people depend on that i had more to lose in telling than she did she could have ruined me more easily than i could ever have ruined her but you might have ruined o a manning did she really care about o a manning she cut that part of her life short as well unless shed said what it was she wanted to say and knew it was safe forever printed into lines on paper that no one could take it from her cormac studied rutledges face do you mean a confession of sorts i dont know the poems that well i couldnt begin to guess what she intended in writing them i really dont believe that she herself knew what they wereonly a force that had to find expression regardless of the hand and mind that created it olivia was the most complex person ive ever known rachel had reached the headland where rocky outcrops blocked her way and the sea sent spray flying in the sunlight she stopped hesitating looking back at them a small frail figure against the massive land mass and the vastness of the sea after a moment she turned and started towards them again she moved with grace her hair flying in the wind her strides long and sure from here she might be jean hamish said softly watching her rutledge said i still think nicholas death is the key i could believe the rest of what youve told me if i was satisfied there cormac said then youll have to go to the grave for your answers i dont have any to give you could it be connected with the house in some way if shed died and nicholas cheney had lived he would have inherited the hall and i dont believe from what little i know of him that hed have sold it surprised cormacs fair brows snapped together he said slowly then why not simply change her willcut him out of it the hall was hers to do with as she pleased why not leave it to stephen he claimed to be her favorite and i think there might be some truth to that stephen would have kept the hall too as a memorial not as his home theres a difference i suppose rutledge shook his head whatever it is ill get to the bottom of it well do me the courtesy of telling me what to expect cormac said when youve made up your mind i dont want scandalous headlines in the morning paper staring back at me over my breakfast if i can rutledge said but it wasnt the same promise hed given rachel after a moment cormac said ive got to be on my way tell rachel im sorry i missed her his eyes crinkled at the corners in a smile but warn her im not ready to leave cornwall yet he walked off moving swiftly and gracefully towards the house rutledge wondered whether he would buy it as hed thought about doingor if the bitter memories here outweighed the sweet even for him cormac whether he liked it or not was still under olivia marlowes spell just as rachel was under nicholas cheneys she reached him looking after cormac and saying he doesnt look very happy what surprises did you spring on him i didnt know that there were any surprises he countered rachel turned her attention back to rutledge does it ever bother youas a man i meanwhen the policeman in you has to break into a persons peace and destroy it do you ever have qualms of consciencenightmares hamish answering for him said aye theres nightmares but no the kind the lassie could bear seeing rutledges face respond to what she thought was her own challenge she didnt wait for him to answer and said instead well i suppose a conscience can grow accustomed to many things when it has to when hed seen rachel back to borcombe settled the boat where hed found it and returned the picnic basket to the inn rutledge went in search of mrs trepol housekeeper and cook she was working in her garden her hair tied up in a kerchief and an apron over her dress as he paused at the gate that separated her walk from the road she looked up her eyebrows twitched and she said i knew youd come here before very long when i saw you with miss rachel awhile ago inspector rutledge id like to talk to you about the deaths at the hall he opened the small iron gate set into the stone wall its my christian duty to answer you but thinking about it bothers my sleep i try not to she set the small trowel in the trug beside her and pulled off the old pair of mens gloves she wore to protect her hands would you care for a cup of tea then following her into the dimness of the house he saw that there was a cat in the chair hed chosen to sit in and moved instead to the long window overlooking the front garden she unceremoniously dumped the torn out of the chair and dusted it with her apron he knows better she said but its his favorite place ill be just a minute sit down please sir he did and the torn stared balefully at him from sleepnarrowed eyes the room was small with more furniture than it could comfortably hold but clean of dust silverplate picture frames of people he didnt recognize covered one table beside small seaside souvenirs from truro and penzance a plate holding pride of place commemorated the coronation of edward vii and a smaller one marked that of george v and queen mary a cutting from a magazine a photograph of the prince of wales in his gaiter robes had been framed and hung over the couch this could be the parlor of any cottage in the west of england rutledge thought feeling the quiet peace of it or in scotland hamish said with a sense of loss in his voice there was my sisters wedding flowers under a glass bell and the souvenirs were from bannockburn and edinburgh not the seaside a photograph of me in my uniform with fiona at my side mrs trepol came in with a tray bearing cups and a teapot a small dish of cakes to one side she set it on the tea table in front of the cold hearth and poured a cup for him that done she sighed as if shed put off interrogation as long as good manners allowed straightening her back she turned handed him the cup and said i told the police when it happened yes i know and your statement was very clear he assured her but im here merely to satisfy the yard that the deaths were investigatederproperly nodding she said aye well the family was well thought of im sure everything that could be done was it was a shock to me i can tell you walking into that house on my day off and not finding mr nicholas aboutbut sometimes miss olivia had a bad night and hed sit with her until the worst passed after miss rosamund died mrs fitzhugh she was then and the staff was reduced he was the one dr penrith showed how to rub miss olivias limbs and her back to help the pain well there was no entertaining only the family coming there from time to time and a full staff was wasteful but to end their lives like that i cant say how long it took me to get over my grief i felti felt i should have been there somehow she brought him milk and the small bowl of sugar then the cakes that you could have prevented it that youd have guessed what was in their minds there was no warning sir none just life going on in its ordinary way she told him earnestly but i thought if i hadnt been in such a hurry on the saturday to leave to run some errands id put off i might have noticed some little difference and mr smedley could have come out to the hall and spoken with them restored the balance of their minds there was pain in her voice a heavy sense of guilt as she quoted unconsciously from the inquest verdict suicide was still viewed as a crime against god mrs trepol sincerely felt a responsibility to save her employers souls if she couldas well as their earthly lives not out of zealousness but from affection she cared deeply but if you didnt notice anythingif their behavior was normalthen whatever caused them to take their lives must have occurred after you left what could have happened there were no visitors expected that i knew of and the post had come already id have heard if it brought bad news and look back on the day as i will there was nothing that changed in that house nothing to cause such anguish that theyd want to die people dont kill themselves without a reason he said preparing to ask the question he knew very well would hurt her more unless you think that miss marlowe was in such terrible pain that mr cheney gave her too much laudanum saw what hed done and then killed himself in grief she put her own cup down and stared at him mr nicholas would never have done such a terrible thing as give her too much oh no sir he was not the kind of man to make a mistake like that without answering her directly he shifted tactics there has been a good deal of sadness in the hall two children dying young miss rosamund losing her husbands before their time then mr cheney and miss marlowe and finally stephen fitzhugh as to that sir we all have our crosses to bear she said stiffly but sometimes theres a history of violence in a family and sometimes one person is at the root of it and who do you think stands at the root of this familys tragedies sir she asked bristling mr cormac who lives in london or miss susannah whos the last of the trevelyans theyre all thats left to do anybody a harm miss marlowe was an unusual woman she wrote poetry of a kind that few men can produce where did she learn so much of life i never asked her sir come to that i never knew until shed died that she was a writer of poems or anything else mr nicholas must have known he sat working on his ships in her study or went to find books she wanted in the library or talked to her long hours of the day and night id hear their voices quiet and steady as i moved about doing my cleaning i think shed have told him she told him most everything important to her except the name of the man she was in love with her mouth fell open and who was that likely to be i ask you she never had suitors coming to the hall and she went out so little no man was likely to stumble over her in plymouth or london and sweep her off her feet mr nicholas and mr stephen they were her brothers and old wilkins couldnt light a fire in a grate cormac fitzhugh wasnt her brother he wasnt related to her or to her mother a stepbrother by courtesy alone mrs trepol gave rutledge an odd look what makes you think miss marlowe was fond of mr cormac or he of her because she wrote of love in one of her books of poetry and no womanno man for that mattercould have written of love with such emotion if he or she had no knowledge of it mrs trepol laughed oh there was love enough in that house to write a dozen books of poetry miss rosamund loved her husbands and her children and her father with a deep and abiding feeling just living there as i did as a young housemaid you could wrap yourself in it and miss olivia she was very fond of mr stephen he could brighten her day just like his mother did mr nicholas used to tease her that shed spoil himmr stephenand miss olivia would say he was born to spoil and love some people are which told rutledge that mrs trepol had never read the wings of fire poems mr cormac fitzhugh used to live in the household miss marlowe might have loved him once but he never loved her sir id swear to that on a bible if i had to he was close to her in an odd way mr cormac was like he knew her better even than mr nicholas did but it wasnt love between them at least not on his part because cormac fitzhugh had recognized olivia marlowe for what she was a murderer do you think that miss marlowe was capable of killing anyone besides herself killing anyone miss marlowe id sooner believe my own husband god rest his soul could do such a thing whatever put such a nasty idea into your head not anyone in borcombe id trust my life to that the indignation in her voice was very real and youd be willing to swear in a court of law that no one in the hallnone of miss rosamunds familywas capable of murder she regarded him severely i dont know what they are getting up to in london she said tersely to send you down here with such questions as that to ask decent lawabiding folk but ill tell you straight out that if there was murder done in the hall on the night that miss olivia and mr nicholas died it was a cruel and godless person that did it and hes nobody weve ever seen in borcombe or want to see now if therere no more you want to ask me ive plants in my garden that still need to be watered back in his room at the three bells rutledge sat in the chair by the window with the books of o a mannings poetry in front of him but looking at the slim volumes he found himself thinking instead about the poet about the woman who had found such resources of understanding within her and yet who had killed herself because her strength somehow came to an end could a man or woman be so deeply aware of the mysteries of the human soul and yet be capable of such terrible crimes as the murder of children could she live with that knowledge of herself and still create such beauty was that finally why she had killed herself assuming that cormac fitzhugh had told rutledge the truth how did you write poetry how many words did you put on paper and how often did you throw them away because they didnt say what you heard in your spirit how many poems went wrong how many lines were flat and soulless how many were trite and tired and empty how many pages were crumpled up and tossed aside before a few unexpected words sang in your head while you responded with blood and bone how easy had it beenor how painfully arduous how tiring or overwhelming he thought about the opening lines to one of the love poems love comes on wings of fire that sear the heart with longing and a whitehot heat in its wake no peace remains only the scars of a terrible loss that mark the end of innocence how many times had she revised that until she was satisfied hed been inside the study where she had worked and died it was amazingly tidy where nicholas had been carving his fleet of ocean liners there were scraps and curls of wood the fineness of sawdust from sanding the small splashes of paint from finishing touches put to bow and portholes and the funnels he hadnt put them away swept and dusted before swallowing the laudanum it was as if hed expected to come back to them tomorrow but where the poet worked there was only the shawlcovered typewriter no balled up sheets of paper no pen or pencil lying where shed scribbled a line to think about it or tried a rhyme and found it weak she had known she wasnt going to sit there ever again and write shed prepared for her death his hand came down hard on the embossed leather cover hard enough to sting the flesh as he swore aloud inventively olivia marlowe had bequeathed o a manning all her papers and letters and contractsto her half brother stephen and stephen was dead where were these papers now and what was in them but neither rachel nor the rector could tell rutledge what had become of olivia marlowes papers ii think olivias will is still in probate and stephens as well rachel said i really wasnt interested in the papers i mean i was in the sense that they were important for a study of livias poems but not in any personal sense if youre asking me if there was box sitting in the middle of a room marked papers for stephen or something there wasnt i just assumedwell if shed left them to him he must have known where to look for them she was standing in the doorway of the cottage where she was staying and rutledge could hear someone moving about inside and then a bird singing from a cage it was a pretty place with vines swallowing the narrow little porch and hollyhocks leaning against the walls between the windows which firm is handling the wills chambers and westcott for olivia and for nicholas i dont know about stephen he had a friend in the city who was a solicitor it would be easy enough to find that out in london he thanked her and walked on to the rectory expecting smedley to be tending his garden but the grimfaced housekeeper announced that he was having a nap and she wasnt about to disturb him rutledge was just turning away when smedley came down the stairs into the hall his hair standing up in the back and his shirttail on one side hanging out of his trousers good afternoon inspector he said voice still thick with sleep give me two minutes and ill walk in the garden with you rutledge went around the back walked along the tidy rows of vegetables and flowers and was nearly to the small scummy pond that had once held fish before smedley stepped out the back door and came to join him his hair was combed and his shirt neatly tucked into his trousers his braces in place he cast a look at the sky and said it has been a beautiful day i hear you and rachel took a boat out rutledge smiled we did and lived to tell the tale though she had some doubts in the beginning who was the gossip it came by way of mrs hinson who had seen mr trask outside the inn on her way to morning service she then stopped to offer my housekeeper a small pot of the jam she made yesterday and i was given the news with my tea along with the jam what do the gossips of borcombe have to say about three deaths at the hall all in a matter of months much as youd expect the women felt that olivias writing must have turned her mind we arent used to famous poets in borcombe i think they believed somehow it was a proper judgment on her for writing about things best left unsaid and probably best left unfelt in a woman and the men smedley frowned as he stooped to pull a yellowed leaf off the nearest carrot the men are of two minds about olivia marlowe she was of course a trevelyan and theyre above the common lot in most eyes you forgive a trevelyan much that you might hold against the greengrocer or your neighbor across the road at the same time dying by her own hand was an admission that shed overstepped the bounds in a manner of speaking and finally became aware of it the universe you might say is now back in its stable orbit what about stephen fitzhugh and nicholas stephen was a sore loss half the village adored him every female under sixty and more than a few over that the other half the men admired him a good man to have on your side sense of humor knew how to lose as well as to win quite a reputation for courage in the war was wounded decorated sportsman successful in his business which was banking popular with the ladies yes he was admiredand sometimes envied thats natural nicholas was respectedrosamunds son the natural leader in village affairs the man you turned to when there was trouble pillar of strength not the sort youd expect to choose suicide the general belief was that he found olivia dead or dying and in the first shock of grief took his own life thats romantic nonsense but theyre more comfortable with it than with the truththat he might have wanted to die but this isnt why you came to see me i think i wanted to know what became of olivias papers the ones she left to stephen as her literary executor theyre probably still at the house stephen didnt want to sell he wanted to keep the hall as a memorial to his sister the others took a few personal things but he was dead set against removing much else and was prepared to fight a bitter battle to have his way have you looked in olivias room or her desk he read the expression on rutledges face no of course not well id start there its not likely is it that olivia sent them off to her solicitor hed have guessed something was wrong and she didnt want that besides we arent sure just how soon after she decided to put an end to her life she acted on that decision a day a month five years a few hours she had straightened up her desk nicholas hadnt cleared away his ships smedley looked at him thats proof of nothing of perhaps a state of mind youre saying that she knew where she was going what she was planning to do and nicholas didnt rutledge watched the light and shadows play on the upper windows of the rectory a birds flight reflected in them and the movement of the apple trees higher branches im saying that she was prepared he wasnt or it might be that her poetry was terribly important and his ships werent he could leave those in safety which brought rutledge back again to those literary papers he walked to the hall after dinner and stood looking up at the house in the golden shadows of the westering sun he could hear sea birds calling and somewhere a jackdaw singing lyrically in his minds eye ghosts of the people whod made the hall a home stirred and moved about the lawns laughing and talking and bringing life to the scene to the emptiness someone said behind him theyve not left he turned to find the old woman and remembered her name this time rachel had called her sadie no he said then playing her game he asked which ones do you see is anne there anne was willful she must have her way or shed set the nursery on its ear they said it was a childs tantrums but the tree grows as the twig is bent and if her father had lived that would have been different instead the women spoiled her and let her do as she pleased and she wanted to hold tight to everyones affection even the old masters mr trevelyan miss rosamunds father that was sometimes shed put off her stormy ways and sit quiet with a book in her lap and hed come into the room and mistake her for her sister there was no telling them apart unless miss anne was being her naughty self or shed tell tales on the others and once got master cormac a hiding for beating a horse and him never one to abuse the animals master nicholas now he stood up to her once and refused to let her have the little soldiers hed been given for his birthday but she found them later and buried them out in the garden and he never did discover where they were she died soon after her words made rutledges blood run cold here was a reason for olivia to have killed her sister a childs excuse for murder he found he didnt want to know about anne why did richard die out on the moors theres none sure he did twas no body ever found miss olivia said they fell asleep in the sunshine and he was gone when she opened her eyes she thought mayhap hed wandered off to find the moor ponies he were a restless child with the energy of two and a devil in his eyes miss rosamund called him her little soldier and said he was born to wear a uniform like her first husband and nicholas ah he was one who always knew more than he said kept himself to himself and you never guessed at what rivers ran inside him or how deep bookish some thought but if you want to know my mind on that he was waiting with a dreadful patience to grow up as if there was something waiting for him if there was we never knew of it he was content to stay by miss olivia and keep her spirits high when the pain was hard but if you looked into his eyes when he stared out at the sea you knew there was a roamer inside him not like master richard but a man who saw distant places in his soul how did you come to know the trevelyan family so intimately there was roguish laughter in her eyes as she stared back at him giving a bawdy twist to his words even the mighty use bedpans like ordinary mortals she told him i nursed the living when needful and laid out the dead dr penrith sent for me when miss olivia had the crippling disease and was like to die he didnt trust the london nurses they wanted she seemed today to be clearminded and aware of what she was saying testing it he repeated you laid out the dead a wariness moved behind her eyes though her expression didnt change he took a chance and asked her was there a killer in that house but her eyes clouded as he watched her lined face and she said i told you there were a gabriel hound in that house and youd hear him running some nights before something bad happened running through the rooms in the dark looking for his soul on those nights the wind howled in the trees and rattled the windows and i kept the coverlet over my head miss olivia warned me once when i spoke to her of it and i knew to heed her id die too if i told what i heard or saw which is why ive outlived them all but two and miss susannahs safe enough in london what about cormac fitzhugh hes not a trevelyan is he she asked theres no gabriel hound wants anything he has she walked off before he could ask her what had brought her to the hall on this particular evening or what she knew of a fire built out on the headland but her mind was already slipping away again and he wasnt sure hed have gotten a straight answer anyway still he listened again to what shed said miss olivia warned me once when i spoke to her of it and i knew to heed her id die too if i told what i heard or saw miss olivia he went on his way taking his time and approaching the house as if hed come as a guest and not an intruder where would olivia have left her papers not in the hallway where anyone might stumble over them that was true enough but would she have hidden them or simply put them where stephen would think to look he unlocked the door and went inside someone had left the drapes open cormac the suns warmth had flooded the hall along with its light and there was a brightness here that somehow made him think of rosamund there doesna need to be anything howling from the attics to haunt a house hamish reminded him suddenly no rutledge answered aloud agreeing with him but this brightness will fade with the dusk what else is here he went up the stairs to the study and stood in its doorway again eyes roving the walls and furnishings there was no place of easy concealment here not without moving rows of booksor nicholas shipsand then shifting heavy shelves and nicholas shared this room after all he shut the door and made his way down the gallery to olivias bedroom glancing briefly at the plan constable dawlish had drawn up for him although he knew very well which door to open he stood on the threshold for a moment then crossed to open the drapes allowing the setting sun to wash into the dimness as he did he caught again that elusive perfume that hed smelled when the shawl slipped off the typewriter and it was stronger when he opened olivias closet door and looked at the clothing hanging on both sides of the deep recess skirts dresses dinner gowns robes coats shawls in neat and orderly rows coats first night robes last hatboxes stood in the back on shelves next to half a dozen handbags several umbrellas hung on hooks to one side and a cane with a heavily wrought silver head beneath the clothing were two rows of shoes the right of each pair with a small metal tab like a stirrup under the instep and straps at each end for the brace she wore without touching them he surveyed the clothes she liked colors rose and a particular shade of dark blue and a deep forest green as well as crimson and winter black summer white and pastels tailored clothes evening dresses very stylish but never fussy his sister frances would have approved of them would have pronounced olivia marlowe a woman of quiet good taste just as the rector had said but was there another side of her and where did it reside the closet had been built into what had in the past been a small dressing room he walked into it towards the shelves at the back brushing against the clothing and that perfume whirled out around him almost in angry protest at his invasion of her privacy where had she found such an expressive scent it touched the senses lingered in the memory confused the image he tried over and over again to draw elusive as she wasand more alive he began methodically to open each hatbox starting at the top and from some of them the heavy odor of cedar shavings wafted up to him displacing olivias perfume sweaters in a range of colors woolen stockings and scarves and gloves leather belts and leather gloves italian made and very supple a fur hat with upswept brim and a dashing style frances would have adored itand looked stunning in it nothing else he had carefully stacked the boxes on the floor now he pulled out the thick wooden shelves beginning with the top shelf looking to see if any of the panels in the wall behind it were loose or even hinged if olivia had kept her writing a secret for so many years it meant she knew how to guard her privacy from servants as well as family if there was no space for storing personal papers in the study where she worked she would most certainly have considered her bedroom next as a repository and this wide closet which no one but a maid had any excuse to enter was rutledges first choice the closet was too dark for him to be sure that the end panels couldnt be opened somehow and he had to remove the middle and then the bottom shelf to run his hands over the wall nothing he retrieved the bottom shelf to settle it back on the brackets that held it and instead clipped the edge on the lefthand bracket part of the shelf broke off and then something else tumbled down ringing merrily as it bounced twice on the hard wood of the floor a key he got down on one knee to search for it running his hand back and forth across the wood and there was nothing frustrated he moved back to the front of the closet and started again it took him nearly five minutes to find it where it had landed in a shoe a small locket gold the sort of thing little girls often wore he took it over to the window where the light was better there were entwined initials on the outer face of the locket and he made them outmam margaret anne marlowe his fingers found the delicate catch and he opened the frame to two tiny portraits inside they were in oil lovely little miniatures of a man and a woman after a moment he recognized them rosamund and her first husband captain george marlowe annes parents an exquisite gift to a child on her birthday or at christmas to be worn when she was dressed up with special care how had it come to be hidden among olivias things or had olivia simply inherited it when her sister died and lost track of it over the years rutledge went back to the closet and brought the shelves out again then the boxes and the shoes on hands and knees then standing he searched every inch of the walls and the floor nothing except for the half inch sliver of wood that had been knocked off the bottom shelf by his clumsiness he picked up the shelf looking to see where the chip had come from and if he could put it back where it belonged it was the end of a longer strip of wood that had been set very carefully into the back edge of the heavy shelf with his penknife he gently pried that out of its slot and when he did another object tumbled out of the space hollowed out behind he picked up that and the shelf and carried them both to the windows the second object was a mans gold pipe cleaner smooth from long use but the initials engraved in it were still legible jsc james cheney nicholass father he set that on the sill beside the locket holding the shelf up to the light he looked into the carvedout hollow someone had stuffed cotton deep inside it and embedded within the soft fibers he could see bits and pieces of other articles the sun caught them in its brightness as if pointing to them he winkled them out slowly and gently first came a small boys cuff buttons heavy gold and again with initials engraved on them rhc richard cheney behind them was a lovely little signet ring that looked as if it had been crafted for a child and carved deeply into the face of the ring was a coat of arms inside engraved in the band itself were the initials remt rosamund trevelyan a gold crucifix came out easily finely wrought with the figure a little worn from the letters on the reverse it had belonged to brian fitzhugh finally at the very back a watch fob in the shape of a small boat with the initials nmc nicholas the sunlight flashed across the raised sail as rutledge laid it with the others he had spread out on the wooden windowsill and in spite of the warmth that poured through the glass panes he felt cold he knew exactly what these were he had seen dozens of collections like them in the trenches in france a button from the greatcoat of a german officer goggles from a downed airman stripes from the sleeves of corporals and sergeants collar tabs from officers a battered prussian helmet a pistol taken from a corpse an empty ammo belt from a machine gunners nest whatever a man fancied when his mind stubbornly refused to frame the words hamish did it for him trophies of the dead he said softly small golden treasures very personal and surely very precious that marked each of olivia marlowes unwitting victims charles todd wings of fire rutledge forced himself to walk away from the things hed found and instead to go through the motions required of him he began with the olive wood desk on its graceful delicate legs in the several drawers he found stationery in various sizes engraved and matching envelopes bottles of ink scissors a box of visiting cards with rosamunds name on them a book of accounts for shops in london and in borcombe a leather notebook with stamps and addressesnone of them of special interestand the usual clutter of pens and pencils the only truly personal item was a wooden pen holder hand carved in the shape of a monster fish the kind drawn on ancient maps at the edge of the known world where they waited to swallow unwary ships on the bottom following the curve of a tiny scale he found the initials nmcoam from nicholas to olivia or to o a manning the bottom drawer on the left side was empty the dressing table the tall chest the bureau and the bedside table yielded more personal things perfume and cosmetics combs and brushes odds and ends of jewelry filmy lingerie silk scarves and stockings lacy handkerchiefs and a prayer book candles and matches nothing out of the ordinary in any way though sometimes intimate and daunting he knew from what rachel had told him that the family had already taken away the things that made a room personal and individualpictures and photographs and possessions with a particular value that wouldnt be put up for sale with the house but perhaps out of respect for stephens insistence much of olivias life still survived in this room yet olivia had been careful to leave nothing behind for either the police or her biographers that could be construed or misconstruedinto the woman whod lived in this room the items buried deep in the closet must have been there a very long time and if no one had found them before now the chances were that no one might have discovered them for years to come when they would have no meaning to strangers living here he went back to the window and picked up each article one at a time six victims if these were indeed trophies olivias sister anne her stepfather james cheney her half brother richard cheney her stepfather brian fitzhugh her own mother rosamund trevelyan and the man whod spent his life in her service nicholas cheney shed been so sure of him then so sure that he would die with her or that she could send him into the darkness before her gentle god rutledge whispered softly and after a moment he found himself silently cursing chief superintendent bowles for sending him here drawing the drapes again and closing the door firmly behind him rutledge went down the passage his mind still working with a policemans precision his thoughts far from where his feet carried him the tiny betraying trophies had been safely returned to their hiding place out of sight but not out of his thoughts burned with molten brightness into his very brain in stephens room was the comfortable chaos of living there was a cricket bat in the corner a pair of riding boots by the closet door suits and shirts and jackets hung haphazardly on the rod inside books on the table under the windowthey were mostly about golf and tennis ireland and horsesand ivory inlaid cuff links in the dish on the dressing table with a fish hook and a length of gut from a tennis racket beside them but no boxes no folders of personal papers no literary failures or private letters or contracts what stephen kept here was the detritus of boyhood and the things one left in a country house visited fairly often in the interim between her death and his stephen might well have taken olivias papers to his bank for safekeeping but rutledge went through the drawers again found a routine letter from stephens bank manager and copied the address in his notebook as he was about to close the curtains hamish said when i was a laddie ma was a fierce one with broom and rag nothing safe from her eyes when the fit to clean was on her id hide what cherished in the shed behind the straw or above the rafters in the loft after pa died she wasna as tall as my pa rutledge stopped listening to what hamish said stephen was a child from a large family nosy sisters and prying brothers he might well have had a secret place of his own but not in this room he rutledge had been damned thorough or had he he glanced around the room again hed even had up the carpet looked inside the grate under the bed he knelt again by the bed nothing only a thin coating of dust sifting down gently since mrs trepols last visit the frame the slats that held the springs above that the mattress sagging a little in the center the bedclothes the slats what could you hide on a slat a key perhaps he went under the bed on his back mindful of his coat and careful not to scrape his head on the springs as he used his arms on the side boards to propel himself claustrophobia caught at him and he had to shut his eyes against the wave of terror that ran through him he coughed hard the dry dust sucked into his drier throat the springs were all but pressing into his face not as high as hed first thought with eyes still shut tight he forced his breathing back to a normal rhythm what you dont see cant fall in on you he told himself sternly after a moment searching with his memory rather than his eyes he ran shaking fingers over the nearest slat between the springs and the wood barking his knuckles and collecting fine splinters nothing but more dust there were five slats in all he felt for the others and began again moving his shoulders and hips across the floor until he could reach each slat nothing it was useless he might as well give up the last slat now only the slight rustle of sound warned him in time but the object still clipped his ear falling and he banged his head as he recoiled slithering swiftly out from under the frame again he turned and looked back the springs were a good fifteen inches above the floor not face high and a small book was lying spine upward in an inverted v on the floor he reached for it and managed to fish it out without going back under the bed again a prayer book pages thin as rice paper the tiny print old and ornately lettered the cover worn black leather the edges of the pages once gilded there was on the front cover an outline in raised leather and rutledge recognized it as the figure of st patrick staff lifted to cast out the snakes on the flyleaf inside in a spidery scrawl in fading ink he read presented to patrick samuel fitzhugh on his first communion june from his loving sister mary joseph claire fitzhugh not trevelyan or marlowe or cheney the fitzhughs had been irish catholic the trevelyans and marlowes and cheneys church of england this had been hidden but not for reasons that had anything to do with murder as a boy had stephen had catholic leanings his family didnt know about rutledge thumbed through the fragile pages eyes scanning the printed lines in the back where the pages were blank someone had written out a family genealogy beginning with the parents of patrick samuel then his marriage and offspring the ink and writing changed over the next generations which followed in sad order so many of them died in the potato famine and the nightmare years afterward that it was more a litany of death than of life at the top of the last page rutledge found brian fitzhughs name and cormacs but neither stephen nor susannah were recorded here nor apparently any other secrets that mattered to an investigation into murder after a moment rutledge dropped the prayer book into the drawer of the table by the bed unwilling to go back under it then he changed his mind and put the book back where it had come from putting it back took less time than finding it in the first place and he did it holding his breath this time afterward he dusted off his trousers and jacket then closed the curtains at the windows the house was already too dark to do more than a cursory search elsewhere most of the other bedrooms had already been stripped of clothing closets and desks and chests empty drawers already smelling musty but rutledge mindful of the hollowed out shelf in olivias room checked each closet with infinite care there was nothing more to find nothing that told him where olivia had left her papersnot even whether they were still in the house susannah and her husband rachel and stephen with the help of cormac mrs trepol and the old woman sadie had spent days going through the house and cleaning room after room he wasnt surprised to find nothing out of the ordinary where they had worked he went back to study but the desk by the window was as sterile as the one in olivias bedroom it was a wild goose chasestephen must have removed any papers left to him yet rutledge had the feeling that a man hellbent and determined to preserve his half sisters fame as a poet would stubbornly resist taking them too far just as hed fought to keep olivias room inviolate to which hamish riposted what do you need the papers for when youve found yon golden trophies or are ye shutting out what they say the sun was a red ball on the horizon when rutledge walked out to the headland its warmth lingering in the light wind that preceded the stillness of sunset behind him the windows of the hall were ablaze and the weather vane on the church tower as well red sky at night he should have listened to hamish and gone back to london on saturday morning he should have told rachel this morning that there was no need to reopen the three deaths let sleeping murderers lie nownow he was committed the truth was something he had to uncover for his own peace of mind for the policeman in him who had to look at the good and the evil in human nature and live with its impact in his own soul what right had o a manning to survive unscathed the nightmares of olivia marlowe what right had she to be praised and revered as a creator of beauty if she had been a woman without mercy or compassion stephen fitzhugh had been left as olivias literary executor to decide which of her papers and her worksheets biographers and critics and readers might see and now through no fault of his own he was dead and neither rachel nor susannah seemed to be particularly interested in shouldering the responsibility cormac by his own admission was more likely to destroy any family skeletons than allow them to rattle the o a manning he might choose to show to the public would be olivia marlowes own public face a quiet recluse who knew very little about the real world and yet had a wondrous insight into the human heart a gift from god or the devil depending on your knowledge of her even if he rutledge drove back to london in the morning he would be the only person living who had proof that what cormac suspected could be true his burden to learn to live with not corrnacs not susannahs not rachels damn stephen fitzhugh for falling down those blasted stairs if he stayed in cornwall hed have to find a way to get to the bottom of a string of murders committed by a woman already dead but that was just the problem olivia marlowe had been buried it was o a manning who was still aliveand possibly had no right to be and when he rutledge found out the whole truth what in hell would he do about it deliberately destroy the author of wings of fire bring down the beauty and the genius along with the cruelty and the lies youve been executioner once hamish warned him and you no have forgotten it will ye choose to do it again then rutledge turned and walked back towards the house and the path to the village if i have to he said bitterly the next morning rutledge sent a carefully worded message to london background material sparse but enlightening no determination of crime possible at this time will take several more days if presence not required in city nothing to alarm bowies nothing to prevent rutledge from coming to any conclusion he chose and he had a feeling his superior would not be anxious to see him in london straight away the monday papers had been awash with news of another killing in the city bowles had been interviewed in depth about the yards pursuit of the murderer and talked fulsomely of modern forensic science and its role in tracking down the guilty party bowles leaned towards cold fact rather than intuition and a careful analysis of the killers reasons for acting now against this particular victim and in this particular place rutledge had found that scientists were not always the best witnesses in the box and as often as not a good man for the defense could walk rings around them he looked at his own cold facts that corrmac had seen olivia shove her sister out of an apple tree that olivia hadnt had the heart to dispose of her trophies of the dead even in the face of her own death that they were an admission of guilt in six possible murders not just the two that cormac laid at olivias doorindicating perhaps a cooler more cunning skill as the child grew older but these facts alone or together were not sufficient proof of guilt in a courtroom cormac was young at the time his own memory might have been at fault a good barrister might point out that olivia could have had those small articles in her possession for any number of reasons shed been given them shed taken them as a childhood prank shed won them in a wager in themselves without more evidence to lay out beside them they couldnt be viewed as the fruits of sin her papers might hold a confession however convoluted or concealed in verse but poets and writers were allowed literary license that too could prove to be more circumstantial than conclusive who then among the living might give him the proof he needed who would make a dependable incontrovertible witness in the box he set out to look for one constable dawlish finishing his breakfast in his wifes sunny kitchen came out to the parlor to listen and found rutledges line of questioning hard to follow so did hamish who was still contending that theyd both live to regret staying on in cornwall and was muttering ominously about rutledges own stubbornness youre asking about mr nicholas father dawlish asked and mr stephens father that was well before my time in uniform sir but james cheney shot himself in his own gun room and everyone knew hed been blaming himself for what happened to his son he took it hard and whos to say whether the revolver went off by accident or of a purpose death by misadventure was the coroners verdict and mrs cheney sick with grief thanked him for it are you thinking that she or one of the children might have shot him dawlish shook his head id as soon believe my own wife would take a gun to my head as mrs cheney you didnt know her sir and as for the children they werent old enough any of them to do such mischief besides no man in his right mind would have let a child so young handle a gun much less play about with a loaded one and brian fitzhughs death his horse threw him down by the sea and he hit his head drowned in the surf before anyone back at the house knew what had happened they had to put the horse down as well caught his leg in the rocks and damaged it badly mr cormac cried over it like a baby holding it in his arms until wilkins could fetch a pistol and do the job miss olivia stood there watching staring at mr cormac as if hed run mad but mr cormac hed trained that horse himself and it was the best threeyearold the stables had had in twelve years how do you know what cormac and olivia were doing the constables eyebrows rose in surprise why my father was a carpenter sir he was working in the stables at the time rebuilding the stalls where they kept the mares waiting to foal mrs cheney had another wing put on for that is your father still alive no sir he died in the first year of the war a dead end well then what was the story behind young richard s disappearance theres a dozen ways a boy could die out on the moors he wouldnt be the first lad to come to grief there nor the last if he died on the moors why was there no body found they looked sir they combed the rocks and the pools and the old mine shafts they probed the quicksand they put up flyers in all the towns around they talked to the folk who live by the moors and to the gypsies whod been camping near there in the month before my father was in one of the search parties and i went along with him it was thorough i want you to send men out again to search the same ground to draw me a map of where youve looked and what youve seen anythinga button a scrap of cloth a bone i want it all brought in and the spot marked on the map then ill check it again myself sir dawlish protested aghast these are farmers and fishermen hereabouts with a livelihood to earn have you any idea how many men itll take and what a waste of time and energy thatll be time and energy dont matter finding that boys body does and if after all our work theres none found then ill know for a certainty that it cant be found dawlish stared at the gaunt face the intelligent angry eyes humor the man from scotland yard hed been told what he wants let him have as long as he returns to london as soon as possible and with no cause to give a black eye to the local police in the matter of doing their duty with a sigh he glanced at the napkin in his hand then back to rutledge ill see that its done sir you can leave it to me but privately he was thinking that scotland yard would have been better served by putting their man onto finding that bloody killer in london instead of raising a stir in far off cornwall where there was no connection to any murders the morning sun quickly gave way to clouds and rain slow and steady that drove the inns keel players indoors to pass their time with skittles and long rambling stories that seemed to lead nowhere except to wrangling over trifling details for half an hour rutledge listened to them argue about which horse won the derby in because someone swore old mickelson had named his favorite dog after it even the innkeeper mr trask couldnt tell rutledge who mickelson was could be he were that actor a troop played in truro one winter and my father spoke highly of them one had a little dogd do tricks i doubt half of them remember either who mickelson might be though you could hang and quarter them before theyd admit to it waiting for someone are you sir in fact he was waiting for dr penrith though he didnt say so several women came in asking for him too but the retired doctor was not in his usual comer and it appeared he wouldnt be in the end rutledge walked down to dr hawkins surgery when mrs hawkins stuck her head out the door trying to keep the rain out of her hallway rutledge asked for her father instead of her husband surprised she said hes through by the fire sir his joints are bothering him fiercely in this wet will you come this way please she took him into the part of the house where the family lived and down a passage to a small room at the back the fire burned high a rush of warmth suffocating rutledge after his brisk walk through the rain the wool in his coat began to steam gently giving off a distinct odor of harris sheep mrs hawkins promised them tea shortly and left them dr penrith pleased to see anyone to till his empty hours profusely welcomed rutledge and insisted that he take a chair close by the hearth a small spaniel resting her nose on her masters foot stared at him myopically as he came across the room and thumped a tail on the hearth rug rutledge feeling like a man unfairly condemned to walk in flames for a time like the ghost of hamlets father commiserated with his host on the afflictions of age and then gently turned the conversation to the trevelyan family smiling dr penrith began to reminisce about adrian trevelyan with whom hed had a running battle over ancient cornish legends as well as the arthurian romances with a chuckle he added half the parish histories in englandve been written by parish priests and doctors but that old fool studied at winchester and cambridge and thought himself a scholar pshaw he wanted to track arthur back to the romans but hes a west country hero and nothing to do with the romans rutledge could hear the fondness in his voice and pictured the two men arguing over their port for the sheer joy of contradiction and controversy in lonely lives even the smallest battles gave great satisfaction lancelot came from france he pointed out shifting in his chair as his knees turned to burned toast hamish as always sensitive to rutledges moods grumbled about hellfire and damnation in the back of his mind aye and wasnt it just like a frenchman to get around guinevere thered been no whispers of such goingson until frogs took up the tales rutledge stifled a laugh and used the opening to change the direction of the conversation what were the whispers about the hall and adrian trevelyans beautiful daughter none the doctor turned to retort angrily like caesars wife rosamund was always above reproach what happened to richard trevelyan the old eyes clouded with pain who can say if the gypsies had taken him youd think hed have come home when he could get away but theres been no boy ringing the doorbell to claim hes richard and no man either would rosamund have believed them if they had come she was an intelligent woman she tried to believe hed been taken awayor run away and been lost then found and not returned it kept hope alive in her heart and she told james the boy would turn up wait and see that hed gone off to join the army and some farmer or carter would be bringing him back soon enough tired and hungry and miss olivia dr penrith frowned now there was an odd thing you know miss olivia never cried she went out with the searchers riding a pony because of her bad leg and was gone all that day and the next until i met her on one of the roads and sent her home ive never seen a child look so tired i thought shed made herself ill again but she stared at me then said richard wanted a tombstone with an angel on it he told me so i want to buy one just a small one to remember him by can you tell me how much it will cost how did you answer her rutledge asked intrigued that they dont put up tombstones until they have the body and she said quite seriously but thats not true there are markers in the churchyard for any man lost at sea she had a raging fever by the time they got her home and i heard no more about angels and tombstones rutledge found himself thinking of a poem in one of the earlier volumes it began they stood an angel in the churchyard for the man they lost at sea but for him i loved so dearly there was never place for me to come and mourn his passing touch the earth beneath my hand or bring him bloodred roses he tried to recall the last lines and failed but hamish the soft scottish burr clear in his voice provided them for him alas a frailer angel watches where you sleep with pansiesfor remembrance lying at your feet olivia herself had known where richard layfind him there and the case was made when tea was brought rutledge asked about james cheneys death and dr penrith shook his head sadly i couldnt tell rosamund how he died and at least hed had sense enough to put the barrel to his temple and not in his mouth for all the world to know what hed been about but who can say whether it was accidental or not whether the thought came to him suddenly and he hadnt the will to turn it aside one round was all he had put in the cylinder and he used it to end the pain that was my guess who was in the house that day they all were olivia nicholas rosamund and adrian of course fitzhugh was there hed brought over the new brood mares it was cormac came for me pleading for me to make haste to do something but it was useless i knew that as soon as i saw james body and you never thought of murder good god selfmurder is terrible enough and who would want to kill james he was a kind man a good man the house had seen enough grief already who could possibly want to add to rosamunds burdens theres no one alive that cruel agitated he spilled his tea and rutledge knelt to mop it up with his napkin his back to the scorching fire what did olivia have to say when she was told of james death i dont remember penrith said testily it was a long time ago and i was not concerned with olivia i was worried about rosamund and her father he never recovered his spirits after that you could see it clear the old eyes fading into a milky gray looked back into a past he didnt want to remember i walked behind their coffins he said sadly not because theyd been in my care not for adrians sake but because in that house i found something ive never felt since under any roof not even my own laughter was there and happiness and most of all a glory brian fitzhugh told me once that it was in the very stones of the hall that it had been handed down with the trevelyan blood and the trevelyan land thats romantic nonsense an irishmans blarney but i knew what it was i knew from the very first day i set eyes on her it was rosamund emotion had drained him he began to nod over his tea cup head sinking slowly until his chin rested on his cravat and rutledge gently removed the saucer from the gnarled fingers then with the wet napkin and the tray he slipped quietly out of the room and into theby comparisonfrigid passage mrs hawkins taking the tray from him said apologetically he slips off to sleep easier every day i wonder sometimes but she left the sentence unfinished and instead showed him to the door thank you for coming to cheer him a little she said i dont expect youll be in borcombe much longer but i know hed be glad to see you again before you leave did you know olivia marlowe very well he asked looking out at the rain coming down in sheets she was friendly enough whenever we ran into each other but no i wasnt likely to know her well she didnt go about much i was that surprised when they told me she wrote poetry but then she was an invalid wasnt she with time heavy on her hands nicholas was here sometimes in the evening to visit my father i always thought he might marry rachel a pink flush rose in her cheeks ive never known a man quite like himthere was an intensity about him aa force she began to search through the chinese stand beside the door and took out an old umbrella you can borrow this if you like otherwise youll sure to be calling on the doctor with a fever then in a rush as if she felt she had to finish what shed begun she said nicholas tried to protect olivia from everything he thought if he was there with her he could hold off the pain he could keep her from the darkness that beset her he tried so hard you could see it i could see it i meanand i thought when i heard how hed died that he was still afraid for her in death as if somehow he could save her from what came after rutledge splashed through the puddles on his way back to the inn heedless of where he put his feet or the dampness spreading through his socks wet feet had been the everpresent hell of the trenches it had cost more men than stephen fitzhugh their toes or part of a foot you learned somehow to shut it out until the smell told you that the rot had begun hamish was fuming at the back of his mind telling him something and he ignored the voice his mind on olivia marlowe if she knew where richard was buried then shed killed him and if she knew then it was a place that could be found the boy hadnt been taken by gypsies or thrown into quicksand hed been killed and hidden with pansiesfor remembrance had olivia meant that figuratively or literally it doesna matter what if she meant pansies to put near him flowers that wilted and were gone in a day who would see them who would guess what she was about the angel then a frailer angel herself somewhere that olivia with her brace could reach she could ride a pony that widened the circle hed been right to order the constable to search the moors again rutledge turned crossed over to the nearest shop in the small window fronting the road there was a collection of ribbons and laces behind a spill of colorful embroidery thread packets of needles and an array of handkerchiefs that reminded him of those hed seen in olivias room as he opened the door a gust of wind and rain nearly jerked the knob out of his hand startled a middleaged woman looked up from a cushion of bobbins and threads and a halffinished lace collar on her lap could i help you sir she asked trying hastily to get to her feet no sit down im too wet to come in i need directions thats all she sank back into her chair somehow preventing the bobbins from roiling to every point of the compass then he saw that like the belgian nuns hed come across during the war she had them pinned in place to where im looking for the man who did the gardening at the hall wilkins is his name oh youve come the wrong way sir hes down towards the river in a little house you cant miss theres a stone wall and a garden in front and beehives out back five minutes later his shoes squeaking with rain water rutledge was knocking on the door of a stone house half hidden under its slate roof wilkins came to answer the summons with his bedroom slippers on his feet he grinned at rutledge and said ive seen drowned men drier than you here wait till ive fetched some rags as rutledge furled his umbrella wilkins disappeared down the dark stoneflagged passage towards the back of the house and soon returned with a handful of old cloths rutledge dried his shoes as best he could and then followed the old man into his kitchen where something smelled suspiciously like rabbit stew in the pot simmering on the hearth i knew youd be along before the day was out they say youre nosing around the hall and the village looking for answers that london wants about the deaths at the hall aye im not surprised if you ask me inspector harvey is a fool and constable dawlish too full of himself to know the difference between his nose and his toes ive got some good ale in that jug over there fresh from the three bells and if youll hand it to me ill pour you a cup rutledge picked up the heavy stone jug and passed it to him wilkins filled two cups and sat down with a sigh of satisfaction i never thought mr brian was killed falling from his horse he was too good a rider born on a horse like as not and knew what he was about and you dont ride a valuable animal through seawet rocks not if youve got any sense with the risk of ruining his legs it were murder pure and simple that happened that dayto man and mount caught off balance rutledge stared at the old man did you say this to anyone at the time when brian fitzhugh died wilkins gave him a toothless grin lord and lose my job on the spot which i nearly did anyway when miss rosamund gave up the racing stables and come to that what was i to say to her or to the police he drank his ale belched with pleasure and shrugged his shoulders with almost gallic expressiveness but if you believed it was murder aye it were murder he said bluntly i were there when they raised the alarm running for all i was worth to see what were wrong and to look to the horse id saddled him for mr fitzhugh i knew which mount hed taken out tell me then mr fitzhugh was lying face down in the sea blood on his head and they found blood on one of the rocks just there where hed been thrown and then rolled into the surf but the horse were deeper among the rocks wildeyed and shaking a spur had raked one flank not the other id never known mr fitzhugh to use a spur on his horses and id never known lucifer to need more than the lightest rein he were that clever read your mind almost something happened that put the fear of god into him and he bolted but with an empty saddle if i know anything about it what makes you say that there were neither horse hair nor blood on mr fitzhughs spurs and if hed been throwed just there where he would hit his head on the rocks coming down then roll over his face into the water why was there water in his hoots when i pulled em off him sos they could carry him back to the house surely the police asked that same question aye and they answered it too that the sead come in with the tide soaking his trousers and his stockings there were no footprints on the shingle but ours and master nicholas coming up from his boat no signs of a struggle or trouble of any kind and the doctor he said mr fitzhugh had drowned before hed regained his wits from the fall he finished his ale then went to stir the stew squinting in the heat of the fire rutledge bent down untied his shoes and looked at his stockings they were wet with rain the shoes themselves were pliable with rain water but when he upended them water didnt run out the stockings and the lining had absorbed it interesting point he told himself as he laced them again and no one else raised objections about the horse mr cormac did he said his father wouldnt have taken lucifer among the rocks not without good reason wilkins came back to sit down at the table refilling his cup and offering more to rutledge who shook his head we found a bee caught under the girth he said where itd stung the horse and that satisfied the lot of them but i walked back down there later and had a look around before the stir mind you master nicholasd drawn his boat up on shore just a few yards away and turned it over planning to come back and work on the seams well i looked under it and i found the print of mr brians riding boot next to the print of another shoe but the tide had half erased that he were on foot then talking to someone he werent alone down there on the shingle not the whole time he might have been there when nicholas cheney brought the boat in and helped drag it above the tide line then why didnt master nicholas say so all right who would have wanted to kill fitzhugh wilkins sighed that were the problem you see not miss rosamundsiie were mrs fitzhugh shed not be likely to send him off the twins now they were little uns and youd not see them on the strand or near the headland or in the stables without their nanny in tow miss olivia were a cripple mr fitzhugh were mr cormacs own father none of the servants that i knew of had any quarrel with him mr fitzhugh had a temper mind you but he were fair and no one held any grudge that id heard about and that left master nicholas whose boat it was why would he want to harm his stepfather it made no sense to me so i held my tongue and waited to see what happened and when naught did i kept on holding of it nicholas might have no reason to kill his stepfather but he might well have covered up for olivia if hed had any fear that she was involved with the brace on her leg could she have moved around among the rocks he asked that question aloud wilkins thought about it she werent one to plead helplessness id see her struggle to do what she wanted to do aye she could get over them rocks spider fashion pulling her leg along slowlike and careful but where she had the will she got her way remembering what constable dawlish had said rutledge asked you put the horse down didnt you was she there watching aye it were left to me and a hard job it were loved that horse i did mr cormac were there his head buried in the horses neck and crying miss olivia came with dawlish who were only a boy then and said theres no saving him not even if he never races again must we put him down and i said the smith looked at that foreleg miss and he said twere shattered there were no way to mend it sos itd take his weight fleet as he were i couldnt watch him live out his days a cripple struggling over every step though i didnt say that to her face her being a cripple herself he looked into his cup and swished the ale thoughtfully she stayed till it were done not a bit squeamish as youd think in a young lady like her afterward she told mr cormac if he cared so much for lucifer he could help dig the hole to bury him in and we did it out on the headland mr cormac and a few of the lads and me rutledge walked back to the inn as the church clock struck twelve the rain had turned into a misty drizzle again and the street was no longer a river under his feet more people were about now men and women a few of them nodding to him in recognition mrs trepol hurrying past wished him a good day and in the distance he glimpsed rachel moving head down towards the woods that separated the village from the hall hamish rumbling with suppressed irritation kept rutledge from concentrating his thoughts on the mornings work or was it his own reluctance at the inn mr trask took his umbrella and greeted him with the news that he had a visitor waiting in the parlor rutledge went through into a long narrow room with a ceiling so low it seemed to brush his head in the wave of claustrophobia that followed he saw only the dark furnishings the empty grate and a tall man with white hair who rose from a chair and stood where he was waiting for rutledge to speak after a moment he managed to say im rutledge im afraid i dont know who you are the man looked him over then said chambers thomas chambers i represent the trevelyan family rutledge had him pegged this was the lawyer who had courted rosamund and almost won her the family solicitor handling the wills regarding him with new interest he crossed the room to light the lamps on the chimney piece their glow added to the one lamp already burning on the table pushed back the darkness and the cavelike atmosphere of the room breathing more easily he could concentrate on what chambers was saying and i understand that youve come down to reconsider the circumstances of their deaths id like to know why rutledge stood with his back to the cold hearth and said because the home office wished to be sure that all was as it should be miss marloweas o a manningis a person of some prominence chambers all but snorted in disbelief you may tell the locals that and theyd be impressed im not suspicious are you rutledge asked of course im suspicious when scotland yard feels it needs to stick its nose into a death where im handling the estate is there anything wrong with the wills any provisions that make you especially nervous he was deliberately misunderstanding the man stripping him of his authority and aggressively taking charge of the meeting not out of personal animosity but as a tool chambers stared at him at the thinness the gaunt face the lines that had prematurely aged a much younger man than hed guessed at in the beginning and wasnt above a little aggression of his own in the war were you rutledge nodded wounded rutledge hesitated then said briefly yes thought as much stephen looked the same way when he came back shell of himself damned foot killed him in the end too over hamishs rude comments about that rutledge recaptured the salient what did you do in the war they wouldnt take me chambers said in disgust too old they told me but i knew that part of france better than they did my mothers mother was from there stupid place to fight infantry battles for gods sake no geographical advantage no high ground prolonged deadlock thats what youll get i told them enormous loss of life i told them no one will come out of it a winner americans tipped the balance of course and the tank and still the best they could do was an armistice chambers realized suddenly that hed mounted one of his hobby horses and stopped watching the advantage slip back to rutledge then he grinned over to you i think rutledge found himself grinning back he liked chambers he could also see what had attracted rosamund fitzhugh to the man who sent for you rutledge asked susannah hargrove daniel hargrove he was worried because his wife is in delicate health and this whole business was upsetting her they tell me now shes likely to bear twins but that runs in the family not surprising they were still standing rutledge by the hearth chambers at the far end of the room a position chosen to make rutledge come to him not the reverse rutledge said impatiently sit down man he was aware of the smell of wool again and with resignation ignored it hamish perversely did not after a moment chambers moved forward and took one of the chairs near the fireplace the room was damp chill with an old coldness that seemed to come from the walls seeping up from the earth that waited to consume the stone when it finally sank under its own weight rutledge took the chair across from him and said actually im glad youve come i was considering traveling to plymouth to find you surprised chambers said not about the wills i think in a way i know that olivia marlowe made her half brother stephen fitzhugh her literary executor but then stephen died soon after and i havent been able to find her papers do you have them no i understood that stephen knew what was involved in that bequest and was prepared to deal with the responsibility himself if nicholas had survived hed have had that duty and if stephen died ah now thats a very good question i think susannah mrs hargrove he didnt specify her as literary executor you understand his will was made out while olivia was still alive and it would have been presumptuous to consider that need but he did leave everything else to her and the courts will i think accept the inclusion of olivias papers in his estate not to cormac fitzhugh then chambers frowned no there was some coolness between the two of them cormac and olivia i mean she made it very clear to me at the time she drew up her will that she didnt wish cormac to be in any way responsible for her affairs stephen was still very young then which is why id suggested an older and wiser man to handle the papers what was the cause of this coolness i never knew quite what it was but rosa his face flushed and he quickly changed that to mrs fitzhugh told me once that even she didnt know the reasons behind it you were well acquainted with mrs fitzhugh i think yes he looked down at his hands turning a ring on his little finger id hoped to marry her he added reluctantly then she would have told you the reasons if in fact she had known them it wasnt a polite lie to an outsider i think she would have been honest with me he said slowly except at the end she was very distressed i begged her to tell me what was wrong why she was upset but she wouldnt say the doctor called it depression it wasnt that rosamundmrs fitzhughwas not the kind of woman who either felt sorry for herself or dwelt on the sadness of life god knows shed had enough suffering heartbreak but she dealt with it with such courage his voice broke off then he said forcing it back to normal tones i never knew why she killed herself it left me scarred not just her death but the fact that she never turned to me in whatever anguish there was rutledge considered him the thick white hair stillblack brows the strong almost attractive face the squared shoulders and straight back a good man to have beside you in the trenches when the next assault came because you knew you could depend on him not to break hamish said unexpectedly but hed protect her wouldnt he hed not give up her confidences to a stranger come to make trouble which was very true rutledge changed tactics who was the murderer in that house for once chambers was completely off guard completely vulnerable his face stripped of the mask that the law and his years had fashioned for it but rutledge had been right in his judgment as well stunned speechless for an instant still chambers didnt break murderer christ man what are you talking about a coldblooded killer who for reasons we cant fathom decimated the trevelyan family with methodical cunning heor shewas there in the household ive discovered that much but so far i cant prove it chambers stared at him his intelligence slowly reasserting itself as the first shock receded i dont believe you in rosamunds house no its not possible youve been grasping for straws and looking for an excuse to make your trip down here worthwhile looking for promotion on the reputations of people who cant defend themselves rutledge smiled a cold smile that never reached his eyes if that were true i could cause a great deal of trouble but in the end id only harm myself no come with me mr chambers he stood up and without waiting to see if chambers would follow he went out into the inns hallway fetched his coat from the rack and was already picking up the borrowed umbrella when chambers slowly came after him through the parlor door where are we going to the hall rutledge told him do you have any objections i dontid rather not go there why none of your damned business chambers flared into anger as a defense i have no responsibility to you or to scotland yard only to my clients i have neither obligation nor duty to cooperate with the police in a wild goose chase if you have a clear conscience i see no reason why you should refuse to go with me to the hall today or any day no it was very final rutledge shoved the umbrella back into the tall brass stand and went back into the parlor tossing his coat across the nearest chair after a moment chambers followed him and shut the door with a pointed slam what do you want of me he asked standing there blocking it and what do you want of this investigation besides this ridiculous charge of murderers in the trevelyan household you know something was wrong in that house dont you rachel felt it becauseshe was particularly susceptible to the moods of the people who lived there he couldnt bring himself objectivity or not to betray rachels regard for nicholas and youre vulnerable too because you cared deeply for rosamund and you know she wasnt a woman likely to kill herself or lets take nicholas as an example if you find thinking about rosamund too painful would you have pegged him as a potential suicide the sort of man whod quietly choose to die with his half sister rather than face life on his own a sentimental pact in the moonlight on a peaceful saturday night or did nicholas strike you as a man with a burden he carried with great patience and strength chambers expression was closed the solicitor yielding nothing loyalty to his clients coming ahead of any personal feelings damn it youre too intelligent to put your own responses down to sentimentality but you feel uncomfortable in the hall let me describe it for you you walk through the door and the house isnt benign its alive with jarring forces to some extent its a subjective response i grant you because of the uneasiness in your own mind your intuition tries to point out that theres something very wrong here but you refuse to listen you dont want to believe that what you sense could be true and you wont help me to find the answers for the same reasons rutledge was met with a wall of resistance but he was beginning to take the measure of it now even i have felt the emotions in that house i was moved by o a mannings poetry i was shocked by the manner of the poets death i was personally involved in a way that an ordinary policeman wouldnt have been and im not by nature one to look for moods orwhat is it that the crackpots call itvibrations i dont believe in ghosts either but trevelyan hall is haunted in a sense that you and i both accept chambers still didnt answer but his face was paler strained i survived in those hellholes they called trenches for four years it seemed like fortya lifetime i learned to trust my intuition men who didnt often died i was lucky to possess it in the first place and war honed it i learned that it wasnt a figment of my imagination nor was it a replacement for the god id lost whatever it was you came to recognize it an inkling a warning a sudden flash of caution a splitsecond insight that saved your life indisputably real however unorthodox the means of reaching you it gave you an edge on death and you were grateful then i lost it for a time it doesnt matter why but it hasnt failed me completely and i can tell you why youre afraid to go back to that house you know that rosamunds death haunts you there you can feed yourself lies down in plymouth but not here not in the house itself rutledge could see the clenched jaw the desperate rejection in his own head hamish was clamoring for him to leave the man in peace it was an accidental overdose the words when they finally came seemed to be torn from the depths of chambers soul no rutledge waited relentless rosamund didnt make such mistakes she was a strong woman she was sunshine and light not despair and darkness it wasnt suicide and it wasnt an accidental overdose i refuse to accept murder because you believe that murder if it was done was your fault for loving rosamund for wanting to marry her for winning her love just as suicide could mean a rejection of your love murder means someone wanted to prevent another stepfather in the house another family another long wait for whatever it was heor shewanted badly enough to kill for hamish was saying in agitation where did this notion come from you never spoke of it before in the tumult of his own emotions rutledge tersely answered the voice aloud i didnt know before but it makes sense now i see the pattern he did olivia had systematically eliminated her family the twin sister who could pass for her and steal her grandfathers love the stepfathers she hadnt wanted the half brother who had stirred up the household and kept it on its ear the mother who was planning to marry again but not nicholas never nicholas who had looked after her not until the very end when he no longer served any purpose hamish was still raising fierce objections rutledge ignored them he was angry and unsettled andyesbewildered by the leap his intuition had taken without warning without a motive he could keep to himself his suspicions about olivia he could deny on the surface that he believed in them because there was no real evidence except the carefully hidden trophies of the dead it was possibleit was likelyit was practicablebut still theory still his own torment now it was real suddenly it was real he had nearly forgotten about chambers in the dark lowceilinged room standing by the door like a man whod lost his way and waited for a sign the hoarse voice startled him damn you you should have died in france chambers said with such bitterness that rutledge knew hed won it was a hollow victory it had cost both men very dearly suddenly exhausted and drained he felt he was on the edge of a precipice inside himself the blackness hed fought so long in the hospital and once too short a time ago in warwickshire it seemed to draw him to beckon like the sirens a place of peace and darkness and silence where nothing could ever touch him again the doctors had warned him he was still at risk that it might be too soon to go back to the pressures of the yard while his own stability was an uncertain factorand hed fought them inch by inch to try returning and then a line of poetry came running through his head like a bright and deadly thread if i choose to die there is peace in darkness and no pain the grave is safe it was as if olivia herself urged him to fail to choose the darkness and leave the past intact chambers would never speak of it again rutledge was certain of that but the very last lines of the same poem came back to him too if i choose to live oh god it will never be the same yet i prevail the dilemma of olivia marlowe who could give and who could destroy with equal adroitness his voice still shaken chambers said i need a drink from the look of you ive no doubt you could use one too he turned and opened the parlor door crossing the hall to the inns dining room there he took a table by the window pulled out the other chair for rutledge and sat down heavily in the watery light he looked old and tired but rutledge knew it was an illusion trask came hurrying across the room to ask them what theyd have and chambers ordered whiskey glancing at rutledge to see if that met with his approval make it a strong one and then well have our lunch i cant travel back to plymouth half sober when trask had gone again chambers sighed youre a damned hard man do you know that im stubborn thats all chambers smiled grimly well so am i i loved rosamund damn it i dont want to think i missed the causes of her distress at the end and i dont want to think that one of her family could beevil thats what it would have to be not wickedness you understand thats entirely different do you believe in evil inspector or did you lose that along with god ive seen enough evil in my work i respect its existence yes thats probably very true i dont as a country solicitor deal with crime as often as i deal with property and wills and contracts the ongoing bits and bobs of everyday life still god knows money often brings out the worst in people but it strikes mehaving seen some of the dregs of life myselfthat evil is something we dont understand because its outside the pale of ordinary experience you should tell that to the rector smedley he has strong views in that direction himself yes i know him a good man but the point im making here is that i knew everyone in mrs fitzhughs household and i sensed no evil there i couldnt point my finger at any one of them and say there i have some doubts or i cant feel easy about that one mind you im still not agreeing with you on any of this he added wryly but for the sake of argument yet rutledge could see that chambers was already following the path of his own reasoning we can eliminate both stephen and susannah they were born after it all began he said began where with anne olivias twin sister to be more precise with her death damn it she fell out of a tree or was pushed and our choices are broader now nicholas rachel olivia rosamund james cheney and brian fitzhugh cormac they were all alive at that time the servants we cant leave them out of the equation you can omit the adults chambers said testily they werent there when it happened not even one of the nursery maids ignoring him rutledge said and next was young richard chambers black brows snapped together trask came just then with their glasses and as he walked away again chambers said all right he was out on the moors during a family picnic olivia was with he stopped rutledge waited watching the trained mind work behind the disbelieving eyes watching the solicitor vie with the prejudices of the lover no he said in a fierce whisper no i will not accept that not olivia she was the apple of her grandfathers eye she was rosamunds shadow she was for gods sake a remarkably courageous and astute woman never mind the poetry she wouldnt have touched that child but dont you see thats the key to a successful murderer when no one is willing to believe he or she could possibly be behind such cruelty chambers shook his head adamantly no if we must put the blame on someone let it be cormac he was no child of rosamunds and i know very little about his childhood which makes it easier to point my finger in that direction yes hypothetically cormac i will accept but not olivia all right cormac if you will what did he have to gain killing anne or young richard i can see that killing james cheney might have made way for cormacs father to marry the grieving widow but cormac was never in line to inherit the house or vast sums of money and still isnt i dont know how susannah hargroves will stands but i should think she leaves her share of the estate to her husband if it hasnt been sold by the time she dies i cant break my trust and tell you how her affairs stand but yes i can be frank about one matter susannah doesnt leave her share of the house to cormac after all shes got a family of her own to think of or soon will then why should cormac kill people and risk being caught if hes nothing to gain and without fail the outsider is the first to draw suspicion theres always the ugly possibility of childhood jealousy i grant you but somehow that doesnt fit him does it cormac strikes me as a clearheaded businessman who will take calculated risks in the market but not in his personal life well yes i must agree there chambers replied reluctantly there was no call to be jealous i know for a fact that rosamund saw to his education then gave him introductions to prominent men in the city when he came down from cambridge just what shed have done for her own sons the rest hes earned on his own considerable merit which brings us back to where we started theres no possible motive i can see for your choice to light on olivia either even if richard did go wandering while in her care he finished his whiskey and turned to signal trask saying to rutledge over his shoulder but let me put this question to you suppose youre right about her where will prosecuting a dead woman however evil she might have been take you certainly not into a court of law oa manning is still very much alive rutledge responded chambers turned back staring at him speculatively i begin to see he said quietly chambers left after the meal with a final comment ill give you a hearing when youve got incontrovertible evidence to show me until then i shall do my best not to give credence to a word youve told me and my best is very good indeed let me assure you luncheon appeared to have restored his balance rutledge went up to his room overwhelming fatigue dogging his steps as he climbed the narrow stairs the reactions hed gotten from chambers proved how far the case he could presently lay out would go in a courtroom hed sown seeds of doubt in the solicitors mind but he hadnt done more than make him think and a jury is no better than the evidence presented to it that was a maxim at the yard all right then where to go next the men searching the moors in this wretched weather would have to find more than suspicions richards body and the manner in which it was found could go a long way towards proving murder but by whom what if there were no pansies at his feet to link the small body with the poem olivia had written in the afternoon rutledge set out in a lowering mist to look for the small isolated cottage where the old midwife lived trask had reluctantly told him how to find it shes harmless they say but she gives me the willies hed confided to rutledge never know where you stand with her and those eyesthey lay a man bare like a fleshing knife but beyond the bone im told shes a good nurse oh aye i grant her that but what does she steal when youre defenseless from the expression on his face rutledge knew he wasnt thinking of money or the brass candlesticks of such fears witchhunts were born rutledge thought as he set out sadie lived in a narrow cranny that branched off the main valley of the bor hardly more than a culdesac where her sodroofed house squatted in the rain like a wet gray toad a garden had been hacked out of the hillsides and into the narrow strip of flatland on which the house had been built he could recognize herbs of different kindsalthough he only knew the names of half of themand rows of cabbage and onions and carrots next to straggling lines of flowers beaten down by the heavy rains a dozen bedraggled chickens scratched in a muddy pen out back she must have seen him coming because the old wooden door inched open before he got there leave the umbrella by the sill and wipe your feet on yon rag she told him sharply i want no mud on my floors he did as he was told and was surprised when he finally crossed the threshold and stepped into the low beamed room that served her as both parlor and kitchen she had whitewashed the wails and they glowed like butter in the fire that didnt begin to fill a hearth broad enough to hold a pig but the room was warm and the bright rag rugs that covered the stone floor kept out the damp the furniture was old worn castoffs that had seen finer days bunches of drying herbs and flowers hung in the rafters giving the room an oddly exotic tang of mixed scents baskets woven of rushes held a stock of dry wood and a large black cather familiar he wondered in wry amusementslept on a cushion by the only window sadie looked him up and down with those bright eyes what brings a london policeman out in a west country rain to talk to an old woman her mind seemed clear enough today he thought listening for the querulousness that seemed to come with confusion when she began drifting out of reach im trying to piece together information about the family at the hall you know that rutledge answered mildly i thought you might remember some other things that would be useful like like where are the servants who used to work there scattered gone to other houses or retired or dead do you remember their names she grinned at him at my age but he thought she could if she tried ask mrs trepol or the rector then tell me about nicholas cheney suddenly wary she stared at him why should i hes not one i care to speak about im trying to understand why he killed himself why he chose to die beside olivia it seems out of character she chuckled ever seen a man gassed in the war many times their crusted faces and red blistered mouths the hoarse gasping as they struggled for air he shuddered remembering it then you dont need me to tell you how the lungs burn how you cant draw a deep breath because the tubes are raw and you choke on your own phlegm he said he dreamt of the scent of violets and lemons nicholas wasnt that ill you know it and i know it now she went over to the window and touched the cat her face turned away from him dont ask me about nicholas cheney or the boy richard thats why youve come i can read it in your eyes and ive listened to the men grumbling on their way to search the moors do you plant pansies in your garden rutledge asked reaching to the rafters to touch the upside down heads of strawflowers brittle between his fingers they dont dry well she said straightening up to look at him do they grow well on the moors sometimes they do volunteers that the wind blows or a bird leaves behind she was wary still but not afraid of these questions he wondered why pansies like the cool of springtime and a little shade in the afternoon if thats what youre looking for find the place where theyd want to grow not where someone thought of putting em rutledge considered her the old stooped body the worn bright eyes the knowledge and the experiences of a lifetime fading with age slipping into forgetfulness he remembered a chaplain in the war at a hasty service for a halfdozen soldiers killed in the shelling saying theyll never grow oldnever feel fear and cold hunger or pain or the sorrows of lost love or the pity of the young while they have missed much these men who wont see their sons in their mothers arms or the moon over a summer sea or the beauty of a rose they have what we all look for in the endeternal springtime it is not their grief but ours that haunts us oddly enough it had helped weary men but not he thought the chaplain has your life been a happy one rutledge asked her shock spread across her face then lingered in her eyes no one ever asked me that before she said quietly but no i was never given the choice of happiness only of service i dont know that i wasnt better off come to that if you feel happiness you must also feel grief did olivia marlowe know grief miss livia she went to funerals like the rest of them and cried no grief for what her life brought her not the paralysis not the poetry not the dead in her family but grief for what she was aye the old woman answered finally she carried a great burden on her soul and had no way to put it right she said to me once a long time ago that god had put an affliction upon her and i asked what that was she told me to live with evil and not know how to stop it and did she by dying put an end to it sadie frowned i dont know sir for her sake i pray she did id hate to think of her lying in her grave with no hope of peace he turned to go then thought of one final question was she the frail angel that watched at richards grave but sadie didnt know what he was talking about she were crippled aye but never frail and id not call her an angel she had feelings like any other woman wet and tired and thoroughly depressed rutledge tramped back to the inn and went through to the bar but time had already been called and he went instead to his room where hamish clamored so insistently in his mind that he couldnt concentrate on the volumes of poetry that rested on the stand by his bed after a time he put them down again feeling as if hed been prying rachel came to the inn for her dinner that night and he thought it was on purpose to discover what hed been up to for reasons of his own he was very happy to see her walk through the door i hear that tom chambers came to call on you today she said when hed asked her to join him at his table im surprised that gossip hasnt also told you what we discussed she grinned some of the strain slipping out of her face the truth is mr trasks hearing is failing he laughed outright tilting her head she said youre younger when you laugh ive often wondered what peter would have been like if hed survived his war out in africa stephen seemed to take france in stridein fact he was quite the daredevil not that he told us mind you but somehow it was as ifas if it was only just another game he was very good at when his foot went bad and they sent him home barely a month before the armistice i expected to find him cheering up half the hospital with his wild spirits instead he was desperately depressed as if he wouldnt have minded dying but he minded terribly losing his foot it was the oddest thing he knew but didnt tell her that often the men who taunted death had a terrible fear of it and reached out to it in bravery because that was easier than waiting for it to come and fetch them cowering in some corner he knewhed taken his own wild risks hoping to put an end to suffering he didnt know how to face when he didnt answer she added but it was thomas chambers i came to torment you about wasnt it short of fiercely twisting my arm alarming mr trask not to mention giving the gossips an earful before morning how do you propose to do that he fell back on teasing her while he considered what he wanted to say to her you dont want to talk about it she was disappointed there is little to tell if you want the truth he said mildly he wanted to know what in blazes i was doing here on his turfsounded much like cormac fitzhugh and dr hawkins in that regardand agreed that if stephen inherited olivias papers hechambershas no idea whats become of them and susannah would be the most likely person to have charge of them now once they are found rachel considered that i wonder what shell do with them they have great intrinsic value i dont know their monetary worth on the auction block oxford would be delighted to have them or cambridge she was a major poet but a woman i wonder if shell be valued so highly now that everyone knows who o a manning really is the war poems for one thingthey seemed so i dont know so genuine a part of personal experience but she never went to france she was a woman who wore a brace on her leg and hardly ever left cornwall much less came face to face with war does she have to shoulder a rifle and kill to understand war i dont know rachel answered honestly i wasnt in france either i can appreciate the words on the page but i wasnt there you sent a husband off to war nicholas went to france stephen you loved all three of them what did you feel he knew how jean had feltshe had wanted him back without four years of suffering and guilt and pain coming between them unchanged nothing to remind her that hed ever gone away from her the man he was now terrified her the man he had been was lost somewhere still in france she hesitated fear mainly i was so afraid the war dragged on it seemed as if it would never end and you tell yourself he can make it a few more days another month he can last out this year theres so little of it left but you know deep down inside that he cant live forever that simple arithmetic the number of shots fired the number of shells that fall the number of assaults and snipersthey have to find their targets sometimes and its really a matter of chancethe hazards of war she broke off and spread her napkin across her lap taking pains with it so that he couldnt see her face he wondered whether she was speaking mostly about peter or nicholas and told himself that he was being unfair to judge her for peters sake then she said in a different voice thats all that you had to say to mr chambers or he to you what were you expecting him to tell me that hed been waiting for me or someone like me to come down here and open pandoras box no she said wistfulness in her face i dont know what i expected not really did olivia like flowers pansies for an example did she plant pansies in the gardens at the hall or out on the moors thereve always been drifts of pansies in the borders at the hall i dont have any idea who planted them first but nicholas was very fond of them i do know that as for pansies on the moors she shook her head i dont recall ever finding pansies there but then i never looked for them im having the moors searched again for richards body rachel sighed do you think youll find it after all these years who knows i have to look constable dawlish must have been very happy about that rutledge shrugged i didnt make an inquiry into his feelings on the subject i just asked him to set up a search she regarded him for a moment then said youre used to having your way arent you surprised he said no i seldom have my way but when something has to be done and the local man can do it better than i can i expect him to get on with it he knows who can be spared for the job while you she said irritably sit in a warm and dry inn hardly that i saw you walking towards the hall earlier why trask brought a tray with their orders cutlets for him a breast of chicken for her and began to arrange the plates on the table saving her from having to answer by the time the innkeeper had finished and gone away again she had a pat reply ready for rutledge and he had a question of his own ready for her there was a pounding on his door in the dark of night and rutledge came awake with a start who is it he called sharply after sitting up and clearing his throat one hand fumbled for his watch constable dawlish sir there was a certain pitch to his voice as if he relished dragging the inspector out of a warm bed at three oclock i think weve found something out on the moors rutledge threw back the blankets and reached for his trousers in a city theres never true darkness in the night but in a place like borcombe where people still used oil lamps and clouds obscured what little starlight there was the blackness was nearly absolute rutledge bumped into the bicycle that one of dawlishs men had leaned against the wall by the inn door and swore feelingly youll make better time with that dawlish was saying than going in your motorcar we can take some of the paths shortcuts still rubbing his shin rutledge nodded then swung the other leg over the saddle side by side the two men pedaled down the wet road coming to a halt at dawlishs signal by doctor hawkins surgery the doctor rumbling with bad temper came out leading his own bicycle then without a word joined them it was a long wet ride and rutledge who didnt know where he was going had to follow the shadowy figure of the constable while hawkins still grumbling brought up the rear hamish of them all seemed to be most comfortable with the night the highlander keeper of sheep and cattle before turning soldier had been bred to it the moors were several miles away even by the shortcuts that dawlish took over fields across hummocky meadows once startling a herd of sleeping cowsand through one stand of trees the moors were not what rutledge had expected bare yes barren yes rolling yes but there were rocks and marshes rills that tumbled into pools and scrub growth here and there that rose up like humbled spirits out of the ground the silence he noticed most there was a whispering wind that seemed to be saying something just under the range of human hearing but it didnt displace the quiet a ghostly white flock of sheep went scurrying off over a hill like disturbed spirits jostling each other in their haste and leaving behind a strong aroma of wet wool that mixed with the wind from the sea and the smell of rotting earth like a miasma it was nearly two hours before they reached their destination and rutledge was never quite sure how the constable had found his way across the featureless expanse tracks there were but they seemed to go where they willed rather than in any discernible direction to any discernible destination a great pile of rocks loomed up ruins of a colliery rutledge thought peering at it through the darkness and then the sputtering fire that the men had lit to keep warm if not dry the rains had stopped but there was a drizzle in the wind that clung to everything it was easy to understand why a small boy might die out here of exposure even in summer in the lea of a boulder where erosion had widened the crevice over the years there was a pile of bones pitiful in their smallness rutledge could see the whiteness of a longer one behind the others he dismounted leaving the bike in the charge of a roughly dressed man who appeared out of nowhere to take it theres no skull dawlish was saying to hawkins and no pelvis as i told you only the little bones and that leg bone yonder can you tell anything about it sir someone was bringing a lantern over to them its light spilling across their feet and then their faces hawkins knelt youve looked for the skull or ribs aye sir all through the rocks nothing carried off then by wild dogs he said running his fingers over the smaller fragments lifting the leg bone he brought it closer to his face then adjusted the lantern in the holders hand so that it fell the way he wished it to this was broken here he pointed to a jagged fracture line in the bone died before it began to heal caught a foot in the hole by the rock id say and couldnt get out again he got up and went to the fire using that and the lantern to better judge the bone after a few minutes he said just as i thought sheep carcass thats what you dragged me out here for there was no knowing for certain sir with nothing larger than that one bone to go by dawlish said apologetically next time bring the damned things in to me no rutledge said countermanding that instruction i want to see them in place not on a laboratory table and as soon as theyre found hawkins glared at him went to fetch his bicycle and rutledge had to hurry to catch up with himor stay on the moors with the searchers as dawlish was doing halfway back to the village rutledge heard hawkins say youre a damned fool you know that dont you im a policeman i do what i have to do no more no less you could go back to london and leave us in peace half those men out there in the rain will be sick before the weeks out and theyll still have to work the nets or tend their sheep or dig in their fields the boys long dead and god alone knows where he could be murdered by gypsies down one of the mine shafts i thought those had been searched yes of course they have but a boy that age is small he could crawl where a man cant go you could walk by him a thousand times over and never realize it predators carry off small bonesbirds and animals could have taken his remains anywhere dawlish should have explained all that nevertheless im going to continue until i find him silence ruled until they were nearly back in the village again rutledge remembering a case hed handled before the war asked how long before the flesh rotted off a childs body and you could move the bones or crush them beyond recognition before scattering them it was worth consideringa husband had nearly gotten away with murdering his wife experimenting with temporary burial and a very permanent exhumation turning to look at him hawkins nearly skidded in a puddle then swore again and straightened the wheel in time youre mad dyou know that stark staring mad he turned in at his gate without another word morning dawned fair though cooler after the rains as if summers heat had been washed away the first task rutledge set himself was to search the churchyard for flowers growing there in his experience english churchyards unlike those hed seen in europe were seldom planted with flowers along the walls sometimes or by the path to the front door of the church occasionally by the gates but not on or around the graves themselves or close to the headstones the english still preferred their yews as funereal offerings these had first been set out in churchyards in the days of the long bow as a source of raw materials and become a habit their shape and somber dark green seemed to suit the mood and the gravity of the place better than a riot of color flowers were more acceptable in tall vases inside the church rutledge could remember as a small boy going with his mother to do the altar flowers when it was her turn hed sat on the cold stone floor running his fingers in the deep crevices of the memorial brasses that held place of honor down the aisle until he knew the shapes by heart a knight with plumes and sword and handsome spurs a lady in a conical hat the sweep of her long embroidered robes nearly hiding the little dog near the hem and an elegantly bearded elizabethan gentleman with padded breeches and coat looking more like a portly merchant than the adventurer he had been he walked slowly through the gravestones in the churchyard some of them tilted with age and so mossy he could barely make out the words incised on them others he recognized at a glancetrepol and trask wilkins and penrith dawlish and trelawny there were poldarins and a hawkins a halfdozen raleighs though none later than the seventeen hundreds and a pair of drakes but no pansies he walked on looking at the delicately drawn celtic cross on one gravestone the sad lines of verse on another for a small child drowned in the bor an open book with a ribbon marking its stone pages any numbers of beloved wife and beloved husband war dead and plague dead and a very fine stone angel on a plinth with the legend below it in memory of the men of the mary anne lost at sea in a storm october eternal father keep their souls safe in thy care and a list of the names twentyseven of them it was surely richards angel the cool marble cheeks turned slightly so that the serene eyes stared unwaveringly towards the church tower for all eternity there was both compassion and strength in the body power in the wings he could see why it had made an indelible impression on a small boy who passed the statue each sunday morning on his way to services a voice behind him said lovely isnt it the village took up a subscription to have it carved in london the trevelyans sent an anonymous donation to help make it up to the amount required in addition to the sum theyd given openly it was the sort of thing they did it was smedley dressed in a dark suit of clothes not the rough corduroys of the gardener over the wet grass his shoes had made no sound i saw you here and wondered if you were searching for a place to lay the sheep bones to rest he went on but there was a sympathetic gleam in his eyes that took away any sting i doubt theres a soul in the village who hasnt heard yes well they never seem to know what i want to hear rutledge said irritably only what im doing youd be surprised they seem to think youre on the trail of a murderer theyre wonderingamong themselves not to your faceif that terrible man doing the killings in london might be a borcombe man theyve gone through the lists of who lived here once and who moved away failing that someone whod passed through its the only explanation they can come up with for a scotland yard inspector wasting his time on two suicides and an accident when half london is in absolute terror thinking the other half is about to cut him to ribbons astonished rutledge found himself speechless hamish quick to point out the fact that rutledge might well be more useful there was not smedley lifted his shoulders deprecatingly the newspaper yesterday morning reported that someone named bowles was quoted as saying that all available manpower had been diverted to the killings do you know him yes rutledge answered curtly the truth is i was sent down here to keep me out of the picture not to run any leads to earth that reassures me smedley answered and there was something in his voice that made rutledge look more closely at him all this fuss over the boy searching for his grave his body proof that he was in fact dead i dont know why i found myself fearful that perhaps he hadnt perished on the moors that hed been taken away and somehow turned into a monster you prefer the possibility that someone in his own family might have purposely let him die of exposure no there was sadness in his voice i prefer that he rest in peace wherever he may be alive or dead i dont want to think of anyone suffering and lost and alone in need of comfort least of all someone i held in my arms and christened whose soul is in a sense my responsibility and most certainly not rosamunds son the murderer in london is very likely mad what hes doing is the work of a ruined mind the murderer im searching for isnt mad whatever reasons heor shehad for killing there was a reason smedley sighed i can give one to you envy envy rutledge repeated it wasnt necessarily his first choice of sins and often not a murderers either in his experience envy is at the root of many small cruelties watch children at play if you dont believe me its a natural emotion in them and they arent yet civilized enough to suppress it a child might kill out of envy what could olivia envy oh i daresay many things a whole leg rather than a shriveled one for starters and nicholas the rector tilted his head and looked at the angels face i dont know that nicholas ever envied anyone he was a decisive man in his way he made his choices and lived with them then why didnt he leave the hall go away to sea make a life for himself somewhere else nicholas had an affinity for the sea thats true in another age hed have been one of drakes sea dogs or nelsons captainsor perhaps one of hakluyts geographers i can see him racing a tea clipper to china and back all of which demanded daring and skill and personal courage not to mention ruthless leadership yet hed let himself be led into suicide rutledge shook his head im not any closer to understanding him than i was at the beginning you wont understand nicholas trust me there have you read the poems after the briefest hesitation rutledge said no not yet let me give you a word of advice as a priest when rutledge said nothing smedley went on be sure your own ghosts dont infringe on your logical minddont rain havoc on borcombe in search of your own absolution if you cant finish the puzzle that worries you be man enough to walk away from it while the rest of us can still get on with our lives this is a very small village you see and we dont have your london sophistication we shall go on suffering long after youve gone away watching smedley walk off across the wet grass rutledge was prey to a variety of emotions and hamish relishing the turbulence in his mind was busy taking advantage of it yere no wanted here he said and no wanted in london as well ive no seen anywhere you belong that has nothing to do with the trevelyan family rutledge replied coldly the rector is right my work and my life are separate yere no keeping olivia marlowe from getting under your skin shes no different from any suspect not to me except that shes dead hamish reminded him is that why yere no reading the poems you read them often enough before when ye knew she was alive rutledge swore and headed for the stone walkway that led from the churchyard to the road his reasons were his own affair and none of hamishs it was a long and tiring day he was summoned twice more to come to the moors the first time it was a boy who came to fetch him the ground he must surely have covered last night seemed very different in the sunlight brown and green and black and yellow and not very much like the higher yorkshire moors he knew so much better but this too was sour land that grew grass and reeds in the lowlying damp and vast stretches of quaking marsh that could become quicksand in the blink of an eye the boy cheerfully threaded his way through a maze of paths and chattered on about the war wanting to know how many boche rutledge had personally and bloodily killed and if hed ever been wounded himself theyd reached the subject of aircraft and whether the inspector had ever been up in one he was disappointed when rutledge said no and how many flaming crashes hed personally witnessed when the first lines of searchers came into sight below a knoll it took them fifteen minutes to find dawlish who was on the far right of the line the constable was not in good spirits inspector harvey returned from plymouth had been out there very early to demand an explanation for this business inspector harvey had not caught up with his own suspect and was in no mood for anyone elses wild goose chases where is harvey now ill speak to him myself as to that sir i dont know theres a problem out on one of the farms somebodys dog killing sheep and he had to have a look himself what progress have you made here more sheep bones and an old dog they had their heads still it wasnt difficult to tell what they were and we found a man sir looked like he must have been a vagabond dr hawkins has been and gone and he said it was an old corpse we could bury it later where by those rocks there about a mile away one of the men sheltered there to light his cigarette and he saw something white in the earth we dug it out bit by bit first a hand then the head not very deep you understand but thats the direction the wind blows and hed have been covered over in a season or two rutledge walked across to see the bones followed by the boy whose bloodthirsty spirits were fascinated by the line of human remains laid out next to raw earth under one of the towering rock piles that mark the moor that a hand sir wheres the middle finger then whats that pelvis do i have one of em too who et away that rib do you think whys his jaw over there and his head here dye think he was murdered sir cor in fact there was no indication what had killed the man no holes in the skull no signs of damage to any of the bones no obvious indications of stabbing or a bullet clipping a rib or part of the spine no crushed vertebrae to show a strangling but the bones were long and well formed hed been tall with no sign of the thickening that comes with heavy work in an underfed childhood or early diseases like rickets that stunted growth according to hawkins the bones had lain in the earth for no more than seven years were he a soldier dye think left to die in the thick of the battle and then forgotten the boy asked hopefully rutledge dug around in the disturbed earth with his pocket knife looking for remnants of cloth buttons coins or other debris that might have told a clearer tale if theyd been here they were gone now a mans skeleton not a childs all the way back to borcombe the boy talked of nothing but the bones and rutledge was very glad to give him sixpence and see the last of him by the time they reached the road into the village he was off then racing to find his friends and make them envious of his good fortune in viewing the skeleton rutledge ate his lunch alone the books of poetry beside his plate hed tried to approach them in the order in which theyd been published and he found one short early poem about the moors reading it he could hear olivias response to the emptiness and the mystery of that barren land for here the spirit dies shed written and that is more of hell than i can bear and yet it was possible shed consigned a small child to that same hell in the afternoon he went back to see mrs trepol whose reputation as a gardener was sworn to by three women hed spoken with in the inns dining room she was working to straighten the stormbattered stalks of flowers lupine and asters marigolds and zinnias stakes and strips of old rag lay in the small bucket she carried with her and in the back of the cottage wash hung on the line blowing like signal flags mrs trepol looked up saw that he intended to come through the gate rather than pause for a few words outside it and said do you mind if i keep working sir these turn their heads to the sun soon enough if they arent righted its about flowers that i came he told her as she reached for a tall golden head of marigold its bruised leaves scenting the air aye sir and what flowers would you be wanting to know about she asked over the mallet she was using to pound in a stake pansies pansies a spring flower mostly hardy in the cold not strong in the sun look over there by the rhododendron he did and saw the straggling green stalks that flopped across the grass the small faces lifted to stare at him theyre twice that size in the spring she said reaching for a length of cloth but they come back in the autumn if alls well thats why i put them in the shadow of the taller bush a little protection out on the moor would they need protection she stopped what she was doing to look at him they dont grow often on the moors unless someone sows them there and that makes no sense a waste of good plants but you might find a few at the edge of a wood gone wild you see which was an interesting thought tell me he said slowly working it out in his mind as he spoke do you know if stephen fitzhugh ever considered becoming a catholic did the family ever discuss his choice of faith not that i know of sir she seemed surprised mr brian now he was brought up a catholic but the children never were and he went to services with the family regularly there was no fuss about it that i ever heard he was a man who wanted to please not one to set people at odds but he loved ireland and he talked about the country often and often in what way was he a supporter of the irish rebellions oh no sir not to my knowledge though he used to tease miss rosamund that it was a trevelyannot her own family mindthat refused to provide money for the victims of the potato famine back in last century so as they could emigrate to canada or america he had a bad name in ireland that one and caused a great many deaths cruel he was i heard mr brian say once that his coldheartedness killed as many people as cromwell and william of orange put together cormac and stephen never showed any interest in irish politics sympathy for the rebels for the suffering there no sir mr stephen considered himself an englishman he said to me that he was going off to war because it was his duty to the king and mr stephen was one that always took duty seriously mr cormac now he was in the war too but i never heard he went to france miss olivia told me he was doing something secret and i shouldnt ask she smiled i never could picture him as a spy sir sneaking about and telling lies mr stephen now hed see all that as a game like hide and seek he weremore lighthearted the kind of man whod shrug it off and not be touched by it but mr cormac was always one to mind appearances not to the manor born you might say cormac had spent his war breaking codes not as exciting as spying and not as dangerous but quite as important as shouldering a rifle he left her and went to walk through the wood between the village and the hall searching along the muddy path for pansies then looking in small clearings before giving it up this was far too close to the village to risk bringing the body of a small boy and burying him and olivia hadnt said anything about trees in her poem when he was called to the moors the second time it was a man who came for him and they trudged in silence to the place where a small cache of clothes had been found the shreds were small and dirty and rotting with the damp of the earth but a boys clothing short jacketyou could see how the collar lay and one side seam short trouserspart of the waistband and a pocket part of one leg what might have been a shirt and underdrawers mere threads of white that fell apart at the touch the good wool of the jacket and trousers was tougher and had lasted while the linen and the cotton had disintegrated and someone had wrapped it all quite carefully in heavily oiled cloth which had protected the fabric for a very long time he couldnt be sure of the colors but there was enough of the cloth left to draw conclusions about the shape and general size of the outer garments as he gingerly spread them out on the grass interestingly enough there were no shoes tregarth found them sir dawlish was saying hes walked these moors man and boy for sixty years noticed the white stone wasnt natural to the land around here and was curious like he started digging and what came to light looked odd he called me and we laid the packet open enough to be sure what was inside before sending for you good man rutledge said over his shoulder to the diffident farmer waiting close by the grizzled head nodded satisfaction in the sharp weatherbrowned face who had buried these articles deep under a bush and covered them with a flat white stone and why or when there was no way of knowing to whom theyd belonged but it was the first evidence rutledge had discovered that proved the search mattered even dawlishs doubts were silenced rutledge put the shreds of wool carefully into a brown sack someone offered him and carried them back to borcombe with him ordering the men to comb the vicinity again until they could swear that there was nothing else to be found and he promised them beer from the three bells with their dinner if they did their work thoroughly he had already arranged to meet rachel after dinner while the light was still good and walk over to the hall to look for olivias papers it was not all that he had in mind for the evening but it was an innocuous beginning rachel was tense as they walked through the door of the hall i miss the flowers she said a trace of nervousness in her voice the hall was always full of flowers you could smell the beeswax polish the scent of rosamunds perfume and the flowers whenever you walked through the door like a welcome now the airsi dont know still dead you have a right to be here he said why dont you cut flowers and put them in vases yourself no i was bequeathed a share in the hall that was the way they wanted it olivia and nicholas but i have no right here no place here her voice trailed off at the end lets start with the upper floors and work our way down he said prosaically before she could get cold feet altogether the attics this way she said shaking off her gloomy spirits and leading him towards the stairs they made their way up to the attics warmed by the sun spared the wind and still comfortable there they began looking through trunks of gowns carefully wrapped in tissue paper and suits of clothes and coats moving aside rocking horses and dolls houses chairs and old bedsteads cribs and perambulators canes odds and ends of lumber and any number of boxes stored long ago and forgotten the debris of generations they found a stuffed fox ratty with age glass eyes gleaming in the lamps theyd brought with them and a wardrobe full of hats that caught rachels fancy look at these i cant believe itthey must be well over a hundred years old the braid on these tricornsi think its gold bullion we used to play dress up sometimes and nicholas had such a hat whats this yes i see its a bonnet with a tucked underbrim straight out of jane austen it was too small but she perched it on her head and made him laugh as she twirled the ribbons setting it back in its tissue nest she turned to the next shelf my god ostrich plumes and bows oh and even a little temple set in among silk trees susannah would have adored this one she was always trying on rosamunds hats it took rutledge fifteen minutes to distract her and they moved on to christening gowns and woolens old linens and sets of dishes riding boots and tables of every size a childs saddleand nothing that remotely resembled a poets work dusty and giggling rachel led the way to the next attics which held more of the same and when she began to cough from the dryness of the air he suggested a cup of tea she agreed and lamps in hand they went down to the kitchen to make it there was no cream but rachel found a lemon in the pantry then leaving one lamp in the kitchen rutledge took the tray from her and carried it to the sitting room that overlooked the sea the sun was low now warming the room with its light and rachel went to sit in a chair from which she could watch it set it was very domestic the pot of tea the quiet of evening the sense of peace and companionship the setting hed arranged in a room where rachel must have spent a great deal of her time with nicholas a room unlike the study upstairs that didnt make her shiver with dread as she sipped from the cup in her hand relaxed and off her guard he said quietly were you there when anne fell out of the tree yes i told you that but you told me what you remembered time changed what you actually saw as it was happening what the grownups said around you the questions they asked you it all influenced you would you do something for me would you close your eyes and let yourself go back to that afternoon and see it again she put down her cup shaking her head no i dont want to go back to that time or any other i dont want to play that kind of game you sent for me he reminded her you must have wanted answers of some kind so far ive got very little to show for the time ive spent here but theres evidence of a sort and it points to olivia not to nicholas she sat there torn he could read it in the tightening of her shoulders wanting him to go wanting him to stay and prove that nicholas had in fact loved her though those werent the words she used even to herself that his death had nothing to do with what he felt for her it mattered in a fashion that went deeper than conscious thought i need to see that day through the eyes of someone who was there ask cormac before shed told him that she hadnt thought cormac was there but cormac was an outsider you werent cormac was the irish latecomer there on sufferance because his father had come with rosamunds horses he hadnt played all his life with the family lived in the nursery with the other children heard them quarrel and laugh and make up games he hadnt been part of their growing up the way youd been he saw them as a stranger sees superficially the outward facade instead of the inner feelings his voice was persuasive his body very still in the shadows of the room just out of her line of sight the warmth of the suns slanting rays taking away any sense of danger or fear the quiet absolute except for the sound of her breathing and the voice of hamish which she couldnt hear hed seen the doctors at the clinic use these same techniques hed seen them break through silences that were so deep even the men locked in them couldnt find the key to them persuaded by quiet and serenity and their own sense of need such men would suddenly speak of events that would send them screaming into horrorand then complete breakdownand finally with luck survival it hadnt worked for him only drugs had broken down the walls hed built so high and strong hamish realizing what he was up to now roused and thundered at him not to take risks with this womans mind yere no a doctor you could do grave damage without knowing it but rutledge couldnt see any other way to learn the truth and forced the voice in his own mind into rumbling sullen stillness i dont know what there is to tell rachel said it was an accident then youve got nothing to be afraid of have you except for grief and the memory of someone you loved long ago i dont know that i loved anne she stopped why not she was your cousin she was bossy sometimes she made me feel very young or very stupid awkward somehow when we played games i was always the one who had to lose and then shed tease me about it the cruelty of children he could hear smedleys voice saying that she wasnt mean she could be very loving when she wanted to be she was just arrogant like her grandmother nanny told me rosamunds mother but of course she was already dead i never met her so i couldnt know if it was true or not anyway for a child like me anne was very trying whose idea was it to go to the orchard that day it was hot we were tired of playing in the gardens and the house was stuffy even with the windows open but in the orchard it was shady the long grass was cool in the trees you felt cooler i dont know who thought of it first i remember nicholas telling anne that she couldnt climb as high as he could and anne had been pestering olivia about being so slow walking nicholas must have been trying to deflect her impatience he could see from the shadows of her lashes on her cheek that shed closed her eyes clouds on the horizon began to swallow the sun it would be dark sooner than hed thought would that matter still he must not hurry but that wasnt what you felt then was it no i was hoping shed climb high enough to fall out she sat upright with a jolt no i couldnt have thought that it must have been afterward when she was climbing and i was afraid shed fall yet rutledge thought she had felt that way at the time and buried it deep a childs wish because the bully was beyond her own reach he waited a moment then said gently reassuringly im sure you wished her no harm no of course i didnt in fact i was worried when nicholas challenged her to climb to the next branches and then olivia went up after her and he tried to prevent her but she was determined to show she could do it too i remember he was holding her sashes trying to help her keep her balance and then anne was shouting something from the top of the tree and olivia pushed herself higher than she should and cormac climbed down from his tree and was over there in a flash saying his papa would thrash him if they got hurt and he was going to stop this nonsense now but i saw nicholas jerk hard on the sashes trying to pull himself up into the tree or something and cormac was crashing about in the branches and suddenly nicholas was ducking and anne came tumbling down bowling nicholas over and cormac was trying to get olivia down yelling at her not to put her bad foot just there hed hold her arm and she was screaming at him not to touch her and nicholas was crawling over to anne and as i slid down my tree i scraped my leg and it started bleeding and i got blood all over annes dress when i knelt there and she was still it was frightening and i kept asking nicholas why hed pulled so hard on the sashes and he said that anne had been shoving olivia and then olivia was down face white as her own handkerchief something in her eyes that terrified me and cormac and i ran for help he to the stables which were closer while ran to the house and rosamund she was crying he could see the tears sliding out from under her lashes and he himself felt the surge of her pain the shock the child who couldnt understand the nightmarish events shed witnessed the picture shed conjured up was sharp vivid in his mind even hamish was silenced by it please she begged huskily i dont want to think about it any more then tell me about richard being lost on the moors he said after giving both of them a little time to recover were you there when it happened yes ive said it was a family picnic she retorted irritably i dont know why you have to keep harping on the past raking it up stephen wouldnt have allowed it it was his duty to protect olivia thats why she left him all her papers olivia is dead so is nicholas your memory is all i have he said again would stephen have protected her if hed known she might have killed his father maybe thats why we cant find her papers maybe he burned them she sighed oh very well we went there to the moorsbecause it was a days outing and children are restless they need distraction uncle james thought we might enjoy looking at the old mines the tin thatd made cornwall rich once upon a time rosamund wasnt happy with the idea she said we could fall down the old shafts which wasnt very like herit was as if she had a premonitionshe was usually enthusiastic and fun but it all went quite well james showed us the mines and then we talked about where cornish tin might have traveled to egypt or crete or phoenicia he could make whatever he talked about seem so real not a lesson at allit was a gift he had then we found a sheltered spot to eat our lunch he could hear her voice change as she drifted back into the past again caught up in spite of her reluctance what was richard wearing i dont rememberwhite shirt long stockings short trousers i should think he did have a jacket too because he took it off for a time it was warm in the sun rosamund made him put it back on again when the wind came up he didnt want to put it on and fussed about it later we wondered if thats why hed run off because he was still in a temper he was so headstrong sometimes she stopped are you sure you want to hear so many little things yes it helps me frame a picture she was one of those rare people who could tell a story coherently describing clearly the images she saw in her mind without backtracking and confusing the threads he needed to follow wed had our picnic and rosamund sat down to rest james had his head in her lap i remember thinking how comfortable they looked cormac had gone to talk to the guide he was an old man whose sons left for america twenty years before to work in the mines there cormac wanted to know about them if theyd prospered if theyd written home about their new life i was drowsy and olivia sat down beside me to rest her leg a little but richard wanted to go back and see the ponies he begged her to walk with him because his mother wouldnt let him go alone i dont know where nicholas was hed wandered off he did that sometimes exploring he always had an unerring sense of direction no one ever worried about him finally olivia got up and followed richard making him promise not to run too fast for her i was waiting for nicholas to come back and didnt want to be bothered with richard and ive felt very guilty about that ever since he let the silence drift and finally her voice picked up the tale again i was nearly asleep when rosamund said we ought to be starting back she sent cormac to look for nicholas and james to find olivia and richard we walked over to the carriages together and put the baskets away rosamund was saying something about a house party she was planning friends from london i remember that because they came for the funeral instead james funeral then she said i wonder whats keeping them there was another pause cormac came back alone and said that nicholas had just seen some of those butterflies you only find out on the moors and didnt want to leave he took me off with him to persuade him but nicholas wasnt by the rocks anymore and we looked for five or ten minutes cormac and i then we went back to where rosamund was waiting and nicholas was already there james came back with olivia saying they couldnt find richard so rosamund left olivia and me in the carnages while she and james and cormac and nicholas went out to search for richard but he didnt come back and they couldnt find him and olivia wasnt sure what had happened except that hed gone to play with the ponies in plain sight and shed thought he was still with them they sent the coachman to the hall on one of the carriage horses to collect the grooms and servants while they went back again to look by nightfall it was clear we werent going to find him at all but james wouldnt hear of calling off the search he said richard was just being naughty hiding from us nicholas came back covered in blood and scratches from a fall and said hed located the ponies and richard wasnt with them but thered been some gypsy boys about he and cormac went back to look again they searched with torches i remember the long shadows they cast and how black the men looked in the distance and then rosamund sent us home in one of the carriages olivia and nicholas and me olivia was crying there was no comforting her and when we got to the stables she had herself strapped to a horse and went back with the men from the village to look again there wasnt a horse for nicholas and so he went off on his own i was told to stay at the house and send out word if any of the searchers found richard but of course they never did sometime later i remember cormac with tears cutting through the dirt on his face yelling at nicholas about richard wanting to know something and i always thought that was very strange since richard had been with olivia but no one was himself we were all distraught nicholas sat with olivia when they brought her back ill talking always talking to her but from the door i couldnt hear what he was saying uncle james was so exhausted that dr penrith put something in his coffee and it took three men to carry him up to his bed he was so deeply asleep but rutledge had lost the thread of what she was saying his thoughts busy elsewhere when the quiet voice stopped he said did olivia and anne dress as twins in the same gowns sometimes she answered surprised at the shift in subject olivia didnt like it she said she wasnt part of a pair like shoes or gloves she wasnt in annes shadow she was just herself that seemed to bother her afterward we all felt guilty the way children do blaming themselves were they wearing the same dresses the day that anne fell ii dont know let me think she shook her head no wait anne was wearing the gown with bunches of cherries embroidered around the hem and on the sash olivia was wearing something blueforgetmenots i think i remember that my blood and annes matched those cherries the empty cup rattled in its saucer as her fingers trembled he got up and poured more tea for her using the ordinary business of spooning in sugar and taking a slice of lemon to distract her and nicholas would have known very well whose sashes he was holding young as he was yes i told you they were olivias she stopped the room was dark now with only starlight to brighten it except for the single lamp on the table near the wall no she said slowly to the darkness and not to him the sash ends werent blue were they i thought they were id always been so sure olivia told me they were blue and it was nicholas who couldnt be found when cormac went out to search for him on the moors he tried to keep his voice level unemotional and he went out alone again when hed brought you and olivia to the hall yes was he envious of his brother the attention he got for being wild or were they close did they spend much of their time together ii think they were too different to be close olivia and nicholas were more alike really quiet by nature found it easy to amuse themselves while richard always needed distractions he was so exuberant he took up a lot of rosamunds time never wanting a nap always demanding a game or to be read to or to be taken to see the horses she smiled to herself richard and anne should have been twins they were so much alike quite bossy and active headstrong exhausting nanny called them and when james shot himself where was nicholas i donthe was already in the passage when cormac wanted to know what the noise was hed heard and nicholas said it was a shot and hed already knocked and then cormac and one of the servants broke down the door but i dont think it was locked after all i saw nicholas pushing the bolt back and forth standing there like a stone olivia came then and made him stop but wouldnt let him into the room wouldnt let him go to his father then rosamund heard the commotion and ran to see what was wrong and cormac went racing to the village for dr penrith and she stood in the door white as id ever seen anyones face but not crying just shaking as if shed never stop and i remember brian fitzhugh putting his arm around her shoulders and she shoved him from her and went on standing there and nicholas kept saying over and over again it was an accident i know it was an accident as if it was dreadfully important to hear the words he waited again letting her take her time but she said nothing more over the years rutledge had questioned many witnesses to a crime even during the war hed had to debrief returned prisoners night scouts men in the forefront of an assault or an attack what weapons did you see what collar tabs whats the strength in reserve where are the big guns it was an art getting at the truth rather than miring down in the tricks of a mans memory the first person on the scene of a gruesome killing in london had told him that she didnt recall much blood and yet the room to him hardened as he was had seemed to be bathed in it but she had blocked it out controlling her memory to exclude what had shocked her the most rachel wasnt afraid of blood she was frightened of betrayal of the possibility that someone she knew and loved was a stranger and yet shed sent for scotland yard irrevocably calling public attention to her doubts and suspicions it was an odd decision for someone like rachel to make a washing of hands a refusal to be a party to accusation and at the same time feeling a desperate need for closure what had she wanted from him the objective inspector from london what sort of proof was she after what did she know and how was he going to find it under the layers of protective emotional armor and what did it have to do with nicholas nicholas the quiet one always there always in the background had he played an objective role or a subjective one had he protected olivia or had she protected him was it knowledge that nicholas had carried to the grave or guilt hamish was angry with him telling him he was wrong but he couldnt stop himself from grasping at this particular straw it might solve so many problems its your own armor youre after any excuse you can find to shift the blame any name to put in place of the woman who bewitched you with her verse yell sacrifice him for her sake hae ye no conscience man hamish raged yet he had to know if there was a chance he had to know it finally he asked rachel what are you afraid of what are you afraid to remember who made anne fall out of that tree it wasnt an accident was it and who lured richard away on the moors he was only fi ve how could he have wandered so far on his own and who put the gun into james cheneys dead hand when brian fitzhugh was down on that beach the day he died who was he talking to someone he trusted enough to tum his back on himor her she sat in stony silence he went on quietly they were murdered you tell me you dont want to believe its true but you feel it deep inside yourself the truth just as i do and rosamund very likely died by the same hand just because the murderer is also dead doesnt matter but the truth does was it olivia or nicholas who hatedor lovedor enviedenough to commit murder no one she cried turning to face him her eyes black with despair its nonsense what you keep trying to say theres no murderer in this house i lived here i ought to know it had to be olivia or nicholas you must choose no nicholas never hurt anyone nicholas was not the kind of man whod kill childrenor his own fatheror his mother then were left with olivia noithere is no murderer i tell you but there is and you believed in it strongly enough that you sent for scotland yard no i had to know why nicholas wanted to die i couldnt believe he would want to take his own life it wasnt right it wasnt nicholas but he did or else olivia killed him no she was out of her chair lunging towards him her face stark with pain her hands balled into fists as if she wanted to pound them against him rutledge got to his feet braced she stood in front of him shaking and livid with emotion but didnt touch him go away go back to london damn you leave me in peace but you sent for scotland yard what did you know rachel that made you think it was murder nono i tell you no you thought nicholas would marry you didnt you if olivia was dead instead he chose to die with her or was killed or killed her then himself theyre the only possibilities we have her face crumpled and furious with himself for what hed done he reached for her pulling her into his arms she buried her face in the front of his coat and cried her body shaking with the force of her grief tell me what you know he urged against her hair his voice little more than a whisper he wrote to me before he diednicholas she began brokenly then the door slammed open and cormac fitzhugh came into the room his shadow springing before him across the ceiling like a great black monster breaking the spell what the bloody hell he exclaimed staring at them in sheer astonishment what are you doing whats going on here startled and redfaced her tears catching in her throat rachel broke free from rutledges hold and whirled to the nightdarkened windows as far from cormac as she could move in the little room drawing silence around her as if it made her invisible rutledge furiously angry turned on him instead the two men glared at each other shoulders tight on the balls of their feet ready to act or to block they were breathing hard for an instant the only sound in the room i might ask you the same question what is this harassment or a rendezvous their voices clashed loud and thick with the force of dislike hamish was clamoring warning rutledge ignored him his whole attention concentrated on cormac for an instant it was touch and go the policeman struggling to rein in his desire to wipe up the floor with the man in the doorway for interrupting when he did and the levelheaded entrepreneur fighting the primitive urge to feel fist against flesh the soldier and the irishman but scotland yard and the city won with difficulty cormac managed to say in a nearnormal tone i saw the light in the kitchen i came to find out who was in the house whatve you done to rachel why is she crying the hall upsets her rutledge retorted but she came to help me look for something it was kind of her leave her alone rachel has he hurt you she answered softly without turning around im all right cormac justits as he said ii still haventolivia and nicholas and stephen i if they d only hurry up and sell this house id he all right she finished despairingly i cant go i cant stay i beg you just put an end to it imthe lawyers are dragging their feet therere three wills involved he said slowly as if shed blamed him not rutledge for her tears but ill do what i can to speed up the sale he hadnt looked away from rutledge except for a brief glance at rachel now he looked back at her again let me take you home if the inspector has any more business here he can finish it in the morning damn it no im all right cormac truly you arent i can see you shaking from here he crossed the room ignoring rutledge almost daring him to step in the way then gently touching rachels shoulder he turned her towards him and gave her his handkerchief rutledge felt himself bristling as she took it gratefully and nodded her thanks for a moment burying her face in its white folds with his arm around her shoulders cormac led her past rutledge to the door but there rachel stopped and looked at the londoner with something in her eyes that he couldnt read was she asking him to go with them or begging him to stay where he was when he didnt respond she turned and let cormac take her out into the passage rutledge picked up the lamp left the tea things where they were and went down to the kitchen blowing out the lamps he set them on the kitchen table and walked out to the hall in the cold darkness of the house to his surprise cormac and rachel were still there waiting for him silhouettes without presence cormac held the door key in his gloved hand impatience marking the line of his body as he watched rutledge take his time crossing the hall then they were out in the starlit night the door slamming behind them the lock turning with a click of finality cormac came down the steps to take rachels arm and lead her along the drive rutledge feeling like a left thumband knowing that was how cormac meant for him to feelfollowed will you let me take you back to london tomorrow cormac was saying to rachel your friends keep asking when youll come to town again i promise soon but it doesnt satisfy anyone lets surprise them she had stopped crying but there were tears still blocking her throat in spite of all she could do ail the same rachel wasnt easily cowed as rutledge was learning iim just not ready cormac but thanks for the offer she glanced across at rutledge a shadowy figure to cormacs left he could see her pale face turn towards him there was steel in her voice as she added when scotland yard goes ill go if youre sure thats what you want she nodded all right i suppose it never hurts to keep an eye on whats happening daniel wont give me any peace hes insisting that i use my influence in london to get rid of the police i told him that might cause more problems but susannah is in bed right now doctors orders so he may contact the yard himself not the babyis anything wrong rachel asked quickly no just precautions but try to tell daniel that youd think he was the one carrying twins damn it ive seen foaling horses with more composure she laughed huskily as hed meant for her to thats better he told her squeezing her arm they reached the shadows of the wood and rutledge let them walk ahead his mind busy ill go to see her tomorrow rachel said ill even take inspector rutledge with me hes made the muddle let him set it to rights again but somehow rutledge didnt think that was what cormac wanted he could sense the stiffness in the man as they said good night to rachel at the cottage gate and watched her walk up the path continuing towards the inn cormac said harshly i dont understand why you dont pack it in i dont see what you can hope to achieve herecombing the moors for richard isnt going to solve any riddles or is rumor for once telling the truth youre here for other reasons what other reasons might there be rutledge parried cormac sighed i dont have any idea they walked in silence for a dozen yards listening to the sound of their shoes crunching along the road then cormac went on his voice weary what really happened in that house tonight its a police matter rutledge said refusing to be drawn dont give me that bloody rot cormac fumed if youre trying to protect rachel ive known for years how she felt about nicholas what i couldnt understand for a very long time was why he didnt love her are you quite sure olivia is the killer annes killer and possibly richards rutledge asked hoping to take him off guard cormac stopped in his tracks peering at rutledges face trying to see his eyes they were of a height and a world apart what the hell are you talking about i was just wondering if i ought to put my money on nicholas instead cormac swore inventively and viciously as they walked on even in the darkness rutledge could see the handsome brows drawn together in an angry frown no of course it wasnt nicholas i may be many things but im not a fool i know what i saw in that apple tree nicholas was a pawn she would have protected him she might well have forced him into killing himself to keep the truth hidden when she was afraid she couldnt go on controlling him yes thats a very fine idea the only problem is it doesnt work then why didnt nicholas love rachel at first i thought it was because she was there so much of his childhood like another half sister familiar and unexciting rosamund was very fond of rachel treated her like one of her own children and thats hardly the stuff great romance is made of thenlaterwhen rachel married peter i realized that nicholas was probably protecting her forcing her by his very indifference to find someone else to love if he hadnt i think olivia might have killed her too the voice in the darkness was oddly strained are you telling me that what olivia held over nicholas most of his lifethe way she bound him to herwas the threat of harm to rachel it was the only way i can think of for olivia to make nicholas swallow that laudanum unless of course she tricked him i dont want rachel to know what i think i dont want her to carry unnecessary guilt around for the rest of her life but if you keep digging thats whats going to happen youll solve your case quite neatly and shell never have a chance of finding love again if youve got any compassion at all send her back to london or better still take her back no its quite true what i told rachel ive considered going over your head pulling strings to have the yard close this case officially i know enough people in high places to get it done and its what daniel wants but even that can cause more grief than good thats the trouble with this wretched affair theres no damned solution any way i turn when rutledge didnt respond cormac was goaded into saying more than hed intended ive half a notion to find out why you arent in london working on this new ripper why youve spent a week in cornwall with nothing but speculation and a good deal of vexatious prying to show for it i thought wed been sent a proper investigator someone who knew his business and was just taking precautions because of olivias sudden fame if you were expecting a rubber stamp rutledge said you dont have much experience of the yard no i wasnt expecting a rubber stamp just a man who knew his job i cant quite understand what makes you tick inspector and why the odd persistence in a case thats finished even if nicholas and olivia between them slaughtered half the village be patient rutledge told him as he held open the inns door and youll be sure to find out it was what his father had often said to him when he was pestering his parents to know what was inside the birthday wrappings or under the silver paper on boxing day the way an adult put off a child and sure to aggravate he was delighted to see that it worked perfectly well for a grown man cormac was gone in the morning whether back to london or to the house no one seemed to know in any event as rutledge had no need to go back to the hall straightaway it didnt matter rachel came as shed promised to take him to call on susannah they went in rutledges car the sun bright through the glass and the wind bringing with it first the smell of the sea and then the smell of the land cormac is right you ought to see her yourself rachel said after a long silence susannah i mean youre a very hard man ive never met anyone quite like you you ought to see the results of your handiwork it might shame you into respecting the feelings of others as he had seen the results of his handiwork last night though for reasons of her own she refrained from mentioning that rutledge was as aware of the omission as rachel was i dont see how talking to her is going to deter me rutledge said and i owe you an apology for last night i most particularly owe you one for embarrassing you in front of your cousin it wasawkward im sorry clearing the air it had to be done and didnt serve any purpose she reminded him on the contrary he said risking a glance at her it served a variety of purposes the roads in this part of cornwall werent metalled just winding lanes for the most part hardly wide enough for a horse and cart puddles from the rains hid deep washouts while the mud itself was sometimes as slick as black ice he knew he ought to concentrate on what he was doing rachel you told me youd had a letter from nicholas before he died did i he gave her another swift glance and saw that she was frowning i dont remember saying that or didnt want to he let it go for the moment they were heading inland away from the sea the high hedgerows shut off the view and the deepcut roads tended to come suddenly out of a curve and into a crossroads where a heavy dray or a small cart was often and unexpectedly in his way he nearly missed the turning they were after but soon found the gates to the beaton house at the head of a pretty valley it was one of those medieval monstrosities the victorians had loved to build with halfruined towers crenelations and even a mock gothic gatehouse there was so much ivy climbing the walls that when the wind blew the leaves ruffled and quaked as if the walls themselves were in imminent danger of collapse gentle god rutledge said slowing the car to stare yes well im told the family knew disraeli and admired his novels enormously they couldnt wait to tear down the old house and replace it with this if you say one word youll hurt their feelings jenny beaton is a lovely person she doesnt deserve to be made unhappy im incapable of comment rutledge answered weakly mrs beaton was a lovely person the house built on the foundations of a much older structure had its finer points for one an exquisite fan ceiling in the great hall that served as a dining room the craftsman who created it knew how to turn plaster into a work of art the drawing room with its coffered ceilings and stainedglass windows looked as if it had escaped from a stage set when asked his opinion of it rutledge answered its stunning mrs beaton was satisfied rachel glared at him susannah was lying on a chair with a footstool a white lacy shawl thrown over her lap but she looked perfectly healthy to rutledge im sorry to hear youve been ordered to rest i hope it doesnt mean complications of any kind he said taking her hand in greeting no she said irritably just a fussy doctor and an equally fussy husband im perishing from boredom she glanced wryly at jenny beaton shes a terrible patient jenny agreed smiling warmly at her friend she was dark and very pretty with small hands and feet and harnish had noticed her before rutledge had wed toss her out on her ear if she had anywhere else to go sad isnt it daniels in london hes running himself thin trying to be in two places at once but the doctor refuses to let me travel just now susannah added even by easy stages she cocked her head and looked at rutledge they say youre searching the moors for richard susannah jenny beaton exclaimed who told you that i may be pregnant im not deaf well is it true yes its true rutledge told her why on earth are you interested in a child who died over twenty years ago do bodies even last that long i dont see any point in it im interested in what became of him he paused then said if hes still alive hes one of the heirs isnt he nicholas younger brother he heard rachel gasp across the small inlaid table from him but he didnt look up at her it was susannahs response he was interested in if hes alive why hasnt he turned up even a child of five knows who he is where he came from youd think hed have found a way home by now somehow susannah was fidgeting with the fringe on her shawl more from exasperation he thought than nervousness yes theres always that possibility but he hasnt im just being thorough thats all did you ever hear stories of what happened on the moor as you were growing up no it wasnt the sort of thing discussed around children and by the time i was old enough to be curious about richard or anne or even my father rosamund always managed to change the subject i remember my father but of course not the early years before he married rosamund he was brought up a catholic im told what about you and stephen or cormac were all anglican well i suppose cormac was born a catholic but he never practiced as far as i know what difference does it make does he have close ties in ireland has he ever talked about the rebellions and the uprisings michael collins the black and tans hes not interested in politics never was as far as i know cormac is typical of the cityhes very good at what he does he enjoys making money and he behaves himself reputation is money he says hes an attractive man wealthy socially acceptable why hasnt he married in his position a hostess is almost indispensable yes i know ive acted for him often enough so has rachel she shot a sidelong glance at rachel i always wonderedgrowing up watching them togetherif there might be something between cormac and olivia the tension between the two of them and the way they very carefully avoided each other she never married i thought perhaps he was the reason i wondered if she was ashamed of her bad leg and wouldnt marry him but wanted to very badly you know thats all in your imagination rachel said suddenly restless she shifted so that her face was out of the light coming through the stained glass in vivid shades of port wine and honey dappling the walls and the floor and her shoulder they never seemed to have much in common and i was around them for years before you were born which tells me susannah said that they had a lot in common didnt you find cormac attractive all my school friends were desperately in love with him everyone wanted to come down to the hall for weekends jenny beaton laughed i was fondest of stephen i had such a crush on him when i was twelve do you remember that cormacs very attractive rachel answered defensively but i never really thought of him in that way nicholas didnt like him and so you didnt susannah retorted why didnt nicholas like him rutledge asked before rachel could answer jenny was watching them her face inquisitive but he kept his eyes on susannah and rachel nicholas was the oldest son until cormacs father married rosamund susannah said it put his nose out of joint i think this newcomer lording it over him except that cormac didnt lord it over anyone thats not true nicholas was never jealous it was something else something i never did really understand until i asked rosamund about it once and she said that cormacs father replaced nicholas father and sons often found that hard to swallow she turned quickly her eyes flying to rutledges face id forgotten that conversation she said surprised i dont know why it suddenly came to mind what happened last night must have jarred my memory what do you mean what happened susannah broke in sitting up straight her face sharp with curiosity what are you talking about but rutledge knew what rachel was thinking that he had stirred up the past like a stick spun in muddy water churning up what lay at the bottom wanted or not family relationships rutledge answered for her we were discussing them after dinner disappointed susannah lay back against her cushions again well nicholas never took any resentment out on stephen or me she said and we were the children of that marriage why blame cormac it certainly wasnt his doing that mother chose to marry his father it probably changed his life far more than nicholas when you stop and think about it from the mutinous expression on her face rutledge could tell that rachel strongly disagreed but remembering susannahs health she held back the defense that seemed to be burning on the tip of her tongue but i was fond of nicholas myself susannah went on complacently he had more patience with us than most boys his age when father died i remember sitting on his knee terribly frightened about putting father into that huge cold vault in the church i kept telling everyone that hed want to be out in the light where he could hear the horses running and the sea coming in and children playing and nicholas said thats why he died out on the strand so he could be free what were putting in the vault tomorrow is only a token a place where rosamund can put flowers then he took us on a pirates hunt looking for fathers gold crucifix to put in the coffin but we never found it i dont know whether he did later or not hamish was already pointing out that it meant nothing but rutledge felt the coldness in his bones suddenly tired and out of spirits susannah added i dont want to think about death and unhappiness what youre doing in borcombe is a waste of time it distresses daniel and that always disturbs me richard is dead and so is everyone else and i dont see why scotland yard should care a hapenny about any of us stephens gone and you cant bring him back however hard you try nobody murdered him he just fell and as far as i know thats still not a crime is it so just go away and let us get on with life jenny beaton was about to interject a change of subject but rutledge was faster did your brother take olivias papers from the house those she left him regarding her writing stephen took hardly anything i feel so guilty now about how we all behaved over that likelike dustmen quarreling over the bins you were as bad as the rest of us rachel she ended accusingly her face flushing with emotion rachel was on the point of denying it then closed her mouth firmly mrs beaton hastily overrode her anyway extending an invitation to stay for luncheon but rutledge thanked her and claimed pressing business back in borcombe he and rachel left soon afterward a fine diplomat you are she accused him back on the main road shes supposed to have rest tranquillity she seemed perfectly capable of looking after herself susannah is a lot stronger than you give her credit for you arent a doctor no and neither are you now tell me about cormac and nicholas tell you what i thought id made that plain at the beatons they never found common ground they were envious of each other nicholas because cormac was older cormac because nicholas was rosamunds son and he wasnt whats wrong between you and cormac why do you bristle at each other explain that and youll see why cormac and nicholas didnt get along rutledge knew why he and cormac bristled they were at opposite ends of the pole cormac wanted the family skeletons packed away where they couldnt rattle and he rutledge was in the process of digging them out and displaying them on the village green antagonists two men used to having their own wayand each finding the other blocking it he found himself wondering suddenly if it was cormacs city reputation that he was protecting so ardentlyor a woman hed wanted to love but couldnt hamish said out of the blue the heart doesna care what she is if he wants her badly enough but the head doesna rest easy on the pillow when shes a killer which was true he rutledge still wanted jean though he knewhe had seen for himselfthat she couldnt bear to have him come near her they were nearly back to the village when rutledge pulled into a farmers muddy lane and switched off the engine turning to rachel he said you told me about a letter last night whether you want to remember telling me or not its up to you but it will save all of us a great deal of time and fuss if you simply finish what you started what will you do if i dont make me walk back to borcombe from here she retorted you know i wouldnt do that rachel for gods sake you may well be concealing evidence no im not she said fiercely turning in her seat to face him the letter was to me not to the police or an inquest full of prying eyes i dont know how you managed to make me speak of it if id been myself if you hadnt tricked me i never would have you told me the day you sent for scotland yard he said tiredly ignoring hamishs accusations and objections you made your decision then and theres nothing you can do now to take it back again i wont let you have my letter then tell me what it says there was an angry silence between them and then in a voice that was so different he didnt realize at first what she was doing she began to repeat the words from memory my dear the time has come for you to move away from thepast myself peter weve both cared for you in our differentways but im not the man you think i am i never was you must believe that and peter is gone youvegrieved for him and you may grieve for me but neitherof us could have given you the happiness you want morethan anything else you must remember that we were onlypale shadows of what life ought to bring to you the manwho will give you love and children and long years of joy i have loved you too dearly to walk away in silenceand leave you alone with an empty heart i have beenguilty of many things but i have never taken your affection for granted whatever may be said about me i have neverlied to you dont ever let them tell you otherwise yours nicholas there was a stillness in the car after shed finished he made himself look down at his hands resting on the wheel and not at her i didnt know when i got it that he was going to die i thoughti thought he was worried for me peters death mymy own feelings towards him my hopelessness about that i did knowfor some timethat olivia was having trouble again with the paralysis i suppose id told myself that in a few yearsfive perhapsshe mightsomething might happen the doctors had never held out much hope ofof a long life for her and if he was freeif i were freeif he wanted to come to me he could that for olivias sake all these years hed lied to himselflied to melied to her about how he really cared for me i told myself hed let me marry peter because he thought it was for the best i told myself that he couldnt leave olivia alone in that house with no one but the servants to look after her that hed stay with herand i respected him for thatuntil the end thatoh damn damn damn i told myself what i wanted to hear but he didnt want to go on living did he or he would have there were no tears on her cheeks when he finally looked at her only a great sadness in her face that touched him deeply and for weeks afterward i asked myself what hold did she have over him what was it that was stronger than anything he could have felt for me why couldnt she let him live what was it that olivia knew and i didnt this time there was a fierce anger in her voice a need that was so ferocious so passionately real that she had been driven to act to send for the yard rutledge didnt know what to say how to answer her instead he got out and started the car again and drove silently back to the village in front of the cottage as he pulled up the brake he said you werent prepared for murder were you noi thoughti dont know what i thought her voice was still husky but i had to know whyand there wasnt anyone else i could speak to most certainly not peters brother in whitehall i told myself that scotland yard would be objective and quick and id at least know why nicholas died thats all i wanted to hear and now now youve dragged in richardand anneand rosamund and im so frightened i cant sleep i dont want to know any more id rather believe that nicholas didnt love me than discover something awful about him that i couldnt bear to live with will you come back to the hall with me i want to show you something no i wont be tricked again this isnt a trick let me show you some things i found some things im not sure i understand but very worrying and the reasons why im still here you may be able to explain them away it would be better for all of us if you could she shook her head then raised it and looked hard at him if i do will you go away back to london and let it be that depends he said on the truth they drove to the hall taking the long way around and leaving the car in front of the steps while he led her out to the headland to see the burned stretch of land the rain had made the grass grow again and the patch was nearly covered now but she could still make it out barely frowning she said are you telling me that stephen burned olivias papers here but why he took an envelope from his pocket and shook the small objects it contained into the palm of his hand a bit of ribbon the silver edge of something the length of leather she touched them gently my first thought would be love letters seeing that ribbon was it blue do you think a woman would choose blue olivia liked green but not that pale shade it isnt the sort of ribbon you see on a womans clothing is it or the hair but a nightgown or a very young childs gown love letters would be more likely olivias id say she smiled wryly at him to hide the hurt i cant imagine nicholas being sentimental enough to keep all my letters bound in ribbon the corner of silver puzzled her for a time then suddenly she laughed of course one christmas rosamund gave us all matching frames for photographs leather and silver for traveling she said we might choose our own photographs and i had one of rosamund and nicholas i put in mine what did nicholas and olivia keep in theirs nicholas wanted one of his parents it was in his bedroom for a time i dont know what olivia chose but she said she wouldnt be traveling much and might like one of george in india because hed done her traveling for her i remember rosamund hugging her pain in her face and the leather well olivia kept a leather notebook by her bed there was a strap that closed it and a small lock i thought it was a journal but she said no it was for thoughts in the night i didnt understand what she meant until i discovered she was a poet she picked it up turning it in her fingers how sad that she burned it if thats what it was she do you think olivia did this who else cormac was the first one down here he might have taken things he didnt want us to find personal things something to do with his relationship to olivia but somehow i dont picture him out on a hillside in the dark with a fire blazing the smart thing would have been to carry them back to london and burn them there where no one would notice why in the dark why do you think this was done at night rachel shrugged it has that kind of feeling clandestine next he took her into the house and up to olivias room she entered it reluctantly looking around her as if somehow shed see the other woman standing silently in the shadows he opened the closet and began to work she watched trusting him in spite of herself to explain when he was ready but she started when one of the canes fell to the floor with a loud clatter indicating that she was very tense he continued to remove boxes from the back of the closet without a word then pulled out the shelf and carried it to the window rachel followed him and bent over him curiosity aroused their heads nearly touching as he worked using his penknife carefully to draw out the strip of wood then the cotton finally on the windowsill as before lay the row of small gold objects sparkling in the sun telling a tale without words rachel gasped moving them about in turn with her fingertip thats rosamunds ring her father gave it to her when she was very young and a silver box of wax so that she could seal all her letters she wore it on her little finger sometimes even when shed outgrown it and i remember anne wearing that locket shed let me look at the pictures if i was quiet in church were these richards the cuff buttons olivia used to put them in for him to help nannyhe couldnt be still for an instant and that fobs nicholas he was so proud of it james gave him his first watch and rosamund gave him the fob it was a beautiful watch stephen let me have itwhenwhen he was going through nicholas room the fob had been in the family for ages i thought perhaps hed taken that and that pipe cleaner is james he carried it everywhere he went i always thought it was much too handsome to use in a pipe and he laughed when i told him so i dont know about the crucifix was that the one susannah mentioned brians i never saw cormac wearing one yes it has brians initials on the back see he turned it over and she peered at it for a moment they all have initials on them he told her the mark of the owner how very odd where did you find these surely not inside that board and where did they come from olivia must have had the ring and the locket but surely not richards and james things or brians cormac might have wanted that crucifix they were hidden in the board just as i showed you one fell outthe locketwhen i was going through the closet looking for olivias papers after a time i discovered the others but why were they hidden i dont understand theyre trophies of the dead i thought that olivia had collected them from each of her victims something theyd treasured and shed coveted now i dont know he picked up the board again and the wood that slotted so perfectly into it it was nicholas who worked in wood it was his skill that must have made this hiding place i realize that now not olivias and it was nicholas who led the hunt for the crucifix susannah mentioned that what better place to keep them safe than olivias closet she wouldnt be likely would she to go moving shelves around on her own there was pain in her eyes you cant thinkbut theres the fob why should nicholas add a trophy of his own and not one for olivia if he was the killer if he killed her before he took his own life her face begged him to tell her it couldnt be true i dont know what was burned in the fire but could olivia have carried things out there burned them and come back into the house without nicholas knowing what she was doing especially if it was done at night someone made very certain that a number of things were destroyed secretly it would have been easy for him to go out there at night while olivia slept no not nicholas rachel olivia couldnt have gone out there without his knowing she could have he went into the village to the church to visit the rector to have a meal at the inn talk to people she could have done it then all right but the fireand the lettertell me that one of them knew that it was all over nicholas couldnt possibly have written to you if olivia planned all this on her own if he hadnt known what was about to happen she took a deep breath and let it out slowly he may something might have been worrying himhe might have known without really knowing you do sometimes he might havesuspected what she was planning they understood each other so well and on the moors yesterday he went on ignoring her interjection they found what looked like a small boys clothing wrapped in oiled cloth to keep it from rotting too soon that means someone stripped the boys body took away the clothing that might have made it easier to identify him thats planning rachel someone planned his disappearance if you found his clothing you must have found his bones she pointed out desperate now no i told you the body had been stripped if youre going to that trouble you dont leave the body and the clothing in the same hole it would make no sense would it next point i have a witness who says that brian fitzhugh was talking to someone on the beach just before he died can you see olivia trying to make her way down through those rocks wouldnt brian have gone up to meet her to save her the effort finally if nicholas was jealous of rosamunds remarriage to brian he wouldnt be eager to see thomas chambers move in to fill fitzhughs shoes either and it looked very much as if that could happen but chambers lived in plymouth not borcombe nicholas couldnt reach him he could stop his mother from taking a new husband in the grave she wouldnt betray him again she was his she backed over to the bed her eyes still on his face her own very bleak her mind listening whatever her heart was denying she sank down on the edge of the coverlet and as she did he caught that same illusive hint of perfume again and so did she straightening hastily she moved across the room to the desk instead as far from the fragrance as she could get you cant prove it rachel told him defiantly you cant prove any of this and i wont let you ruin nicholas memory with speculation and doubt olivia was famous they wont let you tear her down either wait and see youll end up ruining yourself but im going to find out what drives you so hard and im going to stop you before ive lost my own way and start believing this filth this was a close happy family why do you want to destroy it i want the truth he said tiredly no you dont she told him coldly youve come out of the war a broken man i can read that much in your face you need to prove yourself again and you think that the dead are easier targets than the living all right i dont know what made olivia want to kill herself i expect it was suffering that drove her to it and i dont know why nicholas wanted to die but id rather go through the rest of my life wondering than lose him entirely you dont have anything to lose do you youve never loved anyone enough to give yourself for them i must have been mad asking for scotland yard to be sent down here i believed in justice and you only believe in revenge she was moving before shed finished catching him off balance and was out the door slamming it behind her he could hear her running down the gallery almost stumbling in blind haste he didnt need hamishs warning remembering the stairs remembering how stephen had fallen on the worn treads rutledge swore and was across the room in four swift strides going after her he overtook her at the top of the steps catching her arm in a fierce grip swinging her around to face him im not trying to ruin nicholas or olivia theres murder here damn it youre an intelligent woman you could see it for yourself if you werent so bloody wrapped up in your emotions he told her furious with her furious with himself rachel didnt cry where protecting nicholas was concerned she was braver than most of the men who wore medals from the war he hoped that nicholas was worth itand feared that he wasnt dont talk to me about emotions she said her voice like ice its olivia isnt it you dont want her to be a killer you dont want all that poetry to come out of darkness and hate those damned poems blind you and everybody else olivia was a witch she had a withered leg and yet she was able to take nicholas down with her into depression and death she could kill her own sister and her own half brother and give an overdose of laudanum to her mother and still you want to see her as saint her sufferings are just another part of the myth her writing something you wrestle with because shes a woman and respect because you once thought it was a mans and women shouldnt write about lying in bed with a lover or standing kneedeep in your own ordure in a trench or how near we all are to hell but you wonder dont you what kind of lover shed have been and where she might have learned the tricks that mattered well ask cormac maybe hell tell you what she was like stung he let her go dropping his hand from her arm and she turned walking down the stairs with her head high and her shoulders straight with anger fighting for breath and control even while she still seethed with the fury consuming her at the foot of the steps she turned to look back up at him and said now you know how i felt in olivias bedroom ive given you a taste of your own poison and you found it hard to swallow didnt you i dont know if a word of what ive just said is true and i dont really care but now you can see for yourself what lies a twisted imagination might come up with how easily you can twist the truth to debase other peoples emotions i loved nicholas and i mourn the man he was and i wont believe your lies about him you can think what you like about olivia im going back to london if i can find cormac and ask him to take me but i promise you this ill ruin you if you ruin nicholas rachel listen to me no ive already listened to you and i think its all hogwash what you think is your own business what you do about what you think is very much my business consider yourself warned she walked to the door wait he commanded already on his way down the stairs why to be insulted again or worse still hurt i cant think how you could have been peter ashfords friend he was such a gentle good man ill make a bargain with you she laughed i dont bargain with the devil ignoring that he said help me find out the truth and i swear to you if nicholas is guiltyno wait let me finishif nicholas is the one im after ill walk away from it go back to london and tell the yard they were wrong there was nothing further to investigate in any of the three deaths in borcombe this spring the pastthe otherscan stay buried with him rachel stood with her back to him the doors handle in her hand the door already swinging gently towards her i dont believe you i swear and he would do it he knew that deep down inside and if it isnt nicholas then well decide what ought to be done in fairness to the dead all of the dead to o a manning to the poems that might be worse than lies ill think about that and give you my answer tonight ill send a message to the three bells the door was open now and she went through it without looking back the wind from the sea picking up strands of her hair and blowing them around her face she seemed awfully slim and lonely very small and very bereft as she moved down the steps and onto the drive skirting his car hamish was calling him a fool for swearing to such a bargain the yard brings in their man you cant turn your back on your oath no for a slip of a girl that cant see where the winds blowing so you believe me now do you rutledge silently challenged hamish you see im right i think yere a damned fool and a long way from home what is there about witchery in a woman that touches you your jean wasnt that sort shes no the kind to spin a mans head or set his soul on the brink olivia marlowe casts a spell out of her grave and yere lost it has nothing to do with jean or olivia marlowe rutledge countered watching rachels long clean strides as she walked towards the wood and it has naught to do with yon lassie either hamish retorted rutledge closed the door after rachel before she reached the shadows of the trees and then took the stairs two at a time to put away the articles hed left on olivias windowsill back into their cotton nests again for the moment until he was ready to bring them out for good his sixth sense told him hed won in his bargain with rachel he hoped he was right as he passed the closed door to nicholas room he said aloud his voice rough you should have lived you fool and married her shed have made a better wife than any youll find in the grave hamish chuckled rutledge irritated ignored him but hamish was in rutledges own mind and hamish recognized what rutledge had just admitted to nicholas that he couldnt be guilty or he wouldnt have won rachels heart it was one of the first lessons rutledge had learned at the yard that love seldom had anything to do with murder pity yes and compassion sometimes even mercy on occasion but not love and the question in this case was not whether rachel loved nicholas but how nicholas loved rachel enough to protect her as cormac had suggested or enough to use her to protect himself which had it been which way had nicholas turned as rutledge carefully worked with the little gold trophies he realized all at once that nicholas might well have included himself among the dead before swallowing his laudanum but not olivia thats why there was no trophy for olivia she had escaped through her poetry he had waited too long to kill herif thats what hed done if that was what had actually happened shed already found her wings of fire rutledge drove thoughtfully back to borcombe and didnt realize until he stepped around the men seated on their sunwarmed bench before the inn door drinking their beer that hed missed his lunch hamish pointed out that the dining room had already closed which did nothing to improve rutledges mood he felt he was ready to start taking statements from his witnesses mrs trepol and wilkins the gardener rachel and cormac smedley dr penrith and dr hawkins getting it on paper where he could sort it challenge it or use it to move forward but borcombe was a tiny place and everyone knew everyones business to speak to people to ask them for a general picture of the family at the hall and the events that mightor might notimpinge on matters that concerned him stirred up talk and rumors to ask for official statements was tantamount to providing a blueprint for exactly what he was after old murders not new ones room for constable dawlish and his choleric superior to raise hell with london bringing bowles down on him like a cyclone demanding to know what he meant by stirring up the county causing problems for the yard when it already had its hands full room too for cormac to have him recalled summarily citing harassment of a prominent family never mind the local police and hed be forced to reveal more than he could at the moment defend publicly but he knew he was right all his experience at the yard his own intuition the facts that he could be sure of pointed to a long coldblooded series of killings that had spanned years cunningly planned meticulously carried out skillfully concealed a few more days hed have to wait damn it on the statements it would be foolhardy to push on and wreck everything which merely added to his frustration and hamish was there already taking advantage of it rutledge tried to shut him out the clamor in his head was ferocious and he forced himself to ignore it very well then he promised himself wait he would until he had finally talked to the local man inspector harvey and seen the way the wind blew there it could make a difference in his planning he had to accept that sidestepping someone coming down the stairs as if he owned them rutledge settled for mentally laying out his schedule which of the villagers should give statements first what approach he was going to take in the questions asked how he might draw out of each witness exactly what he wanted without arousing rampant speculation and how fast he could accomplish the lot there was also the dilemma of what had become of olivias papers he was going to have to find them he realized the man on the stairs was staring hard at him eyes narrowed and angry rutledge looked up at him for the first time and swiftly shelved his own thoughts rutledge the stranger demanded inspector rutledge im rutledge yes inspector harvey the man retorted with equal curtness ive come to speak to you swearing silently at the timing of harveys unexpected appearancesplitting headaches were not the frame of mind in which to conduct painstaking interviews with choleric cornishmen rutledge led the way to the small parlor where today sunlight tried fretfully to light the gloom we can have privacy here he said holding open the door and advantage to me on my own ground he thought to himself it appeared that he well might have need of it harvey followed still huffing from the stairs he was a bluff man neither tall nor short but heavy in build with a red complexion and thinning dark hair there was an air of having his own way about him as if on his own ground he was used to being heeded and his advice or instructions followed there couldnt be rutledge thought to himself many police matters in this pan of cornwall which might draw the attention of london what there was in the way of crime and mischief would be comfortably divided between the police and the local magistrates in short tread carefully im glad to meet you finally rutledge said holding out his hand harvey looked pointedly at it and walked on into the room refusing to take it finally is the key word here isnt it he asked keeping his voice flat you were in plymouth when i came and youve only just returned i think dawlish told me you were somewhere on the moors talking to a farmer about wild dogs attacking his domestic animals so i was it doesnt mean im blind to whats happening i dont like strangers meddling on my patch not without my keeping an eye on them or having regular reports from them to keep me in the picture looks bad when i know less than my constable and less than london i dont see whats wrong with our initial investigation into the three deaths in question and i dont see why you havent long since come and gone with a clean bill of health on my desk to clear the air in borcombe as a matter of fact nothing appears to be wrong with your initial inquiries i believe that stephen fitzhugh died as you said he did in a fall its the other deaths that interest me and i accept them as suicides just because miss marlowe turned out to be famous is thats what this is in aid of sending a detective inspector all this way playing merry hell with my reputation and her familys reputation all to suit the wigs in london who realized too late theyd missed the opportunity of seeing their names in the times in connection with her death or are you in fact looking for a wee success to set off the yards regrettable failure to stop this knifewielding idiot on the loose in london oh yes ive seen the papersnobody has a clue now the local people tell me youre trying to find a link down here with master richard cheney the boy lost on the moors ridiculous doesnt cover it thats because what you hear from your own people is not in any way the point of my investigation but if thats what theyd prefer to think then id prefer to let them harvey all but snorted what im asking you man is to tell me what youre after not what you want the villagers to believe harvey was feeding on his own sense of betrayal letting it fuel his anger it was a technique used sometimes by men wanting their own waymake life unpleasant enough for the other party and hed be too busy defending himself to attack rutledge considered his own tactics then said nicholas cheney had a brother whos been missing since he was five we presently have no way of knowing if the boy is dead or alive if alive he may be an heir if dead theres a possibility it wasnt accidental that he was deliberately murdered by whom pray and if the family was concerned about him still being alive after the search was called off and the posters brought in no responses or later was wanting to know something more about his death why didnt they come to my predecessor or to me would you have listened or would you have assured them they could safely believe what theyd rather believe that the boy died of simple exposure any new search was bound to lead to the same conclusion harvey bristled i dont tell comfortable lies whatever youre used to in london and i know how to conduct a search im sure you dont tell comfortable lies rutledge agreed and given the facts at your disposal where would you start searching from what i can see there was very little evidence of foul play unless some passing gypsies carried the boy off or someone wandering on the moors stumbled on him and killed him for reasons of his own and the officer in charge examined those possibilities very thoroughly at the time richard went missing even when you took over here you had no reason to suspect more than some sort of tragic accident what has changed now is the way were looking at the disappearance and that in itself may prove to be the key and what is that pray he wandered off during a family picnic and was lost and is long dead most likely because the moors are unforgiving why should i have raised false hopes and as to the present cases would it have prevented miss olivia marlowe from taking her own life or mr nicholas from doing the same would it have straightened mr stephens cracked neck i think not his own neck was red to his collar with the power of his anger no but it might have righted a very old wrong it might have revealed secrets that the family itself didnt know the answers to it might make it clearer to us whose will took precedence and at what time who has the right to sell trevelyan hall and who has none it was my understandingstill isthat miss olivia and mr nicholas had nearly identical wills in that event i dont quite see legal quibbling over which is which and i can tell you that mr nicholas was a very straightforward man very able concerned about his responsibilities to the church and the village fought in the war did his duty like the gentleman he was hamish interrupting wanted to know what being a gentleman had to do with fighting in france rutledge ignored him and in my opinion had long ago put to rest the question of his brothers death never spoke of it to me in the past fifteen years and never spoke to my predecessor about it either or itd have been in the record which leaves us with miss olivia and i dont know that id put much past her it was so different from any other comments hed heard about olivia that rutledge was surprised harvey smiled with sour satisfaction were not all clods here in the wilds of cornwall whatever london may have led you to believe no one has suggested that you might be rutledge said moving with great care now tell me what reasons you have to back up your opinion read her books man my wife is a decent woman shed never so much as feel or think what miss marlowe thought fit to put down baldly in print its unwomanly and disturbing a mind capable of such immodesty is in my estimation capable of the worst in human degradation hed spoken with such venom that rutledge found himself wondering what olivia had done to raise harveys hackles he thought he knew shed been miss marlowe of the hall quiet and unassuming someone he could patronize the cripple who was content to be seldom seen and not often heard a tidy round peg in her tidy round hole like mrs harvey and then the truth about o a manning had come out and harvey had been made to look or feel a fool for misjudging her that would be unforgivable and hed judge her with a vengeance now rutledge quelled the urge to rise to olivias defense his own temper held on a tight rein harvey had already moved on to his next grievance now tell me what this new evidence you spoke of might be those rags they found out on the moors youll never prove they belonged to the boy could have been put there any time in the years before or since dont they teach you your business in london quite well rutledge said through his teeth and i intend to continue going about it until im satisfied harvey was furious but something about the other mans voice the steel in it the natural air of command that came with years in france made him stop short and reexamine his opponent his first impression had been of an ill weary man with no stamina for the course someone who could be bullied and sent back to london with his tail between his legs stake your ground wield your temper like a club and hed soon apologize and be off instead hed come up against hard core and more experience than hed expected harvey tried to think if hed heard the name rutledge before in connection with any of the major cases the yard had handled it rattled him more that he couldnt knowing what rutledge might be capable of gave him more range to push not knowing left him in pitch dark on a steep cliff rutledge meanwhile was making his own assessment of a man who did his job thoroughly and properly but lacked imagination to do it cleverly that was going to matter a great deal after a swift appraising silence both men moved to chairs and sat down as if the confrontation was finished and the conference begun as a form of peace offering rutledge said apart from your natural disinclination to see a case opened again for no sound reasonand i understand that id dislike it myself were you quite serious when you said that miss marlowe was capable of anything any degradation would you for instance include murder in that list and then harvey surprised him a second time by vacillating yes and no if you discount her poetry and her reputation there what gave you the feeling that she was different or was it all hindsight the willingness to believe that olivia hadnt hoodwinked him completely mulling it over harvey said it was not something i could put my finger on mind you it was more her interest in the subject of crime that made me uneasy people most especially women dont think to ask the questions she asked unless theres worry in the mind or fear or even depravity now in a pub talking to a man about my work ill be asked a hundred questions from how i know ive got the right miscreant to whether ive watched a hanging thats different its curiosity the same as hed ask an undertaker or even a glassblower about his trade idle conversation you can tell the man knows naught about it and you could give him lies and hed be just as satisfied rutledge nodded the farmers and tradesmen and lorry drivers hed fought with had often found it odd to be in the same trench as a policeman as if he viewed all mankind with innate suspicion expecting the worst so it was different when miss olivia asked me what made a man take another mans life what goaded him whether he was evil by birth and nature or only caught up in a web of happenstance he couldnt fight his way clear of whether murdering ran in families or wasnt inheritable he paused rutledge realized that harvey had kept this conversation buried deep inside himself for a very long time and was only reluctantly revealing it now because he was a fair man whatever he lacked in cleverness whether a murderer could truly repent and change and her as fair and innocent looking as the day she were bom i didnt know about the poetry not then but i can tell you it gave me the willies because she was that intense i knew it wasnt idle talk meeting the new man in charge and making polite noises about his job she wantedshe wanted something more and i couldnt have told you on peril of my life what it was knowing about murder isnt the same as killing a victims family may understand it better than the murderer himself if nicholas had been the killer olivia would have felt it deep in her very bones aye thats true but once i read some of her verse now i knew it was inside that woman and not something shed happened to think of meeting me on the road like that last book has one poem in it that kept me sleepless of nights for nearly a week the sheer cruelty of it i dont recollect what its called but im not likely to forget how it started murderer i am of little things small griefs treasures of the heart of bodies and of souls i have takenall that is there to give lifes blood the spirits wealth and these secrets i keep locked away for my own joy and your pain not what mrs browning might write or even that rossetti woman no rutledge said quietly considering possible treasures of the heart those small golden trophies of a death are you thinking she killed that boy good god she was hardly more than a child herself you said you believed she was capable of murder harvey looked at him mind working mind sorting but not coming up with anything he could put into words aye thats true enough in the heat of the moment i felt it could be so but its different when you have a face to put to someone she mayve killed he shook his head we dont get many child murderers in these parts i wasnt that fond of the woman but its another matter saying she was one she was different that was her problem she was different there was something in his eyes that pleaded for rutledge to understand what he was trying to say that whatever olivia marlowe was by its very extraordinariness she was outside the realm of his comprehension and therefore suspect even if he couldnt condemn her for a specific crime capable of anything when did this discussion with olivia take place oh long before the war id just arrived in borcombe i didnt know her mother the one they still call miss rosamund that everyone was so fond of and i knew only that miss olivia was one of the family up at the hall her and her brother and the two younger ones the twins how did you answer her i had to tell her the truth as i saw it that the darkness in the human soul was something id never come to understand in my years of policing but i believed it to be beyond healing that struck her as sad i could see it in her eyes and then she said do families believe you when you tell them a sonor a daughteris guilty of murder i said theyre often the last to believe and she nodded as if she understood and thanked me for my time and walked away when rutledge made no answer harvey added not a natural conversation to have with a young woman would you say he wanted reassurance he wanted to believe that olivia and not he himself had been out of line he didnt want to think that she had had a guilt on her conscience had turned to the figure of authority in borcombe and been rejected because he had somehow failed to understand her rutledge wondered if shed brought this up before with harveys predecessor or the rector before smedley and found no absolution for the burden she carried which meant in turn that rutledge was not going to confide in harvey either not until he was sure of his ground it would be wasted breath and if he rutledge turned out to be wrong the damage as rachel had pointed out and cormac as well could be enormous and so in pacification rutledge said to the end of the week then ill continue the search for the boy ill continue my questions and then if i have no more to go on than i have now ill come to you and confer find him or not mark my words the lad is dead the innkeeper trask brought a tray and a pot of coffee to rutledge in his room and made a show of setting the cup within reach putting out the sugar bowl and small pitcher of milk refolding the napkin that had covered the thick sandwiches affably mentioning harveys visit he showed all the signs of a man prepared to linger and gossip for once rutledge preferred the innkeepers opinions to the silence of his own thoughts or hamishs a good man weve had no complaint of him keeps the peace and is fairminded the magistrates seem to think well of him too from what i hear thorough thats the reputation they give him disappointed when rutledge didnt take the hint and offer his own views on the local constabulary trask reminisced for a time about the trevelyan family leaving the impression that the three bells had been the center of social life for generations of them rutledge swallowed that with his first cup of coffee and a grain of salt then something the innkeeper was saying caught his attention and of course her mother was the old nanny there thats the reason miss rachel prefers the cottage to the inn are you telling me that the trevelyan nanny is still alive he felt a surge of wrath that no oneleast of all rachelhad seen fit to tell him that lord no shed be near ninety wouldnt she polworth her name was shed been nanny to miss rosamund then married and had a daughter of her own mary and when mary was off to school she went back to the hall to care for mr stephen and miss susannah only ever had the one child herself mr polworth died of the consumption early on mary otley the daughter is now husband was killed out in africa place called mafeking soldier god save you sir no he were a missionary his death took the heart out of mary and she came home wasnt her cup of tea so to speak preaching to the heathen suffering from dysentery and them big flies and water not fit to drink thank you trask rutledge said cutting him off trask wasted another few minutes filling his tray with the empty dishes brushing away crumbs leaving the pot of coffee as if hoping for another opening but he got none and soon took the hint afterward rutledge sat there and listened to the birds singing outside his window in the ruined garden laying his plans carefully it was nearly four in the afternoon when rachel left the cottage and crossed the road to the rectory disappearing into the house when the liverish housekeeper opened the door rutledge lying in wait in the small wood from which he could see the cottage quite clearly gave her a full minute in case the call was a short one then strode quickly to the gate that shut the cottage walk off from the village street the woman who opened the door to his knock was elderly but not he thought as old as she appeared to be from the yellow of her eyes he could see that shed had malaria more than once and still paid dearly for her years in africa it was not a continent that was kind to european women startled to see him she said miss rachels just gone over to visit rector her voice held a degree of reserve and no cornish accent i know i wanted to speak to you if i may mrs otley is it i understand that your mother was nanny at the hall she let him in and the room itself reflected the odd life shed lived there was the coziness of chintz embroidered cushions and a worn axminster carpet a zulu shield hung cheek by jowl with a crossed pair of long deadly spears on the wall next to a print of the king and queen in a wooden frame and a handlettered certificate stating that mary polworth otley had crossed the equator on the ship ramses the chair she pointed out to him wore a fine fringe of pale cream dog hairs resigning himself to collecting them on his clothing rutledge wondered where the dog was it came trundling in a fat puppy that sniffed his trousers and then tried to tear his shoelaces out by the roots mrs otley referring to it as rhodes shooed it away and sat down her face solemn what was it you wanted to see me about sir if youre here to ask questions about miss rachel no i was more interested in your mothers work at the hall did she talk about the family very often to me no sir she adored miss rosamund you could see that and was very fond of the children at the hall but she wasnt one to make comparisons and she treated their business as theirs and mine as mine which was certainly to her credit did you play with the trevelyan children no sir i was far older than any of them i did lend a hand in the nursery from time to time when there was sickness or company coming it helped me when i was out in africa teaching little ones were you there when anne marlowe fell out of a tree in the orchard or when young richard was lost on the moors no i was away at school i wanted more than anything to be a governess and miss rosamund was kind enough to take an interest in me she sent me to miss kitcheners academy in kent a rueful smile moved quietly across her face then in my first position as governess i met edwin just back from africa and a widower he was a fiery man full of god and grand ideas i became the third mrs otley but this time it was edwin who was buried in africa not his wife i came home a widow and childless i worked in a slum school in london for a time telling myself it was best for me to stay busy in the church but it wasnt i hadnt had a calling you see only edwins dream second hand he could hear the sense of grief not for her husband or herself but for the waste of her life on something she hadnt believed in and then as if shed picked up his earlier conclusion she said africas hard on women thats why i persuaded miss rachel not to follow peter ashford to kenya she was all for going shed have been left out there a widow if she hadnt listened andand for many reasons i was right he wondered if mary otley knewor guessedabout rachels feelings for nicholas he asked a few more questions that took him nowhere then stood to go rhodes caught napping leaped to his own feet before he was quite awake and scrambled to the attack rutledge sidestepped smoothly and the little dog skidded to a halt by the chair taking on its already wellchewed skirts instead but mrs otley looking up at rutledge and ignoring the dog as if used to mock battles said of course i was back here in borcombe when nicholas nearly died if thats any help to you sir i wouldnt want miss rachel to know of it but she tells me youve an interest in such happenings at the hail and i wouldnt want to be remiss in my duty but if it serves no purpose id as soon have it left a secret if you wouldnt mind secret rutledge repeated as unprepared as rhodes for the sudden shift in direction yes it was kept very quiet at the time no one wanted it talked about but i suppose it doesnt do any harm now if youre interested in the familys history as they say in the village you are though god knows why they were always perfectly respectable people up at the hall tell me he spoke more sharply than hed intended there isnt much to tell actually he was coming home to the hall late one night mr nicholas hed been visiting the rectorthis was well before the war oh or thereabouts and thered had been rumors at the time about mr nicholas leaving soon to see some of the ships being built up on clyde bank in scotland those liners everyone was talking about and the prize for the atlantic crossing speed record young stephen told me hed overheard mr cormac saying hed look into finding a place for mr nicholas in one of the fleets if he was interested but i dont know if thats true or not nothing came of it at any rate on the way home from rectors mr nicholas was stabbed by some drunkard too drunk to know what he was about thank god because the knife missed mr nicholas heart and took a long slash out of his ribs instead dr penrith sewed him up ordered him to stay in his own bed and not go wandering off to london or scotland or anywhere else and that was the end of that i dont think anyone knew about it except miss olivia and the doctor and of course me because the poor man dragged himself to my door when he couldnt make it through the wood and up the hill to the hall and the drunkard oh he was long gone away by the time miss olivia took some of the grooms out to hunt for him she told them only that the mand been making a nuisance of himself on the drive i daresay he fled the minute hed seen what hed done drunk or not hed have known thered be a hue and cry over it and rachel never knew she was away and miss olivia said shed be here in a flash worrying herself to death and to no good purpose i agreed and never said a word to anyone mr nicholas ran a fever for a day or two then began to heal it wasnt as if miss rachel was needed to help nurse him did nicholas get a good look at his assailant he said he was too rattled at the time to take much notice except that the man was tall and thin and dressed poorly which was very unlike him to my mind not one to lose his nerve mr nicholas but men are strange sometimes when it comes to pride he wouldnt have a fuss made over it someone dragged up before the magistrate for the attack everyone talking rutledge agreed with her first comment nicholasraided he thought it was much more likely that nicholas knew exactly who had attacked him and didnt want to say and could that explain the gold watch fob in the small collection in olivias closet had she tried to stop him from leaving her and the hall he asked mrs otley not to mention the matter to rachel or anyone else for the time being and left the house before rhodes had finished trouncing the chair skirt and recollected his shoelaces rutledge went off through the woods not ready to return to the inn restless with the complexities of the evidence in front of him needing the physical exercise to clear away the temptations offered to absolve olivia of blame it was still there deep inside although he knew it was wrong a muddle of emotions from the war from his loss of jean his insecurities the persistent fear he might still be unready to do his job properly olivias poetry had been an anchor for many men why hadnt the woman herself lived up to the talent shed been given he crossed the lawns of the hall noticing in the afternoon light that the house seemed to have changed since he came to borcombe once it had seemed warmly welcoming then haunted and alive with pain nowit was odd but he could sense it stronglythere was merely emptiness as if the occupants man or ghost had given up on the living and gone away but it had only been a trick of the light he told himself that had once made the house seem to him so vital and the fineness of the architecture which led the senses astray he made himself remember instead the house that hed just visited the beatons victorian deception a house without a soul his father would have called it because it had been built to reflect a passion not as a thing in and of itself the ghosts there would be just as fraudulent wanting to be noticed as part of the decor wandering in the turrets and along the battlements like figments of the style not as figments of reality he smiled at the fanciful thought for a time he stood down by the shore near the rocks where brian fitzhugh had died watching the sea come in listening to hamish reminding him that what you wanted was not to be considered as proper evidence and yere missing something man yere wrapped up in your feelings because that woman made sense of the war for you and sense of love and blinded you with her bonny words use your head yell no find yon murderer in the sea nor in the answers people gie you and yell no find it in rachel marlowes memory mark my words yell find it in black and white or gie it all up for good what about the clothes on the moor he asked as gulls called overhead blotting out the sound of his voice someone stripped the lad thats what it means and why strip a corpse to keep him from being identified no theyd know god help them who the boy was it was done for another reason not to prevent identification but to confuse confuse dye no think that the mother of that child would know his flesh clothed or bare rotting or whole shed know and if they found the clothes but not the boy shed know those as well rutledge sighed true so why strip the boy then bury the clothes in an oiled sack or cloth making them last as long as possible rather than letting them rot youd think the sooner they rotted the better as far as the killer was concerned all right who stripped the body if i had the answer to that id know the whole and why the poem about the pansies pansies for remembrance i dont think anyone was likely to forget that wretched child nicholas or olivia that was his choice break rachels heartor wound his own by taking away that one small thing olivias poetry had given him a little space of comfort in a bloody terrible war he skimmed a few stones across the incoming tide watching them skip and dance just as his evidence seemed to skip and dance from one suspect to the other and yet he knew as strongly as he knew where he was standing at this instant that it was not the two of them not working together it had to be oneor the other and he knewgod help himhe knew which walking back to the wood he saw the old woman by the trees standing there staring up at the house looking for something in its shadows needing something it could no longer give sadie whose mind wandered but whose brain understood more than she was telling him he was convinced of that or else it was something she didnt know that she knew she turned to stare at him as he came over the rise of the lawns and turned towards her he thought at first she was going to leave before he reached her disappearing so as not to be faced with more seemingly useless questions but after a twitch of indecision she stayed her ground a fine evening isnt it he asked trying to test her mental stability as always whos strolling on the lawns today which spirits do you see i see miss rosamund weeping i see the gabriel hounds sniffing around the chimneys their big feet pattering on the roof like hailstones sniffing looking searching theyll howl in the night once theyve scented prey ill be snug in my own hearth corner when they howl the gabriel hounds her favorite theme when her mind was disturbed he said did you see the hounds when the light brigade charged did you hear them howling and racing across the field with the guns i wasnt there was i i was back in hospital waiting for the dying but i heard them howling heathen they were those russians no better than the turks bloody heathen with nothing to lose having no souls no souls i thought the turks went to paradise if they died in battle paradise pshaw a place of pools and cool water with dancing girls no better than they ought to be and wine to soak the brain in forgetfulness i dont call that much of a reward for the faithful endless whoring and sinfulness thats what it means but fit for hounds they know no better he said who are the hounds of gabriel here at trevelyan hall the same as the others she said looking away from the hall to study his face heathen protestant catholic neither and thats the point now isnt it an unbaptized soul with nothing but evil filling it darkness not light rutledge thought for a long moment olivia and anne were twins was sadie trying to tell him that one of them hadnt been properly baptized that with two babies screaming bloody murder by the baptismal font one had been baptized twice and the other not at all he said was olivia baptized was anne she looked at him as if hed run mad do you think miss rosamund would allow it otherwise of course they were i was there i watched the babes handed to the old rector one at a time there was blue ribbon on miss olivias christening gown and pale green on miss annes to be sure twas all done properly green ribbon a christening gown no he couldnt quite see that who burned some small personal belongings in a fire just above the gardens beyond the headland where the blaze couldnt be seen from the village what fire oh come now inspiration struck the rags you wanted the rags thatd been promised to you by miss olivia someone used them instead to keep a fire going because there were a number of things heor shewanted to burn well a leather notebook a leather picture frame with silver corners a pile of letters perhaps who was it who wanted such possessions destroyed it werent mr cormac she said briskly nor miss rachel id have known it could have been mr nicholas i dont know why hed go there in the dark to burn them but i know it might have been him that did it because of what i saw what did you see he kept his voice low gentle curious but not probing i saw him with pails going down to the sea to fill them with water and then he set them up on the headland left them there and walked back into the house with empty hands nicholas was this the night they died olivia and nicholas notwas the night before i was in the wood looking for roots while the moon was near full i watched him for a time because my back hurt and it felt better to straighten it so i stood there and wondered what he was about and then i knew knew knew what he was putting water out for the hounds to drink because he knew they were coming he felt a coldness between his shoulders as if something evil had come up behind him and laid a hand on his back do the gabriel hounds have a human face have you ever seen it i told you miss olivia warned me to have naught to do with them yes i understand that but miss olivia is dead i think the hounds killed her i think now shed want you to be the one to tell me his name or how he looked i think its time to make them pay for the harm theyve done she shook her head you cant make the hounds pay for killing its in their nature its part of their blood like the turks was mr nicholas baptized aye at the hall because he was sickly at first jaundice and there was a storm coming that promised to be a bad one miss rosamund said shed not risk him driving in the carriage nor in the drafty church truth to tell he was better within the week but she insisted and the old rector came to the hall did a baptism in the hall count for less in her eyes than one in the church she was leading him round in circles but hamish highland bred understood better what was being said and rumbled with uneasiness beneath the surface of his mind the face of the hounds you said you could tell me now that miss olivia is dead rutledge added safely dead her eyes were clouding over and she said querulously you said it i didnt after a time he left her there and walked back to the village on impulse he stopped at the church the heavy west door was locked but the smaller one in the porch was not he lifted the latch and walked inside there was a chill in the place the stone cold as death he stood for a moment looking at the architecture the style of the arches the strength of the pillars the tall nave that bowed before a shorter older choir it was a very fine church but not distinguished its proportions made it fall just short of perfection the carvings unlike the angel in the churchyard were heavier earthier more formidable and less delicate like some of those hed seen in normandy he walked down the central aisle looking back over his shoulder at the victorian organ in the loft then towards the stone altar that was rather handsomely carved as if it had come from an old monastery the choir was plain the stalls of dark oak and off to its left was an octagonal chapel dedicated to the trevelyan family dead there was a knight in the far shadows old and worn and memorials set into the walls for the dead lying in the crypt below a very beautiful marble sarcophagus made for two held the remains of rosamund trevelyans parents weeping figures at each corner veiled and bent must have been carved to represent earthly mourning above the tomb where the arches entwined in perpendicular harmony a cherub with a trumpet floated among voluptuous robes to one side was a smaller tomb carved from what appeared to be a solid block of alabaster with a delicate tracery of flowers and birds more like a wedding bower than a place of burial a figure on the top was barely visible in its shroud the body seeming to melt into the marble earth almost as it touched but at the head the shroud was opened to show a womans features with curling strands of hair escaping to frame them as if holding back death it was rosamund he realized as he looked down into her face there was beauty and strength dignity and love there warmth a woman who had much to give in her own right and in the arms of her family a woman who had lost three husbands and two of her children but never faltered a veritable pillar of life even in death he touched the cold marble cheek and almost swore he could feel its own warmth against his hand but it was an illusion and he knew it on the wall to his left were several family memorials the one for stephen set between his fathers and a slender pillar that supported the chapel was inscribed with his name dates the trevelyan and fitzhugh coats of arms and his rank and regiment in the war and in the back their newness brightening the darkness there were two blocks of black marble side by side incised in them were simply the names and the dates of the dead olivia and nicholas plain for suicides for a moment he stood looking at them wishing he could reach the living people they had been but it was too late for that except in olivias poetry extending his arm he again laid his palm against the marble seeing its reflection against the lettering as if in a black mirror the long fingers the strong palm his hand no one elses was it you olivia or nicholas he asked aloud nicholas the echo repeated softly and you are free of guilt free of guilt it replied who was your lover was it cormac the echo caught the question in his voice as it responded cormac and who is the hound of gabriel rial do you know if so where will i find the answer answer is it in your papersor your poetry poetry he stepped across the small space to where he could touch nicholas memorial ignoring the forcefulness of hamishs voice calling it witchcraft to question the dead warning him not to meddle in such matters to leave it be i talk to you how is that so different he retorted in his mind after a moment he asked the shining black face of nicholas marker were you the killer olivia protected but in that single step hed shifted the odd acoustics of the chapel and there was no echo to answer him only the sound of his own breathing as if even in death nicholas knew how to hold his peace back at the inn rutledge ate a fast meal in one corner of the dining room an old book hed found in the parlor propped in front of him to ward off conversation from either trask or any other diners but it was still early and he had the place to himself asking for another pot of coffee and a cup he went up to his own room to open the books of poetry again they seemed to raise more questions than they answered but he thought it might be his own frame of mind raising doubts not the lines he read over and over the last volume lucifer had very little of the lyricism of keats and more of the strength of milton the writer was coming into maturity looking at life and death as if they were the same a coming from darkness and a returning to it a brief bright glorious span that was often marred by mans own incapacity to learn and trust he found the poem that had disturbed inspector harvey and read it first what harvey hadnt remembered was the title it was oddly enough the failure rutledge thought about that for a time then moved on the poem about eve seemed on the surface to answer the question of the tree of knowledge from which shed taken the apple eating it had opened her eyes to the realities of life and cost her the garden of eden but looking at it not as verse instead as the experience of a young girl faced suddenly and shockingly with the death of a loved oneher own twinrutledge saw something else something hed have missed if he hadnt delved so deeply into the history of the trevelyan family eve was olivia tasting of the knowledge that evil existed and struggling to understand it to find a place for it in her small comfortable oncesafe childhood world losing her own garden of eden watching helplessly as the serpent twined itself into the branches and plucked the apple but it was anne who had fallen and the last lines proved it to him the apple was one i knew had loved and would not wish to fall lt was myself my other self and terrified my soul denied it all denying that murder had taken place refusing to believe in it but then annes death was the first to happen and they were all children at the time whatever olivia might have seen whatever she might have understoodor fearedmurder was not a reality she was ready for cruelty perhaps shed comprehend that because children are capable of great cruelty a knowledge of murder would come afterward meanwhile olivia had lived with silent terrified grief he sat there forgetting to watch the sunset forgetting the coffee growing cold in his cup his mind focused on the finely printed words on the richly watermarked page then after a time he moved on again several pages later when he had nearly convinced himself that the interpretation hed given to eve was subjective not objective he found the next movement in a symphony of pain and grief the title was the prodigal son and it seemed to capture the story of the youngest son who left home taking his share of his inheritance with him leaving older brothers to support their aging father but life had not been kind to him and he returned a failure expecting to be a slave in his fathers holdings only to be treated like the lost and golden boy hed been richard it could be no one else richardstill alive no that was impossible but still a threat to his brothers because his body hadnt been found they would be left to wonder what had become of him to wonder if he might someday come home in truth rutledge thought about that the second murder there had been a long and intense search for the boy no sign of him had been found flyers and posters had been sent out gypsies and tramps questioned farms fringing the moors turned inside out he himself reading over the reports and the final verdict had believed that the killer had hidden the corpseno body no evidence of foul play but what if that was all wrong what if murder had been made to look like an accident a drowning a fall a boys game of hide and seek that had tragically pitched him headfirst into a mine shaft knocked down and trampled by wild ponies there were any number of possibilities then consider someone else had found the bodynot a search party of half a dozen men but one person who might well have known for other reasonsor guessedwho was behind this carefully arranged scene and who might have decided that richards deathirreversible in itselfmight still be a threat to his murderer gathering up the corpse carrying it away in the night while the searchers were occupied on the moor taking it where it might never be discovered someone had altered the murderers design left a question mark in his mind a doubt a worry and later near where the body had been lying the clothes had been buried in case the murderer came back to search on his own for the child that the searchers ought to have found hamish was busy picking the concept to pieces but rutledge ignored him you couldnt bury richard in the church or the churchyard any digging or movement of stones there would have been suspect nor at the hall there were gardenersthey would have seen the first signs of a grave large enough to hold a fiveyearold most of the villagers had gardens too digging in them every season turning them over disturbing the soil the wood then no it was too close to the hall within sight and sound of the village as well the sea it sometimes failed to give up its secrets and other times it brought them back to shore all right none of the obvious choices then but somewhere safe for the boy as well as the person whod moved him who could be trusted to keep such a dark and horrible secret someone who might not know what it was rutledge got up and went to the wardrobe hed brought a heavy sweater with him dark woolwith dark trousers he was nearly invisible in the night and there was an entrenching tool in the boot of his car changing quickly he shut the door of his room and went downstairs no one was around though he could hear voices from the back by the kitchens letting himself out the front door he went around to his car found the small shovel and set off on his macabre errand hed learned in the war to move silently in the darkness snipers trip wires booby traps minesevery step might bring sudden death where you put your feet and how decided whether you came back safely and unseen or not at all and so he walked with stealth and care leaving the village circling well out of his way letting the starlight and his own sense of direction guide him after half an hour he came to the small cottage halfnestled halfcrouched in its narrow valley there was lamplight at one of the windows and he stood in the shadows of the hillside waiting and listening women like sadie sometimes had a sixth sense and the cat she kept would hear him if she didnt the lift of its head the twitching ears the eyes narrowed and stillit was as good as any alarm after a time moving with extreme care the wind blowing towards him to carry both scent and sound away he searched the gardens when hed asked whether or not she grew pansies sadie had answered that they didnt dry well that was probably true but hed taken it to mean that she didnt have any of the plants in her garden and that had been his mistake how much did the old woman know or perhaps more to the point how much had she known she hadnt always been senile there might have been a time when she was a willing party to what was happening but just as it was impossible to turn back the clock it was nearly impossible to lift the veil in that old and tired brain well then make some assumptions could richard have been brought here without in any way involving sadie if the boy had been buried here could sadie have been told that a small patch of pansies set apart from her own flowers was a reminder of a brother lost a private place to grieve possible yes likely no on the other hand she might have pretended to believe and whatever suspicions she might have harbored deep in her unsettled mind shed have kept them to herself it all came down to how much she understood about the killings at the hall and whether she knew the face of a murderer he made each step with minute attention to the ground so as not to leave prints in the earth or crushed blossoms in his wake his eyes roving this way and then that not near the cottage no and not where the herbs and flowers grew best not where heavy rains might wash the bones out nor where the boy wouldnt be under the eye of his mentally frail and possibly unwitting guardian and disguised somehow the kind of place that wouldnt draw attention to itself or tempt anyone to rearrange it and he found it on the hillside just where a small natural outcropping formed the anchor of an asymmetrical rock garden it was no more than a few feet wide in any direction yet large enough for a childs curled body a spill of unusual white stones brought from somewhere else lay like a small river tucked in among the flowers pansies and some sort of small narrow leafed things that formed a mat plants that would reseed themselves half tame half wild clinging among the stones and holding the earth with their roots he squatted there in the darkness studying the rock garden very simple not the sort of thing that would catch the eye of a casual observer a little patch of color above an outcropping that lent itself to this one use only wild and halfneglected unimportant and oddly touching there was the sound of a door opening and he froze keeping his silhouette low and dark against the greater darkness of the hillside sadie stood for a moment a hunched figure against the lamplight behind her in the open doorway rutledge could feel her eyes on him although he knew she couldnt possibly see him where he was whos there she called after a moment she went on have you come for me his mouth tightened in anger at himself for disturbing her giving her a fright it had been the last thing hed wanted but she has a sixth sense hamish reminded him im going to bed she said when rutledge didnt answer her come again in the light if you have honest business here he was very close to standing up and identifying himself but she shut the door again and in a minute or two more the lamp was snuffed out his legs were stiff from squatting but he waited for a little longer then turned his attention back to the garden if the body had been hidden here how much would be found now the long bones perhaps the jaw kneeling feeling the nights damp soaking into his trousers he lifted a few of the stones very carefully from their bed and touched the soil beneath his fingers worked down into it among the plant roots and the friable earth spreading and probing there were no tree roots here on the hillside if there had been a body in this ground some trace would remain to a trained eye he mustnt disturb it too much it was useless to dig in the dark leaving behind signs of his presence wait until later and let the experts his fingers struck something rough and hard in spite of himself a coldness swept over him even though common sense told him he couldnt have found bone at this shallow depth and not the boys bones someone had been here before him lifting the rocks in the center just as hed done loosening the soil he should have realized that as soon as he touched the earthit would have made sense if hed had his wits about him working carefully winkling it and using his other hand to clear a little space here a little there he very soon had the long slender length of wood out of its hiding place a carving no something else the sides were too smooth he let his fingers gently feel the thing in his hand it was not old woodhe knew the texture of that theyd used and reused whatever lumber came to hand in the trenches scavenged for boardwalks to keep their feet dry above the filth for shelter from the rain for a place out of the hot sun or the cold wind on the somme the generals had forbidden even such simple rough comforts while the germans had lived in tunnels theyd efficiently dug deep in the earth no this wood was hard and firm and new to the ground it had been buried in three sides were smooth as sanding could make them the fourth had something cut into it deeply incised and at midlength like a blind man he worked at the shapes slowly letting his sense of touch and not his eyes tell him what was there there was a flow to the shapes but they were separate letters then r yes most certainly an r then a space before the next a next to that an e he thought no he was wrong h and the very last c he thought back to the photographs hed been given by rachel marlowe and the names on the reverse richard allen harris cheney nicholas had left his calling card and not very long ago rutledge put everything back exactly as hed found it brushing the pansy leaves clean of any bits of earth using his hands to smooth and press the disturbed earth then he got to his feet and thought about what hed done whether hed left any task undone then he remembered the entrenching tool and groped for that with the same care hed exercised coming here he made his way out of the valley and back to the inn returning the tool to its place in the car before going upstairs again to his room looking down at his shoes he grimaced the caked mud reminded him of the trenches taking them off he set them outside his door for the boot boy washing his hands well then blotting the worst of the dew out of his trouser knees he went back to his earlier task the poems it was in some ways quite unnerving to put the pieces of the puzzle together like working out the obituaries of people he knew but olivia seldom failed him once he learned the technique of what she had tried to do all the members of her family were here cleverly disguised by the allegorical themes shed chosen for each sometimes like eve they were given biblical names at others wrapped in cornish legends or cloaked in bits of wellknown historywhatever fit her purpose but always with such artistry that the mask itself had a life and drama of its own he marveled again at such talent and the tragedy of its loss she had barely reached her prime of course she wasnt the first to use poetry as a vehicle for her own designs poetsswift and wordsworth were the first names he thought ofhad employed their pens to mock political figures or make literary allusions to famous events or writers some employed satire and a vicious humor to bring down governments or ruin reputations and careers but to his knowledge this was the first time one had grimly catalogued a murderers career bathsheba the faithful wife whose husband had been placed in the forefront of battle because king david desired her had become rosamund olivia described her as an unwitting pawn of a cruel and passionate man who wanted her at any price and took from her the mainstay of her life the kind and thoughtful husband who had filled her with happiness james cheney or brian fitzhugh which had been killed because he was rosamunds husband no rutledge told himself from the description it had to be cheney the kind and thoughtful man whod replaced the dashing soldier the hidden depths of feeling in the lines the understanding of love and lust gave them a soaring beauty that worked at any level but it was also a devastating portrait of a killer scheming to have what he wanted most at any price he went on skimming again looking for something missing it at first glance then turning back again to see it was a short poem two men standing at the waters edge argued over possession of the land that stretched out behind them rich and fallow in the sun anger turned to blows and one was killed to that point the lines seemed to follow the death of brian fitzhugh and then it took an odd twist as the killer stared down at the bleeding body my hand it was that gave you this mine that takes it from you and the dying man answers was it sowas it yours to give im glad i never knew nicholas somehow rutledge couldnt quite see that parallel what could nicholas have given and taken away again from brian fitzhugh he reread the poem and shook his head be patient man he told himself olivia knew the answer to thatshed leave it for him somewhere if not here hamish in the back of his mind was more or less agreeing with harvey about women penning such lines a tormented soul he began yes and a damned brave one rutledge retorted later there was a reference to a man passing through a wood finding death waiting for him there and facing it with courage and disdain death struck and laughed the man managed to break away but felt no sense of victory only of postponement for death could come again and it was not what he desired not yet with so much of life in his grasp so much of life and yet nicholas had chosen suicide rutledge was tired his eyes burning his head spinning from the effort he was making to follow the remarkable thread set out for him to sort through olivias allusions to find the bedrock of accusation beneath and yet he felt he was missing something what was behind what olivia was trying to tell him she hadnt written a great body of poetry just as a memorial to her familys suffering or just as a record for any astute policeman who might stumble over the evidence shed documented in it it was a warning a very public forum of denunciation but to what end she must have said somewhere then where had he rutledge gone astray surely it wasnt just his own stubborn insistence on closure surely olivia would have wanted that too then why hadnt he seen it what didnt he know about the trevelyan family that might have guided him now another poem to rosamund was moving a tribute that made his eyes sting with tears as it spoke of her life her loves her deep belief that she could find peace for herself and her family and the last line left him chilled when he couldnt have her the hound of hell destroyed her they were all there anne richard rosamund james brian all of them except the last pair to die he went through the book again searching finding nothing and then he saw something unexpected it was in a poemon the surfaceabout rome and two small children suckled by a wolf romulus and remus who grew up to found a great city only this was not a city this was a tower of the heart hes missed it confused by the legend mistakenly taking the wolf literally as an animal and not as a childhood nightmare of death and fear that drove two people to a strange and tender interdependence i have loved and he has listened both have given holy grace in his eyes i saw my soul then found my life in his embrace unexpectedand enlightening if it was true it explained so much but it was only half of the final answer he was sure of it now it was well after three oclockhed heard the church clock strike the hours since midnight and felt time passing like a heavy burden his mind was worn and his spirits had sunk like a stone the earlier enthusiasm already attacked by doubt writers often used their own experience for inspiration was that all shed done had he counted too much on her wishing his own need into her words no that was all wrong all wrong he just hadnt learned to see it in the right way yet with exhaustion nagging at him caught in the tumult of his own depression and hamishs prodding hed failed her not the other way around he rubbed his eyes then got up and washed his face in the cold water from the pitcher the coffee was even colder but he forced himself to drink it and then stretching his shoulders as hed done a thousand times on night watches in the war he finally sat back down again giving up was defeat and by god he wasnt going to face the shaving mirror in the morning with excuses and evasions hed start all over again if he had to at the beginning if thats what it took to cudgel his wits into action therere still the papers hamish reminded him if yere half the detective ye think ye are youd have found them by now the finest moment in the final volume was lucifer the centerpiece of the book a description of the great and glorious prince whose ambition reached too far to milton hed been the archangel who had dared to envy god finally to be disgraced and hurled headlong and flaming into the pit of hell to reign over the damned to olivia marlowe hed been the dark angel of death rutledge read the lines again and this time the image created by the words took shape in his mind the dark angel beyond her power to control beyond her power to condemn beyond her power nearly to understand but not an angel not an allegory of death a man clever unemotional his own law resolute fearless without compassion and immutable however long it took however dangerous it was however destructive he got what he desired a man who was neither good nor evil merely unbound by the constraints of humanity or god a glittering archangel perhaps but without a soul and yet like lucifer filled with envy and the need to possess what to him was omnipotence only his heaven had been earthbound a gabriel hound the old woman called him heathen it was a chilling portrait and it was the most truly devastating study of cold hard ego of a core of being without light or grace that hed ever seen by the time rutledge had finished the poem the last time he felt an exaltation in his blood that had nothing to do with poetry or olivia marlowe and everything to do with the great courage of o a manning he knew now the name and face of the gabriel hound proving it was going to be very dangerous and rachel would be brought to tears if he succeeded rutledge found it hard to sleep and hamish ever vigilant for an opening was there in his mind critical disagreeing ridiculing citing all the objections to his arguments pointing out over and over again you havena found a why you havena got the reason i dont need reasons leave that to the lawyers lawyers are no policemen theyll twist the truth until its lost all i need is proof and olivia gave me that proof is it a muckle of lines thats what yeve got would ye stand and recite in yon courtroom while your fine jury nods in their seats and yon judge begs you to get on with it before he declares a mistrial och man its no a case its professional suicide what about her papers youve reminded me of them yourself you must have thought they were important when you did theyre gone man face it ye havena found them and never will nicholas wouldnt have destroyed those out on the headland she wouldnt have let him cormac might have if he found them first before the lawyers and stephen got there but somehow i dont think he did find them i think hes been looking as hard as i have i cant believe he wants anyone to know the truth about what happened between him and olivia before im finished ill find those bloody papers oh aye were back again to a dead womans poems a dead womans papers what you need is a live killer and a confession a witness to confront him and theres no any hope of finding those no rutledge retorted bitterly but im not beaten yet he rose at five oclock his head feeling stuffed with cotton wool from an hours heavy sleep at the very end shaving with cold water he dressed and hurried down the back stairs startling the elderly scullery maid setting out the crocks of butter and putting the newbaked bread into cloths in a basket in the kitchen lord sir you gave me such a fright she cried looking up at him and then burning her fingers on a hot loaf of bread nearly dropping it was it coffee you were wanting sir its not been put on yet is there someone here who can carry a note over to mrs otleys house for me her eyebrows flew up a note at this hour sir surely not as soon as may be he said testily theres the boy taking out the ashes hell do he was already writing several lines on a sheet from his notebook frowning as he worded it to his satisfaction then ripping it out to fold and address on the outside bring him here she went to fetch the boy looking at rutledge over her shoulder as if hed lost his wits the sleepy child no more than nine or ten took the note opened his eyes wider at the sight of the sixpence in rutledges hand and paid close heed to his instructions then he was off rutledge followed him out of the kitchen and down the hall watched him drag open the inn door and set off through the early mists up the hill towards the otley cottage it was ten minutes before he was back breathless and redfaced but smiling she wasnt that happy with me sir for waking her she said i was to tell you that and say that id earned a shilling for the trouble it took to bring mrs otley to the door it was highway robbery but rutledge handed over a shilling and the boy went dashing back down the passage towards the kitchens rachels reply was hardly more than a scrawl if you havent run mad you soon will but if this is what it takes to send you back to london ill do it grinning he stuffed the paper into his pocket and went around to the back of the inn where his motorcar was parked in one of the disused sheds within five minutes he was driving up to mrs otleys cottage the sound of the car loud in the street and down near the wood someones dog was barking in savage displeasure at the racket the dog the rector had warned him of you could hear the damned thing all over borcombe rachel came down the cottage steps ten minutes later dressed in a dark coat and a hat shed tied down with a scarf rutledge got out and held the door for her are you sure you can drive this automobile she looked at him in disgust of course i can probably better than you do on these roads i know them you dont and youll tell susannah that if shell grant this one wish ill be leaving for london as soon as ive tied up all the loose ends yes but i still dont see why you need something like this its the silliest thing ive ever heard of youll understand afterward it will save days of work trust me ive seen spiders i trust more she said tartly and stepped into the drivers seat if you cause susannah any pain any griefif she has a miscarriage because of you she wont what im about to do will give her peace of mind learning that her half sister was a murderess oh yes i call that quite soothing for a woman in her condition she turned and looked at rutledge a long earnest look that seemed to probe beneath his skin and into his very brain are you sure you know what youre doing are you quite sure she asked quietly her face sober and very worried he reached out and touched her hand as it rested on the wheel i can only tell you that what im doing will be for the best if there was murder done it ought to be known and the past put to rest there ought to be justice for the dead if no one else the dead are dead its the living im worried about now andand nicholas no one can touch nicholas he said gently not now not ever again you know that better than i do i wont let you destroy his memory inspector rutledge i wont let you if you do try ill find a way to put it right whatever i have to do i will do believe that he felt cold in the early morning breeze in spite of his coat i cant hurt nicholas he said again hes dead rachel you have to accept it and what it means he left you he chose to die with olivia not to live with you he could see the flare of pain in her eyes and ignored it thats what he told you in his last letter he didnt want you her mouth tightened i wanted him she said quite simply now start this damned thing or ill not go at all not even for susannahs sake he shut the door walked around and bent down to turn the crank he could sense her watching he knew what was in her mind as the engine roared into life again and he stepped back the crank in his hand she looked straight at him over the bonnet of the car leave cormac out of this he said coming around the wing towards her dont send for him its between olivia and nicholas you and me hes not a trevelyan dont send for him hell just make matters worse no one could make them worse except you she took off the brake let in the gear and the car moved briskly off down the road she didnt look back he watched her handle the car around the curve his mind on her driving judging whether hed made the right decision to send her but there was no one else who could have persuaded susannah hamish lurking in the shadows said only play with witchcraft and youll burn yourself it isnt witchcraft rutiedge answered harshly its the only way i can think of to get at the truth there was an echo of the engine from the narrow hedgerows although the car had long since vanished to sight rutledge started to turn back towards the inn then looked up to find mary otley watching him from the doorway of the cottage you havent put her in harms way have you sir she asked no with any luck ive put her out of it he answered and walked back to the inn for his breakfast the constables still at his breakfast sir mrs dawlish said opening her front door to the inspector from london ill just come through and have a word with him in the kitchen he said gently pushing the door wider if you dont mind she did but was too polite to say so though he could read her face clearly enough the constable stood up hastily napkin still stuck under his chin as rutledge came down the passage and turned into the kitchen it was a large room with windows on two sides and a door into the back passage at the rear next to the great polished black stove a table with the remains of breakfast and an unexpectedly bright bowl of zinnias stood in the very middle of the room a vast cornish dresser took up most of one wall the pantry through a door beyond and against the other wall the smaller scraped wood top of the cooking table shone in the light from the east the curtains at the windows the pattern on the tablecloth and the walls themselves were all a summer blue as if somehow to bring the color of the sea into the house sir he said in alarm its all right dawlish ive just come to tell you that you can call off the search on the moors this morning the mans face brightened then youve given it up sir all this nonsense about the trevelyan family youre going back to london there are some loose ends to tie up some statements ill need to cover the questions i seem to have raised you wont mind helping with those no sir not in the least dawlish said expansively willing to do cartwheels if it got rid of the inconvenient man from london and put inspector harvey into a pleasanter mood whatever you wish ill be happy to help rutledge smiled but it didnt reach his eyes and for an instant dawlish was filled with a new uncertainty but he brushed it aside as rutledge said ill be back in two hours with a list of names i dont want you to tell anyone else who is on that list do you understand me youll send for these people one at a time exactly as youre told to do and youll have them write their statements for me exactly in the order ill give you and in the circumstances i describe it may seem strange to you but i think in the end youll see what im driving at there will be a specific list of questions for each interview and i want you to ask them exactly as written change them in any way and ill have it all to do over again it will only take longer do you understand me dawlish didnt and rutledge knew he didnt but dawlish nodded and rutledge turned to go two hours be here when i come and dont forget the men on the moors not bloody likely dawlish answered to himself as rutledge turned and walked out of the sunny blue kitchen working fast and steadily rutledge made his lists his mind tied up with the complexity of details setting them out with precision he had always been good at organizing his thoughts at creating a picture of events from start to finish and this time the facts were there no gaps no guesses no room for doubt no room for hamish to creep in and haunt him but hamish was there still debating the wisdom of what lay ahead a stir in the silence trask came up with a telegram for rutledge and he opened it reluctantly knowing it came from london knowing it was from bowles it read if you arent doing your job youre needed here if theres something happening i want to know about it no answer rutledge told trask and went back to what he was writing explaining to bowles would be the same as emptying the sahara with a teacup there was not enough time for it not today tomorrow might be different finally he sat back and looked at the sheets of paper on his desk how weak was the evidence damned weak at the moment without statements without the voices of people and their written words evidence was always thin and yet it was there it was there waiting to be culled he felt satisfied rachel had driven straight to the hall and left the car there before walking back into the village she came into the inn as rutledge ran lightly down the stairs and he knew the instant he saw her face that hed got what he wanted youll have to get it out of the car yourself susannah says if you damage the frame at all shell have you up before the courts it took two grooms to load it safely thank you he said smiling and she felt a deep sense of foreboding as she watched it light his eyes he seemed to have lost five years over night a man who had changed so much that she was afraid and then the smile was gone and with it the strangeness he was himself again the thin face the lines the bonetiredness but she thought that that might have been a sleepless night not the weariness hed seemed to bring from london with him rachel opened her mouth to say something then decided against it come on then she said instead it shouldnt be sitting out there in the sun they walked in silence to the house and rutledge was grateful for it for the lack of questions in spite of the doubts that he knew were seething just below the surface in the woman at his side she was spirited shed have made someone a very good wife but not for peter who had valued his peace in the long run rachel would have needed more than a bookfilled house in the country and quiet evenings by the fire discussing roman ruins and not for nicholas because the nicholas shed seen and loved was a figment a falsehood built on lies that he couldnt do anything about the man who cared for rachel the man whod done his best to send her away was there inside but for reasons rachel herself would never willingly grasp rachels tragedy he thought as they came out of the woods and turned up the drive towards the house was that love had seemed so real and so possible because she had wanted it too much just as he had wanted to believe jean loved him as deeply as he believed hed loved her jean who hadnt had very much courage who turned from him because she couldnt accept any other dream but the shiny perfect one that had been shattered in four years of war hadnt changed her and it had changed himtheir livesbeyond recognition had he wanted her so much because hed thought she could restore what was gone or had it really been love he didnt know any more which may be an answer of sorts hamish reminded him in the back of the car now sitting below the steps at the front door of the hall was a large object wrapped in heavy brown paper it took him fifteen minutes with rachel offering unsolicited advice to gently dislodge it from its cocoon of surrounding blankets and cushions then lift it out onto the drive between them they got the package up the steps and then unlocking the door into the hall and across it to the drawing room another fifteen to find a small ladder and carry it there too but in the end stepping back to see the results he was satisfied rosamund trevelyan smiled benignly down from her proper place above the hearth her face turned slightly her cheek smooth and creamy against the background of light her eyes full of life and love and hope an extraordinary woman mother of another extraordinary woman as full of goodness and joy and beauty as the gabriel hound had been full of darkness and destruction rutledge was just returning from the kitchen where hed left the ladder when the bell rang loudly in the emptiness of the house and brought rachel frowning out of the drawing room who is that she demanded dawlish he said and opened the door to the constable who had mrs trepol at his heels the elderly housekeeper was staring over his shoulder her eyes moving nervously from rachel to the london policeman before rachel could say anything more rutledge closed the fingers of his right hand around her arm to silence her and nodded to dawlish the drawing room youll see the chairs and a table use them where they are uneasy and uncertain dawlish glanced at rachel but rutledge cut short any query see to it man and he led rachel towards the stairs his eyes commanding her to wait not here not now her mouth was tight with suspicion and anger and she moved ahead of him with the stride of a woman biding her time with a vengeance behind them mrs trepol followed dawlish into the hall their steps sounding loud and uncertain as they moved towards the drawing room once in the back sitting room overlooking the sea rachel rounded on him in a fury what the hell do you think youre doing i wont have it this is wrong this is trickery tell me whats going on or by god ill find the nearest telephone and call london look he said earnestly im trying to get at the truth do you want me to walk away and leave this unfinished i cant what i think has been done hereif im right mind youhas to be settled now it cant be put off what you think has been done she repeated but you havent told anyone what you think have you not me not the rector not inspector harvey i have told you there have been a series of suspicious deaths starting with anne yes yes olivia killed them you say or nicholas dead people who cant answer cant defend themselves well let me tell you what i think while i was at the beatons i made a telephone call to a friend of peters who knew you as well he tells me that after the armistice you spent months in a private clinica head injury he said quite severe he said because you werent allowed any visitors nurses told him that for a time you didnt even know who you were everyone was surprised when you returned to the yardthey didnt think you were well enough that youd recovered sufficiently to take on stressful work hes right you arent capable of carrying out your duties thats why you arent in london looking for that manthats why you were sent out to cornwall to get you safely out of the way and why youre searching out old imaginary murders you cant do any better shocked by her vehemence he turned away towards the windows looking out at the sea his back to her his face hidden from her angry eyes you sent for scotland yard he reminded her for a last time if im mad if im imagining the need for this investigation then some of the blame must be yours it was on the tip of his tongue to say more and he caught himself in time and added only im sorry rachel more than you know his refusal to defend himself the odd tone of his voice brought her up short they were a womans weapon words shed deliberately wielded them to wound to hurt him to stop him shed telephoned sandy macardle because he was a gossip and shed known he was a gossip and she wanted the worst possible interpretation put on anything ian rutledge had done to use that knowledge herself as savagely as she could and suddenly she felt sick ashamed oh nicholas she cried to herself with weary grief why did i have to love you so much rutledge still had his back to her the set of his shoulders betraying his own pain waiting for her to go on she found she couldnt why did you want the portrait she asked quietly after a time he was watching the sea but his eyes were blind to its beauty only the pain within him seemed real and to his credit he told her the truth because i cant close this investigation without taking statements from half the people in borcombe but you see if i do that in the normal fashion by the end of the day ill have taken down whatever embroideries theyve devised between them to shield themselves and rosamunds family from scandal and then well never get at the truth because they all know bits of that truth rachel whether they realize it or not and i need to bring it out cleanly bare and unvarnished it occurred to me that sitting in that formal drawing room where each of them will feel desperately ill at ease and watched by the one woman they all revered both in life and in death i wont get lies ill have facts and before anyone in borcombe has quite understood where what theyre telling constable dawlish might be leading the whole picture of murder and deception will be down in black and white they cant turn around then and deny it they cant pretend that they were misled or misinterpreted the questions theyll have to accept it themselves and come to terms with it however they can but thats the grievous cost of murder we all pay it along with the victims what a very cruel thing to do her voice was harsh with disbelief her brief episode of sympathy washed away he deserved to be savaged he turned to face her again his eyes sad it probably is cruel id thought long and hard about that myself i didnt know what else to do i could have told harvey and these people what it is im after but i dont think theyd have believed me any more than you have and the wall theyve all drawn around the trevelyan family would only go higher all this for a dead woman for olivia no not for olivia for two small children who never lived to grow up for james cheney who died in despair and brian fitzhugh who trusted the wrong person to his cost and for rosamund who was driven to taking her own life to make it all stop for olivia who gave up a quite incredible gift because something far more precious was threatened and for nicholas who had spent a lifetime in her service because he believed he failed her for all i know stephens death was a part of it all he was searching for something just before his fall and i think i now may know what it was if he hadnt been late if he hadnt been in such a damned hurry he might not have gone headfirst down those stairs he was in a sense a victim too how very morally upright of you to set the record straight and will we have a wax effigy of olivia in the dock when you present your evidence to the jury no he said tiredly well have a living person she stared at him her mouth moving soundlessly as if the words were there but her voice had failed her there was a pounding at the front door the sound traveling up the stairs like thunder and rutledge brushed past rachel without a word going out of the door and closing it behind him before crossing the hall to find inspector harvey waiting impatiently outside rather than ushering him into the house rutledge went out to stand in the bright sunlight beside him im told my constable is here that you ordered him to call off the search on the moors this morning and that youve got him taking statements from witnesses in the trevelyan hall drawing room rather than his office yes i left a message for you explaining im returning to london so you said and what use pray are these statements youve gone to such lengths to obtain to clear the record its what you wanted isnt it not mollified at all harvey retorted indeed but i shouldnt have thought that interviewing the good citizens of borcombe would serve any better purpose now than it did at the time of the suicides youre absolutely right rutledge agreed watching gulls wheeling over the shoreline he chose his words with great care he needed harveys support but not his suspicions they probably cant shed any further light on the deaths of miss marlowe and nicholas cheney what im hoping they might do is give me sufficient understanding of miss marlowes state of mind over the last few years family affairs were worrying herat least i have reason to believe that may be true it could explain why in spite of her literary success she felt she couldnt face living would you mind very much giving dawlish an account of your discussion with her about what makes a murderer id feel a fool that was a private conversation between you and me what i told you so it was but if miss marlowes mind was already dwelling on such matters when you came here as a police officer such evidence might provide additional weight i feel she carried a sense of guilt for want of a better word about the misfortunes in her family i found some confirmation of that in her poetry as well gifted imaginations are often sensitive and very impressionable they sometimes see what we overlook harvey looked searchingly at him are you having me on he demanded rutledges eyes came back from the sea to harveys face something in them made the other man wary ive never been more serious olivia marlowe believed that there was a murderer loose in her family she believed she knew the identity of the killer and that she had proof of a sort of a sort mind you not the kind of proof you and i might use to ask for an arrest warrant perhaps or that a good barrister couldnt make laughable in a courtroom but she believed it and she tried to document it as carefully as she could thatsthats preposterous harvey blustered his neck brick red and the color rising fast ive never heard a more ridiculous fiction in all my years as a policeman this is my country id have known if there was murder done here my predecessor would have known precisely why rutledge responded i need these statements i see no point in taking unsubstantiated rumors back to london in my opinion we should set olivia marlowes fears to rest once and for all she was famous and there will be biographers they shouldnt be left to draw conclusions that might reflect badly on the police he shrugged what may come of it is the truth i cant think of anything fairer than that that damned woman was a bother when she was alive and worse now that shes dead harvey fumed thinking over what rutledge had said and from the sound of it olivia marlowe wasnt going to stay quietly dead he hadnt reckoned on biographers trampling about his turf and prying into village business asking questions raising doubts stirring up people hed thought that was finished when the reporters had come to find out about o a manning the specter of an endless parade of troublemakers still to arrive was decidedly unsettling at best rutledge watched the slow careful progress of harveys mind as he considered the situation facing him and then came to his decision harvey had been told the truth not all of it but the cold hard kernel of truth that was the center of what rutledge was doing the rest would come when the facts were down on paper and irrefutable when the warrant was required yes well i can understand what youre saying that therell be no peace for any of us if the home office wanted this case reopened weve already had the first round some newspaperman may get wind of it next god forgive us and well be on the front pages and the academics will be the worst of the lot reading whatever they damned well please into her verse and turning borcombe upside down to show theyre right he sighed oh very well do what you have to do just make what haste you can harvey turned and walked off down the drive rutledge felt the tension in his shoulders begin to loosen and absently rubbed the back of his neck there was something more he wanted to do in the house but rachel was still there and it was more important to avoid her now the other matter could wait the day wore on a long straggle of people coming to the house the rector among them giving their statements to dawlish and then leaving again strangely subdued for a time rutledge watched them from the headland and he saw too that harvey made his appearance in due course then left shaking his head rutledge wondered whether dawlish had told him more than he should have about the questions askedand answers received reporting to his superior thats how hed have viewed it rutledge hoped he had not harveys stubborn straight mind might just make the right leap good policemen clever or not had a sense about some things it didnt take imagination to learn from experience the problem was where would harvey turn if he learned the truth how would he use it hasty decisions had a way of wrecking a clean tight investigation and harvey wanted to be seen as running his own territory not following the lead of strangers from london by dinnertime rutledge had collected the statements from the weary constable eager to get home to his wife then he went up the stairs two at a time and carefully collected the small gold articles from olivias closet for a moment he held them in the palm of his hand where they shone with soft beauty as if innocent of blood and death as they were in themselves he thought sadly downstairs he took one last long look at rosamunds portrait silently apologizing for what hed caused to be done in her drawing room that day she stared back at him in silence a faraway look in her eyes he walked back towards the village alone his mind busy sadie hadnt come dawlish reported though dr penrith walking slowly on his daughters arm had arrived at the hall at the time set for him and wilkins and mary otley later someone would have to interview susannah and her husband and tom chambers the solicitor rutledge himself had questioned dawlish at the end of the day writing down his answers without looking up at the mans accusing eyes the constable was an intelligent man he could think through what he had spent the long day doing but how far had he gotten in putting the pieces of the puzzle together far enough to wonder rutledge thought but not quite far enough to know the whole passing through the woods rutledge considered the problem of sadie did she know what a sworn statement was he would have to go to her then and hope her mind was clear as he passed the otley cottage he could see someone standing in the shadow by the door rachel watching him he could feel her eyes the intensity of emotions the uncertainty but she stayed where she was and he wondered what was going through her mind what she would do now or if she would wait women often thought along different lines where a man saw duty women were more concerned with emotions feelings hed learned early on that a policeman ignored such differences at his peril rutledge was just beside the trepol gate when the housekeeper stepped out her door and called to him inspector rutledge he opened the gate and went up the walk where he would be out of earshot of rachel if mrs trepol had questions about the statement shed given it was better not to broadcast them when he reached her she acknowledged him with a nod and then said youll be wanting me to clean up after all those feet tracking dirt into the hall and the drawing room it would be kind of you he said yes thank you miss rosamund would never have allowed it she said resigned to what she must have considered little short of desecration one did not invite half the village in to sit in a fine chair under the best portrait in the house not in the age in which mrs trepol or rosamund trevelyan had grown up and learned their respective places in borcombe i know he told her but sometimes the law must do what has to be done and worry about the fitness of it afterward i think she would have been glad to be a party to settling her familys affairs is that what youre doing sir mrs trepol asked earnestly its what im trying to do to explain the deaths of olivia marlowe and nicholas cheney to set it right she nodded as if she understood thank you sir she said quietly id not like to think of them in pain and grief over what they did a sad end to two lives that was i could never feel quite right about it and i couldnt see the purpose we have to live the lives weve been given theres naught else for it god doesnt give us a choice thats what the church says suffering teaches in its own way yes sometimes he said knowing how close he himself had come more than once to ending his own suffering she nodded again and looked around her for her cat rutledge turned and started up the walk again mrs trepol said tentatively sir yes he only half turned back towards her wanting to go on to the inn and read the statements if youre finished with us well sir i was wondering if maybe youd know what was best to do with them boxes mr stephen gave me to hold for him i kept expecting mr chambers to come and fetch them after mr stephen died but he hasnt maybe he doesnt want them any more now that mr stephen is dead just some old things he told me some treasures he wanted to keep for himself memories of the family he said nothing but a boys foolishness he said but he didnt want them left behind in the empty house and he wasnt ready to take them up to london with him no room in the car with all those things miss susannah and the others wanted to carry away rutledge turned and looked at her in the late evening light at the plain earnest face that waited for him to do what was best i thought of mentioning it to miss rachel but theyre mr stephens things and i havent seen miss susannah by herself only with mr daniel there and i didnt knowi thought perhaps that wasnt what mr stephen would want hed said i was to keep the boxes for him you see just for him as a favor and he was always a hard one to say no to so i thought id just ask and you might tell me what was best theyre not my thingsi wouldnt want to do anything wrong he couldnt turn to see if rachel was still in her doorway he couldnt be sure she wouldnt see him carrying boxes away instead he scooped up the cat that was coming through the open gate and said quietly show me mrs trepol went indoors and rutledge still carrying the cat followed her in a closet set in the hall between her bedroom and the kitchen there was a stack of boxes three of them to the other side two coats a rack of gardening boots and a line of old umbrellas crowded the narrow space rutledge had already put down the squirming cat and he stood there staring for a moment at the boxes then he lifted down the first of the three and opened it carefully mrs trepol turned away as if afraid she might be trespassing if she looked at the contents he felt no such compunction the first box held olivias notebooks of verse annotated and revised her record of creative thought the process of making words do her bidding he regarded the neat rows thoughtfully not reading any of them but paying silent homage to them as his fingers gently touched their spines the second box held contracts letters and bank records he was amazed at how well good verse paid the third was a collection of many things photographs a genealogy of the trevelyan family personal letters childhood scribbling that gradually foretold the growth of a formidable talent and a number of books with her name in lovely script on the flyleaves rutledge trying to hide his disappointment and quell hamishs fierce litany of i told you so prodded the contents again as if expecting them to produce by magic the answers he wanted mrs trepol had gone into the kitchen to feed her cat and he squatted on the wide floorboards refusing to give up it wasnt until then that he noticed that some of the contents stacked as if in a file drawer were higher than the others lifting them out gently he found a slim journal under this batch and took it out in its turn the hand was strong and clear the writing of a woman who had used a pen most of her life and was at home with words not a journal a letter to her half brother he skimmed it swiftly dear stephen there are some things you must know and i shall not be here to tell them to you im sorry about that to leave you with these revelations when you are grieving for us but i must arm you for whats to come i have done my best to protect you and susannah for one thing have left the house in such a way that it must be sold and youve been aware for years that that was my wish as well as nicholas for another i have kept you in ignorance as long as i dared and drawn the lightning myself all these years by dying i have set him free at last and you will be safe now you have nothing he wants i have promised him that but who can know what the future holds circumstances change and i cannot foresee every possibility the time may come when what i am writing down here is all you have whether you believe me or not i pray youll trust me and for your own sake keep the confidence i am sharing with you vengeance will only bring you and susannah down into the pit and my death will have been for nothing let me tell you then about the murderer who has lived with us for all of your life and most of mine rutledge stopped there and closed the journal returning it to its resting place hamish for once was silenced his voice if not his presence shut down in the face of truth rutledge felt his heart racing his mind torn between triumph and depression triumphant that there was something more than lines of verse on which to base his case and depressed that olivia marlowe had had to sacrifice herself to keep her younger half brother and sister alive had that been what drove her to suicide a threat against stephen his life or yours was that the bargain struck with lucifer or only a part of it mrs trepol stuck her head around the kitchen door and said will you be taking them with you sir mr stephens things rutledge got to his feet and began to stack the boxes into the closet again go on keeping them safe for now he told mrs trepol let them stay where they are ill come for them myself before i leave sooner if i can and i wouldnt bother either miss rachel or miss susannah about them now theyve got enough on their minds i dont want to worry them about mr stephen at the moment she thanked him gravely and followed him to her door closing it after him hamish never silenced for very long had found his voice again ill hear no crowing now or later ye didnt find them did you they had to come to you out of nowhere and you cant take any of the credit for that i dont want credit rutledge said walking down the path and closing the gate behind him still torn between taking the boxes with him and leaving them where they were he turned towards the inn once more only part of his mind taking in the emptiness of the street the quietnessno noisy children no neighbors gossiping over garden walls no young couples strolling hand in hand through the evening light hed seen it before the way villages drew inward in a time of crisis im starting with the statements after that ill have harvey collect that letter once ive organized all my own information clearly in black and white hell be able to see how the letter corroborates it and if he can see it london will have to do the same and what about stephen fitzhugh did he find yon letter was that why he left the boxes here he must have read it rutledge said tiredly he was her executor because she trusted him that may have been her only mistake i believe stephen had changed after the war rachel said much the same thing that he wasnt the same man when he came home my god how few of us are there was bitterness in his voice hearing again rachels diatribe and feeling no triumph for what hed accomplished this day only doubt over his methods beside him the tip of the church tower was touched by the slanting brightness like a beacon it gave him no comfort hamish clicked his tongue in disagreement damn it look at the facts then he decided on a memorialthat was the word rachel usedinstead of selling the house that went against olivias express wishes and yet he hid the boxes where no one could find them and stumble on the truth i think stephen looked at his choices and felt he could turn the hall into a museum by blackmailing the killer into allowing it that was arrogance not courage a fisherman coming up from the strand caught sight of rutledge walking towards him and made a point of crossing the street to the far side to avoid passing him yes the village had drawn its conclusions you cant know what was in his mind no but i know he left the boxes with mrs trepol he didnt put them in the car to take to london he didnt leave them in the house where someone else might have come across them he didnt give them to the solicitor chambers he put them in the care of a woman who would follow his instructions exactly and he knew that aye but stephen fitzhugh fell down the stairs it was an accident and you said as much yourself i still believe that rutledge had reached the inn pushing open the door it was dark and silent except for lights at the end of the kitchen passage he carried the statements to his room and locked them in his suitcase along with the small bits of gold before finding trask and asking that some dinner be sent upstairs for once the landlord had nothing to say when he brought up the tray it was as if the village was shunning him later rutledge walked through the gloaming towards sadies cottage the setting sun still struck the headland with a rich golden light but in the narrow valleys it was already that soft blue dusk that stole color from the land and left it almost in limbo between day and night sadie was in her garden weeding a row of carrots she straightened her back as he came down the path towards her and stared at him in silence he felt a sense of guilt as if it was written in his face that hed been there the night before digging among the pansies but he knew it was impossible for her to be sureto have seen anything heard anything she doesna need to hear or see hamish reminded him she has the gift good evening rutledge began keeping his voice neutral ive come to ask you why you didnt walk across to the hall to talk to constable dawlish he waited hoping to speak to you let him wait she said ive naught to say to him to me then will you speak to me ive told you before that you want no part of the gabriel hound i know i wont ask you about him not directly but i hope you can tell me more about olivia how she managed to keep such secrets young as she was how she grew into the woman she was without breaking under the strain and then this spring why she chose to take her own life if she expected to bring him down with her or if shed given up i need olivias help and shes dead but she trusted you will you let her speak through you im ready to bring this killer into a courtroom and i need all the secrets now except his name i know that finally she cocked her head to one side and examined him id not be in your shoes then theres no mercy in him thats why i must finish this tonight his voice was gentle now did you come in the night last night yes i came i found richard there are pansies at his feet something in her face crumpled but she said nothing she couldnt stop the hounds he said she couldnt bring him to justice but she did tried to leave the evidence one way or another in hope dont let it be wasted let me see that justice is done for her sadie pulled her black shawl closer about her thin shoulders weighing him judging him hes run free all these years hell slip any leash put on him and come back here no one comes back from the gallows he searched for something else to convince her and the dead can sleep in peace then id like that she answered after a time before i die id like to be certain sure of that he thought she was still going to refuse he thought watching the play of emotions on her lined tired face the telltale eyes that he was going to lose her but she straightened her back again and started to walk towards the cottage door come inside and ill make tea and answer your questions sadie was the only person connected with the family that olivia hadnt written about in her poems hed noticed that omission last night and now he understood it hed been right to look behind the facade he followed the old woman through the low doorway and took out his notebook she gestured for him to sit and the cat on the window ledge stared at him through slitted eyes as he took the chair sadie indicated in silence she put the kettle on got out cups and the tin of tea he waited giving her space and time when the small teapot was set on the table and she began to pour he asked his first question she handed him his cup before she answered and in the next hour he was very glad after all that she hadnt come to the hall to be interviewed by constable dawlish her voice was shaking when she started a thin frail thread of sound that worried him made him careful neither to overwhelm nor overtire her he could see too when it became a catharsis like confession before a priest a deep and emotional release that welled up slowly and yet brought with it waves of intense feelings she wasnt retelling an old story she was quite literally reliving old and very bitter griefs buried so long they were part of bone and sinew and a sense of failure she washed been told it early onby nature and profession a healer no we none of us suspected anne had been killed she replied slowly to his first question but miss olivia she fretted herself near to death over it and mr adrianher grandfather that wassaid it was because they were one flesh anne and olivia but it was deeper than that the child had nightmares and sometimes id be called in to sit beside the bed a lamp in the corner with a shawl thrown over it to hold her hand mr nicholas was only a wee thing but hed stand at the door and watch his sister with those deep dark eyes of his and it was as if he knew what she was suffering but miss olivia she never spoke of what was in her heart not even to her mother after a time she was better and yet not the same ever again shed sit with a book in her lap and not know a word on the page shed be standing by the window looking out and never see what was beyond the glass id tended wounded soldiers in my time this was a wounded child when did she first mention the gabriel hound to you or was it you who told her one day she found a book in her grandfathers library and read about them twas an old story and she wanted to know if id heard of it and of course i had she wanted to know then if id believed in it and i said child ive seen the turks i dont need to fear any hounds and she answered me with that straight look of hers ive heard them the night anne died it was all she said and after that i found myself lying awake of nights listening too because you took miss olivias flights of fancy serious she was a knowing one then why didnt she speak to her mother or adrian trevelyan surely theyd have believed her i asked her once she said i was warned and she wouldnt budge from that he felt the cold on the back of his neck as if something had touched him where the hackles rise small wonder olivia had lived in her own world for so very long she had been frightened into it and it had become her sanctuary sadies eyes brimmed with pain he hastily changed directions tell me about richards death she looked at him over her cup before taking a long swallow you know about that its the burying you want to hear surprised he said you knew what shed done not then not when it happened no but once i found her crying over that little garden shed wanted to make on the hillside and when i smoothed her hair and told her her little brother was with god and happy she turned to me and said in a voice that curdled my blood god doesnt know where he is i should have let them bury him in the vault with the others but i thoughti thought it might make mother happier if he wasnt found if there was hope alive i thoughti thought the one whod killed him would be terrified hed come back and point a finger and it would make him confess and i was wrong i can hear her clear as i hear you and it wrung my heart i tell you it was later i got the whole story from her but by then mr james had shot himself and it was better to leave miss rosamund with some hope however small it was so we did rutledge looked up from his notes he doubted that anyone else in the village would have taken that step with olivia it was a measure of sadies understanding of a fragile child did nicholas know he asked nicholas knew everything she replied and held his tongue because miss olivia couldnt prove a word of it then he was afraid the blamed turn on her you see that theyd say she mustve killed the boy herself because shed hid him and was now trying to blame someone else it was a terrible fix to be in i thought it would be the death of them both but miss olivia was strong and he gave her all the courage he had more than many a man possesses i never saw such courage in a lad these were children mind you carrying a secret too heavy for them it made them older than their years but they thought it had stopped you see when miss rosamund married mr fitzhugh mr cormac and mr nicholas they went away to school as it was set out they should a governess was found for miss olivia the twins were born and the house was happy again for ten year or more because he had to be patient to wait until he himself was ready aye she told him sadly the worst in a way was to come mr brian was thrown by his horse they said nicholas was there on the strand speaking to him not half an hour before miss rosamund wasnt in the hall she was out in the gardens somewhere mr nicholas went to find her and that was when mr brian died but not before mr brian had told mr nicholas that mr cormac he wanted to change his name to trevelyan and would he mr nicholas speak to rosamund about it mr nicholas asked why mr brian shouldnt ask her himself and mr brian said its not my place im not a trevelyan and mr cormac isnt a fitzhugh mr nicholas he didnt understand what mr brian meant but mr brian just shook his head and said no i love your mother very deep and ill not ask favors of her let her do it out of her heart not for my sake or cormacs did nicholas ever mention that conversation to his mother lord no before hed found her they set up a shout about mr brian being bad hurt and mr nicholas he looked like a ghost walking and never spoke of it to a soul except olivia and that was only after the funeral i was the one laid out mr brian when they brought him up the stairs and put him in the bedroom beyond the landing looking for a clean shirt sos to make him presentable for miss rosamund i found a letter ready to mail in his drawer stuck deep under them it was to mr chambers and it set out starkly the circumstances of mr cormacs birth but when i spoke of it to miss olivia and we went to look for it it was gone mr chambers he never got it you read it when you found it she got up and went to the door to let the cat out into the night he caught the breath of the sea and knew that the wind had changed direction have you never lived in a house with servants they arent deaf as posts and blind as bats it was buried amongst his shirts sir not in his desk id never have touched the papers in his desk but it fell out on the floor and the sheet of paper went this way the envelope that i picked em up and read the one before putting it in the other and setting it where it belonged in the desk and it was gone from there the next day youre certain mrs fitzhugh herself hadnt take it well as to that sir we couldnt very well ask could we now but later when she was restless and uneasy in her mind wandering the house all hours of the night trying for sleep and not finding it i wondered mr adrian her father hadnt wanted her to marry mr brian and she knew it but mr brian was a kind man he made her laugh and he had no eye for her money the housed gone to miss olivia but the money was still miss rosamunds mr brian gave no thought to it he was happy if she was and he gave her the twins and miss rosamund adored them it wasnt a bad marriage to my way of thinking then mr chambers he started coming around when the period of mourning was finished and miss rosamund she looked for a time to be herself again roses in her cheeks and that special way she had of tilting her head as if listening to something sweet in the air whenever she was happy sadie standing at the open door shut it as the cat came back inside and went to the hearth to stand she was tired her face deeply lined but rutledge thought he couldnt have stopped her now if hed tried that was in june by september she was dead and they said it was by her own hand but lord sir i knew how much of the laudanum shed took i was the one that had to beg her each night to swallow half a draught to ease the despair shed felt all through that last month but shed shake her head and say no sadie i need my wits about me youll have no wits left if ye dont rest i told her plain out but she said theres something i must do and im not sure exactly how to set about it im not going to marry mr chambers or anyone else ive got my children to live for and thats the most important part of my life now there was no changing her mind she was that strong shed decided against marrying thomas chambers had she actually told him that oh lord yes but he was there every weekend come to call and dine with her i heard her say to him once ive killed them all george and james and brian i cant bear to see you die and i wont i tell you and he said thats nonsense my love youre letting grief turn your thoughts she just looked at him her face sad im bad luck tom id rather stay single than wear widows weeds ever again what made her think she had killed them he was fascinated pretending to drink his tea and over the rim of his cup watching the old face in the lamps light trying to read the eyes ah but did she i wondered about that for the longest time miss olivia she said it was deeper than that she thought mr cormac he was in love with miss rosamund but there was no speaking of it not to miss rosamund shed smile and say her spirits were fine shed just decided that marriage was not worth the grieving afterward then how did she come to die that were odd sir one day she said to miss olivia i think ill ask tom to come for the weekend i need to speak to him legal matters and perhaps after thats done we may find it possible to talk about other things i was on the stairs helping mr cormac and mr nicholas move a chest down from the attics that mr cormac wanted to take back to his london rooms you could hear their voices as you came down talking in the drawing room then miss rosamund she came out she looked up at me and her face turned that bleak i wanted to weep i didnt know whatd unsettled her but it was there in her eyes cold as death it was miss olivia who found the note she left and burned it in the grate a note i was never told that there was a note found when rosamund died rutledge said appalled sadie sat down heavily and with great effort then asked him to fetch her homemade wine from the small cupboard by the dry sink when shed finished half the glass and got her breath with more comfort she said no miss olivia she burned it like i said it was written in a scrawl youd hardly recognize and hidden under the pillow just a name and a warning twas all miss olivia needed she went whiter than she was and bent over her mothers body in such grief i couldnt bear it so i walked out of the room and went to fetch mr nicholas the note was never spoken of again i didnt need to be told id heard the hounds myself since poor little richard was taken i knew whod put the overdose in miss rosamunds water not her not that woman so full of life and loveshed not have gone to her god with selfmurder on her hands it was spoken with a vehemence that brought an angry flush to sadies cheeks in a stronger voice she added the twins they were still too young to know anything about such things only that their motherd taken ill in the night and overdosed herself mr chambers he was heartbroken youd have thought he was the grieving widower not the familys lawyer it was the gabriel hounds that whispered in her ear bending over her as she dropped into that last sleep and shed known shed known where the danger was the danger to herself oh aye that and the danger to miss olivia because the truth of the matter was you see mr cormacd set his cap next for miss olivia if he couldnt become a trevelyan in one way hed do it another and miss rosamund she wouldnt marry him nor after begging her how could he ask for miss olivia without it all coming out shed have told mr chambers too when he came sure as god gave her the breath it was what shed decided after all the worry and the sleepnessness he was in a bind and the easy answer was to remove the light of that house miss rosamund shed used every excuse to put mr chambers off and he hadnt run he still wanted her with all his heart hed have done whatever she asked hed have questioned olivia too and she might have told him at long last what was on her soul but when miss rosamund died mr chambers was so sunk in his own pain that there was no way of reaching out to him miss olivia buried her mother and told the world that grief had overwhelmed her in the night mr smedley he loved that family and he wouldnt hear of suicide nor dr penrith he said her hands had been shaking shed been in a muddle from no sleep and it was easy for her to make such a tragic mistakedosing herself rather than waking one of the servants from their rest she was that thoughtful people believed it was true and her killer counted on that to go scotfree who was there to cry murder miss olivia who burned that paper if it was murder she looked at him pityingly ive laid out more than half this village in my time dead of accidents dead of sickness dead of broken heartsits common enough dying aye sometimes murders been done too but dr penrith was a good man he could find that needle in the haystack and we all knew each other well enough to guess whose hand had done it the husband the lover the jealous neighbor but it was different at the hall there was none there who didnt love miss rosamund dearly and miss olivia knew theyd fight against her unwilling to believe any such tale as she could spin he was careful and very clever there was no proof but that was when miss olivia and mr nicholas took mr brians children out of their will no house and the money tied tight in trust however long and loud the hound might bay it wouldnt be for their blood but he came for her anyway in the end because of the poems because he has the money now to do as he pleases because she knew what she knew and it was time for him to marry theres a new provision in the deed of that house that if cormac fitzhugh ever chooses to live in the hall he must never marry mr chambers he thought it was because miss olivia loved mr cormac and didnt want him to bring another bride there but she said it was her house shed do as she liked with it and nobody could stop her which was true enough and mr cormac hes never married but hell live in the hall and i hope with all my heart that the hounds come for him there in the dark when theres no help to be had she began to weep tears running down her white withered face in ugly runnels as if there had never been places for them to fall before and now they couldnt find a way rutledge found himself breathing hard his body tight with black and wordless rage he gave her his handkerchief and she took it fumbling in the blindness of the tears she touched her face with a dignity that was heart wrenching because these were not tears for herself she still hadnt cried for herself after a long silence rutledge asked why did olivia choose to die and why did nicholas die with her sadie shook her head if she wanted you to know that shed of told you in her poetry somehow and god help him she had huskily rutledge said more to the point did she tell you she didnt have to i may be old and tired and useless but there was more to me once and a heart to match it i knew without the telling was cormac ever in love with olivia he was deathly afraid of her if im a judge it was the only thing he ever showed fear of and that fear was nigh on to superstitious miss olivia said he didnt believe in god but that he believed with whatever heart he had her death would surely be his death for the first time in a very long hour hamish stirred and spoke as clearly as if hed sat there at the table with them from the start or because of the tension that held him like a vise had rutledge himself formed the words aloud somehow he was never afterward sure shes wrong there it was no her death that brought him down but nicholas cheneys and yon lassie not understanding it and sending for the yard sadie looked up at him her eyes no longer clear and sharp aye its true enough she answered it was mr nicholas dying but how could he have left mr nicholas alive hed have come for mr cormac with his bare hands the instant anything happened to miss olivia however carefully it were done thats all that saved mr cormac for twenty years miss olivia not wanting to see mr nicholas hanged no they had to die together that was the only chance mr cormac had in this world rutledge had written down her words and afterward when hed made more tea and coaxed her out of weariness and the peace of forgetfulness with his help she read them over and with a shaking hand signed at the bottom of the last page now now he could walk into a courtroom with all the evidence any barrister might need except for what stephen hadnt trusted to olivias boxes the fitzhugh family history it was late when rutledge walked through the woods trying to cope with the emotions that still consumed him listening to his own footsteps on the path the soles of his shoes grinding on the gritty flint and earth like the mills of the gods slowly but surelybut he didnt want slowly he wanted a reckoning now bloody and final and with vengeance driving it and hamish ferociously wrestling for control was losing as he rounded the last bend in the trees there were lights ahead of him and behind the bright windows the heavy thunderheads of a storm building flashes of reddish gold lightning laced the clouds dancing among them as the roll of distant sound like guns firing out to sea reached him rutledge felt a cleaving tightness in his stomach before the battle aye hamish remembered with him always the guns but in gods name youre not in france now not tonightl thats a storm coming in fast and yon house has nae claim on you now nor the man in it your works done this is no your fight man pausing in the shelter of the darkness he turned his eyes back to the house there were lamps in several rooms the drawing room the study where olivia and nicholas had died an upstairs bedroom that had been rosamunds an invitation then of a kind im here i know what youve done this day come and face me yourself if you dare hamish said not when yere sae angry not with the darkness on ye its not worth dying for just to see how hell take his defeat im not dying in there and neither is he if i can help it hes laid down the challenge i wont walk away from it olivia didnt but he knew very well it was the heat in his own blood speaking hamish retorted this isna the law its vengeance and its for herall for that bluidy woman he didnt answer his mind already busy calculating weighing there was a scent of pipe tobacco on the breeze that ruffled the leaves over his head faint but real then the sound of feet walking closer rutledge turned his head behind him on the path the rectors voice came out of the darkness low and passionate the people of borcombe are simple but they arent stupid theyve talked to each other and put most of the story together by now so have i and ive spent my day trying to undo the harm youve done here youve shaken their faith and in the end theyll blame themselves for all those deaths theyll shoulder the burden for twentyfive years of wickedness for not recognizing or stopping it rutledge said ive seen it happen before in murder cases could have prevented it but not this time not with this killer tell them that if i understood why rutledge turned his attention back to the headland gauging the storm and what was waiting in the house the lamps were still burning the bedrock of my faith is redemption that everyone can be saved because deep down theres some goodness to search out and nurture smedley said tiredly i want to help no theres no goodness to find here go back to the village and leave this to me here take this with you he handed smedley the statement hed taken from the old woman keep it safe for me what is it just give it to harvey its finished or it will be in a little while thats what frightens me finished how olivia wouldnt have wanted it to end in violence as a man of god i can try to reach out to offer the churchs solace and forgiveness rutledge on edge and wishing the rector back in his church said savagely ill make it plain this man has killed for the sake of killing whatever he may tell you whatever reasons he may offer whatever logic he can bring to bear for his defense he killed because it suited his purpose and because the opportunity was there and the power of shaping his own fate with his own hands he found exhilarating whatever went wrong in him it isnt going to be exorcised by the church or by you no there is good in every human being i believe it devoutly then go down on your knees before the altar and pray for guidance i need it or if you want to be useful find inspector harvey and tell him i require a warrant but send constable dawlish around to the beach by boat just in case he tries to leave in that direction by boat theres a storm coming i know hurry man there isnt much time rutledge was already walking away as he spoke smedley stayed in the enclosed darkness of the trees as the londoner came to the end of the path and started up the drive not concealing his presence not slowing his pace hamish said roughly all right then yell be fighting his darkness and your own but yere a clever man and ye canna show weakness its what hell watch for let the words roll off his tongue and your back but rutledge didnt hear slowly one by one the lamps were extinguished plunging the house into darkness all but one he could see in the drawing room with its faint glimmer in the halls tall windows the thunder made him flinch again his nerves raw his senses already at fever pitch lightning flickered and through the windows of the room where olivia had died it seemed to dance fleetingly as if there was a living presence there at the steps rutledge hesitated but the door didnt open and he took out the key he still kept in his pocket the shaft of light falling from the drawing room door like a spear was very bright after the darkness outside making him blink and he hesitated aware of what might come out of the halls shadows at him then he turned towards the drawing room his footsteps brashly loud in the stillness there was an airlessness too in the house that seemed to suffocate him in spite of the high ceilings and the open door behind him he could smell the trenches again feel the earth shaking under his feet as the barrage began the sappers were still deep underground he wasnt sure theyd make it out in timetheyd be buried alive in moving earth as hed been breath shut off by tons of soil rising high into the night sky and then collapsing in on themon himshutting out everything sight hearing air hamish stirred uneasily calling out to him rutledge forced himself back into the present making himself concentrate on the light not the dark on the threshold of the drawing room he stopped again there was a decanter and two glasses on the small table by the hearth beneath rosamunds portrait one of the glasses was half full the other empty as if waiting for him theyd both been right he and hamish leashing his anger with an iron will he crossed the silent room and stood looking at the portrait for a time his eyes seeing it his ears listening to the sounds of the house it seemed to be electric with tension and then cormac fitzhugh was standing in the doorway she belongs here doesnt she i was sorry that susannah insisted on taking her away as if rutledge was a guest and cormac the host was making idle conversation before dinner rutledge turned to see the mans face and felt a coldness in his blood there was nothing there of anger or tension or a desire to kill if anything cormacs expression was pleasant welcoming but the brilliant blue eyes were fire answering him rutledge said yes shes the spirit of the house cormac smiled at him thats a very irish way of putting it is it cormac came to the table and picked up his drink then gestured with the glass wont you join me rutledge said nothing and cormac went on easily theres no laudanum in it will you join the search for this new ripper he isnt my business never was but olivia marlowe is ah he lifted the glass again gesturing this time to the portrait you didnt know her as i did olivia was only a pale shadow of rosamund she had a remarkable talent olivia her poetry but talent is transient fame is transient we are all going to die some day mores the pity it seems man has learned to do everything except live forever when we achieve earthly immortality i suppose well finally have the power of god im not sure id want that immortality to live forever would betiresome eternal youth that might be more useful cormac laughed the handsome face lighting from within would you choose now or before before i have no fond memories of the war no i dont think you have ive read your medical reportsi still have connections in london with the people i worked with during the war and most things are available for money a very intriguing file im amazed you survived but youve nothing to fear from me i dont plan to expose you no rutledge thought youd much rather kill me he said aloud it doesnt matter i never expected to keep my secrets forever if they come out ill find something else to do with my life but he knew how great a lie that was or end it cormac asked softly responding to the silent thought you can pray for that will you be here when i leave it depends on what youve come to find for the first time something echoed in the quiet voice after a moment rutledge said why should i make it easy for you and walked past cormac back into the hall to his surprise cormac actually let him go but he could feel the mans eyes still watching him and he knew it wasnt over he crossed the hall taking the stairs two at a time while hamish reminded him that stephen had fallen here the words tumbling like the man had done over and down and crashing into the floor below yet only rutledge could hear them at the top of the steps in the gallery he made his decision then took up the small lamp from the table where it had been set waiting nearly lost in the surrounding blackness down the passage to the left not the right past the closed doors of bedrooms the darkness here astir with feelings rutledge couldnt name as the lamplight made a circle of orange light around him the oil was hot beneath the glass warming his hand he thought of olivia and of nicholas did one ever come back from the dead it was an interesting question he hoped it would be some time before he discovered the answer to it the silence in stephens room was palpable in the lamplight the furnishings seemed stark and somehow dauntingly empty heavily shadowed he paused in the norway for a moment listening to the sound of his own breathing and hamishs trepidation leave now the soft scottish voice repeated over and over now but rutledge crossed to the bed and knelt his hands moving along the struts that held the springs in place fingers careful sensing their way over the strips of dusty wood his nails struck the books binding his fingers stretched and closed around it drawing it out with infinite circumspection then it was in his grasp he stood and in the silence there was now a humming of tension like the distant baying of hounds the hairs on the back of his neck lifted in a primeval reaction hamish hissing malevolently heard it too there was very little time he opened the slim book thumbed through the pages once then again found the family genealogy that had been written carefully here ever since a centurydead fitzhugh had held this prayer book in his hand at confirmation long ago in ireland in another time and another world the sound was louder the tension something that made his body tighten with anticipation it was like waiting for the huns to come over the top and yetdifferent the first rumble of nearby thunder shook the house and his pulses leaped as if the first shells had landed hurry hamish urged him with one swift movement he drew his pocketknife opened it and gently slit the handwritten pages at the binding so that they fell out in his hands he checked once more as the footsteps rang out on the bare wood coming closer boldly stalking down the passage towards him yes hed gotten them all the records of a familyand a single line at the end cormac fitzhugh mother unknown father unknown taken from a ditch along the road to kilarney fitzhugh by courtesy not adoption and the date the gabriel hound unblessedand cursed without a name or blood of his own lifting out the book on irish horses from the others stephen had kept on the table by the window rutledge slipped the pages inside then returned the heavy volume to its place and the closed knife to his pocket was it his imagination or did the echoes seem to double triple the number of footfalls as if there were hordes in the passage crowding it elbowing each other cutting off all space and air sudden panic seemed to choke him he fought it down refusing to give in to it but he was trapped here damn it he wasnt in france this was cornwall he was facing the open doorway the little prayer book in his left hand his balance even ready for whatever was coming for him and then once more cormac fitzhugh came out of the darkness and into the light he was in his shirtsleeves now his eyes went directly to the book rutledge held i wasnt sure my father had kept it after turning anglican for rosamund stephen swore he had it he said but he wouldnt tell me where hed put it before he died i thought it was probably a lie but i had to keep searching thank you for sparing me further trouble over it he must have found itand hidden itthat same morning did you kill him the fall would have i think but i gave him a more merciful end he couldnt move whether it was true paralysis or temporary i cant tell you i twisted his neck until it snapped then shouted for susannah and rachel give me the prayer book now if you please interesting reading rutledge said thumbing the pages lightly apparently youre illegitimate not the stigma it once was of course but you have lived a public lie for many years havent you stepson to the trevelyans even these days the news wouldnt sit very well in london business circles would it where a gentlemans word is his bond especially not if it came from stephen trevelyan in banking himself his doubts dropped in the right quarters could have ruined you he flipped the book closed did you ever learn who your real parents were no fitzhugh found me abandoned along a country road half starved filthy and sickly and he took pity on me but youre absolutely right about london especially since the troubles and that uprising in dublin england saw it as an unforgivable stab in the back in the middle of war being irish just now is the same as being a traitor a bastard irishmanan upstart and a nobodystephen swore hed use that to ruin me in the city if i didnt help turn trevelyan hall into a mausoleum rosamunds house the hall is all i ever truly desired in this world even the money ive earned was only a bridge to owning it and i wanted to come here by right not with my tail between my legs before rutledge could read anything more than light amusement in the mans eyes hed moved swift as lightning without conscious preparation like a snake striking without warning rutledge expecting it dodged but not quite fast enough his head jerked back by cormacs stiff forearm hit the wall with a loud crack and as light flashed behind his eyes cormac moved in to follow up with a blow that had the full force of his shoulder behind it rutledge felt his knees buckle and his senses reel under the impact he was nearly unconscious hamish fiercely yelling at him to hold on when the third and final blow brought down a pall of blackness he awoke to block nothingness lashed out in the primeval primeval fear of blindness and realized suddenly that the lamp had been taken away and he was alone a flash of lightning told him that he was in stephens room where cormac had left him he moved gingerly and everything worked shaking his head to clear it rutledge felt a wave of dizziness that threatened to send him back to his knees using the tables edge to pull himself to his feet he leaned on his hands for precious seconds willing himself into full control of his senses again the amazing thing he told himself dazed still was that he was alive rutledge stumbled across the room and in the next flash of light saw his way through the door thunder rattled the windows behind him the passage was black but there was still a lamp in the drawing room to guide him down the stairs he ran across the hall and looked through its door the portrait was there but cormac had gone where had the man hidden his car or had he come by boat as rutledge had anticipated it was the most silent the most secretive means of coming and going unseen but was it still there the boat swearing as the rising wind caught the big door when he opened it rutledge went out into the night down the steps towards the strand ahead of him was cormac moving through the darkness which meant that he rutledge couldnt have been unconscious very long rutledge called out to him shouting his name cormac turned and lifted an arm mockingly he wants you to come after him thats why he didna finish it in the house hamish exclaimed will you no stop and think man rutledge said nothing his eyes straining to follow the figure ahead of him but cormac was no longer taking the path to the beach hed veered off towards the headland picking up his pace swearing again rutledge plowed on the wind tearing at his face and his coat pushing him sideways his head seemed to split open with the pounding pace hed set but he clenched his teeth and ignored it at the headland where it curved to its highest point cormac turned in the lightning his pale hair blowing in the wind his shirt white against the black clouds beyond he seemed to glow with malevolence lucifer hamish warned rutledge saved his breath and ran on until he was within a few yards of the other man the way it will look cormac yelled you broke under the strain tonight unable to sleep disoriented you came out here to the headland to watch the storm and in a wild moment of selfdoubt you went over the edge thunder brought back the guns and guilt and all the nightmares did you kill olivia or did she choose her own death ah olivia she mesmerizes you as rosamund mesmerized me i meant what i told her the weekend before that i wouldnt hesitate to tell london that she and nicholas were lovers the lucifer poems created quite a stir and i had the feeling another collection was coming out that she hadnt finished with me i wasnt sure i could ruin o a manning but i knew how to kill olivia marlowe how did she answer you she laughed in my face and said that she might welcome the darkness if it brought me harm and promised to burn any new poems shes been a sword in my flesh since i was twelve weve been bound together like lovers by the bonds of a mutual fear but the tides turning and i have to go then he said very distinctly they were not quite dead when i slipped into the house that night i think she must have known i was there the wind was snatching his words away but rutledge heard them and hated the man with a ferocity that was deep and cold cormac for a second time in his life miscalculated this time rutledge moved first with such speed and anger behind it that he caught cormac off guard and sent them both reeling back then before either man could brake their momentum over the edge of the cliff it wasnt a sheer drop it was rock eroded by wind and weather it was clumpy grass and earth punctuated by straggling shrubs and heaved outcroppings a long and rough slope that took its toll on bone and flesh as they tumbled down towards the fringe of boulders where the surf crashed whitely the noise rose to meet them so mixed with the thunder that there was only an endless deafening roar as rutledges shoulder hit the slope he grunted with the force of it then forgot it as cormacs body slammed into his nearly winding them both they grappled for a hold as they rolled and slid yelling cursing pure fury fueling flailing knees and fists rutledge tasted blood and salt on his lips and felt a warm wetness just under his ribs where something had ripped through the skin cormacs flesh was also taking a beating but he was ignoring it with the singlemindedness of a lifetime rutledge fought with the cunning and strength of the battlefield the ruthless unforgiving training of handtohand combat he found himself wishing fervently for a bayonet a rifle butt a weapon of any kind he could feel if not hear the sucking in of breath the grunts from the savage effort cormac made to match him hold for hold blow for blow there was grit in rutledges teeth one eye was half closed and his left elbow felt numb as they came suddenly to the end of the long ragged slope and pitched with savage momentum into the cold wild water shocking both of them in his grasp cormac went limp rutledge heaved himself up through the rough sea and pulled the other man with him you arent deadi wontlet you die he shouted gasping for air but cormac made no response as his face came out of the water damn ityoull hang yet there was a dark smear across cormacs forehead where hed struck rock under the water laying open the skin it was bleeding ferociously now rutledge was fighting the great rocks and the surf rolling in haphazardly before the wind and the storm seemed to be tearing at the headland above downdrafts sending a sandpaper of grit and dirt against his face he clenched his teeth with the effort feeling his body tightening then tiring in the cold water feeling the pull of the current and the edges of the rocks and the weight of the other body he was dragging after him hamish was screaming at him and he ignored it concentration centered on keeping cormacs head above water even when his own sank and he seemed to swallow half the sea unable to breathe feeling himself choke and sputter and start to fail from somewhere in the whirling darkness he heard hamish calling his name forbidding him to die not nownot yetby god i wont let you go this easily or was that what he was telling cormac over and over in his mind panting and coughing he broke the surface again and brought cormac with him the other mans weight seemed lighter now as if hed come to his senses again yet he made no effort to swim or struggle every muscle seemed stretched beyond its limit but rutledge kept one hand locked in the collar of cormacs shirt and with the other fended off the rocks as his feet and legs pushed and pulled and dragged them against the pull of the water in the direction of the strand the numbed elbow sometimes gave way and they both crashed into rocks were washed high on the inpouring of heavy surf and then were slammed back into the headland but rutledge refused to give up sheer will keeping the two of them afloat water was everywhere there seemed to be no end of it he dug with his heels bobbed bumped thundered into sharp edges felt the bruising and lacerations on his back and still held on i didnt survive the damned war to die in a cornish sea he swore to himself again and again ill live to see this bastard hang so absorbed was he in the ordeal of surviving he wasnt even aware that his feet had struck the shingle of the beach where it met the rocks it caught him illprepared for the next surging wave the tide was flooding in and he was swept forward with such force that he lost his grip on cormac they both were dragged up the shelf the water and the sand unmerciful to their faces and hands then the salt burning fiercely where the flesh had been scoured open he lay there digging in with his fingers and toes as the water worked to suck him out again the tide pulling with an energy hed long since lost then it was past him and he fought now for breath trying to stop the shuddering of his lungs and the pounding of his heart beside him he heard cormac breathe as well roughly at first then a long deep draught of air and then the man was on his knees something in his hand raising it high above his head and bringing it down with all the strength hed hoarded while he let rutledge struggle to save them both hamish shouted as rutledge rolled and the stone came thudding down without sound ploughing deep into the wet sand unstoppable with the renewed power of cormacs whole body behind it enough damn it was enough rutledge swung his foot and caught cormac in the groin hed lost one shoe but the toe of the other came into the soft flesh with the might of fury driving it and cormac screamed in a highpitched howl of pain that could be heard above the sound of the water and the screech of the wind rising in a gurgling choking cry that was cut short as he doubled over in anguish sobbing and spluttering as the next wave came in the cold water rutledge thought with fierce satisfaction breathing hard with the effort hed had to make had turned out to be an ally after all reducing olivias lucifer to the human plane of mortal suffering he lay there on his back on the wet shingle rain pouring down over his face and felt the scrapes and bruises and aches begin to come alive his elbow throbbed with an intensity that made him wonder if it was broken or only cracked under his ribs there was another sensation of fire and ice where something sharp had gone in and his head was still splitting with pain every muscle burned with exhaustion he wanted only to sleep after a long suffering silence cormac said in one shuddering breath i knewwhen i first saw you thatyou were differentmettle why did you kill them youre the policeman he said after a time you tell me there was silence again then an odd passion filled cormacs cracked voice the first daythe first day i came herethe hall held me fast there was a warmth about iti dont know butanne laughed at me when she heard me tell a groom id give anything to live in such a place i wanted to choke it back in her throat that laughter instead i had to walk away and pretend i didnt care when she fellwhen i pulled at her sash to make her fall out of the treeand she died on the grass in front of me i realized id just found a way to have everything i wantedif i was careful and patient after that after that they were none of them safe what about the man on the moors did you kill him too rutledge asked suddenly remembering the tramp there was a chancethey never found richard you seei thought hed come back one dayyes he was still doubled over hugging his body his face grimacing as the waves of pain subsided in their own good time from somewhere in the distance they could hear voices calling cormac lifted his head in the darkness and stared at rutledge you had better kill me now if you dont ill ruin you in the courtroom theyll blame youbefore im done for a split second there was an overwhelming temptation to take him at his word rutledge clamped down on it the policeman in him routing the soldier whod swiftly calculated the odds and he heard hamish growl when the policeman won in satisfaction or regret he was too spent to care or will they be glad to convict the irish bastard whose deception took in half the city rutledge answered and got slowly achingly to his feet he reached down a hand and then thought better of it grabbing the back of cormacs collar instead and dragging him to his knees cormac managed to stand half bent over then suddenly found the strength of will to stand straight eye to eye with rutledge lucifer had been stopped but not vanquished not yet down the strand constable dawlish appeared in the heavy rain peering towards them and shouting i think theyre over here inspector harvey with smedley at his back and rachel coming up at the run something in her armsblankets he thought as she stumbled and slipped down the path from the lawns cormac swung to face them and smiled as harvey clapped handcuffs over his wet wrists watching rutledge unconsciously braced himself it would be an appalling trial the tragedyas always in rutledges eyeswas that the murderer could never be charged with the havoc hed brought to other peoples lives only with the deaths laid at his door smedley was right it wasnt over for the villagers of borcombe not for rachel and susannah not even for olivia and nicholas and rosamund and you theyll be after breaking you on the stand hamish warned they can try he answered silently rachel looking up at him said in a low strained voice as she gripped his arm with wet icy fingers i have to know was it me that nicholas loved or was it olivia the words seemed to be torn from her as if they had never been allowed to surface from the darkness of her dread until now rutledge shook his head and consciously told a lie out of infinite compassion he didnt want her to die alone he said it took courage to make such a choice forgive him for it she bowed her head and began to cry when theyd taken cormac away and rachel her face set and pale had followed smedley back towards the village rutledge was left on the headland alone pulling one of the blankets shed brought tighter against the cold air that had followed the storm he limped across to where the black patch of burned grass had once been even its shadowed outline filled in with green now the ashes long since washed away he knew what had perished here in the fire nicholas had built why olivia and nicholas chose that moonlit night of beauty in which to end it a love they couldnt have after a time i envy you both he said softly in the night lifting his head to look up at the room where they had died as he turned towards borcombe the wind followed but rutledge wasnt aware of it he stopped at the end of the drive and looked once more at the house below the headland it stood there dark and silent manmade and vulnerable yet somehow invested with a grace all its own and he knew without knowing how that olivia was finally at peace but that he would be possessed for a very long time by the woman she had been
