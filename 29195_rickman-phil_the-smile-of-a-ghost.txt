the smile of a ghost the seventh book in the merrily watkins series a novel by phil rickman mumford all the people whod told mumford its a new beginning all the beaming faces blurred by pint glasses frosted with froth all the damp handshakes mumford mumbling ah thanks thank you very nice course i will no i wont be going nowhere yes no thank you andy mumford who didnt see the point of new beginnings complete waste of half a lifetimes experience andy mumford who had just wanted to carry on the way this town had carried on the oldest town he knew or at least the one that looked oldest bent and sagging and people loved it for that and nobody looked up at the crooked gables and the wormriddled beams and said what this old place needs is a new beginning mumford felt a gassy fury inside like in one of the firstever pictures he could remember in a childrens encyclopaedia it was and it showed the inside of a volcano close to eruption how many years ago was that now fortyfour fortyfive god almighty not that anybody would ever know about the volcano in mumford not showing it was the one thing he was real good at not showing his excitement when the suspect in the interview room said the wrong thing at the right time springing the trap not showing what he really wanted to do to the rateyed rapist with a cellar full of porno videos never showing his feelings because he was a professional and because he was imperturbable clumsy old word bit of a mouthful but probably the nicest thing anybody ever said about him in all those years in the job and that was all right imperturbable implied solid reliable professional only what bloody use was being totally professional when you didnt have a profession any more what use was imperturbable ever going to be to him again mumford walked up broad street ludlow which some folk maintained was the most beautiful street in the most beautiful medieval market town in the country and it might as well have been a semiderelict industrial estate for all he noticed warmish evening now easter just gone and the town coming alive for the tourists everybodys world opening up mumfords closing down what would he do day to day through the summer and then the autumn and the winter and then another year another thirty years if he was spared the length of his career all over again thirty years of whats the point he reached the top of the wide street across from the buttercross the old market building with its fancy little clock behind it the tower of st laurences soaring over a tight mesh of streets and alleys the whole scene warm and golden andy mumford feeling as warm and golden frankly as shit ludlow wasnt his town mind mumford came from leominster back in herefordshire a dozen or so miles down the a it was just that his mam and dad had moved here to take over a little shop after the old man retired from the force why dont you get yourself a little shop andy some bastard had said in the pub andy couldve nutted him and now gail was working parttime as an auxiliary nurse at ludlow community hospital because gail was still a professional for probably the first time ever mumford had brought his wife to work this morning and hed come back now after what had to have been the longest day of his entire life to pick her up tonight they were going to have a meal at one of the fancy new restaurants that had opened up here a celebration meal a couple of extra glasses of wine for him because gail would be driving them home a toast to a new beginning a meal they wouldnt normally think of affording in the town that with all these new eateries had become the food capital of the welsh marches mumford conceding that for the town this probably did in fact qualify as a new beginning always been prosperous but it had real wealth now all these poncyvoiced bastards moving up from london with their silver knives and forks mumford glared with this new resentment at the little shops with their blinds down and the dark windows of the buttercross where the town councillors met and patted each other on the back and swapped the odd masonic handshake he was in his best suit the suit hed last worn to collect his commendation from the chief constable and gail had brought to work some nice clothes to change into at his mam and dads house down the bottom of town behind the new tescos which was why mumford was walking uptown trying to get himself into the right mood to face his mam and his bloody dad for the first time since the home office had officially repossessed his warrant card needing to sound a bit jovial from now on on account of imperturbable was no longer enough to see him through he was expected to become a member of the human race to become andy andy the dumpy middleaged genial smiling bastard civilian well likely be seeing a bit more of you at last then andy mam had said the other night on the phone you can do a bit of decorating for us if you want to and robbie he wants to show you all his favourite places in the town dont you robbie hes nodding see hes always saying whens uncle andy coming robbie his young nephew his sisters boy from hereford who preferred to spend the school holidays with his grandparents in ludlow even though his grandad despised him ill be getting some kind of job mumford had snapped back ent that old yet guessing that when he got there tonight shed have forgotten he was even retired in any other job he wouldnt have been if hed just been a bit more ambitious in the early years if hed pushed a bit more he couldve made inspector and stayed on till he was sixty but he was a plodder and the plodders didnt get promoted and so they were forced into retirement at fifty and everybody thought that being plodders they were looking forward to it crowngreen bowls growing sprouts bloody linedancing surprisingly the only bit of understanding had come from francis bliss his last boss who was fifteen years younger and as a senior officer still had another twentyodd years to serve if he wanted it cid room mumfords last morning bliss frowning this is all to cock this system andy we just throw away our best natural resources like pressing the fuckin delete button on thirty years of database hed respected bliss for that realized how much hed come to respect bliss as a detective too despite him being a smartmouth from merseyside knew that when the time came unless the world was a very different place by then bliss never a man youd call imperturbable would go out cursing cursing mumford looked up at the hard shiny evening sky ready to curse god but god got in first god pulled the rug from under the slippers that mumford was never going to wear he was turning the corner to walk up to castle square when he heard it coming up behind him a sound that used to make his blood race but now seemed more like a taunt and he wanted to shut it out the way this morning hed punched in the button on his alarm clock which hed routinely set without a thought last night and then lain there staring into the whiteskied emptiness of a new day ambulance he stood on the corner under the dull maroon façade of mccartneys estate agents and watched it barrelling through the narrows a couple of tourists glancing up in annoyance like it ought to be horsedrawn in ludlow he didnt really mean to follow the thing it wasnt even instinct just that it was heading the same way as he was in fact he nearly turned back when he saw the patrol car on the square under the cheddarcheesecoloured perimeter wall of ludlow castle he did in fact turn away when the first copper came out of the gateway near the old cannon from sevastopol and he saw it was steve britton station sergeant at ludlow no hair left but still a few years yet to serve and even then theyd probably keep him on as a civilian but steve had seen him andy mumford kept on walking figuring steve would think it was a case of mistaken identity or that mumford hadnt heard him but then he heard footsteps not merely footsteps police boots clattering across the empty square and steve britton was shouting now andy so he had to stop and stand there waiting wearily in front of woolworths staring down at the pavement steeling himself for what was coming andy mate ive only just heard free at last then eh look i get off in an hour well have a couple of jars but when steve britton drew level with him it was different steves long melon face was damp with sweat and his eyes had a look that mumford recognized straight off a look hed probably had on a few dozen times himself over the years carrying out just about the worst chore you ever got saddled with as a copper confusing though on account of hed never faced it before never actually been on the receiving end feeling that sharp flat punch of dread a punch deep to the gut right where a few minutes ago the volcano had been simmering andy couldnt say anything he just stared at steve and at his uniform wobbling slightly experiencing for the first time ever what the sight of that uniform on your doorstep meant to the average person with no drugs in the house andy steve getting his breath back you been down to your mothers tonight not yet his mother andy felt his own breath catch something happened something happened steve far from bloody imperturbable the way that came out realizing how scared he was now how exposed the streets spinning yes steve said somethings happened walking with steve britton back to the castle the castle of all places christ the castle was ruined but pretty big a lot of it left you couldnt see much from here the town side but from down below across the river it was still massive and imposing and had been dominating ludlow for most of the last millennium mumford had probably been in there just twice in the whole of his life and never in the last twenty years but robbie practically lived here when he was staying with his grandparents which was every school holiday since his mother moved in with the toerag robbie the history buff quiet likeable boy covering up for his gran day after day please god not robbie thisll destroy her couldnt be anyway no logic to it howd this boy gain access steve we figure he stayed in hid somewhere after they closed the castle for the night theres a hundred places to hide inside these little passages the towers its a bloody honeycomb it actually looked like a honeycomb all yellow and orange in the evening light the main gates were wide open a young uniform mumford didnt recognize guarding the entrance you forgot how big this castle was inside the perimeter walls there was a green open space where they had sideshows and medievaltype displays in summer and then the christmas fair from here a stone footbridge took you over the moat which was all dried up now leading into the main fortification with this huge gatehouse tower that had been the old norman keep was that the word robbie would know couldnt be one fourteenyearold boy looked much like another trainers baseball cap this would turn out to be some tourist kid larking around mumford went back to being observational like he hadnt retired two days ago and this was still his job some part of him knowing that if he was to keep from losing everything that had ever meant anything in his life he needed to start off how he meant to go on and that was not as just another member of the bastard public walking with his uniform counterpart sergeant steve britton towards another another death scene just another death scene nothing to do with him a mistake red spears of sunlight were bouncing off the ambulance parked near the footbridge a couple of paramedics were bending over the edge of the driedup moat visitors can go right to the top see steve said talking rapidly a bit hoarsely good good views robbie walsh knows his way blindfold steve the square tower seemed awful high now the size of a big block of flats in this part of the world a st georges flag was hanging limp up there against the amber sky the stone bridge had a wooden handrail and even from here mumford could see there was blood on it like a splash of spilt creosote shouldve been taped off he could see into the moat now something humped and twisted on the bottom the fact that theyd left it down there saying everything mustve come down on the handrail bounced off steve said broken neck and the rest steve swallowed likely never had to do this before to one of his own andy i i hope its not i hope im mistaken thats all sure tbe mumford said lets get it over we used to see him all over town walking up broad street and down old street and past the station youd think hed get sick of it same streets day after day steve making it clear he knew what robbie walsh looked like he never got sick of it mumford said always finding new things so they reckoned he loves it here historymad goes to all the lectures all the exhibitions has some kind of season ticket for this for the castle so he can come in and out people knew him andy all the local people and the shopkeepers knew him always polite not like most of the little sods steve keeping up this streetcorner chat routine to delay the moment prepare mumford for the worst one of the paramedics was on his feet now talking to the cops and shaking his head likely telling them what they already knew witnesses mumford said feller seen it from over the river top of whitcliffe artist bloke paints pictures of the castle watching a buzzard through binoculars said it was ah you dont wanner know this stuff i wanner know everything just make sure first eh i wanner know everything mumford snarled knowing that he was shaking like a civilian that night angela his sister did some screaming the hereford boys had finally found ange and her partner in the orchard gardens the citys most misnamed pub out on the edge of the plascarreg so it was getting on for midnight when they got to the community hospital and ange must have drunk a fair bit which didnt help in the hospital mortuary mumford for all his experience had turned away biting his lip lying there with only his nottoodamaged face exposed the boy had looked all of eight ange had taken one quick glance and then it was the full handwringing dramatics its him its him oh shit shit shit look what they done to him during this performance mumford had found himself watching the scumbag partner lennox mathiesson hunched up with his hands in his pockets nodding his head halffascinated eartrinkets clinking it sickened mumford that angela was three months pregnant with this rubbishs baby tomorrow morning the body of her first child would be taken to shrewsbury for the postmortem tonight outside the hospital ange shelved her grief and set about doing what mumford reckoned shed been doing since before she could walk which was generously apportioning the blame so that there was none of it left for her that selfish ole bitch i just hope shes satisfied i gotter come all this way to see my son lying dead killed because she wasnt fit to look after him she robbed me robbed me of my son i hope shes fuckin satisfied now ange in the car park legs apart arms folded and a sawnoff top advertising her navel and her condition thirtynine years old i reckon you better get off home angela mumford said ill phone for a taxi happier yere than he ever was with you you remember when she come out with that one what did you say nothing as usual shes not right mumford said quietly you know that except on that occasion mam had been dead right mumford drew away from the alcohol fumes stumbling back into a tree trunk as his sister stuck her wet smudgy face up to his she ent fit to look after a child thats for sure and you never said a word so i hope youre satisfied too mister smartarse fuckin detective he ent a detective no more knowing smirk from lennox mathiesson ten years younger than angela two convictions for burglary one aggravated plus an abh well mams mind might be on the blink but she could still recognize a bad bastard when she saw one and that was why her and ange hadnt spoke for the best part of two years since ange had left robbies dad decent enough bloke worked at burtons mensshop for mathiesson mumford got out his mobile putting in the number of this taxi firm he knew in leominster itd cost but he just wanted an end to this night oh yeah get me out ange staring at him with contempt get me out fore i makes trouble well were gonner make trouble mister you count on it we can sue that castle for a start hands on her hips now body arched belly swelling out letting him run wild all day in dangerous ole ruins that oughter be fuckin pulled down run wild robbie mumford was thinking of all the times hed heard her say i wonder sometimes where he came from hiding away with his books no proper friends its not like having a normal child is it angela he said obviously youre terrible upset but lets just get one thing straight theres no case to sue the castle robbie was there illegally when it was closed for the night well well fuckin see about that wont we mister smartarse fuckin exdetective mumford nodded standing with his heels in a flower bed taking it what else could he do and whats disgusting like i say is she never knew where he was i bet she even forgot he was stayin yere laughable that coming from ange it had always been mumford himself whod picked robbie up and brought him over to ludlow for his holidays and his most sorrowful image of the boy was not the lolling body under the tower but the pale kid with a suitcase waiting like an orphan at the top of the steps at the plascarreg different boy altogether when he got to ludlow but ange was never going to want reminding of that he got the taxi firm on the mobile soons you can paul eh and ill tell you what mister you can tell the ole bitch she can pay for the fuckin funeral god almighty angela it had been like this for as long as he could remember mam had been fortyfive when shed had ange and the gap was always too wide mumford always in the middle covering his ears wasnt fit to look after nothin and you never seen it or you pretended not to more like cause you was always too busy persecuting folks just wanted a bit of pleasure outer life meaning the time he and bliss had had mathiessons brother for enough crack to lay out half the estate personal use the balls they expected you to swallow mumford had never set foot in anges flat from that day to this you bloody let her take him away from his own mother just when i needed the help you robbed me she robbed me every ange had started to cry again then tottering across to lennox mathiesson who gathered her into his tattooed arms giving mumford this thin smile over her quaking shoulders time he was off needed to pick gail up from poor bloody mams gail in her best frock for the celebration dinner christ anyway you know where i am mumford said and walked away angela screaming at his back you tell her i hope she never sleeps again all the lights were on in his mam and dads house the last neighbour walking away they were good to her the neighbours in this short terraced row down at the bottom of the town between the station and the new tescos mumford sat in his car and just wanted to stay there he could see gail and his dad through the extended front window its curtains still drawn back his dad had a hand on his forehead likely with exasperation by now his dad had never had much patience with female emotions gail had a cardigan over her new frock and she was bending down like she was bending over a sickbed below the level of the window frame his mam would be sitting in her chair and the tv would be on with the sound turned down he could feel the atmosphere in that room coming out at him like radio static gail was a nurse and knew how to handle people in grief all mumford knew was how to catch the people whod caused it which didnt apply in this case whatever ange said and even if it had he wasnt allowed to do anything no more unless ange was halfway right and he was the guilty party he leaned his sweating forehead against the back of his hands on top of the steering wheel and let the breath come out of him feeling beyond exhaustion aye hed known the state she was in the ole girl but hed also known how much it had meant to her having robbie around didnt know much about degenerative brain disease but he did know his mam would have gone downhill a whole lot faster without the boy when he looked up he saw how pale the night sky was the big tower of st laurences looming out of the body of the town and became aware of another person standing out on the edge of the tescos car park still as a post looking across the road at the house a woman it was with pale hair escaping from the hood of a long grey cape that hung to the ground the night was so still that the cape didnt move its folds like the stone pleats of the robe of some religious statue the only movement was a white flickering like a candle on an altar and it was a candle mumford saw in a metal lantern that hung from the womans hand emerging from a slit in the cape mumford experienced a moment of superstitious fear like he was seeing the angel of death outside the house and then a bigger fear that he like the ole girl was losing his marbles and he got out of the car in a nearpanic as he reached the edge of the car park the woman turned to face him and there was enough light for him to see that she was entirely human and that shed been crying you all right madam mumford said she didnt reply just walked away with the candlelantern swinging like a captured star in a cage and mumford shook his head and crossed the road to his parents house part one robbie i talked to one of the officials and he told me that he was always getting reports of odd happenings in and around the castle peter underwood a gazetteer of british ghosts it is well recorded that those left behind often do experience feelings of closeness to their dead loved ones during the months immediately after their loss ian wilson in search of ghosts into the loop no please i want to understand this siân said youre telling us that you yourself have seen one her pewter hair hung like a warlords helmet shed found her way to the head of the table and she was sitting there in judgement her expression was like say it say that word again the word that merrily was realizing should be avoided i once had an experience thats the only way i can describe it she said a series of experiences if you like that i couldnt rationally explain in the vaultlike vicarage kitchen beeswax candles burned low in their saucers and the empty ashtray mocked her shed been trying to tell herself shed guessed it was likely to turn out this bad but the truth was no not in her worst dreams and so i went to the church for advice and the church wasnt exactly helpful felt i was being treated like some kind of hysterical loony siâns grey eyes blinked once like the steel shutters on the little windows of a police cell merrily stared into them sorry i meant like some kind of emotionally dysfunctional person with advanced learning difficulties and where exactly did you have this series of experiences merrily here at the vicarage upstairs just after we moved in a couple of years ago this is rather a big house nigel saltash said huge certainly compared with anything id lived in before just you and your daughter saltash tilted his head fractionally as though he needed this slight motion to activate his enormous brain it also turned his smile on he had an allpurpose smile questioning explaining sympathizing patronizing for many years hed been a psychiatrist some things didnt change just the two of us yes merrily said me and jane like now so if i were to humbly suggest and you could say im simply playing devils advocate if you like that you were feeling terribly insecure at the time a stranger in the village not yet fully licensed or formally installed as vicar and youd been thrown into this enormous ancient echoing rather spooky old house plus i was not that many years widowed and we had very little money also like now and have the experiences stopped now in the candleglow nigel saltashs face was taut and tanned from skiing somewhere his light grey hair was cropped tight and fitted flush into his beard he was long and lithe and living proof that seventy was the new fifty yes it was all over very quickly merrily said once wed got certain things sorted out youre playing into my rationalists hands mrs watkins deliberately perhaps well i suppose im making the point that someone like you can turn anyones circumstances to your professional advantage but am i necessarily wrong merrily shrugged im always going to say i know what i saw and youre always going to say but you didnt really see it at all and that way surely we arrive at something approximating to the truth siân callaghanclarke said do we nine times out of ten yes anyway merrily said that was the main reason why when i was offered the post of exorcist deliverance consultant i would have found it hard to say no i still cannot believe youve been allowed to go on for so long alone siân was shaking her head the danger youve been in sorry one of the candles sputtered out and merrily ran a forefinger nervously around the rim of her dog collar shed been naive shed misread the signs huw owen had told her at the start what shed be up against if women priests were seen as soft plaster patching up the already crumbling walls of the church a woman exorcist might as well just paint a great big bullseye between your tits huw had said memorably a month or two ago when the bishop bernie dunmore had said im afraid that once again ive been asked what youre doing about establishing a deliverance advisory panel shed shrugged it off realizing that ok sooner or later there was going to have to be a support group within the diocese but it had to involve the right people didnt it people who were sympathetic who didnt have an agenda political or otherwise only the ones shed thought of as the right people hadnt wanted to know simon st john vicar of knights frome backing away in mock terror when shed asked him making the sign of the cross with both hands but the point was she knew that he would always be there for her like the wise old owls outside the diocese huw owen and llewellyn jeavons it just wasnt official some of these people didnt do official whereas people like siân callaghanclarke and nigel saltash didnt do anything else saltash was a good friend of the dean and giving his professional services free no better reason for the dean to take him to meet the bishop and the bishop to introduce him to merrily in any modern deliverance circle a qualified psychiatrist was now fundamental a free one was a godsend thank you god thank you so much you mean im in spiritual danger merrily said as a woman in a male tradition now siân was staring at her leaning back in her chair like merrily must be deliberately winding her up siâns mother was a new labour baroness she wore her feminist credentials like defiant tattoos within five years shed either be a bishop or out of the church spiritual danger political danger all the same to her i meant like the first exorcist having been jesus himself merrily said lamely she let the silence hang recalling the reported mutterings of her predecessor thomas dobbs as hed prowled the cathedral cloisters trying to engineer her resignation at the time shed been probably the first certainly the youngest woman diocesan exorcist in britain operating under the customized title deliverance consultant appointed it later became evident largely because the former bishop of hereford had wanted to get into her cassock siân callaghanclarke already a wellplaced minister in the diocese would have heard the rumours and stored them away payback time for bimbo priest martin longbeach carefully relit the candle with a taper martin tubby and camp wore an alb and an outsize pectoral cross and was known to covet the south herefordshire parish of hoarwithy because of its exotic italianate church it had been his idea that they should light candles tonight to aid concentration by danger siân said i meant the danger of being compromised and exploited and of having to make instant decisions that youre perhaps not qualified to make experienced enough to handle siân left this unsaid merrily sat in the candlelight images of the past couple of years encircling her like pale smoke fears anxieties faltering hopes tentative joys and also the most bewildering and stimulating years of her life there was a stillness in the air was this it intimations of the end on a cool april night siân callaghanclarke clasped her long hands and leaned over them across the table tonight weve tried to go over what we understand by the term deliverance and the multiplicity of conditions were expected to examine from perceived ghosts and poltergeists to perceived curses possession and socalled psychic attack weve considered the cases merrily has to deal with day to day the deluded the disturbed the fantastical the pathological liars not forgetting those in need of prayer and nonjudgemental understanding and the ones afflicted by what seemed to be genuine intrusion merrily said seemed to be nigel saltash smiled seemed to me to be a conclusion not lightly reached the point is siân said that deciding who is deluded and who however remote that possibility might be is ahm genuinely afflicted has been merrilys sole responsibility an impossible situation for just one person who also has a parish to run ive not been without backup huw owens always on the end of a phone merrily felt the outline of the unopened packet of silk cut in a pocket of her denim skirt the other backup ah yes siân said looking over her halfglasses huw owen im sorry saltash said who is huw owen nigel im not sure youll want to know siâns eyes were still and neutral merrily was furious but bit down on it she really really needed a cigarette they were all looking at her huw was my primary tutor me and a bunch of others he runs training courses for the deliverance ministry in a former nonconformist chapel in a remote part of the brecon beacons where nobody can hear you scream siân said my understanding is that huw owen while living the life of a fourthcentury hermit has himself been in such a precarious psychiatric state for so long that merrily felt herself arch like a cat thats ridic that not only can he no longer be relied upon to remain au fait with current thinking and fucking defamatory merrily said in the silence the phone rang in the scullery which she used as her office siân looked up said mildly you want to get that ill let the machine take it merrily glanced at the scullery door which was ajar if its not urgent they all sat there uncomfortably as the machine in the office played merrilys outgoing message through the open door nigel saltash giving her a look that was professionally wry and sympathetic it was saltash whod introduced siân whod worked with him when she was standing in as a hospital chaplain she said shed been wary of deliverance work up to now but if nigel was going to be involved siân in turn had brought in martin longbeach once her curate who was clearly a placid and malleable guy and no doubt guaranteed not to fancy merrily this was a nightmare there was a bleep from the answering machine and a cough mrs watkins mumford andy mumford ill call you later if thats all right with you the line went dead the machine rewound merrily nodded i can call him back would that have been sergeant mumford siân asked from hereford cid i think hes about to retire actually may already have youve had some interesting dealings with the police havent you i was talking the other day to sergeant mumfords superior dci howe oh yeah our paths have crossed so she tells me i get on very well with her figured if glacial annie had opted for the church rather than a fasttrack police career canon callaghanclarke would have been her ideal spiritual director ill make some more tea merrily said nobody had referred again to huw owen nobody had reacted to her outburst no i think we should say goodnight at this point siân folded her document case took off her glasses given ourselves quite a lot to consider yes i think weve all accepted that having inherited a basically medieval structure our task is to turn it into something practical efficient and geared to the demands of the twentyfirst century to formulate a set of parameters so that changes in say personnel will not damage the efficacy of the essential deliverance module merrily gripped the cigarette packet on her thigh deliverance module siân stood up i think the main decision weve made is that to ease the very obvious pressure on merrily all of us should immediately be brought into the loop the deliverance email loop that is and that each and every new case should be submitted for observations before any action is taken correct it makes sense martin longbeach said we might not always be able to make a contribution but its a question of sharing ill tell sophie at the bishops office merrily said and in my case nigel saltash said in these formative days i do think it might be rather a good idea for me to tag along and observe some of the people youre dealing with merrily i mean purely from an educational point of view sorry i want to learn see how you operate had more time on my hands since we sold half the land always thought i could settle down in retirement as a farmer but im afraid that once a shrink would that be in order i want to understand how you see deliverance merrily took a big breath nigel how i see deliverance im supposed to be a priest right i have to operate on the basis of there being a spiritual element that weve got used to calling god in everything so i actually believe that things can happen on more than one level indeed martin longbeach said the holistic approach is essential all aspects of life are interconnected and the fact that there are certain things that im never going to be able to explain scientifically or psychologically that doesnt bother me one way or the other and i think we should be there to say to the people affected no youre not necessarily going mad but if you are nigel saltash smiled hugely we can also help you with that merrily sighed as i tried to say when i was having problems the church looked at me sideways and raised its eyebrows pityingly i dont want anybody out there to feel im writing them off as disturbed or deluded and id absolutely hate to cramp your style merrily saltash said merrily stood up her legs felt weak well see what we can work out of course we will saltash said dear god vicerage lol had a bunch of newhome cards hed put them in the deep sill of the window overlooking the bathroomsized garden and the orchard beyond jane began to read them holding the first one up to the hurricane lamp hanging from the central beam alison eh wooooh the card had a pencil sketch of horses on the front alison kinnersley who bred them had lived with lol for a while before taking up with james bulldavies whose family had once run this village before they ran out of money two years ago even a struggling squire with holes in his farmhouse roof had been a better bargain than lol but now lol had mum and a career back on course and the village more than accepted him and even alison was being generous its definitely the right thing to do shed written you cant hide it for ever even james thinks that now and i dont need to tell you how conservative james is wow jane said if it goes on like this theyll be inviting you to run for the parish council lol looked down from the stepladder the overloaded paintroller in his hand dribbling burnt orange onto the flagstones jane had chosen the ceiling colour it looked wrong now but she was never going to admit that lol just looked uncomfortable he had orange smudges down the front of his gomer parry plant hire sweatshirt tiny spots on his round brassrimmed glasses then again jane said maybe not there was a card from the prossers at the eight till late and one from gomer parry and danny thomas welcome back boy with a sheep on the front driving a jcb finally one from alice meek god bless you in your new home mr robinson big letters full of stroke victims shake alice was only alive because of lol and the village knew it and that was why he was so welcome here now and of course it was making him wary lol didnt wear medals finding the old girl halffrozen over a grave in the churchyard carrying her into the vicarage and all the heavy stuff that had happened afterwards he didnt even like to talk about any of that it could easily have ended so differently the verdict at the inquest on the guy whod wanted alice dead had been accidental death totally correct although most of what had happened had not come out the villagers closing ranks around lol no longer an outsider even if it wasnt publicly acknowledged that he was mums whatever couldnt have worked out better really his first album in many years was out he had respectable gigs scheduled and he was about to abandon his temporary flat at prof levins recording studio at knights frome like thirty miles away for this little terraced house a oneminute stroll from the vicarage so like if his star for once was accelerating towards the high point of the heavens well nobody could say it had been easy jane looked up at him it was getting too dark to paint and the electricity was still disconnected but he was going at it like if he stopped somebody would come and take the house away and maybe take mum too and then the tour would be cancelled and the album would be savaged in the guardian or time out and come on down lol tomorrow is another day need to finish this corner you cant even see the corner lets go and get some chips otherwise i wont get to eat till breakfast if mum gets through with the pofaced gits on the deliverance committee before eleven itll be a certifiable miracle hate going in the chippie now lol said they wont let me pay jane laughed its not funny jane lol they like you thats unsettling jane sighed whens the next gig next thursday bristol wooh bigger and bigger glastonbury next year jane you trying to make me fall off oh god nick drake syndrome it never really goes away bad enough that theres this guy from q magazine coming to interview me on saturday lol said i mean if id thought what jane went to the foot of the ladder shouting up like he was on a mountain did you actually say q magazine like did i hear that correctly and did you say thats bad enough and are you insane just there are things i dont necessarily want people to read about so like jane spread her hands wide in frustration dont talk about them talk about any old crap lie they wont care theyre a music mag when will it be in dunno its a monthly guy said they work weeks in advance maybe it wont be in at all they probably do a lot of interviews that get overtaken by better stuff this diffidence is worrying jane shook her head i think i preferred the paranoia she went to put alices card back on the window sill and found another one lying face down whats this lol actually this one wasnt a card as such it was a folded paper lined like from a writing pad she opened it out and held it up to the lamp saw crude line drawings done in thick fibretip of a big house and a little house with two parallel lines between them suggesting a road across the big house was scrawled vicerage jane looked up at lol vicerage vicarage lol started rolling hard at the ceiling could be a double meaning there i suppose but i wouldnt think whoever sent it was that smart there was a doublepointed arrow connecting the two houses across the road underneath the drawing was written reckon you can find your way in the dark bloody hell jane said its a poisonpen letter she looked up the ladder lol went on painting jane smiled thinly so this was the problem well there was always going to be one spiteful bastard somewhere mum got along with most people in ledwardine but not everybody approved yet of women priests and it was a safe bet that not everybody who did approve would accept the idea of the female clergy having intimate relationships unsanctified by marriage like the clergy was supposed to stay in the victorian era mum and lol walking out together with a chaperone this would be one of the areas of his life that lol would prefer to be kept out of q magazine who sent it i dont think thats supposed to be obvious jane thats possibly why it isnt signed but theres an element of threat i mean i realize its probably just some semiliterate tosser lol came down from the stepladder ducking under the beam that divided the room the beam was dark brown oak well woodwormed a big chocolate flake the hurricane lamp swayed shadows rolled jane wanted to crumple up the paper but on the other hand can i keep it what for might be an opportunity to compare the writing like with the parish noticeboard the cards in the shop window or even the prayer board in the church i mean its always useful to know who your friends arent anyway she folded the paper nothing really to worry about i dont think mums worried i mean the bishop knows jane picked up a paint rag and dabbed up some blotches from the flagged floor recalling the first time shed seen lol when he was looking after lucy devenishs old shop ledwardine lore lol peering out between racks of appleshaped candles in the orchardscented air like a mouse hed been really messed up back then jane had been fifteen just a kid now she was facing a levels and a driving test and she wasnt a virgin and lol and mum were some kind of tentative nervous item and lucy devenish was dead hard to accept that even now no matter what colours the crooked walls and sloping ceilings were repainted this was lucys house and always would be when you stood in the hall you could imagine you still saw her old poncho hanging over the post at the foot of the stairs if it was really dark when you came in you could imagine lucy herself there wearing the poncho her arms lifting it like batwings the people from london whod agreed to buy the house when it first came on the market last year had given back word after their fiveyearold asthmatic kid had asked who the old woman was on the landing scary lucy hadnt been scary not really formidable certainly maybe a little witchy in the best most traditional sense and ok she had been a little scary but shed liked lol and supported him when he needed it and shed been some kind of mentor to jane and and this was ok lol finally getting the house this was meant everything finally was going to be ok for lol and for mum whod been a widow for long enough yeah in one way it was ridiculous lol living in this little house and mum across the road in the huge vicarage with seven bedrooms but it was an arrangement that would work for the time being and it would have lucys blessing lucy who though dead still somehow spoke for ledwardine jane allowed herself a shiver lol carried the roller and paint tray into the kitchen and put them in the sink how about you get the chips lol you wimp wallets on the mantelpiece jane found it and took out a tenner mushy peas why not just dont say theyre for me jane shoved the tenner down a back pocket of her jeans along with the vicerage note and shrugged on her fleece youll be all right on your own for a few minutes then you and lucy lol said sometimes did i tell you sometimes i try out a new song on her if she likes it she joins in a bit croaky and out of tune of course but you cant jane threw the paint rag at him pebbles next morning when jane had left for school merrily phoned huw owen she hadnt slept well was feeling frayed and edgy sitting in the scullery in the kids old pink fleece outside the window the day was crazed with april chemistry white sunlight soaking through holes in the foaming cloud so when did this happen lass huw had been up north on what he liked to call a retreat working with a gang of hardnosed clerics in the badlands of south manchester she wasnt yet ready to hear his horror stories think it happened when i wasnt looking cant say you didnt warn me if you dont pick a team somebody picks one for you just that my guys didnt want to be picked he was silent she could hear the kindling detonating his livingroom fire pictured his feet in peeling trainers on the hearth the volatile sunlight in his old hippys shaggy hair she was getting the feeling that his manchester time had left him energized rather than wearied precarious psychiatric state bitch i feel pathetic she said ringing you with this stuff i just wondered if youd you know heard anything huw had been born in rural wales but brought up in yorkshire returning to the beacons in middle age as a parish priest and a personal trainer in the practice of exorcism where nobody can hear you scream merrily heard the creak of his chair as he stretched thinking callaghanclarke wasnt she one of the bints who did a circledance round the tombs of the old bishops in hereford cathedral to celebrate the ordination of women if she was shes calmed down now the calming power of naked ambition get their feet under the table next thing they wants a bigger table where exactly does she stand in your deliverance circle given herself a title diocesan deliverance coordinator we voted on it every case we get from now on has to be submitted to the group before any actions taken we voted on that too three in favour one bemused abstention bugger huw said quite a little focus group its just what you need isnt it we light candles and concentrate im not kidding she told him about martin longbeach and huw laughed the noise milk would make if you could hear it curdling merrily looked up at the wall clock nearly nine am and a difficult funeral to organize an elderly woman whod moved to the village no more than a fortnight ago to live with her daughter and soninlaw themselves comparative newcomers and andy mumford was due here around ten it was looking like another day when she wouldnt see much of lol backups one thing huw said you need a witness sometimes no question and somebody to watch your back but an illmatched committee operating in an area where nothing at the best of times is ever a bloody certainty we all accept the need for a psychiatrist there are good shrinks huw said and there are dangerous shrinks you come across nigel saltash before never me neither merrily gazed out of the window at the unmown lawn vividly green against the grey sky with its seeping sun hes a regular churchgoer however huw laughed again you know your problem lass had your picture in the papers once too often and you take a very nice picture they dont like that and they werent happy at all when you were cosying up to the pagans against ellis oh huw ellis was the kind of humourless dangerous fundamentalist bigot who brings the church into ellis was part of the church huw said whereas pagans are pagans any road im just planting the thought who doesnt like it not the bishop dunmores a timeserver he wouldnt even be consulted think higher huh she was thrown you want a list of all the embittered backstabbing bastards who hate the whole concept of deliverance hey god forbid that priests should meddle in metaphysics somebodys happen saying we need to keep an eye on that little watkins in hereford could be getting carried away too much too soon needs a steadying hand hang on let me get this right you think callaghanclarke may have been nudged into place as a an instrument of restraint merrily heard huw sniff she was thinking of what siân had said about his precarious psychiatric state would it help to tell him about that she stared out into the garden at the pale buds on the apple trees and the bottom line she said is that nothing much gets done right but how can we be certain huw doing this delicate disapproving posh voice we could so easily look ridiculous couldnt we and this lad with the candles sounds like window dressing bumbling new ager whimsical but essentially nice and harmless making us seem a little woolly thats a good word aye let me get this right you actually think leave it with me huw said ill ask around see what i can find out merrily made a call about the funeral hereford crem two pm monday shed go and see the family over the weekend it was always a problem when you didnt know either the dead person or the bereaved gently quizzing them about their mum looking for the one little jewelled detail that would make it meaningful before you slid her through the curtains and the next one came through another priest another set of mourners a line of sad trains on the last platform andy mumford turned up ten minutes early on the phone last night hed sounded agitated when he walked in she was shocked he was wearing a fawncoloured zipper jacket over a yellow polo shirt shed never seen him without a suit before and he looked all wrong hed always seemed comfortably plump now he was sagging and his farmers face was less ruddy than red you had breakfast andy i can do toast no no he waved a hand said hed have tea weak no sugar so shed been right hed retired from the police when three weeks back mumford pulled a chair from under the pine refectory table three weeks and two days cid boys bought me a digital camera oh now ill have to get a computer he sat down with his legs apart hands bunched together between his knees like having your leg off sorry people thought i was looking forward to it like you look forward to having your leg off wake up in the morning and you think its still there and then you realize it was why his clothes didnt fit hed lost the kind of weight you could never quite put back poor andy shed seen a lot of him over the past two years most recently as bagcarrier to frannie bliss the di bagcarrier and local encyclopaedia an essential role youll get another job merrily filled the kettle security adviser somewhere or to be honest mrs watkins id rather not be a nightwatchman at some batterychicken plant mumford looked down at his hands might get some chickens of my own mind beehives dunno yet however he looked up at her howre you im all right she smiled along the welsh border it was some kind of etiquette that you took ten or fifteen minutes to get around to what youd come about you tossed pebbles into the pond and at some stage the issue would float quietly to the surface must have been fascinating to listen to mumford interrogating a suspect your mother dont live round yere mrs watkins cheltenham she has a lot of friends there now we dont see each other that often but you did have some relations yereabouts my grandad had a farm and an orchard near mansell lacy when i was a kid all gone now mumford nodded my folks moved north into south shropshire after my dad retired from the force ludlow they had a little newsagents and sweetshop for a while then it got too much for them nice place historic pretty historic themselves now my mam and dad theyll expect me to do more for them now im retired no brothers sisters sister twelve years younger than me lives in hereford with this lowlife idle bugger her he paused her boy from when she was married he never got on with this bloke always an oddball kid used to spend the school holidays with his grandparents in ludlow he looked at merrily and she met his baggyeyed gaze and detected ripples in the pond a circular movement something coming up mumford said my sisters boy my nephew robson walsh the name broke surface lay there the water bubbling around it robson walsh suppose youd still be dealing with the funny stuff mrs watkins mumfords face was a foxier shade of red now but she saw that his eyes looked anxious when it comes up she sat down opposite him never the most religious of professions the police saw too much injustice degradation few signs of divine light even frannie bliss raised a catholic up in liverpool had once said that if he ever made it to heaven he wouldnt be too surprised to see a feller with a trident and a forked tail sitting on a cloud and laughing himself sick whatever this was it was hard for mumford robson walsh robbie walsh robbie walsh oh my god andy tv pictures old mellow walls police tape a school photograph the boy who fell from ludlow castle aye i was there at the castle in the town come to pick up the wife she was working at ludlow hospital we were going out for dinner celebrate my celebrate he looked down at the table station sergeant at ludlow spotted me in the street took me into the castle boys still lying there waiting for the pathologist god im so sorry andy i just never ive spent time with a lot of families lost a child he looked up at her but at the end of it mrs watkins you always gets to go home you said your sisters son slag oh lives in hereford with a new bloke toerag only too happy to let the boy spend his holidays at his grans now she blames me your sister why cause we covered up robbie and me covered up how bad the ole girl was getting he couldnt stand the thought that he wouldnt be able to go and stay there he loved it see ludlow the history they called him the history boy in one of the papers thats right you and he covered up that your mother was there was a knocking from the front door where the bell had packed in again merrily didnt move whats the point of putting a long name to it mumford said but her minds going and it ent no better for this but didnt your sister know what your mother was like they dont speak not since she went off with the toerag i usually got to take the boy to ludlow hell he was all right there better than at home on the bloody plascarreg with a latchkey your sister lives on the plascarreg not the best address in hereford he was capable and intelligent mumford said i never had a son but i couldntve complained if id got one like him anyway gail works at ludlow hospital three days a week so she pops in sees theyre all right what about your father not the most sympathetic of men tells you about all the death hes seen in his time how you gotter put it behind you kind of thing meanwhile ole girl goes over and over it in her mind whats left of it mumford glanced over at the door to the hall more knocking you better get that its ok probably just the postman with a parcel hed leave it in the porch robbie walsh she recalled the case throwing up questions in the papers how had he managed to conceal himself in the castle had he been alone so has the inquest opened and adjourned after medical evidence boy was cremated at hereford no proof of anything more than an accident most popular theory is he got totally absorbed in whatever he was checking out inside the castle got hisself locked in and went up the tower to try and signal for help mabbe leaned over too far that feasible its feasible but theres ways out of there for an agile kid and if anybody knew em he would but nothing iffy sitting on a plate the police dont go looking for it no more not enough manpower to handle what they got on the books already verdict of misadventure most likely and what do you think i reckon it should be an open verdict mabbe im just saying this on account of its destroyed what was left of my bloody family but i reckon theres stuff we dont know meanwhile my mam this is gonner be hanging over her for the rest of whatever shes got left there was more knocking at the front door insistent in more ways than one it looks like mumford said sorry hanging over her its why ive come you better get that this time it ent gonner stop merrily went to open the door just what she needed sorry if i got you out of the bath or something merrily nigel saltash smiling his allpurpose smile routine pastoral on his training courses at the disused chapel in the beacons huw owen liked to invent pet names for the unquiet dead insomniac hitchhiker breather groper exorcist jargon a touch of black humour for the troops merrily brought over an extra mug poured three teas and sat down at the head of the table her back to the window the sun laid a creamy sheen like an altar cloth on the pine table top huw would have called mumfords mothers problem a partingcaller or a day tripper throwaway terms for a commonplace phenomenon loved ones dropping in just to show their faces let you know they wouldnt be far away they tended not to stay long she remembered huw saying that nine times out of ten they were none of his business the technical term is bereavement apparition she told mumford if anybody bothered to do a survey theyd probably find that at least fifty per cent of bereaved people have similar experiences usually widows or widowers or the children or siblings of someone who had recently died but it could equally be a favourite teacher or a longtime colleague youd be doing something mundane around the house when suddenly youd feel a sharp awareness of whoever had died or youd actually see them passing through the hall or maybe sitting in a favourite chair just a glimpse and then theyd be gone what were saying andrew nigel saltash said is that this tends to happen with a person one is used to having around its something ive encountered many many times he was wearing a tracksuit the colour of his hair and his tanned skin shone at the door just now on autosmile hed told merrily hed thought they ought to have a chat onetoone didnt want her after last night to run away with the wrong idea and as this was his day for earlymorning jogging with kent asprey the fitnessfreak ledwardine gp oh yes old mates hammered the country lanes together every friday terrific so thered been no alternative to bringing him in and explaining to mumford about the new deliverance advisory group giving mumford an opportunity to say nothing make an excuse and leave call her later but of course it turned out that he and saltash knew each other from way back when saltash had worked at the stonebow psychiatric unit in hereford reminding mumford of all the times hed been called across to police headquarters to assess some druggedup prisoner selfharming in the cells what days eh and now both of them retired or entering a new lifephase as it were saltash watched with a smile conveying mild pain as mumford dumped three white sugars in his mug of tea essentially what youre looking at andrew is griefprojection the bereaved person is carrying an image of the departed one very close as it were to his or her heart we dont want to have seen the last of them a part of us desperately wants them still to be around in the old familiar places and so an area of our consciousness responds to the need this is almost certainly whats happening with your mother and her visions of the boy are we together on this one merrily would you say the tilted head the smile that was a welloiled explanatory tool but he was probably right huw owens advice had always been to leave partingcallers in general alone didnt matter whether they were hallucinations or psychological projections or something less explicable they usually brought comfort rather than fear or distress and so they were part of the healing mechanism part of a phase that would pass and if mrs mumfords mind was on the slide can i merrily conspicuously sugared her own tea and stirred it noisily can i just briefly go over some of it again andy your mother says she saw him first in the kitchen right mumford nodded glanced at nigel saltash then glanced away out of the corner of an eye said he was standing by the fridge like he was about to help himself to a can of pop when she turned towards him he vanished this was before the funeral nigel saltash was nodding eagerly merrily wondered despondent if he was going to call in every week after jogging with dr asprey to discuss the many areas where socalled spiritual guidance overlapped with nutsandbolts psychiatry and the second time she said to mumford in the back garden robbies standing by the bird bath looking up at the house mam was in the bedroom says she saw him through the window but it was you know it was like a reflection in the glass when she stepped back he wasnt there any more a reflection saltash said yes of course same in the town mumford was mumbling now like he wanted to get this over near the buttermarket shop window oh really another reflection kind of thing she was with my dad he didnt see anything she was looking in the window and robbie he was behind her but when she turned round merrily said did she think he knew she was there i dont i dont know i mean does she ever think he wants to communicate with her mumford shook his head dont know does it frighten her at all frighten her the corner of mumfords mouth twitched robbie right i see what youre getting at merrily nigel saltash said theres clearly a contributory element of perceived guilt here whether or not that guilt is misplaced and also he leaned across the table holding his hands like bookends a desperate need to know exactly what happened does she know you were coming here andy merrily said i mumford shook his head she dont like a fuss like she was very embarrassed at the size of turnout for the funeral people from the castle councillors the press like they were sitting in judgement she thought but all it was its still a small town see they take something like this to heart bishop insisted on conducting the funeral hisself david cook the suffragan bishop of ludlow number two in the hereford diocese bernie dunmore now bishop of hereford had previously held the post but surely david cook even though it was only about a week before he went in for his heart bypass mumford said not a well man and he looked it mumford didnt look a well man either his hair was grey and lank his eyes baggy and wary small veins wriggling in his cheeks he had to be about twenty years younger than nigel saltash but he seemed older just a civilian now no longer detective sergeant while saltash was still dr saltash look i mumford came to his feet might well be like you say mrs watkins imagination playing tricks well that wasnt necessarily what i old girls had a shock she dont want no fuss neither do i i just thought as i knew you youve cleared things up a bit thats fine and the doc here glad to help an old mate andrew nigel saltash sitting back with his arms folded like when the drivingtest examiner had told you to park and sat there making notes on his clipboard merrily said on impulse i think i should probably talk to her she saw saltash raising an eyebrow so if you want to ask her andy you think you could ah get rid of it merrily saltashs smile expressing professional curiosity wrong terminology nigel ah sorry help it on its way even that might be counterproductive so you have this general policy of nonintervention unless theres a clear threat to the patients mental health patient god something like that merrily said she hated this she hated it when lofty consultants exchanged viewpoints at the foot of the bed like the third party was already braindead i have a lot to learn dont i saltash said on which basis if you go to see this lady might i perhaps tag along she could see mumford was uncomfortable about this saltash evidently picked up on it too smiling down at him andrew old boy im retired ok like you this is observation only he was doing this windscreenwiper gesture with both hands no reports no referrals ill talk to her about it mumford seemed less than reassured which was quite understandable ill call you andy merrily said coming up to midnight she was lying fulllength on the sofa at lucys old house with lol sitting at one end her head in his lap low music was seeping from a boombox beside the glowing hearth i suppose im going to have to do something merrily said before it all falls apart on me the sofa delivered that day was the only furniture in the parlour it was orange like the toodark ceiling never trust jane in linda barker mode psychiatrists lol said the weight of his own experience turned the word into some kind of lead sarcophagus full of decomposing remains i think i want to kill him merrily said the sofa smelled of newness and showrooms but the scent from the fire in the inglenook was of applewood the kindest mellowest aroma in the countryside well she said you know oh he knew she was thinking of heavy medication day the only angry song on the new album it was about his experiences on a psychiatric ward with a doctor who overmedicated someone has to pay now dr gascoignes on his way a lot of residual bitterness there last year before they were a unit hed enrolled on a training course for psychotherapists with the feeling that he could maybe in some way alter things from the inside discovering fairly soon that mere psychotherapists werent anywhere near the inside and like all therapists and crisiscounsellors they were tenapenny nowadays and so lol had walked away from it back into music he slid a hand under her hair how necessary are they shrinks i mean in deliverance merrily thought about it you could probably say theyre only actually essential when youre dealing with someone who thinks he or she is possessed by something external a psychiatrist would be able to detect symptoms of say schizophrenia symptoms of schizophrenia dont necessarily prove the person actually is schizo lol said no but its something that needs to be eliminated how often have you had a case of demonic possession then never as you know never had a case where it was down to schizophrenia either so the idea of having a psychiatrist as a permanent part of your deliverance group could be overkill merrily said if you consider that most of what were dealing with are what you might call noninvasive psychic phenomena then if you have your resident psychiatrist insisting that its always down to delusion hallucination comfort chemicals in the brain et cetera then whats the point of people like you listen to us were finishing one anothers sentences merrily said how cosy is that whats this music elbow cast of thousands its lovely its bloody terrifying i dont know why i bother never mind they were probably influenced by you you vicars can be so patronizing merrily looked around in the firelight among the paint cloths and the ladders for a clock jane was out with eirion as usual on a friday night by agreement she was always home by one there wasnt a clock anywhere yet she guessed shed been here about an hour and a half so anyway i called andy before i came out she said im going over tomorrow to see his mother not being much help around here am i youre crap at painting anyway you told the shrink youre going i really dont know what to do i mean this is routine pastoral stuff i wouldnt be going if it wasnt andy mumford id refer it to local clergy it doesnt need a psychiatrist so why set a precedent youre right its overkill all this beltandbraces stuff the church covering its back never sticking its neck out can you cover your back and stick your neck out at the same time lol bent and kissed her one hand pushing her face into his the other hand mmmmph it suddenly struck her that there were no curtains in this room and one window overlooked church street youve gone stiff lol said she sat up you should talk we could go upstairs take some cushions merrily people know i need to get home janell be back besides if youve got to drive back to knights frome im going to sleep here on my nice new sofa lol said theres this guy from q magazine coming tomorrow quite early hes coming here prof didnt want him poking round the studio weve got tom storey in mixing his album profs a very private producer tom hates the media i wont say a word about you you know that it shouldnt be like this merrily stood up and straightened her sweater im sorry i mean theres probably no real reason for well get there lol said would they within a few weeks when his intermittent tour was over he was going to be living here permanently she supposed that what the newhome cards on the window sill were saying was that it was time to stop being coy and covert oh hell lol lets i dont know put a notice in the window at the eight till late or something uh lol went over to the window where the cards were you should know about this handing her a folded paper she took it to the hearth and opened it out it wasnt hard to read it by the firelight big letters find your way in the dark oh not a universal welcome then id have said it was somebody having a laugh lol said but i cant think of anybody i mean its not that funny is it she refolded the paper annoyed you might as well tell the guy from q it would at least end this kind of stuff not in the context in which theyd run the story itd have to be from my side the arrest the loony bin my years of hell now finding happiness at last with a good woman in every sense and letting it all come out in the music god merrily shuddered let me think about this when she left she went by the back door reaching church street via the alley keeping to the shadows until she was approaching the square where security lamps lit the front of the black swan and only two cars were still parked what was coming back was what huw owen had said had your picture in the paper once too often he was right of course deliverance was the churchs secret service essentially lowlevel publicity was seldom helpful no room at all for the cult of personality maybe the deliverance grouppanelcirclewhatever was a good thing good for her prevent her becoming proprietorial a question of sharing martin longbeach had said always painful lessons to be learned about yourself your attitude so why was she deciding as she padded quietly across the cobbled street to the vicarage that she would not ring nigel saltash about tomorrows appointment with mumfords mother saturday sun nigel saltash came to pick merrily up at ten jane spotted him from the landing window on her way down from her apartment in the attic calling down the stairs hes got one of those cool little bmw sports cars merrily widened her eyes like gosh hes getting out hes wearing jeans and a cream sports jacket that could be armani he looks a smooth old bastard mum merrily said nothing stepping into her shoes at the bottom of the stairs sliding her slippers under the hallstand she was still feeling resentful manipulated what saltash had done was phone andy mumford himself last night saying hed tried to call merrily but she was out finding out the time of this mornings proposed visit to mumfords mother and then leaving a message on merrilys machine suggesting he pick her up no point in a convoy so how badly do you think he fancies you jane said hes seventyone flower the new dangerous age theyre getting in as much sex as they can before its too late apparently at that age they can only hold an erection for five minutes max and its counting down all the time did you know that oh jane and listen youve got to stop calling me flower youve been calling me flower since i was seven ill try merrily pulled her coat from the peg what are you doing today in the absence of his girlfriend ill probably help lol finish painting lucys living room i dont think so jane peered down at her hands on hips im sorry the guy from q magazines coming to interview him teenage girl walks in the guy remembers lols history oh that is jane bounded downstairs that is like totally ridiculous it was twenty years ago he was a kid and he was fitted up and if the guy from qs done his research hell know that no smoke flower just stay away until hes gone ok hah jane stopped with an arm wrapped around the black oak post sunk between the flags like a tree stump at the foot of the stairs now i understand if the journalist sees me lol will have to explain whose daughter i am and we cant have that coming out can we merrily sighed its a music magazine they wouldnt be interested anyway yeah but doesnt the same firm publish heat jane please humour me feet crunched the gravel outside and the front door was rapped merrily unbolted the door telling herself that some deliverance teams worked like this all the time in tandem with a bloody shrink at the eight till late now the only worthwhile shop in ledwardine a partitioned strip along the side of the main window was full of handwritten notices puppies border collielab cross good working strain parents can be seen respectable cleaner needed two days a week mountain bike nearly new eighteen gears that kind of stuff even the personal columns of the hereford times were loaded now with ads like live adultfantasy chat venuss hour wankline but village noticeboards never changed unless respectable cleaner was some littleknown rural euphemism for bondagesupervisor this window was janes last hope anyway shed checked out the prayer board in the church shed even for the first time ever been through the parish register to see if by chance somebody had endorsed their marriage vows in the hand that had also scrawled vicerage shed photocopied the poisonpen note before giving it back to lol ok maybe it wasnt that poisonous it was just that they all had to go on living here and lol and mum had been through all kinds of crap already and it just really pissed jane off that there was some meanspirited git in this village who begrudged them a hint of happiness and mum was the vicar and therefore too nice to deal with it and lol was too timid and so mobile hairdresser women and men catered for she pulled the photocopy from her jeans held it up to the window close jim prosser who ran the shop waved to her from inside jane put away the paper waved back jim knew everybody in ledwardine must have seen a fair few handwritten shopping lists and weekly orders for delivery and he knew all about mum and lol maybe not and the lettering wasnt that close she walked off down church street sharp saturday sun slanting on ledwardine the black and white cottages and shops all tarted up for the early tourists looking for pseudoantiques and maybe a weekend cottage to display them in predatory londoners on the spree jane had read in one of the sunday property supplements that now you couldnt find a garden shed in the cotswolds for much under half a million the welsh border was no longer considered too remote for commuters so ledwardine this classic calendar village still enclosed by ancient orchards was well in the crosshairs even its onetime council estate no longer looked like a council estate with its new hardwood windows rendered brickwork conservatories bulging out like transparent blisters herefords estate agents were doing faster business than venuss wankline lol had somehow squeezed in though jane guessed that his mortgage on lucys house was crippling and knew that when she got round to needing a place of her own thered be like no chance here and she liked ledwardine didnt want it to become beverly hills with a botox population and jim prosser forced to stock disgusting pâté de foie gras to stay in business but unless you had a farm or something to inherit you were stuffed at least when the church kicked her out of the vicarage mum could move in with lol if that was acceptable to mr vicerage who might be here right now on the square watching jane wandered around keeping an eye open for eirions car after mum had put her off going to lols shed called eirion at home in abergavenny and hed said yeah ok he could probably try and cobble together a few quid for the petrol hed come over less enthusiastic than he might have been was something cooling off it was true that there were times when she felt she needed some space maybe go out with someone else just to you know compare but the thought of eirion with another girl she couldnt handle that she stopped in front of the twoup twodown terraced cottage separated from the pavement by a ridge of new cobbles lucys house a little black nissan was parked outside behind lols clappedout astra the man from q she thought of going round the back and letting herself in through the kitchen door that lol never locked just sitting in the kitchen listening but she knew that if lol was being too selfdeprecating shed just get annoyed and give herself away and she was annoyed enough already at the carrion crows from off scooping up ledwardine and at herself for being so insecure you must feel im rather on your back saltash said cruising onto the leominster road he had dark glasses on and his leather seat eased well back there was a buttermilk sun and the hedgerows on either side of the road were greening up almost in front of their eyes well i tend to think that if you arrive with a psychiatrist most people feel a bit threatened merrily said some of them have really had to steel themselves to approach someone like me and so we probably need to think of a way around that saltash chuckled just as well im no longer a psychiatrist merely a new member of the team who wants to learn probably a few things i could learn too merrily said being diplomatic for the moment she was wearing civvies jumper and skirt in another parish you didnt make a show of what you were the bmw was swallowing miles in small easy sips when saltash slowed for the leominster traffic island the engine made a thick and fleshy sound as if it was powered by rising sap with the size of insurance premiums and the cost of petrol you peered into a sports car these days and almost invariably saw white hair and driving gloves merrily tightened her seat belt so what exactly do you want to know about ghosts nigel ghosts saltash twisted his head towards her the cords in his long neck like piano wires oh ghosts are terribly interesting dont you think i doubt theres ever been a wholly convincing study though that mean youre thinking of making one be awfully timeconsuming but perhaps worthwhile id certainly be quite interested in examining apparitions as subjective or reflective phenomena im sorry a study of perceived apparitions to discover what theyre telling us about the perceiver the ghost as a psychological projection of someones inner condition inner guilt inner torment saltash joined a tailback of cars from leominsters towncentre lights sense of loss repressed sexual desire is the perceived ghost for instance shadowy and quiescent is it urgent or aggressive so i can take it you dont accept the possibility of ghosts as an objective reality merrily the very word ghost saltashs smile broke out is surely an antithesis of the word real so even as a christian i dont think the bible has a lot to say on the subject or am i wrong well it occurs here and there but probably without a hard and fast definition of the term ghost you see i dont know how far you personally go with this im not going to ask you about your personal psychic experience highly subjective therefore rarely helpful and not a can of worms id want to open at this stage of our relationship this stage merrily had the feeling of being worked becoming the subject of some kind of private thesis and guessing that whatever she said next would seep at some strategic point back to siân callaghanclarke there was that mellow newcar smell inside the bmw a discreet no smoking sign on the dash she wished she was alone in her rattling volvo look i i dont have a particular problem with psychological projection probably does account for a lot of ghost stories but it doesnt fully explain the traditional haunted house does it where something is seen again and again by more than one person how would you deal with that where do you want to start the lights turned green saltash turned left preconditioning folie à deux on a grand scale if i were a physicist i might even be drawn to seek a more scientific explanation of the tracememory theory but thats not my backyard the minds where i live edging a touch warily for the moment however around jungs collective unconscious so id be safe in assuming that the whole idea of the unquiet dead would be well over your belief threshold merrily nigel saltash wore his smile like a gold medallion do you think we know each other well enough yet to even raise that question without the risk of permanent damage to an otherwise promising relationship promising promising how they were leaving herefordshire now and the personality of the countryside was changing she saw the plains and ridges and escarpments of shropshire a bonier landscape a lighter green a bigger sky she saw far in the east the sawnoff slope of the clee hills and then momentarily in the middle distance fading out of the morning mist to the northwest the tower of the church that was sometimes called the cathedral of the marches st laurences ludlow the ancient town clustered below it an island in amber a small town with an antique lustre and a bigger history than the whole of herefordshire no town that ancient is unhaunted merrily thought irrationally at first lol had thought hes too young too young to know the background too young to understand how difficult it had been to get anywhere in the s with music that was soft and breathy and woven into a mesh of acoustic guitars when everything else was shiny and synthesized and nobody had heard of nick drake and the beatles were archaeology jack fine sat on the shorter stepladder his microphone between his knees wired to a minidisc recorder in his jacket pocket he had floppy hair and sulky lips and looked like he could be about nineteen but then so did a lot of blokes that lol learned later were in their midtwenties a sign of age but he tried not to worry about this any more and it became clear that jack fine did know the background maybe too much of it so as i understand it lol this goes back to when this other guy in the band karl windling was hot for this groupie and he roped you in to keep her mate occupied and they were both underage and you got stitched up i was eighteen lol said patiently i was very naive but you were the one who finished up getting arrested and taking the rap for something that never even happened oh god how many times was he going to have to tell this wretched story even karl windling was history dead in a road accident two years ago leaving you with a police record jack said lol nodding wearily and then my parents they were tied into this fundamentalist religious sect and they disowned me and everything went downhill from there got the wrong kind of help cracked up wound up in a psychiatric hospital and listen jack im not trying to cover anything up or tell you your job or anything but would it be possible to maybe not go into all this again lol jack leaned over his mike his fair hair falling over his forehead and covering up one eye look man ok i can gloss over it i can deal with it in like a couple of paragraphs its just that you seem to be putting this experience into a few of the songs on the album lol sighed no way round this the song heavy medication day jack said the one that goes someones got to pay now dr gascoignes on his way whats that about it was just a particular doctor who was how can i put this liberal with the medication anything for a quiet life and probably so people wouldnt know what he got up to on the side go on uhhuh lol shook his head he knows and i know and all the rest is just a song theres real anger in that song though isnt there which is unusual for you its usually more sort of resigned its as if this guy did something really bad to you not to me personally so what can we leave this one jack seems to me this whole album is about your journey through the system back into the light kind of thing jack said like an exorcism not exactly the word id use jack grinned like maybe he knew about merrily he couldnt know so how did you wind up out here in the sticks well i came here originally with a woman she eventually went off with someone else and then um lol leaned back on his sofa and paused for a few seconds while he worked out what it was best to leave out like him leaving the village and then coming back because of merrily then i met prof levin just as he was setting up his studio on the other side of the county and ive been working there helping prof out doing a bit of session stuff and then prof kind of persuaded me to do the album so i owe it all to him really lol got out a copy of the cd and put it on the boombox and they sat there amid the paint cans and the dust sheets discussing the songs and people whod played on the tracks including simon st john on bass and cello jack said thats a real name from the past and hes a vicar now right hes been a vicar for years cool yeah hes cool but youre nothing to do with the church oh no cause like your parents it can put you off when your parents are extremists a lorry full of gravel went clanging down church street and jack was silent for a moment seemed to be thinking what else he could ask how long have you been in musicwriting lol asked oh not long my old man he publishes specialist magazines now but he used to be a newspaper reporter when he was young but my grandad thought this was a really disreputable thing to be and he tried to persuade him to pack it in and get into the management side my old mans really encouraged me to go into cuttingedge journalism go for it you know dont look back musics er cutting edge i do other stuff anything that comes up really anyway lol i mean you were really fucked up for a long time werent you it was like with nick drake how longs he been dead now thirty years i mean like him you couldnt cut it on stage face an audience i identified a lot with nick drake from the beginning hence the name of the band hazey jane huh the nick drake song hazey jane oh yeah sure sorry i thought you meant so like how did you get over that cause you did this amazing comeback gig at the courtyard in hereford lol told jack about all the help hed had from moira cairns folkrock goddess who happened to have been recording at profs how moira had literally pushed him out in front of that audience scary oh yeah coldsweat situation all those lights all those faces and youre still doing a few gigs as support for moira right but you and her jack moved his hands around oh no lol said nothing like that but youre with somebody no i live alone a rural idyll right jack said right still waiting for eirion jane saw lol and the guy from q come out of the front door of lucys house and walk up the street to the village centre they seemed to be getting on ok she didnt know why she felt so responsible for lol he was just that kind of guy vulnerable the journalist was a surprise he didnt look any older than eirion for gods sake he had a camera with him a nikon digitallooking doing his own pictures too jane slid behind one of the thick oak supports of the old market hall as they came onto the square a few shoppers and tourists were glancing at them by now and jane saw that lol was looking a bit unhappy course i wont say where it is the q guy said only the market halls fairly well known lol said be a give away no problem well face you the other way better for the light too the guy lined lol up on the edge of the square with the church in the background and people walking past and jane wondered if he was trying to simulate one of the famous black and white streetscene pictures taken for nick drakes first album five leaves left and she wondered not for the first time if that was a good thing nick drakes music was wonderful but he surely represented the old lol he had after all killed himself with an overdose of antidepressants jane saw eirions car arrive little grey peugeot with the cym sticker identifying him as a welshman abroad eirion drove slowly around the square to park in front of the vicarage gate and jane stopped herself from running across waving a measure of cool might be more appropriate try and cobble together a few quid for the petrol indeed she strolled casually over the cobbles as eirion climbed out he spotted her at once and did his incredible smile the kind of smile that said you were the only person who could make it happen smooth bastard ok he wasnt eirion wasnt smooth he didnt even know he had any charm when theyd finished kissing he said is there something wrong why its very busy here today isnt it ive never seen it like this its saturday jane looked back at the square lol and the guy from q had gone already not a major photosession then didnt used to be like this on a saturday did it eirion said tourism its like tourists have suddenly discovered the area good for the shopkeepers i suppose jane imagined the figure of lucy devenish the ghost of ledwardine past standing in the shadows under the market hall lucy looking very old the way she never had and the poncho drooping something feeling wrong lets get out of here jane said on the slippery slope merrily found the atmosphere stifling too much heat foodsmells a sense of something out of everyones control she exchanged glances with saltash from opposite ends of the sofa saltash raised an eyebrow mrs mumford seemed to think he was some kind of priest and the wrong kind at that wheres the bishop she kept shouting at her son you said youd bring the bishop you never does what you says yous gonner do mumford sat impassive on a hard chair by the tv which was silently screening some saturdaymorning childrens programme grownups wearing cheerful primary colours and exaggerated expressions smiling a lot and chatting with puppets soon after theyd arrived mumfords dad had walked out cant stand no more of this im off shopping she wont face up to it you talk some sense into her boy else you can bloody well take her away with you im cold mrs mumford was hunching her chair dangerously close to the gas fire fetch me my cardigan andrew you got it on mam mumford looked down at his shoes the room felt like the inside of a kiln his mam wore this winterweight red cardigan and baggy green slacks she had one gold earring in and that wasnt a fashion statement she looked from merrily to saltash to andy shed done this twice before as if she was trying to work out who they all were why ent the bishop come he ent well mam i told you he had a heart operation her eyes filled up youll tell me anything you will mam he was always nice to me the bishop he never talked about god and that ole rubbish used to come in when we had the paper shop used to come in for his star nearly every night mam that was the old bishop he dont live here no more he cant tell me why see thats why he dont wanner come she turned to saltash cant tell me mrs mumford stared at saltash in silence merrily looked away around the room the walls were bare pink anaglypta except for a wide picture in a gilt frame over a sideboard with silverware on it but the picture had been turned round to face the wall all you could see was the brownpaper backing stretched tight what was it a picture of ludlow castle what would you like the bishop to tell you saltash asked mam kept on staring at him like she knew him but couldnt place him you could feel her confusion in the room like a tangle of grey wool in the air her voice went into a whisper why did god let her take him starting to cry now why did god let that woman take our boy saltash leaned forward which woman is that phyllis youre supposed to be a policeman mam rounding on andy chins quaking why dint you stop her andy mumford drew a tight breath through clenched teeth the veins prominent in his cheeks the bishop when he come round he sat on that settee with a cup of tea and a bourbon biscuit and he never mentioned god nor jesus not once merrily said softly mrs mumford who was the woman mam didnt look at her i cant say it she pulled a handkerchief from her sleeve and blew her nose saltash caught merrilys eye andy said mam you can say anything to mrs watkins and it wont go no further what this girl mam snorted mumford looked helplessly at merrily phyllis saltash said i think you were starting to tell us about robbie oh she smiled suddenly her face flushed she sat up centre stage he loves it here he does he felt safe here he loves it he was interested in history wasnt he he loves all the old houses hes always walking up and down looking at the old houses he knows when they was all built and he knows who used to live in them you can walk up corve street with him and hell tell you who used to live where what hes found out from books reads such a lot of books reads and reads i says youll hurt your eyes reading in that light phyllis saltash said can you see robbie reading no she reared up nodding the word out hard i dont need to see him no more i said please dont let me see him i dont wanner see him like that like that all broken i dont wanner i just hears him now nan nan sometimes hes a long way away but sometimes when im nearly asleep hell be real close nan she smiled and he draws them the old houses hes real good draws all them old houses and the church and the ca she stopped her mouth open and then her whole face seemed to flow like a melting candle and a sob erupted and she clawed at her face and then as merrily stood up kicked her chair back dropping her hands she took him off mam andy knelt by the side of the chair steadying it you mustnt she pushed him off andrew no mumford said now that didnt happen did it pushed him off his mam said he told me what do you mean mumford staring up into his mothers swirling face what are you saying outside the sun had gone in and there was a cold breeze merrily stared across the car park at the tesco store its roof line had a rollercoaster curve and she saw how this had been formed to follow the line of the hills beyond the town some town even tescos having to sing in harmony she felt inadequate something wasnt making sense or it was making the wrong kind of sense there was an acrid air of betrayal around the house where the mumfords lived in the middle of a brick terrace isolated now on the edge of one of the new access roads serving tescos and its car park when they came out nigel saltash had spotted andys dad walking back across the car park with a tescos carrier bag a wiry old man in a fishing hat think ill have a word if thats all right mumford nodding glumly sitting on the brick front wall of his parents home looking out across what seemed to be as close as ludlow got to messy the train station small and discreet sat on higher ground opposite the supermarket lower down was an old feedmill beautifully preserved turned into apartments or something then tiers of georgian and medieval roofs and chimney stacks and above everything the high tower of st laurences like a column of sepia smoke the doc says she needs assessment mumford said should have had assessment some while back see the way he looked at me its how he looks at everybody merrily said hes a psychiatrist her hands were clasped across her stomach damming the cold river of doubt that awoke her sometimes in the night the seeping fear that most of what she did amounted to no more than a ludicrously antiquated distraction from reality checking out the old feller now see mumford said next thing hell have the bloody social services in this is his hands gripping the bricks on either side shes got worse much worse since the boy died a dreadful shock can do it reaction can be delayed it doesnt necessarily mean shes on the slippery slope at her age mumford said what else kind of slope is there merrily paced a semicircle she saw saltash just out of earshot his head was on one side and he was pinching his chin and nodding flashing his mirthless smile as mumfords dad talked his carrier bag at his feet she was remembering huw owens primary rule never walk away from a house of disturbance without leaving a prayer behind had she left without a prayer because she was afraid it might have inflamed the situation or because nigel saltash was there just because im working with a psychiatrist doesnt mean other possible interpretations go out of the window she bit her lip uncertain hoping she wasnt just fighting her corner for the sake of it what do you think she meant about a woman pushing him off the castle mumford shook his head she never said that before does it make any sense there was a witness bloke lives over the river steve britton showed me the statement bloke saw him fall nothing about anybody else i wheres she get this stuff from never said nothing like that before i dont christ i need to check this out now dont i youre right its easy enough to say shes losing it he sprang up from the wall i dunno at every stage of your bloody life you become somebody you said you was never gonner be in what way ah youd be on an investigation murder suicide missing person and thered always be some paininthearse busybody relative never the father always someone a bit removed from it whod be trying to tell you your job have you looked into this or that aspect have you talked to soandso why ent you done this you wanted to strangle them after a bit but the truth is there arent enough cops to do half of what needs doing and so things dont come out the way they should things gets left filed ignored be careful andy merrily said for no good reason knowing she wouldnt be careful in a situation like this airyfairy sort of feller apparently writes poems and publishes them hisself who the witness ill mabbe go see him got time now ennit got time to be the busybody paininthearse uncle nobody bothered about the kid when he was alive except for one ole woman andy im hardly the person to be disparaging it but if she does think shes been given this information by a by robbie could be something he told her days before ennit before he died something thats suddenly clicked i been agonizing about robbies death for three weeks now thinking leave it till after the funeral wait for the inquest now even mams on at me to do something why dint you stop her where the hell did she get that from mrs watkins on the edge of the car park mumfords dad had picked up his carrier bag and he and saltash had started back towards the house in the wake of saltashs allconcealing smile andy merrily beckoned mumford into his parents tiny front garden i think we should try and deal with this go back in but not with him think of something ill be waiting there was another clear reason why the implications of retirement were terrifying andy mumford his dad reg mumford was taller than his son and held himself stiffbacked and upright but it was hard to believe now that hed ever been a policeman still wearing his fishing hat he was standing with his hands on the shoulders of his wifes chair as if it was a wheelchair merrilys feeling was that this was because he didnt want to look at her i reckon theyve started watering the beer again andrew you said have you found that no dad always start doing it this time of year when the tourists come i dont think so prices goes up too dont seem two minutes since it was one and six a pint before my time dad hee hee reg mumford pointed at andy who was standing uncomfortably up against the sideboard near the picture that was turned to the wall you ent gonner be saying that for long now youre retired see times gonner speed up times gonner flash by you mark my words boy mrs watkins would like to talk to you again mumford said id be delighted to talk to this young lady andrew shall we go out for a drink the three of us she wants to talk to mam dad wont get no sense out of her reg said i can tell you that much merrily still standing by the door glanced at andy mumford watched his lips retract a sign of extreme frustration they were getting nowhere here nigel saltash had suggested lunch in one of the splendid new restaurants which he said now made visits to ludlow such an unexpected pleasure at least shed got out of that saying that she had a sermon to write and then mumford telling saltash he had to pick his wife up in dilwyn not far from ledwardine so he could give the vicar a lift back she came over from the door and knelt on the rug in front of mrs mumfords chair mrs mumford contemplated her for a while and then began to nod light graduating into her eyes as if the action of nodding was powering a small dynamo now then now i know who you are i was a bit confused the way that man kept smiling at me but i know who you are now my dear merrily smiled back somehow she didnt think mrs mumford was going to get this right you were at the funeral werent you erm youre the teacher yes robbies teacher you was his favourite youre mrs mumford started to prise herself up youre his history teacher well i course you are reg mumford was leaning over the chair from behind and pointing a forefinger at his own head making screwing motions and were very glad to see you arent we phyllis he loved history mrs mumford said yes merrily said yes he did much bloody good it did him reg snorted shouldve been out playing football if hed played football like a normal boy hed still be alive ive always said that dad for christ andrew we gotter face facts were all terrible sorry bout what happened but it ent no use blamin ourselves for ever and a day is it boy was a bloody dreamer head in the clouds no gettin round it all right dad mumford said desperate well go to the pub you and me eh half an hour mrs watkins will that be all right merrily nodded grateful now i know i had something to show you mrs mumford said where did i put it merrily had made tea for them both the kitchen wasnt as clean as it might have been shed wondered if there was a home help mrs mumford didnt seem to be disabled but she was very overweight look in that top drawer would you she seemed to be accepting merrily now they were on their own but not as a priest she wouldnt be ready for that no no not that one the long one thats it this merrily opened the drawer and found a hardbacked sketch pad inside there it is will you bring it over phyllis whys this picture turned to the wall eh the picture merrily touched it no you leave that alone ok she drew back took the sketch pad to mrs mumford who put it flat on her knees merrily pulled up a dining chair an envelope fell out of the sketch pad and she caught it and put it on the chair arm dont know what that is mrs mumford said now look at these he spent hours on these youve got to be careful not to touch them or itll all come off he had a spray he did but it still comes off they were charcoal sketches the first one was clearly of st laurences church but its size was exaggerated so that the townhouses seemed like dog kennels the second had been drawn from directly below so that the tower resembled a rocket about to blast off the perspective looked to merrily to be spot on there was light and shade and hed smudged the charcoal to produce mist effects he was very talented phyllis sit there for hours he would drawing pictures of the church and the black and white houses the others we never sees them they never comes to see their ole gran only robbie he loved being here with you didnt he whats this one is that what they call the buttercross with the little clock tower on top town council meets there that ones the feathers hotel mrs mumford was much calmer now leafing through the drawings some identified underneath castle lodge the readers house the old college did he sit outside with his sketch pad too shy he went out see and he looked at the old houses for a long time and hed walk all round them and then hed come back and he you know what do you call it drew them from memory thats it either robbie had had a photographic memory or hed really studied these buildings come to know them intimately whichever it was remarkable merrily said this to phyllis and phyllis began to cry silently the tears just coming her cheeks swollen and shiny like the pouches that fed hospital drips and merrily held her hand and phyllis said hes dead looking up at her as if pleading for a contradiction youll see him again phyllis no phylliss fingers tightening in a spasm flooded eyes gazing past merrily now at the picture turned to the wall the atmosphere in the room seemed brown and felt dense as if the air was flecked with clouds of midges the sketch pad slid to the carpet phyllis will you say a prayer with me the only one of em ever come to see his ole gran phyllis said did she mean still can i say a prayer whens the bishop coming ill make sure he comes merrily whispered ill bring him i promise cant see the bishop like this phyllis pulled her hand away state of me youre upset and youve got every reason to be going to the bathroom ok merrily helped her up phyllis had a bandage on one leg rumpled and it wasnt clean will you be all right does that dressing need im all right that woman will come my gail is it andys wife shes a nurse her daughterinlaw of thirty years was it merrily held open the door that led to the hall have you got a downstairs im all right girl merrily left the door open went to pick up the sketch pad it had fallen open at a drawing of what looked like a high stone wall with a jagged white hole in it the shape of a figure like when a cartoon character crashed through brickwork she picked up the pad took it back to the open drawer listening for mrs mumfords movements down the hall problems here and nobody would challenge saltashs assessment when she was putting the pad away light from the front window showed how shed misinterpreted the drawing it wasnt a hole in the wall it was a white figure in the foreground a vaguely female figure with the charcoal smudged around it to suggest a glow a halo it was twodimensional without contours featureless it seemed to be the only figure in any of robbies drawings merrily closed the sketch pad put it away in the drawer went back to plump up the cushions on mrs mumfords chair and spotted the white envelope that had fallen from the sketch pad it seemed legitimate to open it inside the envelope was a picture postcard an atmospheric filter photo of ludlow castle in a pink and frosty dawn light the message written in black fibretip across the full width of the card dear marion i am in ludlow again as i told you and its brilliant here even on my own altho when i am walking through the castle i feel you are there with me and then i feel really happy sometimes i pretend you are walking next to me and we are holding hands and its brilliant everything is all right again and i never want to leave cos this is our place i was so miserable i didnt think i could stand it till the end of term its worse than ever there i hate them they are stupid and ignorant and they are trying to wreck my whole life the nearer it gets to the end of the holidays the sadder i feel and dont want to go back there and i wish i could stay here with you for ever please come like you promised you would please please please come ill be waiting on the way back in mumfords car coming down from leominster towards the ledwardine turning merrily said i did a brief house blessing no fuss a prayer for robbie to be at rest and the lords prayer she even realize what you were doing shes not that far gone andy although i dont think she quite got the point that i was a priest hard to say erm look im going to talk to the bishop ok i mean she asked for him right all that was mumford looked embarrassed they both knew him quite well the bishop mr dunmore back when they had the paper shop hardly ever went to church mind certainly not the ole man but it didnt seem to bother him but hell hes bishop of hereford now we cant just get the bishop of hereford to an old woman who what like if it was the dowager lady mumford it wouldnt be a problem of course we can get him you got me i mean you were concerned enough to think it might be something we could help with wish id never bothered the ole man he dont give a toss hes not making her feel any better is he do you think he even notices mrs watkins the fact is hes been treating her like shes daft for half a century a stray spatter of rain landed on the windscreen merrily took a breath well im not sure she is whats that mean he almost turned at the wheel but the old mumford set in and he kept on looking at the road its a feeling based on this and that whos marion who did robbie have a girlfriend too shy thats what your mother said but there was an unfinished message on a postcard in an envelope in robbies sketch pad begging someone called marion to meet him at the castle he said it was their special place he said he was imagining them holding hands written by robbie he hadnt signed it yet but the handwriting matched the titles hed put on some of the drawings also was he having a bad time at home not according to his mother but that dont mean a thing if i had a home like his idve been having a bad time perhaps you should read the card merrily said i put it back in the sketch pad next to a rather strange drawing strange how difficult to explain cole hill came up in the windscreen and the church steeple and rain came on for real two oclock in the afternoon and it felt like dusk marion mumford said dont mean a thing you ask the ole girl i didnt mention it she was already upset so i just did the prayers she seemed calmer final point merrily said the mirror turned to the wall couldnt fail to notice that could you i thought it was a picture so i had a quick look while she was in the loo thinking maybe it was a picture of the castle or something mirror mumford sighed dad wouldnt let her take it down nothing to straighten his tie in im not happy with this andy no mumford said sermons every week another one hanging around your neck like a penance supporting the traditional assumption from the days when the priest was the only person in the village who could read that you could stand up there in the pulpit having universal truths channelled through you when all you really had were questions an hour after merrily got back to the vicarage the computer in the scullery was still switched off ethel the cat curled up in the tray next to it on the sermon pad shed scrawled a number of questions including old people why have we stopped listening to them maybe one day something unexpectedly profound would get pushed between the lines a surprise parcel in the spiritual letter box one day the phone rang merrily this is siân just a very quick call nigel and i had lunch apparently you were late with your sermon well i always like to leave it till the last minute keeps it fresh like like a salad god why does this woman always make me talk bollocks anyway nigel was impressed with your handling of a rather difficult situation huh inevitably when people weve known for years like exsergeant mumford are involved we feel we have to go through the motions dont we but i do think this case underlines the usefulness of having someone like nigel who can confirm our own suspicions with some authority suspicions he tells me hes already given exsergeant mumford his own initial assessment along with suggestions on how it should be followed up with his mothers gp as early as possible next week hes also going to write up a short report for sophie to keep on our database and i think that concludes our involvement thats what you think is it except of course as a discussion point amongst ourselves ive given this a lot of thought and i have to say theres a danger that by our very existence we may ahm sometimes be actively encouraging people to inflate their feelings of paranoia or persecution or their reactions to sudden and shocking bereavement into something altogether more fanciful by our very existence youre suggesting we shouldnt exist siân laughed essentially im merely saying that we the deliverance ministry if we are to lose the unsavoury aura of medievalism should not be seen to bolster peoples protective fantasies encouraging them to deny personal responsibility by projecting it into something separate and amorphous over which they have no control ill put this on the agenda for our next meeting shall i erm but thank you all the same for going to ludlow with nigel although i gather he did the driving evidently merrily felt rage clogging her chest siân are we becoming a fu focus group thats becoming a derogatory term i think because focus groups appear to be designed to obliterate the individual intuition by which something as inexact as deliverance often stands or falls one viewpoint certainly siân said we could discuss that issue also afterwards merrily sat watching the wind in the apple trees she folded up the pad and rang the bishop at the palace behind hereford cathedral answering machine she left a message asking what he was doing tonight anticipating his groans but this was important even if she wasnt sure exactly why intuition maybe she rang andy mumford on his mobile hold on one minute mumford said and she heard him apologizing to someone else and then he came back with a different acoustic outside i was in with mr osman the witness feller who saw robbie fall you went back to ludlow ent far oh god what are we doing andy think ive found a woman mumford said mabbe two imbalance hard to credit the bishop said my god how its changed the street had narrowed closing around the crawling volvo merrily couldnt see how the town centre could have changed much at all in about five centuries she had her window wound down the dusk was dropping over ludlow like muslin on antique trinkets the cooling air singed with woodsmoke the medieval timbered buildings on either side seemed to be reaching for each other gables bent towards a creaking kiss under the dusty copper sky not the buildings the bishop said most of this towns in aspic lay a finger on a brick and english heritage will crucify you with antique nails goes without saying no i meant the people even when i was living here on a saturday night youd have the pub trade and not much else now look at them listen to their accents tv actors live here now you know and newsreaders politicians and what are they all doing where are they all going theyre going to dinner now call me a puritan inappropriate you havent got the waistline for it youre very frivolous tonight merrily actually im nervous she said and im not sure why the plan had changed andy mumford wanted them to meet up at the spot where the man had seen robbie walsh fall there were some things that mumford thought merrily should know before she took the bishop to see his mother the volvo was stuck in an unexpected queue of vehicles on the bottleneck corner near the buttercross she tapped the accelerator as the engine began to falter recalling reading somewhere that ludlow now had more michelin stars than any other town its size in the country what exactly started this invasion of restaurants bernie i think they had a food festival which was a huge success perhaps someone realized there was something irresistible about expensive meals served in crooked oakframed rooms with sloping floors i dont really know why it took off all i know is that its virtually destroyed my chances of ever moving back one day nowadays if youre going to even look in an estate agents window in ludlow its advisable to swallow a valium first bernie dunmore was probably the first suffragan bishop of ludlow ever to be given hereford safe pair of podgy hands after a difficult period all the same he was often heard to say he wished theyd left him alone seemed to have personal history invested here which is how we arrive at a possibly dangerous imbalance he said its always been a friendly town but therell be resentment inevitably from people who were born here and have been thoroughly priced out even the likes of me i wasnt born here but theres nowhere quite like it once youve been here you never want to leave you do the lottery bernie is that a sin do you think in my position only if you pray for a result the traffic broke and they emerged into the market square turned sandy by the last of the sunset there were shops either side of the square and a wider street sloped down to the left warped and tangled medieval timbers giving way to graceful georgian terraces with their soft lights and the wooded hills behind serene timeless secure in itself all of that the bishop shaded his eyes against a sudden sunset flare before they drove back into shadows straight on merrily and then just as you think you cant go any further follow the wall to the left the wall directly ahead across the square flat as a filmset in the muddy dusk was the reason maybe this town had survived to become so cool and comfortable in the twentyfirst century by day as merrily remembered the castle was more obviously ruined sunny sandstone like a big play area now in fading light it was seizing power again dragging its history around it like a heavy military cloak it was a royal history didnt catherine of aragon live here for a while with the shortlived prince arthur bernie said and then she married his brother who became henry viii and the rest is oh and the two illfated sons of edward iv they were here the princes in the tower here in happier times presumably people tend to be happier here she headed left where hed told her along the walls ludlow castle lost and won besieged and battered but still hugging this craggy site as if to stop the town crumbling into the river below i suppose hundreds of people must have died here its just that most of us thought the deaths were over the bishop said steeply down through dinham another ancient piece of town with a small medieval chapel dedicated to the martyred st thomas of canterbury and across the bridge over the river teme with the castle behind them from this side as much of a fortress as it had ever been she supposed that the highest tower was the keep from which robbie walsh had fallen i suppose i ought to have come to the funeral the bishop said but it was davids show and with the tv cameras and everything i knew thered be scores of people there anyway i didnt think the mumfords would remember me i just bought my papers there he sighed suppose thats why i felt obliged to come with you tonight even though im not entirely sure what this is about or why shed want to talk to me especially she liked you because you didnt have much to say about god bernie grunted limited opportunity to bring the almighty into a transaction involving a packet of polos and the shropshire star she smiled guessing hed used the mumfords shop as an information bureau picking up on local gossip he could look jovial and vague but bernie didnt miss much when hed asked her how she was getting on with the deliverance panel shed been glad it had been too dark for him to see her eyes while she was murmuring that this was something they perhaps ought to discuss when there was more time like several hours phyllis and reg must have been well into their seventies when i knew them the bishop said i remember when they sold the shop we sent them a goodluck card you ever see the boy ive been trying to remember i dont think so but he didnt live here all his life did he only the best bits apparently across the river the land gave in to ranks of dark conifers and the lane took them uphill cottages and a hotel had been flung into the hillside lights coming on in them now the road kept on climbing and they did almost a uturn and emerged unexpectedly onto a natural parapet merrily slowed gosh never been to whitcliffe before merrily its incredible she stopped the car at the side of the lane it was like arriving in the circle at a theatre and the whole of ludlow was the set the best most focused most enclosed view of a whole town shed ever seen this fairyland of castle and ancient streets like a richly painted wheel around the spindle of the church tower haloed by the molten glow of evening another car was parked a few yards away two men getting out of it one of them mumford the other man was taller and wore a big hat merrily eased the volvo up behind them this chap happy to talk to us merrily i think andy kind of used you to square it with him if the bishops involved it must be kosher as it were merrily zipped up her fleece over the dog collar it was cold now for the end of april cold enough for frost mumford and the bighat guy came over mumford wore a dark heavy jacket mrs watkins bishop this is mr osman gerald the guy shook the bishops hand and then merrilys he was wearing a barbour and his widebrimmed hat was waxed too an incomer then pinched face prominent teeth mr osmans a writer mumford said well illustrator mainly and book designer i produce local watercolours with accompanying verse a new career in retirement and a chance to immerse oneself in the place and calendars i also produce calendars gerald osman i think someone sent us one at christmas actually the bishop said watercolours yes keep it in my office do you really you must come up to the house for a glass of wine afterwards were at the bottom of the hill this side of the river my wife used to think it was so lovely having a house with such a wonderful view of the castle but not so sure any more rather wishes it would all go away yes mumford said perhaps you could show us sir where you were when you saw the my nephew fall well as i told you its just just here actually quite a remarkable view of the castle as you see and it was earlier in the evening therefore so much clearer the sky was darkening fast now a sharp shaft of burnt orange over the keep getting duller like a spearhead cooling after the forge ive painted it many times at different times of day and night mr osman said often from this actual spot so i do know this angle pretty well as you see it can look rather sinister in the last of the light and in the rain it often has a faintly dolorous air but in the early evening on a fine day its mellow like the crust of a mature cheddar everything very clear every ridge every fissure if thered been two people up there do you think youd have known mumford said well its rather further away than it looks from here so human figures are very small and i didnt manage to focus my binoculars until i saw him fall couldnt believe it obviously terrible shock but youve spent a lot of time in the castle mumford said youve been up that tower of course ive been everywhere making sketches which is why i recognized your nephew i mean from the photographs on the tv not when he was falling the moment the face came up on the screen i said to my wife good lord ive seen that boy several times ive even talked to him in the castle when it was quiet id sit in the castle grounds make some watercolour sketches im sure they come out just as well when i do them at home from photographs but i always felt i was honouring a tradition all the distinguished artists who painted ludlow castle turner for heavens sake not one of his best i grant you and the boy would come and watch me from a distance at first normally im quite wary of children especially teenagers with some of the malevolent little tykes around nowadays but this boy was genuinely interested eventually telling me he did some drawings himself and his extensive knowledge of the castle was apparent from the start knew the names of all the towers their history the various stages of development i was impressed knew his way around merrily said absolutely rather a pleasant boy shy at first i find shyness something of a virtue these days and the woman mumford said heavily you were telling me about the woman ah yes mrs pepper lives in that rather splendid old farmhouse down from the bottom of the linney mr osman pointed somewhere to the left of the castle ruins well its a bit of a fraud actually was built up from very little by some professional restorer who incidentally cut down a wonderful old oak tree allegedly by mistake and the woman herself she bought the place earlier this year shes supposed to have been quite well known at one time afraid i dont know very much about that kind of music myself shes like a number of people living here now i suppose somewhat eccentric and you saw robbie with her mumford said oh yes how many times well twice certainly shes quite distinctive with the varying colours of her hair and the way she dresses dresses how oh like out of a victorian melodrama long coats swirly cloaks i see you ever talk to the boy when he was with her never some people one instinctively mr osman cleared his throat but the boy would follow her around and theyd be pointing things out to one another if i hadnt known she lived here i would probably have thought they were tourists a mother and son he looked at bernie i gather youre a friend of the family my lord just ah bishop please bernie had dressed down tonight golfing jacket corduroy trousers yes were all trying to help them come to terms with what happened dreadful thing i did telephone the police station the next day to tell the sergeant i now realized this was a boy id seen in the castle and about the woman he didnt seem to think that was very important oh mumfords tone didnt alter what did he say exactly he just said something to the effect that robson walsh was a familiar figure to a great number of people boy was clearly obsessively interested in the history of ludlow and would talk to anybody who seemed to know something about it though why that particular woman would be considered a fount of local knowledge im sorry merrily said did you say she was a musician some sort of singer i gather at one time mrs pepper hasnt lived here two minutes well say six months admittedly weve only lived here permanently for about three years ourselves but it was our holiday home for seventeen years before that so i think were permitted to feel a touch proprietorial and you said she was eccentric i try not to listen to gossip you dont happen to know her first name do you merrily said i dont think i do no couldnt be marion doesnt ring any bells well not in that context mr osman turned to mumford you asked me that didnt you do you know anyone called marion who frequents the castle merrily asked well not he laughed as i told mr mumford here not someone ive ever seen im sorry mr osman didnt reply over the town the sky was turning a luminous acid green with early moonlight ah the bishop said i think i understand you mean marion de la bruyère but that wasnt the keep was it mr osman it was the hanging tower bishop i wrote some verse about her for my calendar the year before last marion whose endless death is poised upon a midnight breath not not awfully good really im sorry merrily said three of you seem to know what this is about but one of us doesnt who are we talking about here what does she do she haunts bernie dunmore said allegedly the bishops tale the bishop said he was confused too much too fast why did you want to know if osman had seen anyone else on the tower i mean surely you dont imagine that someone actually killed the boy the ornate lamps in the square were white like magnesium flares we have merrily slotted the volvo into a corner down by a darkened delicatessen and well away from the castle a kind of reason to try and eliminate the possibility god she was thinking do we she had her window halfdown collecting music and laughter draining from a pub in a nearby street no wider than an alley the sounds disconnected somehow as though on the tapeloop of a separate but parallel timeframe eras overlapping a disconcerting town all shed told him earlier was about the supposed bereavement visions that phyllis mumford had been in a distressed and confused state that he was the only priest she seemed likely to open up to there hadnt seemed much point at that stage in going into what phyllis had said about a woman but it was unavoidable now i see the bishop breathed in slowly thats rather a difficult one isnt it only for a deliverance consultant merrily said the rest of you are free to roll your eyes if i could just say andy mumford was a bulky shadow on the back seat the fact that osman didnt see another person dont mean there wasnt someone up there with the boy just they didnt hang around afterwards the bishop shuffled you do know what youre saying here andrew after many years as a detective bishop i think i got a basic idea yes but what are you actually suggesting kids fooling about and one falls off the tower or what i was ready to believe mumford said that it was an accident at first mabbe its what we all wanted at the time no stigma with an accident but now he leaned forward between the front seats now its like somethings telling me real strongly that something ent what it seems you understand story of my life merrily said the night robbie was found after my sister idd the body i go back to my mothers house theres a woman outside long cape just standing there looking across at the house when i tried to talk to her she walked off what what i could see of her face shed been weeping andy you never even mentioned this before didnt think too much of it afterwards spooked me a bit at the time ok but i was tired lot of neighbours been in and out the house lot of people dress funny in ludlow these days people going out to dinner so the chances are your mother knows this woman she was carrying a lantern with a candle in it well theres a few shops in town now selling tat like that you think some crank dont you well certainly ask phyllis about her the bishop said perhaps clear it up meanwhile merrily said can we she squirmed a little can we talk about marion now the dear marion postcard she talked about that when we go over there ill ask mrs mumford if i can show it to you needs to be photocopied i think merrily the bishop said good idea then andrew has to decide if the police should see it meanwhile let me let me get this right this is a postcard with a photograph of the castle on the front written by robbie walsh to someone he actually addresses as as marion someone he imagines hes walking with in the castle grounds holding hands and theres a drawing of what appears to be a spectral female figure pleading with her to come to him ill be waiting he says i see bernie dunmore was silent for a moment he seemed agitated what are your conclusions about that the psychological one first please shy solitary kid fascinated by medieval history besotted with ludlow youre thinking fantasygirlfriend the bishop said i dont know is she fantasygirlfriend material he sighed all right look i do as it happens know something about this story goes back to the twelfth century or in my case about thirtyfive years to when i was a young curate here as it happens i didnt know you were a curate in ludlow not something ive ever emphasized on my cv a bishop is expected to have been around unfortunately once id lived here i didnt want to end up anywhere else moved on drifted quietly back ive been ah fortunate you jammy sod bernie yes thats another way of putting it so i happened to be a young curate at st laurences when a chap called peter underwood doyen of british ghosthunters though i didnt know it at the time was researching a book called if i remember rightly a gazetteer of british ghosts it has quite an extensive entry on ludlow most of which as it happens is taken up by the story of marion de la bruyère marion of the heath she was usually described as a lady of the castle bernie said which could have meant anything possibly she was a ladyinwaiting if there were such creatures in the reigns of king stephen and his successor henry ii turbulent times less than a century after the norman conquest and the ownership of the new and highly strategic ludlow castle was in dispute stephen had put the fortress in the charge of a breton knight joce de dinan arguably the source of the name dinham for the community under the castles perimeter wall to the southwest but the powerful baronial de lacy family thought it should be theirs and it was the conflict between joce and the de lacys that led to a young knight called arnold de lisle a de lacy man being taken prisoner while not exactly established history its certainly welldocumented in a medieval epic known as the romance of fulk fitzwarrin bernie said seems that marion de la bruyère described by one source as a guileless damsel had fallen in love with the prisoner arnold and helped him escape from the castle either down a rope or knotted sheets and then her fatal mistake marion had arranged to let arnold back into the castle on a later occasion by means of a rope ladder while the two of them are otherwise engaged in marions bedchamber a large number of armed men from the de lacy camp come swarming up the ladder to capture the castle now we know that happened de lacy did get the castle appears to have slaughtered a lot of people and set fire to property in the streets of ludlow that night to make it clear that he was now running the show in fact some of the killing and the burning would have happened exactly where were parked now thanks for that bernie anyway when she finds out whats happening marion full of remorse and fury at his betrayal snatches arnolds sword and kills him with it and then not seeing presumably much of a future for herself she throws herself from a high window in the hanging tower merrily said but that no its not where robbie fell its a tower at the rear of the castle facing the river and the present hanging tower doesnt seem to have been built until two centuries after these alleged events took place but marion yes marion theres certainly quite an extensive section in underwoods book relating to her activities postmortem it ah it was said that people could hear her final screams for many years but the more recent stories relate to a sort of heavy breathing supposedly as she psyched herself up either to dispatch arnold or herself underwood told me hed talked to a local man whod heard it several times and researched it pretty thoroughly disproving to his own satisfaction the theory that the noise was caused by a nest of young owls not possible in january apparently nothing seen merrily said ah there was talk of a a white lady nothing on record but it seems likely that robbie walsh would have heard the stories bestknown ghost story in ludlow merrily and theres no shortage of competition in this town theres a chap now who conducts ghostwalks at least twice a week in the season marion id guess would be his star attraction from what little i know about medieval history merrily said an unattached female in those days wouldnt be far into her teens bernie coughed if at all robbie would have known that he wandered the town alone he might well have fantasized a relationship maybe at that age no more than a rather romantic friendship with a girl from the past rather than a supernatural entity the guileless damsel the kind you rarely encounter today merrily thought about jane who wouldnt have fitted the description guileless since turning eight and written to her bernie said gives a kind of substance to the fantasy makes her seem more real to him pleading with her to meet him saying hell be waiting merrily shrugged if thats your psychological explanation the bishop said im not sure i want to hear the other one i havent fully worked out the other one yet they were silent for a few moments a bunch of kids were whooping and kicking a lager can in the square merrily wound her window up andy isnt it likely given what bernie says that your mother would have heard the story of marion mumford grunted i hadnt but then i ent from yere could she be subconsciously associating it with robbies death is what im wondering shes seen his drawing shes probably read the letter even if shes forgotten about it and in her confused state of mind out on the square one of the boys whod been kicking the can shouted out for no obvious reason fuckin shiiiiiite merrily thought of the cries somewhere on the tapeloop of slaughtered citizens hacked to death by de lacys men while the broken body of marion de la bruyère still lay at the foot of the tower and also andy given that the card suggests a depth of unhappiness at home doesnt this open up another possibility youre saying suicide in which case merrily looked over her shoulder at the shadowy mumford would you really want to take it any further wrong tower mumford said stubbornly you heard what osman said boy knew that castle like the back of his hand he wants to kill himself the way this girl did why would he jump off the wrong tower i dont know tell you what mumford said if you wanner stick with this ghost stuff mabbe ill check out the real woman the living woman the one he was seen with mother and son mrs pepper if her name turns out to be marion what we gonner be looking at then look its getting late the bishop said perhaps we should go and do what we came for see how we can comfort your mother perhaps hear what phyllis has to say and then little prayercircle do you think merrily proper blessing of the house hows your father andrew hes all right probably showing less than hes feeling if hes the reg i remember but ill persuade him to join us all right andrew how about you drive down and prepare the ground merrily and i should perhaps discuss tactics thank you mumford said aye ill go and talk to them thanks he had to put his shoulder to the rear offside door which jammed most times when hed gone the bishop turned to merrily his arms folded his legs stretched out into the well so whats all this really about he said mildly she asked if she could have a cigarette so they got out and walked down towards the centre of the town there was a greenish sheen on roofs and a glare in windowglass as a nearfull moon came up like stage lighting sharpening the medieval gables and creaming the appropriately buttery stonework of the buttercross with its neoclassical portico and its clock tower eras overlapping like double exposures on a film dont say i didnt warn you bernie dunmore said i warned you last summer before that trouble at the hop kiln nearly backfired on you i said that when dealing with matters that can never be verified you needed to cover your back had to get some support around you it just wasnt as easy as you thought the people i was hoping to get are not joiners yes well unfortunately in the church of england the joiners are usually the ones trying to further a political agenda i dont know siân callaghanclarke very well and im sure the hint of dominatrix i sometimes see in her eyes is pure illusion bernie i never wanted a cosy life whereas saltash is someone i have had dealings with over the years and the man has an ego the size of a hereford bulls balls to put it bluntly and incredibly for a psychiatrist he doesnt appear to listen so you have my sympathy there merrily however this was difficult if merrily wasnt careful the bishop was going to think shed generated this whole situation to bend his ear on the subject of controlfreak deliverance advisers brought him out here to get him on her side bernie if youre thinking he lifted a hand we do share a secretary sophie gets emails from callaghanclarke endlessly it seems questioning this questioning that usually about the way we conduct deliverance she hasnt complained to me hasnt complained to me either sophie doesnt complain just hasnt concealed the computer traffic i mean obviously as soon as interest in using saltash was expressed from the deans office of all places i suspected wed have problems if only because i knew hed rather like to repossess your office for general cathedral admin i didnt know that you knew he was hardly a deliverance ah groupie merrily she followed him across the narrow medieval street into the wide street that glided gracefully down to the georgian era and the river how close is the dean to saltash not sure merrily but i have the feeling he was once chaplain at a mental hospital somewhere oh theyre going to try and tie your hands between them thats not in doubt as to siân whether its personal ambition on her part or shes firing someone elses bullets i wouldnt know but remember whatever they try to make you do youre still the only officially trained deliverance minister in this diocese shes certainly doing her best to discredit the man who trained me oh dont worry about old huw been there before loves it and you dont have to do what youre told in fact resisting the rationalists is probably an important part of your role tightrope obviously im not denying that but then the whole jobs a tightrope he pushed his hands into the pockets of his golfing jacket watching his plodding feet in the moonlight of course youll never prove saltash wrong because to do that youd virtually have to prove the existence of ghosts wouldnt you hadnt thought of it quite like that she lied i he stopped under the awning outside the ancient and cavernous de greys restaurant theres something i didnt tell you merrily oh when the underwood ghost book was published i all right i was a curate but i was still a young chap played rugby had some mates and we used to go drinking on a friday night not to excess in my case obviously but we enjoyed ourselves and i happened to have a copy of the book and we i mean you know what young chaps are like do i were in the pub one night half a dozen of us discussing this business of the heavy breathing in the tower giving it somewhat salacious overtones im afraid i said it was all a load of rubbish probably dreamed up to attract more visitors to the castle someone said how can you say that all the nonsense youve got to swallow and regurgitate every sunday anyway the upshot there was a bet ten quid lot of money back then id guess curates were paid even worse in those days and i was engaged at the time so yes ten pounds well worth having there were five of them and they threw in a couple of quid each one of them you see knew a way into the castle at night over one of the walls dinham end and then anyway you didnt if it had been for a whole night i definitely wouldnt have but it was quite a warm evening warmer than tonight and we agreed on two hours i had to swear on the bible that i wouldnt sneak out the deal was two hours absolutely on my own in the hanging tower and if i was still there when they came to get me around half past midnight the money was all mine you astound me bernard wasnt going to tell you in front of mumford thats for sure anyway we all went in together first id never been in the hanging tower before you have to go across the inner bailey theres a wonderful norman chapel in the middle dedicated to st mary magdalene and then into a sort of great hall which is rather eerie because it has these sculpted stone faces on the walls one of my friends had a torch and he kept lighting up the faces making woowoo sort of noises all pretty juvenile they were walking downhill now towards the old town gate where the roadway still passed under an arch with lighted rooms over it the socalled hanging tower protrudes from the rear of the castle must have been two or three storeys high originally but theres no roof now so you can just see the windows in recesses one above the other and then the sky small rooms now six of us filled the space but when the others had gone most unpleasant well i wouldnt have done it it was a boy thing as they say castles a very different place at night hadnt realized that all that nice mellow honey stone but when youre absolutely on your own inside an enormous walled ruin its black smells the thought of rats and cold as hell in there a clammy damp in the air i spent the first hour at the window least i thought it was an hour probably ten minutes looking out at the few visible lights night mist coming off the river and i couldnt see the ground or the sky and it felt i gather its commonplace if youre on a high building and suffering from vertigo to want to you know you wanted to jump they were alone on the street no cars for a few moments and bernies voice was resonating as though in a small church as they passed under the short tunnel which had once been broad gate probably couldnt squeeze through now but i could have then didnt like it anyway so i had to move back into the dark in the end i found myself hunched up in a corner in neartotal darkness which was like being entombed and i at some point i became aware of an unhappiness almost a physical thing rather like when you feel the beginnings of a sore throat and its no more than an unpleasant taste have you ever tried to pray and you couldnt not sure merrily lit another cigarette been times im ashamed of when i just couldnt do it because it seemed worthless useless slippage of faith no weve all been there this was an actual physical inability to pray when i very much wanted to the way an asthmatic cant find breath here i was a fairly recently ordained minister of the church and i could not pray that would be scary panic the unthinkable the feeling that it just didnt work here that god had been excluded from this place i remember it seems laughable now no actually none of that night seems remotely laughable i remember thinking of the ten quid at stake and how despicable that had been how what was happening to me was a direct result of that that what id done taking that bet had been almost evil i when you asked me earlier tonight if i did the national lottery no i dont ive avoided anything approximating to a bet ever since merrily stopped on the wide pavement under the first street lamp beyond what had been the town boundary the road sloping to the river teme at ludford bridge what happened i ran away of course or stumbled away would be more accurate when i realized i was actually cringing into the stones like a cornered animal i threw out a prayer like a sort of yelp just god help me just praying that i could move and i did move like the clappers and youre probably smiling im not honest boss ill cut it short there are two ways out of that tower and i took the wrong one at first and came up against some steps that led nowhere any more a blank wall and that was horrifying as if whichever way i went id come up against a wall that hadnt been there when i went in imagination in these situations becomes so unbelievably powerful so i scrambled back down and back into the chamber and well thats when i saw her i bloody saw her what she was look at me the bishop held his hands out under a street light after all these years still shaking you saw marion oh for heavens sake i dont know who or what it was but i remember i did know with a quite awful certainty that something was going to happen as soon as i reentered the chamber partly because of the cold yes i do know thats a cliché but it wasnt a normal cold not a healthy cold not like rushing wind or crackling frost it was a negativity an absence a hollowness an area in which warmth couldnt exist any more than normal prayer bernie held the lamppost like a drunk merrily feeling chilled now one of those attic moments when you opened an old chest to expose ancient rotting fabric the bishops tale she wondered when hed last told it to anyone and she wondered why in all the discussions theyd had about the nature of deliverance hed never even hinted at a personal experience she it was as i reentered the chamber there was a paleness i can see it now but i still cant properly describe it only my own reactions to something that seemed to be made of nothing more than the cold air and the damp unfurling from the stone i wasnt aware of a face but i was sensing a horrible smile that was more like an absence of smile a smile so cold so bleak so devoid of hope only this perpetual bitter terminality merrily brought the cigarette to her mouth it had gone out as she fumbled for her lighter the bishop stepped away from the lamppost rubbing the warm blood back into his hands and then as merrilys lighter flared so did bigger lights flashing white and orange and wild blue bouncing from pale walls and darkened windows leave god out of it the road had already been closed below ludford bridge which explained the sparseness of traffic on broad street not so sparse though at the bottom of the hill where there had once been mills and the distinctive horseshoe weir sent the river teme rushing over flat rocks a beauty spot on the edge of town now a garish confluence of hysterical light an ambulance police cars blue beacons still revolving inviting an audience like bleak neon road accident looks like bernie dunmore said funny we didnt hear it happen better turn back i suppose last thing they need is andy in the fullbeam headlights of a static vehicle merrily could see the stocky figure climbing over the lower wall towards the river down there look by those two policemen were going after mumford close to the shimmering sheet of the river poor chap cant seem to walk away from it can he the bishop said but merrily was already running down the hill the throbbing voice inside her chest keeping time with her pounding feet going no no no no they were bringing him back over the wall one pushing him to the other whod leapt over onto the pavement andy shouting dont you stupid bastards ever listen the cops had an arm each at the side of the road a third shone his torch on them andy andy mumford get them off me its all right boys the third cop said who told you small town steve mumford shaking them off brushing at his arms where theyd gripped him did you see didnt get a chance did i in the torchlight mumfords face was smooth and cold like washed grey stone these cretins he looked up saw merrily mrs watkins andy whats better go and make sure hadnt you the third cop said merrily found herself following mumford over the wall nobody blocking his way now they knew who he was it was a longer drop the other side than shed been expecting and she stumbled mumford catching her arm couple of neighbours waiting for me outside the house with dad one was walking his dog by the river when he seen these boys come out of the pub by the bridge and go wading into the water the policeman called steve came alongside cant believe this andy mumford said nothing they reached another cop and two paramedics in luminous jackets there was a stretcher and two widebeam lamps were sparing them nothing merrily looked once and then turned away fists tightening watching the moonlit river washing under ludford bridge hearing the hard questions the terse replies no mistake andy no mumford moving round the body no other injuries not that we can see the swab of froth on phyllis mumfords mouth had made it look as if shed swallowed soap had made it seem at first like she was still alive blowing bubbles the bandage on her leg had been hanging loose like a pennant mumford grunted hands in his pockets shoulders hunched nothing anybody couldve done steve said didnt go off the bridge then be more damaged wouldnt she andy looks like she got over that wall same way we just came in just started wading out from the bank and then slipped on the rocks anybodyd fall over in a minute in the daytime even no chance at all at night see not at her age no what can any of us say if those boys had got there five minutes earlier im real sorry mate aye merrily turned and mumford was there they walked back slowly towards the wall mumford clearly coping with it the only way he knew how like he hadnt retired and this was someone elses mother someone elses mother someone elses nephew someone elses life cold water he said they always reckon a heart attack gets them first im sure it must she said andy a mercy under the circumstances why why would she come out in the dark on her own you tell me this is just standing there stupidly shaking her head i shouldve didnt know what she shouldve done this was altogether beyond comprehension my fault ennit mumford said shouldve noticed the way she was going shouldve had her assessed couldnt expect the ole feller to see it he ent noticed her for years his arm came back and he smashed his right fist into his left palm christ its not she caught his arm on the rebound its not your fault look mrs watkins i got a long night he turned away long night ahead of me sounding like what he was really talking about was the rest of his life someone helped merrily back over the wall the bishop saw a chap i knew merrily this is beyond all aye mumford said calm again as if that one slam of the fist had been like a pressure valve andrew look wheres your father one of the cars last i seen with zoë policewoman dunno which one it is ill find it ill talk to him only id leave god out of it if i were you bishop mumford said and turned to merrily these accidents will happen wont they ole women shouldnt play by the river at night merrily thought accident as they stepped onto the pavement several people were trailing past and as they faded into the lights she saw that they were wearing oldfashioned evening dress two women in long black frocks and two men in tailcoats and top hats she thought of posh restaurants the new and affluent ludlow phyllis mumford dying alone on the edge of all this need to call the wife mumford had his mobile out pick up the ole feller take him back to our place i could ill see to him you get off home she wanted to scream for gods sake youre not a copper now youre one of us come over to the car andy steve the policeman said we better sit down sort some things out merrily was left alone the party in evening dress had stopped gazing down to where a knot of police and paramedics were concealing the body they were not what shed thought these decadent revellers a ruby glistened like a bubble of blood in the cleft of the chin of one of the women and one of the men in top hats wore eye makeup and his hat had ribbons hanging behind like an oldfashioned undertaker come on a policewoman came over arms spread wide dont hang around please is she dead one of the girls said like she was asking about the time of the last bus you can read about it tomorrow come on i wont be here tomorrow good the policewoman said was it suicide this was an older quieter voice merrily saw that there was a fifth person in the group this woman wrapped in a grey cape so long that it was touching the pavement the policewoman said do you have anything to tell us about this incident madam the woman smiled faintly with a shake of the head as the blue beacon light passed over her face brushing like a strobe effect over an eagle nose and causing a glistening like hoar frost in hair that was like strands of tarnished tinsel and merrily recognized her partly from mumfords description but mainly pale arms outstretched fingers clawed sleeves of a black robe slipping back a copper bangle like a snake merrily froze hands clasped catching a longago devilish reflection of herself in a mirror white lipstick and a black velvet hat and mascara caked on like chocolate heard her own mother appalled youre not walking out of this house looking like that no i thought not the policewoman said so would you mind not blocking the footpath please shes quite distinctive mr osman had said with the varying colours of her hair and the way she dresses and then andy mumford in the car if her name turns out to be marion what we gonner be looking at then from what merrily could remember her name had never been marion she saw mumford getting into the back of a police car with his friend steve heard the church clock strike almost softly ten oclock and all so very far from well she stood in the middle of the road the dog collar under the zippedup fleece tight to her throat like a stiff admonishment furious at herself for failing to foresee something like this and to a lesser extent at saltash whose flip diagnosis had probably been right although it could be no more proven now than the existence of ghosts nightshades merrily didnt feel any better in the morning sunday she awoke with the light and lay watching the red dawn surfing the ceiling where the oak beams were like beach barriers wondering what difference it would make to a suicidal world if she just didnt bother to get up unless anyone specifically asked she hadnt been in ludlow last night and neither had bernie dunmore theyd agreed this as she dropped him around one am at the bishops palace in hereford bernie had told her about his time with reg mumford hed taken reg to the angel in broad street as a damn bishop you get out of it bernie said out of real people youve forgotten the conclusions you once came to about what this jobs about not preaching just pure concentrated listening in the bar he said reg had been remembering his wife as she used to be and a lot of other people bernie didnt know memories dripping into the beer most of them from a long time ago reg hadnt mentioned his wifes death as if that was something he wasnt yet ready to process bernie said as for robbie reg didnt understand how the boy had come to get himself killed didnt see any use dwelling on it kids did daft things and sometimes they ran out of luck and that boy face it he wasnt entirely normal reg never knew how to talk to him never had since he was little phyllis however reg had been trying to lose himself in daytime telly looking up every so often and seeing phyllis gazing into the mirror where shed found a new channel of her own the robbie channel robbie still sitting scrunched up over the table drawing his black and white buildings hands all black with charcoal holding up his hands phyllis said and grinning at her through the mirror phyllis weeping through her mad world which had reflections of robbie everywhere sometimes trailing aimlessly around the shops reg embarrassed striding ahead then looking back and seeing phyllis staring in some window look there he is again do you see him reg buying her bits of things in the shops it was only money but when they got home the packages were never opened would have destroyed reg too if hed given in to it but reg had seen too much death in his time and hed lost all patience with her only so much a man could take it was reg who in a fury had turned the mirror to the wall before the bishop came because he hadnt wanted the bishop to see phyllis going insane only it hadnt been the bishop at all it had been andy and some strangers and reg didnt want to meet any more strangers this bloody smiley feller coming up to him in the street all chatty then asking who his doctor was what right did they have treating you like a kid merrily got out of bed and knelt under the window with its view over the village towards wooded cole hill under a shiny salmon sky and prayed for reg and whatever remained of phyllis and robbie when she stood up her eyes were wet and she found herself thinking irrationally of lol and had this image of herself running down the drive and across the cobbles in her nightdress and banging on the cottage door screaming let me in for all the village to hear at breakfast jane said mum you look like sh i know all right you turn up for communion looking like that theyll all lose their faith oh hell what time is it and what are you doing up so early just curious about why you were out so late on the other hand jane put a pensive forefinger to her chin if you were to turn up at the altar in your dressing gown a soupçon déshabillé it might bring in more blokes and youre not in the mood are you whats happened the elderly lady merrily brought her mug of tea and sat down opposite jane morning sunlight piercing the top window over the sink the woman saltash and i were supposed to be helping she drowned herself last night in the river teme jane blinked mumfords mother must have happened while we were no more than half a mile away talking to a bloke who saw robbie walsh fall her lying in the water us theorizing about some bloody stupid old ghost story and wondering what old ghost not important no more important than me going on to the bishop about saltash and callaghanclarke and feeling sorry for myself oh god mum deliverance the fourth emergency service have to laugh dont you flower im not laughing was she you know confused we always assume that dont we thats what everybody would have assumed last christmas if lol hadnt got to alice meek before the cold did but even if mumfords mum was on the slide there might have been a part of her i could have got through to with perseverance and i didnt really try but you did try you pressured the bishop into going back with you because he was an old mate of the mumfords putting the responsibility on someone else merrilys head felt congested she found a tissue in her dressinggown pocket blew her nose should have tried harder instead of halfthinking yeah saltash could be right this is probably more his show than mine i dont know maybe i just mum dont keep doing this to yourself you did what you thought was best at the time you always do so just like finish your tea have a wash brush your hair get your kit and off to work merrily looked at the kid who was no longer a kid and dug out a smile from somewhere there you go jane said why there could be as many as like four people in that church just gasping for holy communion get down there and give em wine so she got through it no big state of eucharistic grace no allenveloping peace but she got through holy communion and morning worship doing the sermon about listening to old people the real meaning of honouring your father and mother not very convincing really and she was having problems staying focused when she closed her eyes she saw phyllis mumfords drowned face and heard her wispy untethered voice now then i know who you are i know who you are now my dear back in the scullery she rang lol explaining about last night about the two women who had faded into the picture one dead one on the streets of ludlow in a fulllength cape accompanied by younger people in decadent goth costumes the shock of recognition belladonna lol said are you sure just after lunch priests always knew when other priests were most likely to surface on a sunday siân callaghanclarke rang shed heard about phyllis mumford from nigel saltash whod heard it on the radio its terrible but im afraid nigel wasnt entirely surprised theres an area psychiatric support team that ought to have been told about mrs mumford but human resources are terribly stretched these days largely as a result of increasing addiction problems awfully sad though because nigel was going to talk to their gp first thing tomorrow was he but thank heavens merrily thank heavens in a way that you didnt take it any further sorry from a deliverance point of view when you think of the kind of adverse publicity if the media had discovered that youd performed what they would have seen as some sort of exorcistic rite at this poor womans house just hours before she died a homeblessing its not whats been done merrily a few prayers its whos done it youve become fairly widely known now not least to certain sections of the media as an exorcist certain people would put two and two together and make six but suppose that after this exorcistic rite it hadnt happened suppose mrs mumford hadnt wandered into the river was therefore still alive but then she had done it shed returned behind saltashs back and done her rudimentary blessing and mrs mumford had still died we could play the whatif game for the rest of the day merrily siân said but i doubt exorcism has ever been hailed as a cure for senile dementia so do you think its time for me to quit siân before i bring the church into even more disrepute lets not be silly siân said sunday evening the bishop rang something he thought merrily should know old reg mumford phoned me today encouraging really that he was able to do that how is he staying at his sons house but insisting on going home tomorrow he seemed more focused and resigned and in his resignation behind the loss one could almost sense im afraid an exhausted kind of relief said he knew phyllis would never have come to terms with what had happened to robbie however long she lived merrily was taking the call on her mobile alone in the church preparing for the quiet service she lowered herself to the edge of a pew opposite the west window where the evening sun made a ruby in the apple held by eve you mean hed actually thought she might want to die not exactly bernie said she was so convinced the boy was still there in the town that reg said he was halfexpecting to hear shed been knocked down in the traffic after spotting robbie across the road or something and rushing to him his reflection reflections exactly look ah reg said that in happier times he and phyllis often used to walk by the river and one fine evening last week she got him to take her back there oh no merrily closed her eyes and it was early evening and the water was fairly still even so close to the horseshoe weir and she went and stood near the wall looking down and of course robbie looking up at her from the water oh god reg couldnt take it he pulled her away they walked home in silence nothing to say to one another the last thing she said to him last night therefore the last thing she said to him ever was i cant feel him in here any more youve driven him out meaning the mirror turning it to the wall who knows and then she walked out and she was standing at the front of the house and he could hear her talking to one of the neighbours for a while when he looked for her she wasnt there he didnt tell you this last night i think he had to get it clear in his own mind anyway thought i should tell you thats all so that we can draw a line under it as it were merrily heard soft footsteps opened her eyes to the sight of lol padding into the aisle sometimes hed come to the quiet service though never any of the others he was wearing his old roswellalien sweatshirt hed worn this in church before possibly a signal that he wasnt yet fully integrated you really think a line can be drawn bernie i think we have to this marion business thats always going to be a mystery why have you never told me about that before didnt seem relevant and anyway you mean not relevant to like what i do put it this way he said youre the only person ive ever told including the friends who got to keep their ten quid and i trust youll keep it to yourself are you in the church merrily you want me to swear on the bible over the phone sorry yes im just rearranging the furniture lol was pulling movable pews up to the front to set up a rough circle ah the bishop said your meditation service that going all right we just call it the quiet service now yeah going very well since we managed to cool the rumours of miracle healing well do prayers for specific people sometimes but strictly no handson i know my level we get about twenty most weeks including jane occasionally and now even lol merrily beckoned him down the aisle and into the vestry soon to be converted into a gift shop its walls had been freshly painted in yellow and some cheap pine shelving had been fitted a faded victorian sofa now looking for a new home had been pushed against the wall under a window and lol sat on that well this is nice but wouldnt it be some kind of sacrilege i just want to talk you fool merrily shut the door behind them sacrilege could have been exciting lol lifted his hands kidding i know couple of years ago the church organist had openly fantasized about slowly unbuttoning merrilys cassock lol however after the experience with his parents was still wary of the church and its trappings another reason he preferred the quiet service when merrily wore only her pectoral cross over a dark sweater and jeans so she said belladonna you could be right lol sat forward hands on his knees i rang prof he said hed been warned a few months ago that she was living in the area and possibly working on a new album consequently he was putting it around that the studio was booked up for the foreseeable shes not changed then dont go there lol said hey ive been there when i was janes age it would have been it was at a wrestling stadium she wasnt very famous then but she had a cult following we all wore black tights for the gig and i had this kind of funeral coat id bought for a couple of quid from oxfam and a black velvet hat and a lot of cheap stage makeup thank god all the pictures have disappeared you really were a goth a phase we all linked arms under the stage and stood very still like mourners around a catafalque i didnt like the music that much to be honest too slow a bit dismal occasional bursts of hysterical screaming no tunes to speak of what does she look like these days hardly any different this long grey victorian kind of cape that trailed in the mud same slightly beaky nose same slightly crooked teeth but in an attractive way that strange kind of uneven beauty lol said mmm she tossed him a suspicious look so how close did you get all those years ago he smiled nice of you to imply i might have been brave enough at eighteen no we once played a very badly organized oneday festival in this halfflooded field in oxfordshire we were near the bottom of the bill eleven am and she was in the prime sunset spot we didnt actually stay for her gig but i did hear the discussion she had with the organizers about the level of facilities scary formidable woman hadnt realized she was so posh until then you dont expect it no i never actually met her she lols gaze had turned watchful she came down to the river last night because shed heard thered been a death she asked a policewoman if it was a suicide i thought that was a curious question suggested she knew who it was or maybe i was just thinking that because i realized this was probably the woman seen with robbie walsh she certainly knew where he lived because mumford saw her standing outside the house ironically we were going to ask mrs mumford if she knew this odd woman personally thought that might solve something merrily could hear voices and footsteps from the nave and laughter which was good this gig i went to she said when i was seventeen the band were all dressed as undertakers and they wheeled belladonna on stage in a coffin on a bier remembering the album nightshades fairly sure she didnt have it any more or jane would have found it maybe that was why shed got rid of it on the cover belladonna had been sitting in some kind of dusty chapel cradling a mandolin like a baby a strap of her dress pulled down as if she was about to breastfeed the instrument subtly profane this guy you spoke to lol said he said the womans name was mrs pepper mmm prof told me belladonna was married at one time to her producer saul pepper thats it then ill phone andy mumford when i get home and confirm it whatever her connection was with robbie walsh mumford would find it if you wanner stick with this ghost stuff mabbe ill check out the real woman the living woman his mothers drowning was hardly going to make his inquiries more restrained lol he was leaning back on the victorian sofa exposing the bigeyed alien on his sweatshirt lol the former psychiatric patient dropout psychology student you were an imaginative kid right what makes you think that did you never fall in love with someone who didnt exist seriously with me it was always serious lol stood up even the real ones you turn them into something that doesnt exist you start with a beautiful face and you build around it something that might actually love you she told him about robbie walsh and marion de la bruyère lol said if he saw ludlow as a refuge from something very bad it was the end of the holidays wasnt it when he died virtually maybe he really couldnt bear to go back this time maybe he just wanted to stay with marion suicide mumfords given no indication that his home life was that bad everything can seem very closedin at that age lol said the futures like staring down the wrong end of a telescope you cant envisage anything more than a few months ahead at most and if youre having a very difficult time you dont see a way out ever he killed himself in ludlow dying the way she died because that was the only way he could stay there she looked into lols eyes lol shrugged slipping back into the nave for the quiet service merrily was trying to see this unlikely triangle robbie marion belladonna the kids connection with a s goth rock singer was the hardest to envisage frankly lol whispered in the vestry doorway if it turns out he was suicidal i can think of more suitable people to administer counselling esoteric merrily somehow sensed it and looked up maybe half a second before it was dismissed and sophies face was blank again outside the gatehouse office window muscular clouds were hanging over hereford like a street gang closing in maybe it was the sudden darkening of the room that had caused her to raise her head nothing to do with sophie the only person she knew who could convey disapproval without any change of expression probably went with her breeding whats wrong soph im sorry sophie looked up from her computer she was wearing a dark red woollen suit over a cream silk blouse the bishop of herefords lay secretary over many years and several bishops worth her weight in pearls you scowled merrily said i dont think so merrily there was a muttering of thunder from dinedor hill or somewhere merrily got up from her desk on mondays she usually tried to come in for a couple of hours to review the deliverance schedule although lately there hadnt been much of one she was late today because of the afternoon cremation a difficult funeral people she hadnt known before and so it was all the more important to make it resonate huw wasnt the only deliverance minister to suggest that cursory conveyorbelt funerals were leading to disquiet on both sides of the grave id better put the kettle on before the power goes this isnt ledwardine merrily the power isnt going anywhere its my turn anyway she filled the kettle and plugged it in spooned tea into the pot then swiftly backed up and peered over sophies shoulder at the computer there was an email in the frame sophie re the sample of deliverance files that you mailed me this morning this is not what i meant i feel it is important that the whole team sees all correspondence before it is filed i also think we should be able to access the database at all times of day rather than having to trouble you during office hours please get back to me with your thoughts before close of sophie clicked it away ah merrily said i see sophie gazed into the screensaver photo of swans on the wye impossibly blue i tend to receive instructions most days from canon callaghanclarke outside the window the sky was solid now like a rock formation over broad street and oh dear you didnt do this you didnt treat sophie hill as a servant what you had to learn if you wanted to avoid trouble in the workplace was that sophie served only the cathedral and will you be getting back to her with your er thoughts what do you suggest for instance sophie went back into the emails should i have sent her a copy of this happy beltane ms exorcist yes soon be walpurgis night why dont you come out and let your hair down ha ha ha i lucifer this came through the website yesterday when exactly is beltane april the thirtieth saturday may day eve anyway when all cardcarrying satanists perform their blood sacrifices ah yes probably mailed from an internet café just some kid whos learned how to construct a devil on the keyboard with a website youre bound to get a percentage of this sort of crap unless of course sophie looked up one decides to dispense with the facility scrap the message line she wants to do that the entire website actually sophie said what ive been asked initially to supply a list of all the emails its stimulated in the past year merrily went to the window exchanging hard looks with the sky this time there had to be a mistake the website was about offering straightforward advice to people experiencing problems they thought might be of paranormal origin it included selfhelp procedures and useful prayers it advised them to contact their local clergy if the problems persisted or if they preferred to email phone or write direct to this office she turned back to sophie so how many people did contact us in the past year through the site not a great many perhaps thirty and what percentage would you say were jokes or tryons id say about twenty per cent a few were from children who genuinely thought they had a problem but turned out to have seen too many episodes of buffy the vampire slayer a couple came from womens institutes asking if you could address their meetings we had i think four from people thanking us for the prayers and the advice and saying theyd actually worked and they were now sleeping better that sort of thing and how many requiring followup action seven mainly poltergeistrelated all subsequently dealt with by the local clergy prayer and counselling its a substantial number when you think about it for a largely rural diocese what exactly has siân said she said shed placed the issue of the website on the agenda for the next meeting of the deliverance panel and as i say went on to ask for detailed background information as to the sites usage what do you think her arguments going to be i suspect shes going to dismiss the whole thing as costly and trivial if anyone wants this essentially esoteric service badly enough theyll go to the trouble of finding us of course i may be quite wrong esoteric that was her word unless i misheard so were minority stuff theyre pushing us into a back room and switching the light out or possibly a cupboard sophie said if that website has saved just one faintly timid person from you dont have to convert me merrily no they looked at one another in the dimness of the afternoon the kettle rumbled towards the boil distant lightning glimmered merrily sat down at the desk her back to the window and switched on the lamp sophie what am i going to do about this bloody woman this morning shed phoned huw owen leaving a message on his answering machine hed come back to her just after twelve when she was getting into her black coat for the funeral he hadnt found out very much and none of it was encouraging except that there appeared to be no hidden agenda no worthwhile conspiracy theory no credible faction in or out of canterbury with a mission to destroy deliverance which of course didnt mean it wasnt bubbling under somewhere huw told her what hed learned about siân callaghanclarke fiftyone years old formerly a barrister which would explain her need to work with professionals like saltash the resident expert witness born in winchester to an uppermiddleclass high church landowning family word is huw said that the father was a traditionalist her younger brother would have the career siân was expected to marry well raise kids womens stuff not a good time to impose those values siân had not only not married well she hadnt married at all moving to worcester as a criminal barrister and managing to raise two sons inside a comfortably loose arrangement with her head of chambers he was still around still in worcester and the sons were both at oxford the church well it was in the family huw said uncle became bishop of norwich her brother who she appears to have resented from an early age is now an archdeacon exeter or somewhere siân commendably enough began to help some of the youngsters she was defending and concluded that the church had the facilities to operate a support network for addicts and suchlike and wasnt using them its not that simple as ive just been finding out up in manchester but it was enough to get her involved and that was the time when the battle for women priests was on and her younger brother apparently was strongly anti that would do it merrily said oh aye that were the red rag all right shed get into the church and shed leave the brat behind as a priest huw said siân was exactly what she seemed a modernist and a politician known to be tolerant of islamic fundamentalism while deploring its equivalent in christianity suspicious of evangelism and alpha training considered opposition to gay clerics to be irrational to the point of superstition talking of which aye well there were rumours of her having a bit of a thing in worcester with a bloke i trained with keiran winnard younger than me charismatic in all senses of the word shed certainly be his type striking blonde plenty of style and fancy footwork in debate liked a woman with a bit of intensity keiran as i recall risky though in the church in the same diocese wouldnt be the first pure physical attraction not necessarily a meeting of minds anyway it must have burnt through quickly enough leaving her even less well disposed towards the miracleandwonder lads than before happen that was the reason she got out of worcester or she just thought she could rise faster in hereford smaller pool bit of an outpost either way looks like herefords got her for the foreseeable future and so have you so maybe she sees deliverance as a method of exercising control merrily said to sophie you mean over the wilder elements within the diocese the charismatics the evangelicals if you consider that in certain hands exorcism itself can be very rigid and repressive keeping the lid on the cauldron as someone once said taking a dim view of the charismatic movement armwavers happyclappies speakers in tongues because of what they might be opening themselves up to look at my predecessor he hated all that but from a different perspective surely sophie leaned into the lamplight canon dobbs lived an ascetic life selfdenial fasting long hours of prayer a deeply spiritual man bitterly opposed to women priests as we know and i have no doubts at all where hed have stood on the issue of gay clergy with his back to the altar and a big cross in front youre right it works both ways rationalism can be even more repressive in its way all possession is mental illness all ghosts are psychological projections siân is potentially more restrictive than dobbs then why sophie pinched her chin forefinger projecting pensively along her cheek why would she want martin longbeach on the panel a well a treehugger window dressing huw reckons i mean hes harmless isnt he and gay probably an excellent source of information from the lunatic fringe and doubtless so deeply honoured to be chosen that hes more than happy to pass it on merrily smiled is siân a gay icon do you think or maybe martins being groomed as my successor the phone rang sophie snatched it quickly probably to kill the image of martin longbeach here in this office with his thinkingcandles and his herbal teas gatehouse merrily heard a mans voice on the line pale sheetlightning brought the office up in shades of grey one moment ill see if shes in sophie covered the mouthpiece its formersergeant mumford are you sure shed spoken to him very briefly last night telling him about the woman who had proved to be belladonna it had meant nothing to mumford who said his knowledge of rock music began and ended with the rolling stones sophie passed the phone across the desk andy i was going to ring you tonight how are you got a tv switch it on mumfords voice flecked with storm crackle also loaded with the kind of urgency you didnt expect from him just caught the headline called you at home your daughter said youd be there you got a television in the office well we have looking up at the portable collecting dust on the filing cabinet switch it on central news its on now dont hang around ill call you back thunder trundling like a heavy goods vehicle over the horizon as he hung up part two jemmie people who will accept an apparition because it is a visual experience will tend to reject the conviction of a sense of a presence because the experience is not externalized i am convinced that this sense of a presence is experienced far more often than is reported andrew mackenzie the seen and the unseen and who that lists to walk the towne about shall find therein some rare and pleasant things thomas churchyard on ludlow extreme remains a possibility but yes very unlikely to have been accidental the stonework in jagged closeup was hard against the patchy sky then the picture pulled back and you could see that the shot had been done from the ground this was as near as they could get because the tower was taped off two police protecting the site old videotape from coverage of the robbie walsh tragedy merrily thought they cut back to the policeman whod been talking over the shot she didnt recognize him just about possible to survive that kind of fall but unlikely the policeman said now robbie walshs face came up the school photo robbie with his hair brushed and his tie straight his mouth in an unsure smile his eyes flicked to one side the reporters voice over the picture weeks since the town was shattered by the death of fourteenyearold robbie theyd been too late to catch the link into the story and had also missed the first part of the report it looked like central news was going heavy on the death of mrs mumford rehashing the events preceding it the boys photo had been replaced by another one a poignantly blurred holiday snap of a woman in a sundress leaning bitter irony now against a lifebelt hanging from a sea wall merrily bit her lip and then at the weekend came news of the shocking death of robbies grandmother mrs phyllis mumford whose body was pulled from the river teme flowing just below the castle here eightythreeyearold mrs mumford was said by neighbours today to have been inconsolable after the death of her grandson whod been staying with her and her husband at the time shot of the river a police barrier two sheaves of flowers lying up against it the cellophane flapping the town is in mourning once again but absolutely nothing could have prepared the people of ludlow for what was to happen today huh merrily looked at sophie the phone on sophies desk started to ring sophie opened a drawer and put the phone in and shut the drawer up to the wire merrily moved closer to the tv hard to take in were shocked shattered man in his sixties hair like wire wool and hollow cheeks george lackland ludlow mayor the caption read gather she wasnt local george lackland said we dont know where she came from but the thought that she came here a girl that age specifically to you know to die in this horrible way that really doesnt bear thinking about does it christ merrily said long shot of the tower the reporter saying and thats the terrible question that just about everyone here is asking tonight the camera finding the reporter evidently live picking up off the back of his taped report standing outside the castle on a walkway halfway down the banks above the river his spread arms conveying universal incomprehension did the girl come here to kill herself in a macabre imitation of the death of robbie walsh there was nothing to suggest that robbies death was anything other than an accident but two identical accidents at the same castle as the mayor said the implications of this are to say the least disturbing in the studio the presenter a blonde young enough to be the reporters daughter said paul do we know yet where exactly the girl had come from how far shed travelled tammy my information is that the police do have a name and the parents of a fifteenyearold girl are at this moment being brought to ludlow in the hope of a formal identification but it could be several hours before that name is formally released is there any connection with robbie walsh its a question thats been asked but theres no reason to suppose there was any connection between them at all except of course the circumstances of their deaths and what does that say about robbies death paul well theres no particular suggestion that it throws a different light on robbies death therell always be an element of mystery about that what id guess police and townsfolk are asking is was this girl in some awful way inspired by by the way he died and of course the dramatic location obviously paul this is something nobody could have predicted but how could it possibly have been prevented tammy its an impossible situation this is a major tourist attraction that gets hundreds of visitors every day many drawn in by its dramatic location at the highest point of the town with these high walls these ruined but still very tall towers and this steep drop almost to the river yes of course its dangerous but so are hundreds of beauty spots all over the country and whats being said is well if someones determined to die theres no shortage of places to go but two teenagers both at ludlow castle why here particularly yes thats a question a lot of people are now trying to answer children do have to be accompanied by an adult and with the number of tourists increasing daily as we move towards the main holiday season theres no doubt at all that attendants here are going to be exercising considerable extra vigilance paul thank you tammy said turned back to camera and if the girls name is released well update you on our latenight bulletin merrily switched off the set the phone had stopped ringing and sophie brought it out of the drawer a girl merrily said a fifteenyearold girl whats it mean another one children are impressionable sophie said she used to teach merrily reached for the phone ill ring andy he mustntve known anything about it either until he switched the news on mumfords line was engaged probably ringing the sergeant he knows at ludlow poor guy must feel right out of the loop when something like this happens and he finds out from the news like the rest of us especially when its going to add a lot of fuel to his own suspicions merrily as the reporter said theres no reason to think robbie walshs death was anything other than accidental children have always been impressionable now theyve become horribly extreme they want extreme experiences extreme sports sensations death they see death on tv and its usually rather exciting merrily pulled the silk cut from her bag bloody hell sophie sophie frowned at the cigarettes when i was a child the country had just come through a world war and people were simply grateful to have survived and we children were aware of that today some of them seem to treat life almost like an unwanted present that they might as well take back im sorry merrily if i seem to be losing my christian compassion im sure therell be a thoroughly heartbreaking story behind it the phone rang merrily grabbed it andy ah you are still there the bishop said i suppose youve heard the news from ludlow just caught the last part of the tv piece tragic the bishop said awful wasteful three deaths three and in fact its more than tragic its nightmarish now in ways i we dont know where shes from other side of herefordshire ledbury i think that is george i rang an old friend in ludlow george lackland the mayor you saw him on the tv thing used to be my senior churchwarden george says the police are saying she seems to have hitchhiked across thirtyodd miles forty something like that do they know why will they ever witnesses someone on the bowling green below the linney appears to have seen her fall no one inside the castle was aware of it although it must have happened while the place was open to visitors so easily done you see you cant follow everybody around she apparently paid to go in and just never came out nightmarish was she dead when they found her im not sure george thinks there may have been complications but if she was alive when they found her she didnt survive long outside the rain had started like nails on the window bernie erm should we be involved in any way merrily heard his breath slowly expelled i dont know something did strike me when i saw the tv pictures actually i feel rather foolish and trivial even mentioning it at a time like this but you just know that some people in the town are going to be talking about it this sort of gossip one cant do anything to stop it you ah marion you remember marion i think i can just about remember marion yes and we were all thinking yes but wrong tower the keep as distinct from the hanging tower precisely well you wouldnt know the layout of the castle but i do and there it was on the news sophie and i missed the beginning of the report merrily said cautiously well they didnt make a point of it but they wouldnt know either however the bishop coughed they showed it from the outside unmistakable this time it was the hanging tower black poppies that night lol boiled some water for tea using a primus stove in his kitchen leaving merrily to finish dressing by firelight he had something to tell her but it could wait when he came back into the living room with the tray she was sitting on the end of the sofa small and demure with unless he was deluding himself the same glow on her face that hed once seen by the light of altar candles and her hair tied back with a rubber band but too soon the glow was fading ok ill go up to the bathroom later with a torch and a mirror to check the fine details thats not exactly what i meant lol said as so often it had been a touch furtive curtains surreptitiously drawn cushions from the sofa this time on top of freshly washed paint cloths on the flagstones like teenagers when the parents might come in only the parents were the parish jane kept a straight face merrily said when i said it was my turn to help you with the painting and then she spoiled it by murmuring something i didnt quite catch about brushes and paint pots lol smiled merrily looked around the firelit parlour with its bounding shadows there were always shadows lol thought about lucy devenish whod made him read the poems of thomas traherne the seventeenthcentury herefordshire minister who believed that god wanted you to be happy sitting there listening to your mournful wistful records its spring open your heart to the eternal let the world flow into you lucys last spring as it had turned out suddenly he could almost feel her in the room with them lucy sensing merrilys underlying gloom and frowning and turning now towards him poncho aswirl eyes like the smouldering core of the fire do something lucy commanded lol gazed into the top of the chromium teapot i see three male presences looming over you mystic laurence huh ones a retired detective who hates the way his world is being fragmented ones a bishop for whom retirement is looming and he doesnt want his longedfor haven spoiled and the third is a retired psychiatrist who actually i dont think theres such a thing as a retired psychiatrist they never give up analysing wrongly of course merrily said but the message is retired people are the new delinquents too much time nothing to lose beware of them essentially the teapot is saying this is not your problem easy for the teapot to say merrily went to sit on the hearth last night when he rang me in the church bernie was oh lets draw a line under it tonight hes virtually saying sort this out sort this out for me he does seem to feel a spiritual responsibility for that town because he used to work there and hopes to retire there so maybe nothing spiritual about it at all really lol said not sure about that she took the pot away from him and poured tea for them anyway he thinks this girls death is going to cause a lot of dangerous speculation and hes probably right the legend of marion de la bruyère is very well known in the town and this is her tower the idea that the girl didnt know about that seems remote might have a terrible appeal for a certain kind of teenager in despair sure more so probably than the accidental fall of a fourteenyearold boy from a different tower i just there has to be a connection we cant yet see had the girl been seen in ludlow before were not going to know that until they confirm her identity and issue a picture you keep saying we its not your problem but lol knew already that this was a lost cause i looked up belladonna on the internet merrily sugared the teas just to see what shes doing these days what shes doing in ludlow and didnt find out learned a lot of history for instance the name belladonna isnt actually much of an affectation her name was arabella donnachie so she was always carrying belladonna around with her in the middle of her name wonder if her parents intended that says not on her website says it was fated all that kind of stuff she was born in banbury oxfordshire father a welloff accountant educated at cheltenham ladies college walked out at seventeen to form a band for which she was apparently later considered too weird in what way didnt say i erm tried to call mumford tonight no answer at home mobile off suppose hes gone after her she can take care of herself lol said and merrily looked up he shrugged i had a call from prof relating to well belladonna and you werent going to tell me choosing the moment did i mention that tom storey was at knights frome mixing his album he didnt know if shed ever been a tom storey fan always more of a boys hero tom like jeff beck peter green mark knopfler and eric clapton before he recorded wonderful tonight normally i keep out of the way when toms there lol said hes um irascible his hairs all white now and his moustache seems to cover half his face its like the studios being vandalized by the abominable snowman and yet at the end of it all those guitar licks fluid economical delicate he knows belladonna and underneath it all a sensitive man i mean sensitive sensitive and sensitive about discussing it because hes in permanent neurotic denial tom will tell you just like your friend saltash that its all crap and all in your mind except that tom knows it isnt so when prof said hang on im going to put tom on the line belladonna big voice filling the mobile phone making it feel twice as heavy like an ingot bellafuckingdonna lol had had to sit down you know what that woman did laurence she had a baby shes in maternity when she learns shes finally got herself a recording contract the longedfor break whats she do kids born she gives it up for adoption at that stage might have arranged it earlier im not brilliant on details im giving you the sense of it gives the father up too dead now poor sod smack thats the kind of woman carries death around like a tray of black poppies gives up a child for a recording contract hard to be sure how accurate this was lol knew that tom felt strongly about anything childrelated his daughter vanessa was down syndrome he treated her like a goddess but that was a long time ago lol said she couldnt have been much more than a kid a woman take my word then gawd knows what she is now tom talked about the albums biggish over here for a while but in the states mega which was rare for a british punk or new wave artist american punks at least they knew a few chords and they didnt gob on the audience british punk americans just didnt get the joke but see belladonna was never funny and she wasnt like the rest she talked posh talked like bleedin julie andrews they loved that in the states because america had quite taken to her tom said belladonna had made a huge amount of money very quickly and because shed looked after it with daddys assistance she never wound up on some sad endofthepier s nostalgia trip like some other poor bleeders tom could name they put the loot into property old houses bought this dump looked like the bates motel done it up sold it for triple never looked back daddy saw the value bell only bought the place on account of whats this tell you about her on account of she reckoned it was haunted lol had asked hesitantly what it had told tom tells me she dont she aint got it she dont feel haunted to her was like romance this fucking irresponsible dilettante bitch they were close to toms barrier here hed let go of a huge but unstable laugh at this point like a big tipperlorry dumping gravel the house the house wasnt haunted enough apparently or the bleedin spooks couldnt stand the company and pissed off she didnt feel lol took a chance the way some people feel but she wanted to tom was quiet lol halfexpecting him to ring off and then story is she had meningitis as a kid teens anyway came close to checking out had some deathsdoor experience changed her life kept wanting to tell me about it following me around sent me a card wiv you know a picture inside of her that kind of picture i dont fink so outta my face you crazy woman so when was the last time you actually spoke to her gawd few years ago she wanted to work wiv me this time like id be that insane didnt seem to be able to decode the phrase piss off kept ringing bending shelleys ear the missus i wasnt gonna talk to her no way its why we was exdirectory gawdsake we had the number changed in the end mad sick stupid woman and the music atrocious where was she living the last you heard moves around always moved around couldnt settle i fink shelley would know this i fink the last we heard she was on her daughters back nah nah not her daughter saul peppers daughter the poor bastard she married he had a daughter already bell went to live near the daughter thats the last we heard would that have been in ludlow where in shropshire shit tom said that aint too far away from here is it listen you ever run into the mad bitch you never spoke to me in your life laurence lol put a log on the fire the marriage to saul pepper ended apparently about six years ago merrily said he went to america to work has a new family now one website says the split was amicable pepper said she was too merrily sighed too weird for him in the end seems to have been too weird for people all her life but not too weird for saul peppers daughter nor it seems for robbie walsh erm what tom storey told you about the neardeath experience thats interesting the church has a strange attitude towards all that the most common perceived experience of an afterlife but were oh so wary you me no id love to have a neardeath experience well not too near not just yet but i mean most people whove had them the long tunnel the glorious light they immediately seem to lose all fear of dying i thought the clergy naturally would have no f youre kidding lol smiled doesnt really explain belladonnas music though does it her old stage act which was not about the delights of the afterlife as much as the trappings of death itself coffins biers all that what kind of neardeath experience accounts for that good point none of this adds up does it i mean thats the problem nothing here adds up nothing quite connects pieces missing everywhere what about the dead girl especially that thats horrific merrily stood up steadying her mug of tea im going to suggest that mumford talk to frannie bliss see if he can find out what the police have uncovered i think what bernies saying is that it needs to be sorted explained before local people start putting a superstitious slant on it does that really happen any more in our secular society especially in our secular society merrily said she reached out for lols hand nothing wrong is there i no youre ok about the bristol gig ill just take lots of drugs lol said she peered at him to see if he was smiling he smiled a few minutes later he watched from the front window as she moved across the edge of the cobbled square to the vicarage gate he felt vacant spare she was working seven days a week letting herself be used to further other peoples agendas in the past week hed written about half a song that was never going to be more than a filler track on the next album if there was a next album he felt incomplete worthless the fire was burning low and the room was laden with shadows as dense as old clothes it was time he got the electricity connected ghostwalk mumford didnt want to talk to frannie bliss well it wasnt that he didnt want to talk to bliss he said on the phone just that he didnt want to put the di in a difficult position mumford reluctantly as joe public a crisis of confidence you do want to find out about this merrily said how this girls suicide ties in if it does suppose i wouldnt mind aye almost certainly welsh borderspeak for yes i will never rest again until i know outside the scullery window the apple trees budded branches dangled uncertainly and the greygreen moss gleamed coldly on the stone wall between the vicarage garden and the churchyard spring had stalled in frosty spurts of morning mist the exhaust of winter you heard the local radio mrs watkins some of the early stuff the breakfast lead on radio hereford and worcester had been an extended report live from ledbury not unexpectedly the parents werent talking anonymous neighbours said that the dead girl jemima pegler used to be a helpful friendly kid once but shed changed neighbours in small towns didnt like to use words like sullen they said more withdrawn lately you leave it on for the studio discussion mumford said didnt have time your friend dr saltash merrily gripped the wooden arms of her chair ethel the cat taking off from the desk and raking up a page of the sermon pad introduced as a retired consultant psychiatrist with hereford hospitals special consultant to the department of health and the author of a paper on selfharming in children and teenagers andy was this man always bloody ubiquitous or is it just my paranoia said he couldnt really comment on an individual case but in the general way of things this particular method of suicide public place it was usually a cry for attention a child saying youre all gonner know who i am now kind of thing and two nearidentical deaths in more or less the same spot didnt make much of that once a place gets known for it like scores of folk jumping off beachy head ennit he mention your mother not in so many words old folk thats not so emotive is it not like kids and we still dont know what the police think giving mumford another opportunity to say hed contact bliss look he said i gotter go into ludlow this afternoon see about the inquest get an undertaker on standby for the ole girl might talk to some other people while im there let you know what i find out all right please course mumford said no particlar reason why you shouldnt give the boss a call bliss always got time for you as i recall and then like tell you what he says i wouldnt mind mumford said andy mumford frannie bliss said nostalgically merrily i just cant tell you how much i miss the miserable bastard the faded rugbyclub ties the knackered tweed jackets he probably inherited from his dad his dads still alive frannie figure of speech merrily unlike his mother ah jesus over the sounds of phones and fractured laughter in the hereford cid room she heard the side of his fist bump the desk im not thinking am i im sorry i was gonna ring him merrily its just difficult yeah strangers i can handle the sorryforyourloss routine and when its a working copper you all go out and get drunk together but a retired ds who never wanted to go never even got pissed when he left you know that were in the pub for his presentation and hes shuffling about a bit trying to pretend he cant wait to see the back of us and then i look around and hes like just not there any more gone evaporated always that bit of distance mind him local me incomer been trying for two years to get him to stop calling me mrs watkins no chance bliss said so andys slumped in his garden like a bloody old smouldering bonfire thinking the shropshire cops are sitting on information that could reveal the truth about his nephews death right and theres also the question of his mother and now the girl listen ive gorra say at the outset this is not really my case true both kids came from this division but its ludlows headache for which were frankly quite glad i mean is it a case i dont know has it been a case for you as it were ive never yet had anything so cleancut as a case you know that go on then bliss said resigned tell me why youre interested so merrily told him about mrs mumford and the bereavement apparitiondelusionhallucination well he knew what she was about he was a liverpool catholic tended not to laugh at her not often anyway funny i remember me ma when me uncle got killed on the railway she swore shed seen him walking up our front path didnt know he was dead then opens the front door nobody there familys a funny thing merrily what did you do nothing i had a psychiatrist with me not an entirely happy situation but i wont go into it now bottom line is what she subsequently said in front of andy and me was that a woman had taken robbie later she appeared to be suggesting that a woman had pushed him off the tower how did she know that merrily sighed hed told her ah bliss said the old phantomwitness scenario i knew youd be impressed dont get me wrong id have been dubious too frannie except we talked to someone whod seen the boy with a particular woman on two occasions once in the grounds of ludlow castle and what do you top detectives call it these days when youve got a feeling we call it time to keep very quiet merrily because in the modern computerized cctv dna cpsconscious politically correct focusgroup fuckin police service we do not do individual feelings any more and there was me thinking you were the last maverick cop under forty man who needed to live life on the edge that was before i was back with kirsty now im a husband and father again with a mortgage and a career path i see merrily said well then thanks very much frannie erm have a nice life the rest of the morning she didnt think about any of it she had parish matters to deal with not least the fortnightly ledwardine magazine which in recognition of the need to sell a few hundred copies to people who didnt go to church had become a general community newsletter edited in this parish inevitably and somewhat crudely by the vicar it usually carried a few paragraphs on newcomers to the village and jane had left a piece on lol in the file which merrily got around to just before noon we are delighted to welcome to the select end of church street mr robinson who many of you will no doubt remember as the young goodlooking and talented one in the almostfamous s folkrock band hazey jane mr robinson who spends some of his spare time with the vicar has recently relaunched his musical career after a difficult period in his life but wants it to be known although far too shy to say so himself that he will not be available for the ledwardine summer festival or any other piece of crap planned by his fellow incomers to put the village on the map also in the file was a copy of a letter from an outfit calling itself parish pump which had apparently gone to every community in the diocese do you want to make your parish magazine into a genuine goingconcern a professional publication that every parishioner will want to buy if so we can help you we can show you how to turn your parish notes into something lively gossipy and compulsively readable we can even do the whole thing for you and if you arent satisfied with the increase in income well refund your fees parish pump guarantees to pump up your income contact us now you had to hand it to them for enterprise but the idea of turning the ledwardine community news into something resembling hello magazine somehow didnt appeal still she put it back in the file perhaps shed show it to the parish council janes contribution however she cremated that slowly over the ashtray with the zippo because the magazine was usually laid out and printed in a hurry you could never be too careful it just might get in the phone rang she burned her thumb reaching for it this woman mumford said sorry you got time where are you ludlow on the mobile in a layby edge of the town centre below the castle looking at a pair of locked gates mrs peppers house what you can see of it behind all the trees i can imagine she wouldnt want to be too public merrily said some of her old fans could well be slightly disturbed people thats what the feller does the ghostwalk said sorry ludlow ghosttours ah right dont stop her roaming the street in the early hours mind sometimes on her own sometimes with her followers from out of town mostly weird clothes like dracula i saw them andy down by the river been street fights between local boys and these creeps did you know that mumford said a stabbing one time in ludlow like anywhere else at closing time local yobs dont work for the tourist office this is what the ghostwalk guy said eventually took some time to get anything from anybody most folk wont hear a word against her i asked around in shops cafés the tourist information office helpful at first then they clammed up without exception either they dint know or they said it was rubbish telling you to take no notice of any malicious gossip you gets told its all lies woman lives quietly does nobody any harm bit eccentric thats her business what dyou make of that that its a nice town where people dont like malicious gossip shops mrs watkins businesses good customer mabbe rich woman big spender or maybe they thought you were a reporter no mumford said they didnt think that so finally im in this café and an elderly woman having a cup of tea overhears me talkin to the proprietor leaves the money on the table follows me out mumford paused merrily heard faint voices in the background passersby when it was quiet again he came back his voice tight to the phone whispers to me do i mean the woman who walks the back streets the alleys very late at night early morning ah mumford said the elderly woman lived in one of the discreet courtyard retirement flats between the church and the top car park new housing cleverly built into the oldest part of town ancient stone walls merging with new brick almost the colour of the old desirable dwellings if you didnt mind a few curious tourists the occasional drunk and the night walker walking the back streets dressed all in white sometimes carrying a candle in a lantern thats your woman so i went back to see the ghostwalk boy taking what you might call a slightly firmer line with him i hope thats not understatement andy only language they understand his sort anyway he opens up eventually telling me how this woman hired him to take her on his walk this was not long after she moved in just him and her nearly three hours questions all the way ghosts when was this one seen is it still seen have you seen it i reckon he wasnt too upset in the end at being kept out most of the night mind he was well remunerated one way or another i reckon unfair people change presumably you asked the ghostwalk guy about mrs pepper and robbie natrally well first thing he knew robbie all right no surprise there they all knew robbie all the shopkeepers the coppers but the ghostwalk feller they had an arrangement hed come along on the walks tell folks about the history of the various buildings very useful for the ghostwalk feller people liked him see robbie the history boy exactly would that be how he met mrs pepper id say anyway figured id go over to her place down lower linney ring the bell ask her straight out come up against a pair of locked gates no bell no speakerphone just an expensive mailbox so i climbs over that wise mumford snorted walks up the drive fully visible from the house farmhouse looked like pretty old bangs on the front door nothing but see she was in there thirty years a copper you just know when theyre in and she was she was in you tried phoning exdirectory which wouldnt have been a problem few weeks ago no maybe not merrily could sense his frustration he was panting a bit now she had the impression that years of bitterness were being funnelled into this like petrol into a generator folks finding candle stubs on walls tree stumps where shes been been going on for months and me even i seen it hovering round mams house with her bloody candle why didnt i go after her because you had no reason to because whenever theres a public kind of death a big funeral theres always someone like that around leaving flowers burning candles i see it all the time and she was crying wasnt she was she crying at the river merrily paused no i ent gonner make a mistake like that again mumford said grimly merrily shoved the parishmagazine file into a drawer lit a cigarette this could get out of hand with the death of his mother an unnecessary death a second public death mumford wasnt going to stop when the phone went again she thought it was going to be him ringing back having cooled down but it was bliss he sounded relaxed or maybe that was just in comparison with mumford you remember karen merrily huh sorry you all right yes sorry karen big farm girl wpc acting dc now with mumford gone i campaigned very strongly to get karen on the team another real local country person somebody who can work a baler and drain a slurry pit cant get along with these poncy law graduates now then earlier today karen brings in a personal computer lifting it around like its a toaster what a woman good to hear you have a new bagcarrier worthy of the term the computers original owner jemmie pegler jemima i thought you said it wasnt your case yeah well you ringing up like that out the blue got me thinking i always hate it when me mates are talking over me head and karen despite having pigshit on her boots is also our resident computer expert bit of a natural so they sent her on a course for stripping down hard disks all that so shrewsbury asked if she could do the necessary with jemmies gear and i thought id have a peep nice to have you back frannie yeah that really hurt me feelings still the last maverick cop under forty and proud of it so what did you find on the computer upsetting bliss didnt sound upset hard disk is full of links for instance to these horribly scary teenagesuicide chatlines would you like to see shall i come now leave it till late afternoon when the dci has a meeting at headquarters with some tosser from the home office and no dog collar eh id really hate it to get back that i still talk to dangerous cranks kindred spirit that evening it rained again hard brutal nailgun rain like in winter for the first time in about a week merrily had built a fire of logs and coal in the vicarage sitting room she sat watching jane cuddling ethel on the hearthrug there was a lot to be chilled about tonight but it was cosy enough in here if you averted your eyes from the damp spreading under the window what is this jane said suddenly everybody wants to talk about suicide never mind merrily said we dont have to put the cd back on not the belladonna album again jane put the cat down and made as if to get up staging a startled glance at the door anything but that in fact lets talk about suicide what do you want to know jane being selfconsciously frivolous but she really hadnt liked the cd nightshades that merrily had found in woolworths if you ever do come across that woman in ludlow just dont invite her here teenage suicide jane said sweetly all i said flower was that it seems to have merrily shook herself sorry did i call you flower again its no good doesnt seem right saying jane all the time not my fault you wanted a kid called something basic just because youd been landed with a silly name jane slumped back down just call me whatever makes you happy and yes i do know people my age whove been into suicide chatrooms why how do you mean i mean is it suddenly seen as cool or something is it cool to die ok merrily said jemima pegler was habitually sullen and uncooperative and didnt talk to her parents hmm that does sound like a particularly curious case jane ok sorry jane leaned back hands clasped behind her head its like one of the uncles said on the news how were they to know she was seriously depressed when she wouldnt talk to them you dont sound too sorry for her sorry jane said im supposed to feel sorry for her look suicide chatrooms its like its the final taboo the great unknown the ultimate experience because nobody you know all the cool guys whove been there done that washed the tshirt again its the one thing the one place death that they havent do you know what im getting at possibly merrily said in fact yes jemmie pegler had been fifteen years old reading her emails you had to keep reminding yourself of that merrily had left the volvo in the gaol street car park to find frannie bliss waiting for her in the street with an executive briefcase annie howe the dci had been delayed was still in the building bliss had rushed merrily off to a café in a mews at the opposite side of the car park on a discreet corner table hed laid out a sheaf of printout material from the dead girls computer but first he wanted to talk about mumford merrily why the why didnt you tell me hed had his red hair cut tight to the skull maybe because it had been receding or maybe because he thought it made him look more dangerous which it did i did tell you no you didnt you totally did not tell me merrily i dont understand mumfords been in ludlow today right right talking to people all over the town about robbie walsh and this woman did i mention and the reason i know about this is that the dci told me and the reason the dci knows is that she was telephoned by her opposite number in shrewsbury a shinyarsed admin twat called shaun eastlake who was clearly chuffed as a butty at being able to tell her about a a member of the public stamping around his patch interrogating other members of the public having identified himself as detective sergeant mumford oh god merrily said now i think you can probably imagine how the ice maiden is reacting to this mmm danger signals in merrilys head blinking amber and red before bliss had been promoted to inspector and annie howe to dci mumford had been her bagcarrier and localknowledge man history which in the present circumstances would matter not a damn frannie look i didnt know should have realized of course should have realized if only from personal experience how hard it is to get information out of people if you havent got the weight merrily blisss fist came down on the table a woman behind the counter glancing anxiously across its an offence impersonating a police officer and if youve been a police officer does that make it better no it makes it wairse the mersey in his accent bursting its banks is it conceivable the fat bastards forgotten that frannie you think im kidding this is annie howe were talking about not a human being and her face is as close as it gets to being pink with embarrassment merrily sat back one of the people he talked to told the police no they told george lackland the mayor right and county councillor and vicechairman of the west mercia police committee oh god really but apart from the element of deception why would he or any of the people mumford talked to not want the truth to come out about robbie walsh and a woman who i dont know maybe shes well connected lets just say that ludlows one little town where mumford would be well advised to walk like the streets are tiled with antique porcelain bearing in mind that when it comes to bailingout time steve britton will no longer be his friend best to assume he doesnt have any friends any more in or out of uniform at ludlow nick policemen dont just drop their mates times change merrily we didnt used to have divisional chiefs like howe so you tell mumford any officer spotted discussing the weather with him its a redcard situation do you think you could convey that to him merrily nodded there was nothing to be said mumford was so far out of line he probably couldnt even discern a line any more good bliss said now lets talk about poor jemmie pegler it was realizing i just did it to keep him quiet and so hed keep paying for the drinks whats that say im anbodys after a few drinks and they just laugh at the desperate worthless fat bitch and when your worthless thats the bottom your never gonna come back from that are you merrily winced whos this one to frannie girlfriend found it on the end of a reply from the other girl karen went to talk to the other girl she seemed genuinely shattered said jemmie peglers emails always went over the top wanted her mates to think she was a woman of the world whod had so many men she was bored with sex girl thought it was all bullshit doesnt seem like that to me in which case bliss put a stiffbacked photo envelope in front of merrily with another email on top of it the girl said she thought this was bullshit too theyve gone out again so i looked in the bathroom cabinet just now and im thinking what would happen if i emptied every packet and every bottle in there and swallowed the lot well just be sick as a dog most likely how sad is that sam im not going out sad im not when i go theyll fucking know ive gone merrily read it a second time then opened the envelope it was a flash photo in colour a party pic of a fleshy girl laughing short black hair gelled into goldtipped spikes a nosestud with an implausible royalblue gemstone she was gripping a bottle by its silvery neck when did the computer come in frannie soon after we got a firm id last night and would karen have been working on it last night she was certainly on last night and its much nicer tucked up in an office with a computer and mug of tea than going out on the cold streets so probably why merrily went back to the email this line about not going out sad seems to echo what someone apparently said on the radio this morning that this kind of public suicide was a way of saying now youre all going to know who i am who said that im probably being paranoid dr saltash interviewed by radio hereford and worcester is he officially assisting the police possibly hes done it before the ice maidens fond of psychological consultants profilers all these buggers whore supposed to be doing our job for us mmm and siân callaghanclarke who colleague of mine callaghanclarke on dci annie howe the night of the deliverance panel i get on very well with her why paranoid merrily sorry you said you were probably being paranoid oh it its just that nigel saltash has been inflicted on me as a psychiatric consultant he probably volunteered when he saw your picture do you have a reason to say that or hmm bliss did a wry smile if he is a mate of the ice maidens forget i spoke have a look at this one i want to go away want us to go away where they cant get at us do you know what im saying im sick of guys im sick of going to london in nicked cars only it always turns out to be worcester and im sick of loading the poxy dishwasher i want to goooooo awayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy for good merrily went back to some of the earlier emails about jemima not wanting to go to school any more but not wanting a job either jemima professing to despise girls who stuck with one boy longer than a few weeks suggesting that boys usually dumped her within that timespan doesnt want to live at home but she thinks it must be crap to have a place of your own and have to clean it so shes overweight and has a reputation as an easy lay because she must be desperate selfesteem at rock bottom bored with going out with blokes who nick cars because theres nowhere worth driving to in them was she ever diagnosed as clinically depressed parents say not drugs in normal life possibly hard to say when she died however this is well off the record right absolutely the window in the ruins were fairly sure she went out of is not actually that high up certainly not compared with the top of the tower that robbie walsh came off you cant get to the top of jemmies tower without a ladder its hollow so youre going out of one of the reachable windows quite a drop the other side and it could kill you but its not a foregone conclusion unless that is youve already shot yourself full of enough heroin to make keith richards play the wrong chords merrily looked up blinking she shot up before she jumped bliss said threw the syringe out the window first it looks like soco found it underneath a yew tree with her mobile a few feet away both some distance from the body pm this afternoon showed cardiac arrest is that common enough with an inexperienced user more often than youd think the first fix is the last sometimes they dont even have time to take the needle out before theyve gone dr grace thinks she mightve been dead before she hit the ground but well never know that god so for all the drama its a sad little death merrily mobile shows she tried to call her mate sam before she did it see we know she wouldnt have had any problem at all getting the stuff a useful byproduct of getting into jemmies computer was it led us directly to a dealer we didnt even know about in ledbury shed had es and dope from the same guy so delightfully indiscreet these kiddies ledbury pleasant picturesque old place at the foot of the malverns you didnt think of it happening there but then it happened more or less everywhere now and some links to bigger players in hereford bliss said for all she never spoke to her parents shes chatting away to us from the other side of the grave talking of which bliss spread out some typescript read this with a plastic bag u can tie it round your neck but its not really necessary and it will take u much longer to get it off if u change your mind wot is good about plastic bags is that u dont look really horrible when they find you like with some methods of suffocation cos your eyes dont come out all bloody you can also read about the delights of hanging yourself bliss said this is an internet chatroom right a specialist suicide chatroom adults advising unhappy kids on how to top themselves cant describe what id like to do to these bastards with a few plastic bags but then a few of us catholics still think suicides a sin did jemmie pegler join in the discussions in the suicide chatrooms just eavesdropped i think lurking as they say been doing it on and off for weeks it looks like downloaded quite a lot so we know shed been dwelling on the possibility of suicide for quite a while but no clues as to why she chose this method this place no mention of robbie walsh or ludlow castle nothing you see the point is that robbie fell from the big tower the norman keep no history to that but jemima wasnt the first to go off the hanging tower tell me bliss said merrily told him about marion long time ago that bliss reached down to his briefcase youve already indicated this particular tower isnt best suited to suicide yet jemima was determined to go that way did she use all that heroin to give her courage or was it to make sure she died if the fall wasnt enough interesting question bliss said how about robbie walsh did he have a computer apparently not karen checked this afternoon youre having second thoughts about robbie walsh because of this you got me thinking bliss said however according to his mother he wasnt the computer type an oldfashioned reader certainly enough books around the place according to karen history books no personal cd collection either very oldfashioned little lad an oldfashioned family the mumfords well most of them bliss laid a folder on the pile in front of merrily there you go all ends tied it contained a colour printout from a website ludlow ghostours you knew merrily said just thought id see if you did its all there marion of the heath for a small fee this feller will even guide you to the spot shed downloaded it and more besides plan of the castle she knew exactly where she was going and what she was gonna do when she got there anything else you havent told me because you wanted to see if i knew it already bliss smiled before leaving hereford merrily had called mumford on his mobile from the car sitting in the gaol street car park with the rain beginning aye mumford said wearily i know who told you doesnt matter pointless me asking why you felt you had to pass yourself off as still a copper there was silence she thought shed lost the signal the rain pooled in a dent on the volvos bonnet when mumfords voice came back it sounded driedup like a ditch in summer cant talk to people simple as that never could cant do small talk walk into a shop i can just about ask for what i wanner buy what do i say im robbie walshs uncle and im feeling guilty as hell and please can you help me cant do it never could in the same way he could only call her mrs watkins in the same way hed addressed gerald osman as sir but not out of politeness his whole identity had been written on his warrant card what did bliss say mumford asked he said you should stay out of ludlow he was probably hyping it up a little mabbe not merrily sighed ok heres what else i found out she told him about jemmie peglers computer and the suicide chatrooms emphasizing that although his name had appeared briefly on the chat pages there had been no obvious personal connection with robbie walsh hopefully this would keep mumford out of ledbury computer eh he let out a slow hiss never thought damn bliss said robbie didnt have a computer of course he had a computer his grandparents bought it for him had me collect it from pc world packard bell well he hadnt got it any more andy well see about that mumford said driving home with the rain starting up merrily wondered how much was actually known about marion de la bruyère a lady of the castle you thought of flowing robes one of those funnelshaped headdresses with a ribbon but bernie dunmore had been right you were probably talking about a child those precious teenage years were also very much bypassed in the middle ages by janes age you could be a mother of three marion was probably about fifteen herself when she died or even younger young enough certainly to be fooled by a smart operator she thought was in love with her jemmie pegler staving off chronic emotional starvation maybe profound loneliness had been in very much the right mental state to imagine that marion disaffected betrayed a kindred spirit would be holding her hand as she jumped merrily said to jane what sort of state do you imagine someone would have to be in for the idea of suicide to become appealing exciting look jane said suicide chatrooms my basic feeling is that most people who go into suicide chatrooms are never going to top themselves its just titillation like running across railway lines bungeejumping real suicide thats when you just no longer want to be alive when it seems like theres absolutely nothing worth hanging on to you dont care how you do it do you as long as it works jemmie pegler went through with it in a way that suggests she cared very much how it was done yeah thats weird and what about robbie walsh possibly killing himself mmm i think were all starting to have second thoughts about poor robbie well thanks anyway jane said for what for not saying look flower if there was ever a deep source of depression in your life i hope you wouldnt hesitate to thats the phone merrily pointed a menacing finger dont go away by the time she got to the scullery the answering machine had caught the call as was intended to ambush the people who made a point of phoning at night because it was cheaper to bend your ear for an hour on some parish issue of awesome triviality mrs watkins if youre there she sighed and picked up switching on the anglepoise lamp andy im at my sisters robbies mother andy do you think maybe you need to relax just a little i got robbies computer oh thought you might wanner know when my sister told karen the boy hadnt got a computer she lied natrally which karen wouldve guessed of course but she was hardly in a situation to push it im sorry why would your sister lie two reasons one they was worried about what he might have on there that praps a good caring parent ought to have known about two they thought they could sell it for a couple of hundred taking it to a carboot sale along with the rest of his stuff course she also tried to tell me theyd already got rid of it but i remembered the lockups sorry garages a number of which dont contain cars but serve as storage for various items that residents of the plascarreg might not want found inside their houses sometimes using each others garages or the garage of some harmless old lady with no car to confuse the issue the plascarreg of course are you bringing the computer out there was a pause i could spell this out but youre an intelligent woman my sisters here on her own the boyfriends down the pub i got till he comes back to check this over not that he scares me but if i can get away without a scene thats best so im gonner go over the hard disk on site as it were merrily looked up at the wall clock pm over the phone she could hear vehicles revving the tinny sound of hard rain splattering a car roof would it help if i came over couldnt ask that mrs watkins not the plascarreg this is hereford andy not brixton whats the number of the flat one thirtyseven ok she wrote it down i cant ask you to do this mumford said not at night you didnt ask im electing to come im interested youre stupid jane said you cant see what hes doing to you merrily standing in the hall pulling on her coat jane in the kitchen doorway doing the slow headshake that conveyed superior knowledge make this very quick merrily said ok lol will doubtless confirm the psychology at a future time but essentially mumford is a subordinate officer right he never rose beyond sergeant because he was totally reliable but never had the spark of inspiration that make guys like bliss and dont you ever dare tell bliss i said this into a bit of a star no worries there merrily unbolted the front door bliss would not believe youd ever said that and now mumfords lost bliss right jane came into the hall hes floundering hes out of his depth he cant make decisions he cant function without a governor and so like whether he realizes this or not hes put you into that essential role jane thats its spot on vicar im telling you merrily stepped outside then turned back would you actually like to help janes eyes halfclosed what go on the net and see if you can find any links between ludlow and suicide sites and erm anything else jane looked surprised yeah ok thank you flower any time ill er ill see you later then guv outcast in the city the rain had stopped leaving the roads blurred and gleaming the whitelit restaurant complex in left bank village like an ice palace beside the river wye as merrily drove across greyfriars bridge this was tourist hereford only seven minutes drive away from the plascarreg estate where no tourists went except by mistake plascarreg welsh for place of the rocks if what shed read some months ago in the hereford times was still valid the only rocks here now were crackcocaine plascarreg was flatpack brick and concrete housing blocks just off the road between belmont and the barnchurch trading estate its windowless backs hunched against the west wind and the city halflit in sour sodium it looked like a vague idea halfthoughtout merrily drove in slowly on full beam the derelict land opposite had been scheduled for an extension of the barnchurch site suspended through lack of investment or perhaps because someone thought derelict land reflected the plascarreg ethos better than fields the second block was three storeys high flats behind covered walkways there was a parking area crammed with vehicles with just one space free if you put two wheels on the kerb she reversed in next to an abandoned van with a stack of crumbling bricks under one rear wheelarch it would have been stupid to tell herself she wasnt feeling vulnerable here but when youd started out as a curate in a particular area of merseyside it wasnt exactly a fear of the unknown mumford hadnt said whether his sisters flat was on the ground floor or if there was a stairwell involved nobody liked stairwells at night she started walking along the edge of the roadway looking up at dull lights behind tightdrawn curtains edging round puddles hands in the pockets of her waxed jacket that was hanging open the air was damp and chilled and sharp and there seemed to be nobody mrs watkins andy moving softly in the shadows and it was all shadows here mumford took her elbow shouldve told you on the phone we ent going to the flat its just over yere he led her to a low concrete block separate from the flats garages with upandover metal doors stopping outside one with a thin rim of yellow light around it pulling up the door with a clang that echoed like machinery in a quarry the light came from a caged circular ceiling lamp reflected in an oilpool on the concrete floor where a car would have been you better make this bloody quick andy a woman moved out of the shadows and pushed in front of mumford and remember you dont take nothing she was about merrilys age maybe a bit older with mumfords small features surrounded by a lot of dark hair her red leather coat was open showing that she was pregnant my sister angela mumford said this is mrs watkins merrily good job you didnt come in your dog collar angela said they eat priests on this estate they wouldnt enjoy me merrily said im more chewy than i look angela gave her a glance unsmiling so maybe this wasnt the time to offer condolences remember what i said angela said to mumford you dont take nothing away she tossed him a key on a chain you got half an hour no more lock up when youve finished key through the letter box angela walked out without looking back mumford tried to pull down the door from the inside but the handle was missing i would say shes changed he left a gap under the door so they could get out again but she ent at the far end of the garage the computer sat on a workbench already switched on casting a somehow baleful blue light over stacks of cardboard boxes mumford nodded at the boxes take a look mrs watkins see whats left of robbie walsh merrily walked around the oil there were about a dozen wine boxes from supermarkets warily she opened one books she pulled one out largeformat everyday life in the middle ages in pictures heraldic symbols in each corner once a paperback its covers had been stiffened with card the way you did to prolong the life of a book that you really loved one that was well used day after day it flopped open where a page had been torn out none too carefully fragments of it still flapping from the spine the facing page was headed trial by ordeal mumford prodded a box with his shoe all his books are yere stuff on castles armour weapons guide books to historic houses people gave him all off to a boot sale at the weekend outside of town they ent daft theyre selling all his stuff need the space another baby on the way boyfriends this time just to prove he can merrily put the book back in the box and closed the flaps it felt like pulling a sheet over a body what happened to robbies father he came to the funeral not a bad bloke mumford opened another box pulled out a turquoise baseball cap put it on his own head where it almost fitted this was always too big for robbie see poor little devil never realized why folks were laughing tried for street cred never got close youve got kids havent you two girls one in new zealand one a veterinary nurse living with a vet down in newport they done ok considering mumford took off the cap when you make cid youre as good as lost to your family oh dad youre not working again we never sees you look id say im protecting you and your mother thats what im doing any old excuse see this hed opened up a book hed evidently been using as a mousemat for the computer the tudor household something had been scribbled on the front and then scribbled over through the top scribble they could still make out crude black letters walsh is gay jane tells me the words become an allpurpose term of abuse now among kids merrily said abuse mumford said aye what are you thinking mumford reached into the book box pulled out a paperback with a white and sepia cover castles and moated sites of herefordshire it looked new except for the brown tape holding the spine together a pamphlet fell out south wye history project looks like the book was ripped in half ennit he was real careful with his books what youre saying is he didnt do this thats likely what im saying the boyfriend or it could be ange when he was little if he left toys around after shed told him to put them away shed throw them on the fire ive seen it this was when she was still with his dad and they were living out at kingstone marital tension always felt i oughter do something for the boy couldnt think what he put the book back carefully in the wine box hell he was never abused im not saying that just never encouraged which is how he became a loner up in his room with his books mumford turned away stood very still hands in the pockets of his dark tweed jacket andy lets have a look at the computer mumford brought out his glasses case his hands were shaking very slightly never got to see the boy much since she moved in with mathiesson they never liked me coming round not with both neighbours on probation no excuse is it i couldve done something he put on his glasses and gripped the mouse began dragging the cursor over icons on the computer desktop mumford merrily had noted this before was surprisingly at home with computers seems likely the only time the boy ever went out on his own was in ludlow just walking the streets in his element he clicked on an icon bringing up a photograph of the ornate oaken façade of the feathers in corve street against an improbably mediterranean blue sky what hed do see hed download documents and photos from the net compiling his own files switch on his computer straightaway hes back in ludlow street maps architectural plans the lot virtual heaven merrily said aware of her own voice giving way she coughed aye look mumford brought up a series of short histories of different buildings some like the readers house shed heard of this is what i wanted you to see the weir house name adopted since recent major restoration for this onetime farmhouse on an elevated site below the castle and overlooking the teme origins believed to date back to the early fourteenth century when it was acquired by the palmers guild or earlier timbers extensively replaced but one original cruckbeam is preserved and the central fireplace believed fifteenthcentury remains a significant feature not open to the public thats her house mumford said mrs pepper there was sweat on his forehead a small mesh of veins like a crushed insect twitching below one eye but it andy it seems to be one of over a dozen old buildings hes got listed there he shook his head all the others are key historical buildings this weir house its just been done up from a shell its the only one on the list thats not important and not really in the town itself but its only there cause its hers you think ludlow the one place he thought he was safe he clicked to a photo of the buttercross staring at it as if he could get the full story out of the stones safe from what where he thought he was free then he stepped away from the monitor you have a look see if anything occurs to you merrily went over to the computer keyboard you checked his emails nothing no emails at all i reckon they been wiped by ange or mathiesson just in case in case of what im not sure you been through the deleted mails buggerall see for yourself under deleted mails merrily found one that said ghostours re half price she clicked on it hi robson thanks for your mail and your interest in ghostours yes it certainly is halfprice for children however we dont usually allow anyone under sixteen to go on the walk unless accompanied by a responsible adult mind you its usually the adults who are most scared is there a parent or relative who would come with you if so we usually gather in the bullring on friday and saturday evenings at pm but pop into the shop when youre here and well see what we can do cheers jonathan scole ludlow ghostours thats months old mumford said boy making plans for his holiday this is the ghostwalk feller the pepper woman paid to take her round would she have made a responsible adult for robbie you reckon andy that merrily turned round a boy had squeezed under the metal door he looked about ten or eleven she tapped mumford on the shoulder gave the kid a quick smile hello the boy said nothing mumford eyed him with naked suspicion what dyou want sonny the kid moved further into the garage baseball cap pulled down what you doing whats it look like were doing mumford said were playing computer games what you got sonic the hedgehog mumford said before your time ent you got something violent to watch on tv that robbie walshs stuff mumford clicked off the email makes you think that their garage ennit you knew robbie walsh you his grandad no i ent you cheeky little sod ange said we could have a look at his stuff see if theres anything we wanted aye i bet she did honest all right goodnight son mumford said his tone had hardened his hands hung by his sides mumford still had police presence the kid backed off ducked under the opening then stuck his head back in dont want none of that shit anyway robbie walsh was gay id get aids or someing and disappeared laughing mumford said nothing but went over and pulled down the metal door leaving a much smaller gap at the bottom this time he probably doesnt even know what it means anyway merrily said when mumford came back to the computer i know what it means he didnt look at her means the boy was different sensitive bit academic and didnt hang around with whatever gangs operated on the estate an outcast in other words he picked up the book with the damaged spine therefore a target he was being victimized bullied thats what you think mumford didnt reply he put the book back and laid a hand on the mouse running the cursor from icon to icon try internet explorer and click on history merrily suggested find out where hes been lately but robbies most recent ventures on the net amounted only to ludlow tourist sites ludlow historical society documents nothing unexpected nothing that looked like a suicide chatroom after about fifteen fruitless minutes mumford went back to the desktop where nothing looked promising unless you were seriously into medieval history it was cold in here and merrily was no longer sure what they were looking for it all came down to mumfords feeling that the boy had been in need of help and he hadnt noticed perhaps thinking hed got off too lightly with his own daughters to whom nothing bad seemed to have happened school projects she said try that sounds boring mumford looked at her a vehicle went slowly past the garage maybe a bit too boring merrily said do you think mumford clicked on it an email appeared at once dear robbie thanks for the stuff you sent me it was great its cool that were interested in the same things and of course i wont stop writing to you but dont worry i know things can seem really bad but like my nan says its always darkest before the dawn and i know this is going to work out for you and youll get away from that awful place just hang on in there and thanks for sharing this with me i feel really privileged look robbie ive got a lot to do with exams and stuff coming up so if you dont hear from me for a bit dont think ive forgotten all right love and good luck merrily read it again there was no signature well done mrs watkins mumford said it looks like hes copied the email onto a document deleting the signature and the email address hes hidden it away where nobodys likely to look for it and if anyone finds it they wont know who sent it mabbe scared of his mother or mathiesson getting into his computer when he ent around mumford scrolled up hang on heres another dear robbie youve made me cry i just wept when i read your mail those bastards you cant let them do these things to you you have to tell someone do you understand you could even tell the police never mind about your stepfather or whatever he is youve got to do something do you understand ill tell the police for you if you want i dont mind just do something love i take it all back merrily said you didnt say anything i thought it i thought you were making something out of nothing mumford scrolled up again no more emails we need to go through everything mrs watkins no matter how unpromising hes probably got stuff scattered all over the place merrily read the last one again obviously a girl a boy would never admit to crying its also someone close to his age because she talks about exams and if we assume the last one was sent first then hes replied to it obviously mumford said hes replied and deleted his reply from his own computer hes upset hes made her cry and so hes saying oh things ent that bad and hes told her something and hes sent her something thanks for sharing this with me whats that mean sounds like hes told her about some plan for getting away right mumford straightened up rubbing his hands im taking this computer home then im gonner come back tomorrow and talk to angela you agree i ent overreacting no youre not overreacting accident balls mumford said that boy killed hisself its starting to look more like it and if i mumford spun round as the garage door came up suddenly and violently like a car crash breath shot into merrilys throat and she toppled a box with her elbow spraying books across the floor she saw still figures in the gaping night silence except for a metallic chink there were four of them one in a hooded top had something like a dogchain doubled up and stretched between his fists and he kept pulling it tight letting it go snapping it tight chink departure lounge the claustrophobia in the departure lounge was so intense that jane had to go into the kitchen for a glass of water didnt like this at all any more dipping into the internet was sometimes like lowering yourself into hidden catacombs or potholing going down click click click one site dropping into a deeper site crawling through narrow tunnels until you found youd sunk so far that when you looked up the patch of light over your head had totally vanished and the air was too filthy to breathe of course she knew what this was too many bad experiences with confined underground places linked with death the cellar at chapel house the crypt of hereford cathedral it was close to phobic and she resented that but it still didnt mean she could handle it she filled a tumbler with sparkling water all she needed now was a bottle of oldfashioned aspirin to wash down twenty should do it right naw twenty is nowhere near enough karone the boatman from nevada had written for the benefit of dolores from wisconsin ya dont just wanna be sick jane had started with the new teenoriented searchengine i wanna which dealt mostly with shopping wannas shopping to topping yourself was quite a long and tortuous trip and meant circumnavigating all the agonyaunt sites that wanted to talk you out of it but she was getting better at this nearly as good as eirion now at knowing what to look for which was how shed wound up with the disgusting karone the boatman in the departure lounge welcome to the departure lounge take a seat you are among the best friends you have ever had perhaps your last good friends help yourself to a drink see our wine list left listen to some music see our selection right as you can see the departure lounge has two doors you may leave at any time through the door on the right or you may choose if invited to enter through the lefthand door into the inner lounge if invited it was confusing the walls of the departure lounge kept shrinking and expanding and the doors on both right and left would alternate from black to white and sometimes they were both grey this was technically quite a sophisticated site more sophisticated at least than some of the sickos who hung around in the virtual lounge like virtual pimps karone the boatman from nevada jane guessed hed taken his name from charon the boatman who ferried the dead across the styx in greek myths only hed never read any greek myths someone had probably just told him the name mispronouncing it and hed never even bothered to check it out she pictured some earnest humourless semiliterate burgermunching git in a sweaty baseball cap who was arrogant enough to imagine it was his mission in life to help other people end theirs karone kept printing up a link to his personal website on which jane had tentatively clicked thus learning how to make a foolproof noose shutting down the site at this point before slime could start oozing through the monitor she went back and perused the music selection some classical stuff and a few names jane hadnt heard of plus leonard cohens dress rehearsal rag which it said cohen had banned himself from singing was this a joke and a song called gloomy sunday which definitely was not a joke god gloomy sunday also known as the hungarian suicide song had been written and recorded in by rezso seress after breaking up with his girlfriend in the song she dies and he decides to follow her the actual girlfriend later killed herself leaving a note saying only gloomy sunday rezso seress himself jumped to his death from his apartment in jumped to his death jane found that shed whispered it she was starting not to like this she learned that the song had been banned by the bbc and other broadcasters because it had been linked to so many suicides some within the music business one of the more recent had been one by the scottish duo the associates whod recorded it in but the most sinister version remained the original which had recently been cleaned up it was said to promote nightmares depression and irrational fear in listeners but was not available for downloading on this particular site however the cleanedup version was not available in when gloomy sunday was covered by belladonna and the singer insisted that the crackles and scratches on the recording be scrupulously duplicated on her own version record company executives refused to include the belladonna version on the album the pervading dark for which it had been recorded after a spate of suicides including an assistant engineer a secretary and the singers former lover the session musician eric bryers who threw himself from high up in a block of flats in south london jane drank some water christ another one did mum know about this somehow she suspected not one theory was that the music was part of an occult ritual devised by seress for purposes unknown in which his girlfriend was expected to take part but the implications of it terrified her and this might have been linked to her suicide the words gloomy sunday were blinking at jane from the monitor uhhuh she drew back and clicked away the panel belladonna there were some artists whod been big in the s that it was still cool to kind of like elvis costello julian cope and xtc of course who would have been totally celestial if they hadnt stopped touring and been forced to compete against dreary synth bands but belladonna belladonna had embraced synthesizers her voice even sounded like it had been produced electronically thin and screechy with occasional pulses part of the machine belladonna was distant lacked any kind of intimacy but in its dismalasjanuary way the music did jane was forced to concede sometimes carry you away just not to anywhere she could imagine ever wanting to be carried actually she was being particularly wimpish tonight could be something to do with being alone in the vicarage she really should download belladonnas gloomy sunday it was almost certainly a scam that whole story sounded phoney on the other hand she was pretty sure the associates had existed the trouble with the net was that it was always very good at halftruth and conjecture jane clicked back to the music panel immediately gloomy sunday began to flash her hand hovered over the mouse mumford calmly put his glasses in their case tucked it down the inside pocket of his jacket he stood there turning his head slowly from face to shadowed face as if he was matching each one to a mugshot then he straightened up hands by his sides cleared his throat help you boys and merrily realized that they were boys mainly young teenagers plus the kid of eleven or so whod been here earlier the tallest and presumably the oldest of the teenagers peeled himself away from the others so whats happening dad he was about a head taller than mumford heard you was having a garage sale the beefy kid with the chain grinned from inside his hood like some kind of malevolent gnome he pulled the chain tight chink con the tall kid said will you put that fuckin thing away he looked mixedrace had prominent teeth a stud in the cleft of his chin his silky black jacket had zips everywhere like ridged operation scars sorry about my mate dad hes seen too many old videos dont apologize mumford said mildly just take him back to the home and well say no more about it good one dad so the tall kid with the zips looked around this is it then is it the official robson walsh closingdown sale everything must go yeah knew robbie did you we was only his very best mates dad we had some awesome laughs with robbie he turned to the others am i right the elevenyearold giggled the other small kid yellow fleece combat trousers watchful eyes looked down at his trainers you had some laughs mumfords voice was a thin taut line with robbie so like basically we thought wed like to buy something to remember him by not the books though the books are shite what kind of laughs you have with robbie see i was thinking that computer how much not for sale mumford said tell you what dad forty quid you ent listening son all right sixty you ent gonner get sixty for a secondhand computer that old are you the tall kid unzipped his jacket felt in a pocket of his jeans took out an amazingly dense wad of notes ok ill go seventy seventy quid hows that merrily saw that the boys had arranged themselves in a rough semicircle around mumford and her the width of the garage so that nobody was going to get past them lot of notes you got there jason mumfords face was set like cement his eyes steady on the tall kid been nicking little childrens dinner money again is it jason mumford knew him merrily kept quiet staying in the corner beside the workbench they were only boys after all the elevenyearold he could even be ten the other younger one maybe twelve or thirteen kept glancing nervously at the tall kid as if he was worried about where this was going merrily felt the heat of sweat on her forehead you talking to me the tall kid said is that my name dad ah well mumford reached up and unplugged the computer from a socket over the workbench the screen sighed and faded could be i made a mistake just you reminded me for a minute of jason mebus star of a whole stack of cctv nasties urinating in high town nicking big issues from a disabled man jasons just waiting for his seventeenth birthday he is so he can be in prison videos fuck are you the tall kid said he might as well have pinned on a lapel badge that said jason then again its a bit dark now mumford looked into the black screen so i mightve been mistaken and if you was all gone from yere fore i had a chance to get a good look good merrily breathed slowly that was sensible jason didnt move the gnome with the chain stifled a laugh merrily saw something dance into jasons eyes he reached out a hand laid it on mumfords shoulder you a cop dad take your hand off me boy mumford said mildly jasons grip tightened no come on dad are you a c mumford came round faster than merrily could have imagined had the boys arm down behind his back had him swinging round and rammed up smack hard against the side wall squashing his open mouth into one of its concrete blocks no for your information i ent mumfords forearm in the back of jasons neck which means i can do what i like to you ennit boy merrily saw a bloody imprint on the wall where jasons mouth had kissed it andy she came out of the corner if mumford had smashed this boys front teeth they were in trouble lets just you can start by explaining why you want the computer jason mumford said or mabbe who sent you in to get it for them and then and then merrily was dragged aside from behind and stumbled to her knees and saw across the bench that the boy in the yellow fleece had hold of the plug on the computer lead and had started to pull on it his face red with effort and a kind of panic in his eyes by the time she was back on her feet the dogchain was around mumfords throat the fat kid tugging on it from behind swinging on it both feet leaving the ground and mumfords eyes bulging out of his veined florid face the joy of death sadgirl ok it wasnt sophisticated but it was simple and it sounded vulnerable and inoffensive sadgirl hereford england it would do so sadgirl left a message in the departure lounge i lost my baby and i lost my fella im seventeen and i dont want to get any older dont want to do any of this again i listened to belladonna and shes given me the courage to do what i have to do i want to rest for ever with my child this is serious rest for ever with my child jane thought this was moving and resonant she felt better hiding behind sadgirl putting her own name in there would have been awful planting some part of herself in the electronic depths a suicide seed sadgirl was cyberbait it just needed someone to come through and harden the link between belladonna and suicide jane had a picture of the dragon lady lurking logged on from ludlow waiting to entrap damaged people which wasnt entirely ridiculous she instinctively didnt like this woman ok she hadnt even been born when belladonna was famous and she hated almost all s music on principle but it went beyond that now shed logged on to the belladonna websites surprised at how many there were mostly unofficial and they were all creep sites you had an immediate sense of something unhealthy sexually perverse and kind of slick and clammy like those things people put up to catch flies and the woman her music at least was sharing the same cyberspace as karone the boatman sultan of sickos maybe and the idea wasnt total fantasy because anything was possible in cyberspace and everyone was equal sadgirl could lure belladonna into the open she just needed to know more mum had not divulged enough to give her much of a handle and mum was out of reach which left lol it was useful not to say comforting to have lol just across the street jane stayed connected to the net and phoned him on her mobile lol said shes out with mumford at this time of night its not a date lol and like im sure that while a certain kind of woman wouldnt be able to resist that gruff monosyllabic im backing off all right lol said just because im across the road no i like you to be concerned about her its oldfashioned meanwhile what exactly is bothering you about belladonna just need a clearer picture of where she fits in like why is she in ludlow whats she doing there everybodys got to live somewhere jane its a very soughtafter place these days however apart from the fact that her stepdaughters in the area we really dont know but there is a definite connection between her and robbie walsh right seems that way however therefore if i was to firmly link her with jemmie pegler as well you havent got to be close mum says pegler was visiting suicide chatrooms and if theyre the ones ive just peered into theyre more or less recommending belladonna as like music to slash wrists by thats no surprise it doesnt mean shes authorized it she could have though it um sounds like youve been having an interesting night educational i tell you lol if i was ever contemplating an exit its the last place id go for help thats the idea isnt it ha ha no listen theres this guy who comes on like are you cool enough for it like do you have what it takes to be a statistic you can imagine people who are really really depressed and this creeps sneering at them like its a challenge are you hard enough to top yourself could be reverse psychology not that subtle its telling them that if they cant find the balls to do it they really will have failed you know out of interest which belladonna songs well she this is probably some kind of sick joke but shes supposed to have done a cover version of something gloomy sunday lol said with no hesitation the hungarian suicide song shit lol its fairly well known billie holliday did a version and survived for a while she didnt have a very nice life did you know that belladonna had recorded it no i didnt doesnt surprise me though see theres supposed to be an original version from that if you hear it ive heard that too not the song ive heard what its supposed to do the music business is full of ghost stories they only had the belladonna version on the departure lounge recommended listening list along with a leonard cohen song he apparently doesnt play any more and nick drakes fruit tree thats usually among the top ten suicide songs i didnt see that lol the hungarian guy who composed it and belladonnas exlover eric bryers you knew him i know people who i think did they both committed suicide by like throwing themselves off buildings did you know that its a popular method jane especially in ludlow apparently jane said jane lets not like i say belladonna might not even know theyre using her songs nah i think shes there i can feel her lurking like an evil presence and jemmie pegler was definitely into those sites lets not get carried away jane ok hey when did that ever happen lol was silent she could picture his expression you had any more anonymous letters lol you would tell me youd be the first to know i bet jane leaned into the computer screen hey somethings come up ill have to go jane you didnt listen to she cut the line this could be significant but how would she handle it if belladonna herself had left a message for sadgirl well it was possible but it was karone the boatman whod come back and he was not sympathetic sadgirl u r in the wrong room babe nobody here wants to know about ya problems come back when ya ready to do the thing the heartless bastard youd lost your baby got dumped by your guy and this scumbag jane started to laugh oh god she must really be overtired she finished the fizzy water thinking how it would be best for sadgirl to react now she knew how she wanted to react but that wouldnt achieve anything outside of personal satisfaction she switched off the desk lamp sat back in the chair and closed her eyes to think this out standing in the wreckage of robbie walshs tornoff life merrily lit a cigarette and smoked half of it and then threw it down on the concrete and stamped on it when she put a hand to her face it sent up a hot wire of pain afterwards her fingers were slicked with blood and water and mucus should mabbe see a doctor holding his head at an angle mumford bent and picked up a cardboard box books were scattered all around oil soaking into the pages the turquoise baseball cap crushed flat shouldntve let you come mrs watkins shouldve realized what about you for gods sake merrily could see the flush on his neck a glaze of blood where the chain had bitten im fine oh sure thats why your voice is like a penny whistle someones trodden on she tried for a laugh but she was still too shaken the scene replaying itself from when shed thrown herself at the fat kid trying to get a grip on his gelled hair at the same time aware of the kid in the yellow fleece pulling the computer by its cord towards the edge of the bench she remembered seeing mumford turning into the chain his hand crabbed across the face of the fat boy thrusting him away merrily feeling grateful that hed found the strength until at the same time as the computer hit the concrete the boys elbow had pistoned back into her face sitting on the floor semistunned shed heard one of the younger kids crying out car coming and been aware of jason mebus lurching away eyes flashing hate at mumford blood from his mouth forming twin channels either side of the stud in his chin in the next memoryframe there was just her and mumford amid the wreckage he stood over the computer for a moment before lifting it back on the bench where it sat lopsided looking like a badly fractured skull andy we have to tell the police he laughed andy come on blood on the wall you halfgarrotted god knows what i look like were supposed to just walk away mumford sighed mrs watkins you know how these things work they appear in court in their school uniforms hair all neatly brushed look real scared and helpless ones got a missing front tooth they got mr ryan nye representing them on legal aid making references to my mental state following the death of my nephew who these boys will deny they ever met and then my mother i need to paint you a picture suppose i phone bliss at home his expression was enough to shut her up he put out a hand and tipped the computer lightly something inside it collapsed got what they wanted then she remembered jason mebus on his way out putting in two vicious hacking kicks splintering the back of the computer probably wont fetch much at the car boot sale now andy no what are you going to tell your sister mumford bent down picked up robbies baseball cap not a thing sorry merrily had found a tissue in her coat pocket she brought it cautiously to her face winced looked up at him through one eye is there something here im not understanding i was thinking at first it was the boy told the others we were yere mumford said but then im thinking wouldnt ange stay with us wouldnt you stay with somebody wanted to mess with your dead boys stuff make sure they didnt find anything you didnt want found what are you saying she had a full view of his throat now red and purple and swollen and lacerated at least his wife was a nurse funny ange ent come back ennit he said funny we ent seen nothing at all of her feller mathiesson you think they put those kids could be they all had reasons for making sure we never got to see what was on that computer the kids too mumfords eyes were pale and hard tells us why robbie was afraid to come back from his grans mabbe we was his best mates dad we had some laughs with robbie as someone trained always to see the best in people i confess to having a problem with those kids merrily admitted lets not dress this up mrs watkins mumford said they killed him as good as and she was in no position to dismiss it when they left stepping under the door into the dark and the damp she noticed mumford stuffing the crushed turquoise baseball cap into his jacket pocket then he picked up the computer long shot he said but its possible the hard disk might not be totally destroyed jane woke up so suddenly that merrily had to hold on to the chair to stop it tipping over sorry she held on to the kids shoulders i didnt realize you were the scullery was lit only by the computer merrily felt shed had about enough of computers for one night she had to have a bath she felt exhausted and aching and soiled and useless why havent you gone to bed whereve you been how long have you she saw what was on the screen you fell asleep online oh shit listen its been twenty minutes max anyway it doesnt cost much at night forget it its my fault merrily switched on the anglepoise lamp and turned off the computer i shouldve rung except i thought if youd gone to bed dont look at me like that things were difficult i realize its unlikely im looking my best shit jane breathed jane things really were bloody difficult werent they im ok ill tell you about it in the morning in confidence so like did mumford do that huh was it mumford gave you the black eye what merrily stumbled out of the study through the kitchen to the mirror in the hall slapping lights on from the framed print holmanhunts jesus christ regarded her with sorrow and pity and eternal understanding oh shit merrily said when she came back to the study holding a cold sponge to her eye the computer was back on and jane was in front of it didnt even turn round to reinspect the injury mum take a look at this you know what time it is yeah yeah listen the suicide chatrooms ok i got into this one and it seemed to be just like crap there was this guy in nevada and anyway i logged on under a false name sadgirl merrily leaned over the desk thats you and belladonna was there or least her music was but lol said somebody might have just ripped that off and there was a song she covered a famous suicide song where lots of people connected with it topped themselves it was hungarian originally composed in merrily dabbed at the eye wishing now that she hadnt brought jane into this sounds a bit tenuous except belladonnas boyfriend also committed suicide just like the original composer by get this jumping off a high building well thats its tragic and everything but its not exactly an uncommon method yeah well i was trying to find a stronger connection i dropped in the name belladonna and got a nasty reply from this bastard karone which is what he seems to specialize in and then this mustve come in while i was asleep right ok let me see merrily eased jane away from the screen sneery message from someone called karone the boatman and then someone called dolores had written sadgirl you have to understand karone is a technical adviser and inclined to be abrupt i think what hes saying is you need to go back and think things out this is the biggest thing you have ever done or will ever do i myself know because of my condition that im going to have to do this thing sometime and all that is important to me is that when the time comes i do it efficiently and quickly and without leaving an unsightly mess for my folks to clear up you sound like your problems are emotional and i beg you to go away and think again because it will surely pass sorry thats not the one jane scrolled down i feel really bad about dolores shes obviously got something really horrible wrong with her she put a forefinger on the screen this one revenant sadgirl belladonna understands death is eternal life without pain know that we must make our own eternity old ludlow canon callaghanclarke is looking for you sophie said without glancing up shes rung here twice already claiming your answering machine isnt switched on cant believe how inefficient i am sometimes merrily dumped her bag on the desk pulled out the chair opposite sophie who was addressing an envelope by hand with a fountain pen glasses on the tip of her nose sophie put the envelope in a tray for the ink to dry and started on another theyd talked on the phone soon after nine when jane cleareyed and superficially undamaged by minimal sleep had carried off a slice of toast and marmalade to the bus stop merrily had told jane a certain amount not everything about last night shed told sophie because there were probably confessionals less secure than this office the whole situation more or less oh yes sophie said on the filing cabinet this mornings daily mail oh the paper was folded at page five and a fuzzy picture of jemima pegler at a party collapsed in laughter with two other girls holding her up the circumstances of her death had come to light too late for yesterdays morning papers to indulge in more than straight reporting what a difference a day made on the other side of the page from jemima was a line drawing of a woman in a medieval robe and headdress a leap across time eight centuries separated them but now jemima pegler and marion de la bruyère are united in tragic death obvious the media would discover marion and nobody waited for an inquest any more the police line no suspicious circumstances was a strong enough pointer to suicide the story said jemimas death had the hallmarks of a copycat suicide but who was she copying robbie walsh or the deathplunge of the twelfthcentury woman whose ghost was said to haunt the castle the story is certainly well known in ludlow according to jonathan scole who runs ghostours which organizes lectures and guided walks around the towns haunted buildings our tours are getting increasingly popular and this poor kid may well have come to one we do occasionally get groups of teenage girls marion is a very romantic figure and one of the highlights of the tour is gathering under the castle wall at the precise spot where she fell its intended to be pure entertainment and im afraid i do tend to ham it up a bit naturally it horrifies me that the story could have had this kind of impact on someone but i doubt it did if wed had a multistorey car park its quite possible she would have jumped off that i think if someones determined to die theyre going to do it somehow arent they but an experienced psychiatrist who is studying the ludlow deaths said that a second fatal fall at the castle was disturbing because it indicated the formation of a behavioural pattern saltash he does seem to be cornering the market in what one might call soundbite psychology sophie said he might be right actually the teenage packmentality the need to feel that even in death youre not alone anyway someone has to be around to do the psychobabble how far have you read sophie murmured what and teenage girls are particularly susceptible to the fantasy world of ghosts and the supernatural as an escape from the ordered world of school and the prospect of exams said dr saltash who is also a special adviser on mental health to the diocese of hereford which includes ludlow special adviser on mental merrily let the paper drop to the desk you notice he doesnt neglect an opportunity to file psychic phenomena under the general heading of fantasy sophie said thus detaching it from the churchs official area of belief this isnt going to stop is it merrily slumped down next to the window it wasnt warm out there but there was enough earlyafternoon sunshine for a few people on broad street to be wearing dark glasses she took hers off just as the phone rang and sophie looked up ah sophies hand froze over the receiver i thought there might be some minor aspect of last night that you hadnt mentioned impressive isnt it merrily tilted her head to the window the sunlight hurt purplish last night now a delicate bottle green what are you putting on it sophie picked up the phone just the glasses gatehouse sophie tucked the phone between shoulder and chin just above the pearls leafing through her letters yes bishop im doing them now theyll be in the lunchtime post certainly well yes shes here now as a matter of fact i will sophie put down the phone hes coming over later he wants to talk to you merrily had started to roll up the daily mail into a stiff tight tube she stopped sensing the change and saw that sophies face had hardened and darkened in a way that just didnt happen god almighty merrily what the hell are you getting into it was ok it wasnt exactly an accident but it you do know thats whats known as assault causing actual bodily harm what did they do to mumford some merrily let the paper unroll shaking her head helplessly some damage nothing serious we hope before leaving home shed talked on the phone to mumfords wife gail whod sounded cold and guarded saying mumford could hardly turn his head this morning hardly the first time hed brought injuries home but that was supposed to be all over now wasnt it sophie wasnt letting it go either did he even think about what might happen to you last night when he took on these savages i dont suppose he did merrily reached for her bag a woman with a painful black eye was allowed a cigarette with hindsight i think he was quite happy when they invaded the garage he was on home ground recognized one can we at least assume this will bring him to his senses sophie we both know its going to make him worse blokes like mumford the bagcarriers the localknowledge men the stoical taciturn imperturbable downbeat lowkey saltoftheearth types when those guys started to come apart it was like landmines you were never sure where the next one was going to explode we now have or we had last night its destroyed now evidence that robbie walsh was scared to go home to plascarreg we have it from his email correspondence also his letters to we also know he fantasized about marion de la bruyère saw her as some kind of a confidante and wrote to her the postcard shed seen next to robbies sketches was now making perfect heartbreaking sense sometimes i pretend you are walking next to me and we are holding hands and its brilliant everything is all right again and i never want to leave cos this is our place i was so miserable i didnt think i could stand it till the end of term its worse than ever there i hate them they are stupid and ignorant and they are trying to wreck my whole life the nearer it gets to the end of the holidays the sadder i feel and dont want to go back if theres anything that makes me feel a very unchristian hatred its bullying from cruelty to animals to merrily drew in too much smoke suppressed a cough as colliding clouds sucked a sunbeam from the desk between her and sophie we even know who some of them are now they as good as admitted it but bullyings not quite a crime and neithers suicide any more three people dead and none of them crimes doesnt make them any less dead this woman sophie said mrs pepper i dont know what to think about that any more soph shes a woman who makes mournful music evidently chosen as a suicide soundtrack by people who run unsavoury websites and chatrooms theres undoubtedly a cult or cults of suicide operating on the internet if she is into all that and she talked to robbie walsh as we know she did and he was suicidal is it remotely conceivable that she would actually have encouraged him to jump off that tower i mean i hate bullying but i can understand the spiritual vacuum it comes out of but this there are internet sites that are actually urging people to take their own lives thats the implication according to jane and chatrooms bit like the samaritans in reverse isnt it sophies expression didnt alter sophie was a samaritan merrily if you think this woman might be connected with one of these organizations its surely our duty to expose it in what capacity its not a deliverance issue is it isnt the woman fascinated by ghosts that isnt in itself a deliverance issue either anyway if i follow agreed procedure and consult the deliverance panel are they going to let me get within ten miles of mrs pepper mumfords already been warned off by annie howe with whom siân callaghanclarke says she gets on well probably attend the same kickboxing classes this is a mess merrily sophie folded her reading glasses snapped them in their case everything seems to be a mess at the moment the bishop arrived before lunch he looked pensive he sat on the edge of sophies desk picked up a pen and kept tapping its top into the palm of his left hand george lackland merrily you havent met him have you mayor of ludlow she had her sunglasses back on vicechairman of the police committee thats the one he unbuttoned his jacket and his purple shirt strained over his stomach longstanding county councillor magistrate george is the epitome of old ludlow and your old friend yes an honourable man conservative in every conceivable sense of the word of course retails traditional furniture as distinct from socalled antiques he sounds very influential merrily said the bishop looked pained i realize that to you attaining power and influence means being as bent as as a crozier thank you merrily im all too conscious of the opportunities for personal gain afforded to an unscrupulous bishop but some of us do our best and so does george lackland sorry bernie anyway hes been in touch called me last night and we spoke again this morning as you can imagine george is very concerned as are many people in the town about these deaths at the castle everything that happens in ludlow he takes personally always has its that kind of town people feel privileged to belong to it mmm that part of the castle the hanging tower has now been closed to the public for obvious reasons but already sightseers have been turning up on the other side of the wall where this girl fell cant do anything about that its a public right of way what sort of people young people mainly a group of them were observed last night theyd gathered with candles singing and chanting theres an old yew tree they were clustered around it near where she fell jemima and ah the other one robbie marion the bishop said why would they gather there bernie would you expect a coherent reason everything seems to become a shrine these days well perhaps if they knew the full facts theyd find it less romantic thered been nothing in the mail or anywhere else presumably about the heroin overdose theyll draw their own conclusions anyway as some people in the town are now doing the pen was going taptap on the bishops palm again agitation you see george lacklands always been a man of the church senior churchwarden until his civic duties became too onerous seen by many of the older residents as something of a figurehead and not only in a temporal sense especially with david cook still in convalescence so george has been approached oh dont look at me like that its how things are done there people worried about the towns reputation have made approaches tourist association well yes but also church people all kinds not just us the rc church various nonconformist chapels individuals who fear for the spiritual health of the community people who might feel happier talking to the mayor than to each other and what are they saying hinting would be a safer word no more than whispers undercurrents mmm youre not getting me to say it merrily some people are suggesting that the recent spate of tragedy is somehow rooted in whatever happened on the same site over eight hundred years ago ah the bishop cleared his throat uncomfortable i dont imagine anyones expressed it with that degree of exactitude rumours trickle through the streets about a place becoming unlucky and they gather momentum even when i was there youd get people saying the town was becoming ungodly selling out to mammon new restaurants rich incomers how does that relate to two teenagers and an elderly woman well it that is george says some people were suggesting the walsh boy had become a little too obsessed with the past aspects of the past that is that should be left to ah has he seen the papers this morning for once it seems the papers are only echoing whats already been whispered itll die down in the press probably before the weeks out the media always treat these stories as a joke not in the town however things will be blamed on it that have no connection whatsoever so whats the mayor want a meeting hes asked me to go and see him tonight ive told him id like to bring someone with me who knows more about the elements being ah hinted at are you free tonight merrily i could be good excellent right then merrily said so do you want me or sophie to inform the deliverance panel the bishop looked blank procedure merrily said all possible cases must be referred to the panel for assessment before any action is taken who decided that the panel well i think the bishop stopped tapping and closed his hand around the pen that we ought to regard this as a preliminary and essentially informal discussion dont you if thats what you think bishop oh yes i do he placed the pen carefully on the desk i your eyes merrily is there something wrong with your eyes or are you trying to look sinister tradition the mayor closed his heavy front door and they stepped into a hall that was creampanelled and bright with shards of crystal light from an electric chandelier through merrilys new glasses it glowed amber and pink like a rose garden at sunset this is the reverend mrs merrily watkins the bishop said merrily is my ah deliverance consultant oh yes the mayor shook hands stiffly he wore a midbrown threepiece suit with a watch chain and you didnt come across many of those any more i see he obviously didnt see at all you could be close to the church your whole life without being aware of what went on in the crypt bernie dunmore didnt explain merrily felt he was still faintly embarrassed even in ludlow about perpetuating a tradition as medieval as hers come on through bernard the mayor said lets sit down in the drawing room and hope to discuss all this in a civilized manner george lacklands home was above and behind lackland modern furnishings midway down corve street the corve was the more modest of ludlows two rivers and this ancient street sloped steeply down from the town centre to meet it the shops here didnt look like shops at night most were fabricated inside historic buildings and the owners hadnt been allowed to enlarge windows or put up new signs much of corve street was frozen in various eras all of them preneon even the mayor looked like part of the façade his forehead jutted like a mantelpiece over the deepset embers of his eyes he looked more like a bishop than the bishop nancy sends her apologies bernard meeting of the festival committee some very big names coming to town this year you mean the few who dont live here already bernie said he was still in his episcopal purple shirt hed told merrily that george would expect this she followed the mayor down the hall to his drawing room unbuttoning her black cardigan so that the dog collar was fully on view she wasnt insecure about the womens priesthood any more but he might be this is nice she said well it probably had been once the room was lodged in the era when cream leather threepiece suites were cool and carpets were always fully fitted because bare floorboards were a sign of penury there was a high ceiling with mouldings and another crystal chandelier french windows revealed a moonbathed sunken garden and that really was nice yes were fortunate if thats the word to have quite a number of famous folk living here now georges voice had an old ludlow roll shropshire easing into hereford we seem to have become a bit of a refuge from london actors television personalities political people singers merrily said aye singers too the mayor put on a cautious smile showing merrily to a chair near the hearth where a logeffect gas fire fanned out tame flames he opened a drinks cabinet glancing towards the french window perhaps by daylight youd be able to see the castle ruins from here then he looked back with uncertainty at merrily im sorry mrs watkins what exactly was it that you said you did i dont fully perhaps bernie coughed sweat had pooled in the centre of his expanding malepattern tonsure perhaps i ought to explain george that deliverance consultant is the modern term for what we used to call diocesan exorcist a silent moment flames flickering emptily among the artificial logs conscious of what the bishop had said about her looking sinister merrily had dived into chave and jackson on broad street and picked up this pair of lessdark glasses that might even be taken as ordinary tinted spectacles on the outside the glasses looked light brown but they turned these flames bright red like a miniature synthesis of hell merrilys our adviser on the paranormal bernie sank into the leather sofa that is the person who advises people who believe theyre having problems with what we loosely refer to george as the unquiet dead there hed said it his hands came together in his lap as the cushions broke wind with a soft hiss this young woman george said oh dear and then he changed the subject and went to get them drinks merrily saw against a far wall an elderly radiogram polished mahogany case with gilded fabric over the speakers she could imagine the records nothing later than elvis she sipped her tonic water mr mayor is there any history of disturbance unrest around the hanging tower it had taken half an hour to get to this point via the new restaurants a good thing in general better than nightclubs the new tescos there was demand for it and it could have been worse long as it didnt put the traditional butchers out of business and the new people the new people well they had money which they spent in the new shops buying the sort of old rubbish that george and nancy not so long ago used to throw out but at least the new people appreciated the town sometimes too much disturbance the mayor said you mean these young people dancing around no merrily looked at the bishop i mean paranormal phenomena of what nature the bishop avoided her gaze and said quickly merrily knows about the breathing the gasping sounds alleged alleged huh when i realized i was actually cringing into the stones like a cornered animal i threw out a prayer like a sort of yelp george lackland came to sit down opposite merrily a leathertopped coffee table between them with a hardbacked looseleaf file on it look he said theres always been stories you expect it dont you in an old place different stories all over the town catherine of aragons been seen some say theres an old woman who walks through the churchyard thats a regular one but marion aye shes probably the oldest the breathing like someone in a deep sleep quite a few folk reckon they heard that nobodys said they seen her lately mind not in years people used to merrily said the bishops chin was sunk into his chest the white lady the mayor said marion of the heath walked the ruins and the path around the walls and people who used to live in the flats at castle house used to talk about strange noises and what do you call it when things misbehave poltergeist phenomena aye but like i say nothing about that lately although somebody did blabber on about strange lights round the old yew tree year or two back what kind of lights hovering lights the mayor made a ball shape between his hands orbs of lights routine stuff lowkey energyfluctuation the mayors eyes narrowed what are you looking for exactly im not looking for anything that isnt there at some level merrily said its just that what youve told me doesnt sound as if its particularly bothering anyone i dont know what you mean you see we dont consider it our function to investigate all inexplicable phenomena just because theyre there we like to think that were here to try and help people who are frightened or upset by whats happening to them well george lackland leaned towards her top and bottom of it is if you dont mind me saying so mrs watkins that a great many people have been very gravely upset by these deaths folks remember mrs mumford in the shop and they were fond of that boy too walked into my shop one day asked if he could look at the old fireplace in the back and the cellar very polite very knowledgeable all the little tearaways as breaks your windows and writes on your walls and the one who falls to his death has to be the decent one he didnt fall from the hanging tower though he was the start of it the start of something the mayor looked into her eyes maybe he could see the discoloration through the glasses see i truly love this old town mrs watkins were not from here my familys roots are in east anglia but weve been here nigh on two centuries wool merchants originally that sounds pretty local to me mr mayor were settled but we dont feel we own it been selling furniture here for over seventy years real furniture hardwood none of your strippedpine rubbish we believe in solidness and quality what this town always stood for solidness we can be relaxed about the sideeffects of the tourism and the new people because weve got a solid heart and the church the church has always played an essential role here and still does george turned away staring fiercely into the gas flames what about the owners of the castle bernie said what do they have to say about all this he turned to merrily the earls of powis the herberts have owned the castle for many generations edward herbert was mp for ludlow in the early nineteenth century prior to inheriting the earldom bit of a silence so far the mayor said apart from taking the obvious steps to ensure it dont happen again plans to get that window barred that kind of measure its a question of what other steps might be taken on what youd call a spiritual basis wed have to go carefully george bernie took a hurried sip from his brandy balloon let me put it to you directly merrily said do you personally really believe that the two deaths at the castle are in some way connected with a paranormal presence dating back to the twelfth century george lackland grimaced at the stupidity of the question top and bottom of it is it dont matter what i believe mrs watkins im the mayor my role is to go along with the will of the people and among the older residents theres a strong sense that somethings very wrong very bad is there a history of suicide here well obviously i mean in the rather lengthy period between the twelfth century and a few weeks ago the mayor didnt reply bernie dunmore shot a warning look at merrily to which she didnt respond i mean what actually happened do you think to make two teenagers take she bit off the sentence no suggestion of suicide in robbies case although after last night lose their lives in a place that had been the scene of just one suicide over eight hundred years ago george lackland looked at the bishop am i supposed to be able to answer that george i think what merrilys saying is that we have levels of response perhaps in the old days the lets get the word into the open the rite of exorcism was enacted without many preliminaries today with the ah levels of bureaucracy within the church is this lady going to help us bernard or not of course she is the bishop said help us merrily had the sense of being woven into someones fabric it was time to tease out george lacklands agenda this was the man to whom the traders and tourist operators had gone when mumford had started questioning them about belladonna this was the man who as vicechairman of the police committee had leaned on the head of shrewsbury cid who in turn had contacted annie howe to get mumford warned off right she took a sip of tonic erm the strange people gathering around this yew tree below the hanging tower with their candles and their chanting who are they mr mayor do you know not local as if this was all that needed to be said about them what did they look like oh stupid horrorfilm clothes you know the kind of thing what i heard merrily said was that thered been quite a few of them around the town recently possibly before the deaths the mayor spread his hands its possible we get all sorts comes and goes and there was a bit of a fight with some local boys more of that than there used to be regrettably street violence too much drink about and someone got stabbed first ive heard of that mrs watkins but shed seen the twitch of a nerve at the corner of an eye perhaps people like this were attracted here by the ghost stories i wouldnt know about that he smiled apologetically and shook his bony head to be honest i feel a little bit daft sitting here in this day and age talking about ghosties and ghoulies and things that goes bump oh i get used to it merrily said but the thing is before we can organize any kind of remedial action we have to eliminate all the possible rational explanations for instance somebody told me that these kids in fancy dress are probably just fans of one of your rich settlers a singer george lackland said nothing nothing twitched this time but she was sure that she saw a quick glitter of anguish in the hollows of his eyes and he planted levering hands on his thighs as if his instinct was to walk out cant remember her name used to sing these mournful songs all about death and and things like that merrily smiled ruefully at george not your cup of tea really i suppose the flameeffect gas fire gasped the bishops brandy glass chinked on an arm of the sofa as he sat up and she felt his curiosity uncurling in the air no the mayor said at last not my cup of tea at all he came to his feet screwing his eyes shut for a moment and swaying slightly rubbing a hand wearily over the back of his neck ah thats the trouble with public life he said always some malcontent ready to shoot his mouth off something here you should be telling us george the bishop said stepmother the bishops gaze swivelled back to merrily and in it was incomprehension and suspicion well she could understand it the hourlong journey here had been filled with an explanation of her bruised eye and everything that had led up to it jemmies sordid emails mumford and robbies computer and the history books and jason mebus not reaching the departure lounge until they were leaving the bypass at the sheet lane entrance into town with the moist blue night dropping over ludlow like the lid on a jewel box and so not quite getting around to belladonna ive got nothing to hide about this george lackland said nobody could possibly expect me to like the woman he was standing up now behind his cream leather chair both hands gripping its wings one of the bulbs in the chandelier had blown and was hanging there like a bad tooth making the room seem just slightly tawdry when the boy came home with this girl susannah she was everything youd want for your son respectable steady nicely spoken and a solicitor too of course always useful to have a solicitor in the family especially with a firm like smith sebald and partners merrily glanced at bernie both eyebrows raised to convey that she had no idea what the hell the mayor was talking about sorry george bernie said im a bit out of touch which boy is this douglas or ah stephen the younger one the one who went to university like nancy said when you think of the girls he might have brought home from that place hes ah engaged is he to this girl from smith sebald as i say very well established firm as you know offices in ludlow bridgenorth and church stretton shell be a partner one day bernard no question of that im sorry george who exactly are we talking about susannah the mayor said susannah pepper ah merrily said of course bloody hell your future daughterinlaw her father would be a record producer called saul pepper the mayor looked at her with keen interest thats quite correct mrs watkins but how could you i have a friend in the music business i gather saul pepper lives and works in america now since the breakup of his marriage to mrs pepper she turned to bernie who lives in the renovated farmhouse at the bottom of the linney and was seen in the castle with the mayors hands tightened on the chair wings and then he turned away merrily could tell that getting the story out of him was going to be like dredging a pond a lot of discoloured water and sludge and the bottom never quite exposed but enough had now been clarified particularly the warningoff of andy mumford to make the exercise well worthwhile no matter how long it took they were engaged before you met her mother then merrily said george spun round stepmother of course but yes you put your finger on it there all right mrs watkins we had not met her before the engagement george do excuse me bernie said but my own knowledge of the ah the stepmother is somewhat scant aye and if my knowledge was as scant as yours bernard george said id count myself a happy man of course when susannah pepper had told them her stepmother was coming to stay george hadnt known who this woman was let alone why she was considered notorious he knew that sues mother had been deserted by her father for the woman whom hed proceeded to marry it hadnt lasted however and hed moved to america starting a new family over there well out of it as george now realized although the divorce had been amicable she has considerable assets bernard could probably buy my business twice over susannahs her solicitor and financial adviser and nursemaid now and by god she needs one day and night particularly at night merrily said nothing let this come out in its own way whenever they needed to discuss her financial affairs susannah used to travel to her stepmothers home the mayor said wherever it happened to be at the time she moved around a lot london one year paris or rome the next and then she came to ludlow well that first visit of the stepmother george didnt think much of it not an event he was ever going to keep giltframed in the formal gallery of his memory and nothing particularly amiss at first they werent contemporaries george and bell not by ten or more years yet for that first meeting shed been dressed decently and conservatively if a little eccentrically in an edwardiantype summer dress her blonde hair neatly styled nancy had noted quite girlish rather attractive and clearly besotted with the town from the start george should have spotted the danger signs the woman tripping and gliding around the buttercross this delighted smile on her face upturned to the sun and then breaking into almost a dance he was quite gratified at first in his proprietorial way not having any idea then that she was already planning to stay for good george looked at the bishop do you know that she tried to get one of the flats at castle house was she eligible bernie turned to merrily we mentioned this earlier there was a large house built onto the outer walls in i think the nineteenth century later turned into council flats would you believe not quite sure what the situation is at present there was a couple living there halfway through a fortyfiveyear lease george said and she tried to take it over she was besotted with the idea of living inside the castle i think she thought if she could get that apartment shed soon have the whole house maybe feel like she owned the castle who can say what happened george oh the powis estate managed to stop it they have other plans for castle house but she has money my god she has the people she tried to bribe fortunately the earl of powis is a man of strong christian principles and i reckon he saw the danger eventually she settled on the weir house so called i dont know what she gave for it but the people who rebuilt it seemed to have been well satisfied as for bell hold on a minute would you george went over to a long mahogany sideboard opened a drawer took out a slim box file brought it back and emptied out the contents in front of merrily as if he was putting all his cards on the table this is one from the south shropshire journal he spread out a photocopy of a press cutting ludlow is my heaven says rock diva bell in the colour photo belladonna sat on the steps of the buttercross in a filmy cream dress arms folded she looked graceful and calm and strangely demure shell only ever speak to the local papers george said reckons this towns her whole world now and nothing outside it matters oh they all had a go when she first moved here national papers television none of them got close dont suppose they tried too hard merrily said she isnt as famous as she used to be if they all knew what i knew mrs watkins george said shed be in every paper there is thats the top and bottom of it and are you ever going to tell us george the bishop sat cradling his brandy balloon with its last quarterinch of spirit merrilys not exactly one of the little sisters of the assumption shes been around you know thanks very much bernie george knows what i mean whats ironic george said is that shes become a bit of a heroine to many people here specially the new folk the welloff folk ever a bit of timely cash needed to conserve some historic building shes in there with her chequebook made plans apparently for her own trust fund to protect the old places and then there was the housing business you remember the development plan for the weircroft fields bernard the bishop shook his head after i left here i imagine owner of a couple of rough fields not far from the weir house bit of a wide boy you ask me had the look of a gypsy he was trying to get planning permission to put houses on them and there was a fiftyfifty chance hed get it too eventually down by the river the bishop said surely not under the castle walls near enough council opposed it and so did all the residents nearby naturally but the way this government is on housing now build more and more ignore the green belts chances are hed have won on appeal especially as he was promising more than the usual quota of lowcost homes which are hard to get in ludlow now then she made him an offer for the land did she indeed and a very meaningful offer it was too but he had to decide now now or never well he couldnt afford to risk it and so she bought the ground and declared it preserved and now none of her neighbours will have a word said against her because if she moves that grounds gonner be up for grabs again so all the folk in that vicinity from upper linney to stanton lacy turns a blind eye and a deaf ear to what george to a good deal more than rumour but ive never been one for gossip bernard you know that erm merrily thought that one day she might meet someone who actually admitted to relishing tittletattle she walks the streets right at night with a candle sometimes george lackland folded his arms and sucked in his lips like a ghost merrily said george dropped his arms like a whore oh really george the bishop said you were here long enough bernard you know whats what the prostitutes in this town they knows their place and you will agree that place is not for instance st leonards graveyard oh come now we manage to keep it all under wraps one way or another the police well if shes broken the law its not much compared with what else they have to handle nowadays can a woman be done for indecent exposure minor theft im sorry merrily said what she stole a prayer book from st laurences maybe other things too but someone saw her put the prayer book in her bag and walk out and there was more but we couldnt tell david cook with the state of his health more of what in particular we didnt exactly hold on to the evidence merrily waited bernie dunmore took a precautionary sip of brandy what she left in the church george spoke tightly as if his throat was closing up back of one of the misericords well you dont keep articles like that perhaps im somewhat naive the bishop said corey house in broad street bernard the decorators architectural interior designers and restorers i believe they call themselves now decorators george said the son callum he went to finish off a wall for her at the weir house had some very peculiar requests made of him his fathers on the town council and he had a word with me theyre newcomers but theyre a decent family thought i should know what were the requests merrily asked but george shook his head in a shuddery kind of way and theres the parties the young people the singing what kind of singing i only use that word out of politeness george said sounds like a tribe of tomcats youve heard it just the once i was advised to walk down the linney and have a listen there was something resembling a song but i couldnt distinguish the words i think it was her and some other people possibly the ones who gathered under the hanging tower after the girls death aye the neighbours they look the other way some of the local boys are less tolerant specially when they come out the pubs was it one of these local boys who was stabbed that time merrily asked george took a long breath said nothing but nobody was charged right perhaps somebody was persuaded not to make a complaint probably wasnt serious george said quietly as a leading member of the police authority merrily said i suppose its a bit difficult for you the mayors eyes flared with anger like coals far back in an old kitchen range merrily came back quickly before he could clam up again did you know that mrs pepper had been seen with robbie walsh not long before he died well of course i knew she was seen all over the town with him in the church the path by the yews as leads down to the back entrance of the bull the old alleyways do you know what brought them together no but then ive not had what youd call lengthy conversations with her wisest not to do you have any idea at all why she does the things she does george didnt reply he began scratching at the back of his hand as if hed been stung youve evidently been covering up for her george bernie said for quite some time it sounds like for ah susannahs sake and stephens naturally the mayor went to the french windows and pulled a cord to draw the velvet curtains stood with his back to the dusty pink folds as if he was keeping something out and the good of the town of course bernie said slyly shes a sick woman shes george lackland reached up and pulled the curtains together at the top where one had slipped off its glider and merrily thought she heard him say evil but couldnt be sure he turned around pressure of wondering what shes gonner do next is getting to me a bit have to say that top and bottom of it is i wish shed never come and i wish she was gone i might be slightly off course here the bishop said but it seems to me that all your problems might conceivably be part of the same one do you think george lackland didnt reply and you cant involve the council george and you cant involve the police therefore i suppose thats why were here maybe i just wanted to talk to somebody who knew the town and could see the picture the mayor said even if they thought there wasnt anything they could do at least theyd understand a few things some things are not easily understood likely i used the wrong word im not an educated man as you know but theres areas of areas of experience where education dont help that much the curtains were swaying a little in a draught from somewhere george lackland watched them with a faint smile i remember a young chap thought he was up for a bit of easy money just spend a couple of hours on his own in the hanging tower oh now george that was a long long time never seen a man more scared from that day to this comes running across the old inner bailey stumbling and tripping didnt think his pals could see him and they didnt like to rub it in at the time what didnt want you trying to escape bernard so we took a few bottles of pale ale into the old magdalene chapel and kept very quiet sobering though in the end we all thought you were faking it at first merrily smiled the bishop saw her and scowled bastards he finished his brandy all right george suppose someone was to look into it all of it discreetly someone sympathetic but ah knowledgeable in all the necessary areas and of course utterly reliable then i would be most grateful to that person george lackland said and provide what assistance i could down by the fake logs merrily froze duality the road to hereford was due south more than twenty moonwashed miles for the first three or four neither of them said a word merrilys black eye was pulsing her new sunglasses lay on the dash somewhere behind its facia the old volvo was ticking like a time bomb eventually the bishop coughed motherinlaw from hell eh well stepmotherinlaw merrily glanced to her left moonlight bathing the bishops brow at the little chef at wooferton the lights had gone out what have you done bernie i think the word evil passed old georges lips at one point but im afraid he had his back to me at the time and that justifies it does it we have nothing to justify merrily not yet its all quite legitimate so youll send an official memo to the deliverance panel first thing in the morning saying youre personally authorizing me to investigate a cluster of deaths and their possible connection with a woman whos causing considerable embarrassment to the mayor of ludlow we can deal with that the bishop said and surely you want to dont you i think id want to know why im doing whatever im supposed to be doing i mean lets establish first of all what your longtime friend the mayor is after for instance when he was close to advocating exorcism which woman do you think he was talking about the dead one or that duality again it had been there from the start why did god let her take him why did god let that woman take our boy look i had no idea the bishop said i didnt know there was any connection between george and this woman until that chap who makes calendars brought her up id never even heard of her because bloody george is using his position to hush it all up hes already had andy mumford warned off plus a guy who was stabbed in the street has probably been given a bung to keep quiet about it you dont know that ha i mean sure i can see the mayors problem shes landed like an alien being from a world he cant even comprehend but theres no way i want to appear to be working on behalf of someone who works the system like good old george merrily he hadnt even mentioned mrs pepper it was you who introduced the subject you think you know what bernie i think he was talking about her all along from the beginning i think shes whats causing unrest among the older godfearing folk of ludlow far more than the possible influence of a silly little girl who got taken for a ride in the twelfth century on which basis by the way im buggered if im going to even consider exorcizing the hanging merrily sorry didnt get much sleep last night got elbowed in the eye by a psychotic teenager how come you know so much about this mrs pepper lol and jane on the internet it doesnt take very long to find out about anything any more also i saw her when i was on the river bank with mumford and you were in the pub with his dad i recognized her realized this was who osman meant well i dont know anything about her as i said but i do know that george lackland while he may work the system is a decent man who thinks his beloved town is being contaminated if only by having its moral tone lowered is he exaggerating this i dont know personally i just cant see a wealthy middleaged woman going in for wholesale alfresco sex in a town she regards as heaven and i dont want to get involved she braked catching a movement on the grass verge badger about to scuttle across the road get involved with a witchhunt witchhunt the bishop leaned his head back over the passenger seat from which the headrest was long gone how simple things were in those days the mob would have dragged her in front of some judge who thought he was god and then taken her out and hanged her at gallows bank he turned his head towards merrily still there you know still this patch of open space in the midst of modern housing you can see where the actual gibbet stood so that executions would be visible all over town ludlow you see looks after its past unlike hereford we try unfortunately i think our old execution site is underneath plascarreg really dont you dare make anything of that merrily smiled and try not to hang george hes an oldfashioned civic leader middle ages hed have been the sheriff when they eventually come to lay him out theyll find the imprints of chain links on his chest of course hed know exactly how george felt because it was how he felt if ludlow was tainted george was tainted and if bernie let george down he would probably feel hed forfeited his right to come back and live out his sunset years in the benign shadow of the buttercross of course the womans obviously mad he said too many chemicals in years gone by one assumes you think we should inform the diocesan director of psychiatry she felt him staring at her working this out he shifted something clicking ominously under his seat saltash you read the mail then he grunted it was in the times too actually yes that man did rather exaggerate his role didnt he glad you think so heavens merrily last thing we want is worried people avoiding deliverance for fear of being considered eligible for assessment under the mental health act but under our new agreed working practices im supposed to report for instance what weve just been told for consideration by the panel before any action is taken like i said earlier i shouldnt even have come tonight without clearing it with them its preposterous merrily its what we agreed what they agreed you mean in theory he could as bishop overrule any of it in practice it would be impossible without dispensing with the panel and making lifetime enemies of siân and saltash and the dean who had brokered the deal she left all this unsaid but it was drifting between them as leominster appeared over to the right an island of lights the bishop sighed merrily lets not fool ourselves look at me overweight over sixty and not up to much in the pulpit ive never been under any illusions im a caretaker here and i suspect my times already running out come on bernie people like you like whats that got to do with it there are those who could have me quietly retired in no time at all if they chose to whisper in the right ears and i rather suspect ms callaghanclarkes one of the potential whisperers you think siân wants you out i dont know what i think herefords not the most exalted of dioceses and nicely out on a limb good place for a woman to have a chance at the helm wouldnt you say siân callaghanclarke was that the wheel shaking or her hands bishop of hereford im simply saying its a possibility thats occurred to me thats all may be years off yet then again christ merrily said and theres something else im not supposed to tell you this yet but the archdeacon came to see me this afternoon you know jeff kimballs moving to st johns at worcester leaving a major vacancy at dilwyn i didnt well he is and with archie menzies retiring in the autumn your area of north herefordshires going to be stretched inevitably the archdeacons looking at the possibility of a shakeup introduction of a collaborative ministry in that area rector team vicar et cetera and as all this would be happening very close to the ledwardine parish boundary its been suggested that ledwardine should be included in the review oh her hands slackened on the wheel she could see where this was going only a matter of time and of course someone pointed out that you had only one parish the bishop said inevitably something of a rarity these days you will admit who er pointed that out no idea but i expect you could make a solid guess my opinion as ive frequently stated is that with an expanding deliverance department to run one parish is quite ample and i do know youre working seven days most weeks but when i pointed this out to the archdeacon he said it had been suggested to him that perhaps deliverance was something that ah expanded according to the time and the manpower or indeed womanpower available the archdeacons been got at so it would seem someone wants me to have a bunch of extra parishes thus leaving very little time for deliverance work draw your own conclusions the thinking i would guess is that deliverance would itself then become something of a teamministry and the post of diocesan exorcist under whatever title would disappear well i suppose thats neither here nor there merrily kept her eyes on the road except that the end result would probably be that deliverance itself as a specialist field would eventually also disappear i can see that happening yes the bishop said its a political thing isnt it they hit the leominster bypass picking up speed and extra rattle the bishop seemed tired almost defeated merrily wondered how close he was to preempting attempts to remove him while a suitable property in ludlow was still within his price range im sorry he said i didnt want to tell you tonight im glad you did i may be misinterpreting it i dont think you are it explains a lot well quite if i fight it its going to look like pure selfinterest extreme selfishness some ministers struggling to support seven parishes while im poncing around with a flask of holy water theres so much resentment in the church now ill hold out against it of course you cant i wouldnt expect you to anyway lets see what happens meanwhile theres the ludlow situation to sort out look he said if you think you should take it to the deliverance panel do it if they say leave it alone leave it alone the parish church of st mary hopeunderdinmore rose up on the left separated from its parish by the fast road our lady of the bypass merrily slowed this stretch had a bad record for deaths stuff them merrily said ill do it but if anything rebounds on george i wont try to catch it first ok of course not merrily look ive been thinking about this whole situation why dont you take a week or ten days off from the parish get dennis beckett in as locum then you can look into the situation and you wont be responsible to anybody will you you wont be there youll be working whats the word not plain clothes undercover thats it afterwards you produce a report for me and i inform anyone who complains that this seemed to me to be the best way of dealing with a delicate and rather nebulous situation bernie have you really thought this through and its not a witchhunt merrily its pastoral care its very clear that this woman needs help women dont behave in this way because theyre happy and fulfilled they dont leave used sanitary towels down the back of a fifteenthcentury misericord they she turned to him i dont remember him telling us that he didnt he got halfway and became embarrassed the incidents it happened three times in successive ah months were mentioned as a whimsical footnote in a report on church maintenance i was obliged to read we didnt exactly hold on to the evidence thats weird bernie she followed a pale grey ribbon of road up the long hill towards hereford not to say faintly ridiculous play it by ear follow your conscience the bishop loosened his seat belt settled back with his hands folded on his stomach do have a cigarette merrily if you want youre a true man of god bernie merrily said merrily didnt have the cigarette until shed dropped bernie dunmore at the bishops palace behind hereford cathedral it was about ninethirty pm a few people about she parked for a few minutes on the corner of broad street and king street opposite the cathedral green took the silk cut from her bag and thought about belladonna and marion de la bruyère about ghosts in the s a cowled monkish figure had been repeatedly seen in the cathedral close seen initially by policemen the whole town had been hugely excited apparently excited rather than frightened as many as two hundred people would gather here on the green night after night in the hope of spotting the ghost like a football crowd someone had observed at the time merrily smoked and gazed out at the green and the cathedral and the soapy spring moonlight splashing through the trees where all those people had stood in anticipation of a multiple psychological projection a shared hallucination on a grand scale the existence of ghosts the nature of ghosts at least half of the raison dêtre of deliverance she rang jane to say she was on her way home the kid sounded tired ill probably have an early night take it nobody beat you up or anything not sos youd notice look im sorry i had to go out again save it for lol hes off to bristol tomorrow oh my god i forgot you always forget id better go round stay the night ill be ok ill be back by midnight merrily said yeah jane said morosely i expect you will she parked the car at the vicarage and let herself in a kitchen lamp had been left on but there was no sign of jane she gave ethel a foil pack of felix and then out of habit went quietly up to the attic apartment just to make sure er nightnight mum jane said from the other side of the door merrily smiled forgiven kind of she managed to catch the eight till late just before it closed picked up some cigs and a bottle of white wine carrying the bottle openly down church street the village was deserted but there were a lot of windows on either side it was the darkened ones you had to worry about not all of them were holiday homes however the darkened ones did not tonight include lols hed seen her coming he was standing in his doorway youve had the electricity reconnected no going back now lol said he still seemed bewildered at finding himself a man of property the hall behind him was lit by a lowwattage bulb dangling over the newel post where lucy devenish used to hang her poncho merrily felt a rush of emotion no she said definitely no going back in full view of all the darkened windows in church street she stepped up to the doorway and kissed him on the mouth saw his eyes widen close to hers as he manoeuvred her inside throwing the door shut behind them what have you done oh god her glasses they were still in the car i she swallowed would you believe it if i said id walked into a lamppost no thought not she put the bottle on the floor felt at her dog collar look im sorry im still in the kit its coming off tonight for for at least a week ive been told to get a locum in so i can be a an ordinary person she shook her head im probably demob happy lol thats what it is a lock of hair brushed her bruised eye like a birds wing she pushed it aside with a hand and winced tell me what happened lol said she looked up the stairs and imagined lucy devenish standing at the top watching them with a weary disappointment her poncho drooping and then caught a sudden mental image of belladonna down near ludford bridge wrapped in her floorlength cape electricblue light on her beautiful predatory face thought about marion de la bruyère a young girl who had reacted to betrayal in the manner of the times now a ghost more than eight centuries old and what the mayor of ludlow might be asking probably her last task as a deliverance minister and it wasnt even official actually she said to be honest im not so much demob happy as demob very pissedoff could have done a deal with bernie merrily told god later i could have said save my ministry get those two bastards off my back and ill help you in ludlow that was the obvious thing wasnt it but like playing politics thats not what the church is supposed to be about is it yeah yeah the church has been deep into politics from the start but that didnt make it right or did it i mean it survived didnt it would it still have survived if there hadnt been political popes reformation renewal and and i dont want it to end thats what im trying to say deliverance i dont want it to be over thought i was starting to get it to get some of it right maybe helping people sometimes ok i was too late to help some people like roddy lodge and too blind to help others layla riddock but i had a strong feeling you were using me to give nat and jeremy a chance at stanner last winter that was i mean sometimes its been amazing and sure ive felt desperate because it didnt seem to be working or i wasnt getting it right and guilty when it was fulfilling when it felt like i was wielding light guilty because i only had one parish and didnt have to go on the road on sundays and learn how to preach properly have i been guilty of pride are there ministers in this diocese there surely are who could do this so much better than me did you send siân and saltash am i stupid and naive and blind is it your will that i give this up let it be taken from me stop meddling in the affairs of the dead run five six seven parishes instead watch it all falling away for all of us im sorry i dont know i dont know do i fight this or lie down which is worse cowardice or pride and do you ever listen any more merrily opened her eyes standing by the window moonlight sugaring the trees on cole hill no easy answers written in the sky part three bell to thcentury eyes such colossal expenditure on unproductive religious ritual may seem strange but in the th th and th centuries most people were in no doubt that what kept mankind from both spiritual perdition and temporal catastrophe was an incessant flow of prayers to god from the priesthood and from religious orders it was more vital expenditure than commercial investment or relief of poverty michael faraday ludlow ludlow had become the elite leisure centre of the middle marches in the th century and the castle was the focus of this burgeoning tourist industry john byng thought it was one of the best towns for a genteel family of small fortune to retire to ludlow was thus one of the first tourist honey pots in england david whitehead symbolism and assimilation chapter in ludlow castle its history and buildings ed ron shoesmith and andy johnson ancient incense merrily felt very small and exposed she was wearing jeans and a green fleece with a torn pocket she had a canvas shoulder bag with her cigarettes inside and her phone around her neck was a chain with a tiny gold cross on it that was hidden by the neck of her grey tshirt demobdisorientated in an old town like a popup book coming at her from all angles in wedges of carrotcoloured antique brick and twisted timbers and thrusting gables cars and trucks laboured up corve street and down old street or were funnelled squealing like pigs into the bull ring and king street which must have been designed for donkey carts and the sun slithered overhead like a softboiled egg trailing clouds of bloodied membrane or that was how it looked through the rosetinted glasses and she felt very small especially next to jon scole of ghostours drinks he said right ok ok ive got to think about this which one of these tartedup pissparlours threw me out last ethereal he wasnt he wore a motorbike jacket with extraneous chains he seemed about seven feet tall and he had long hair and a beard and a manchester accent that could split logs he winked at merrily tossed back his blond ringlets only kidding mary they love me really i bring em customers theyd never see as a rule old ladies who want coffee or a bitter lemon if theyre feeling daring soft drinks and beverages thats where the real money is sides you need a clear head for ghosts i should know ok the feathers it is then top place you did say the feathers didnt you they always do i didnt say a word merrily said hey you thought it though nobody can resist going in the feathers at least once hang on he lifted a finger as if he was testing the wind direction now right feathers hotel ok now we dont normally get to this until last cos its not what youd call typical as ghost stories go its a bit off the wall but still he led her across the road weaving through the traffic drivers letting him through jon scole looked like he could damage small cars he stopped at the opposite kerb gazing up at the ornate jacobean fantasy that looked as if it had been sculpted out of cadburys chocolate flakes and marzipan the last time shed seen the feathers hotel was on robbie walshs computer i mean classic haunted inn right what would you reckon mary a highwayman in a black mask no well maybe i dunno but the most interesting phenomenon in this particular location is get this young girl in a miniskirt and a seethrough blouse really fact usual time about now no later around noon comes sashaying straight across where we just come right through cars fades through the bloody cars and out the other side up onto this very pavement and then poof vanishes seen not once but about a dozen times back in the s when i were still learning to walk go in there luv ask the staff come on ill prove it to you no jon id rather not ask anyone i dont want to sorry he put up his hands as though the spectral girl had just glided out of the telecom van parked up on the kerb with its hazard warning lights on got you you dont wanna make a thing of it im with you lets just go in grab a drink at a round table in the comus bar of the feathers she made like the old ladies and asked for tea jon scole grinned at her through his curly copperwire beard vicars and tea eh sorry just cant get over you being a you look so little and he puffed his lips out sorry im a bit direct me no thats its always nice to know where you are with people makes quite a change but if you could just like merrily patted the air reduce the volume right ok he brought down his boom to a loud whisper and thats the last time ill mention religion in public swear to god dont worry about the folk you get in here though unless its rotary day its guaranteed to be mostly tourists whys it called the comus bar miltons play comus first performance at ludlow castle little robbie walsh told me that god rest his soul everywhere you go this town youre wading through istry come in off the street you got to scrape it off your shoes like dogshit he took off his motorbike jacket hung it over the back of his chair underneath he wore a leather waistcoat he pulled it straight used to wear a watch and chain then word reached me councillor lackland thought i were taking the piss didnt want to offend dear old george he could make things very difficult for me could george all the official buildings i need to take people through and the shops george runs the chamber of trade he could wipe me out in a month no shit a gap appeared at the bar jon scole stood up pot of tea please ruth and a pint of the good stuff he sat down so mary you want to meet bell eh tough one that not impossible but certainly tough it was george lackland whod set this up the bishop had talked to george on the phone from the deliverance office early this morning setting the ball rolling perhaps whatever she turned up could be filtered through sophie during office hours bernie said best if they were not seen to be collaborating although she was welcome to ring him at home at night merrily didnt imagine it would make much difference now there were times when you felt it was all out of your hands a will of god situation shed never actively sought out the deliverance role so if it was taken away what right did she have to feel furious embittered isolated stabbed in the back you all right mary jon scole said yes sorry you looked like you suddenly wanted to kill somebody no it was just she felt the blush had a late night this morning shed sat in the office and listened to bernie giving george lackland the spiel important man to important man george we have to work this out between us you and i and i think our priority is essentially the same that is preserving the spirit of the finest most precious little town in the country but if were tampering with heritage george we have to tread softly ill be frank what ive said to merrily is this go into ludlow talk to people take the spiritual temperature come back to me and well make some sort of decision sooner rather than later i promise not spelling anything out never once mentioning belladonna and then george had been talking for a while and bernie had been nodding and glancing at merrily and giving her small confidential smiles finally telling george that of course he understood we decoded your messages old friend well keep your confidence and youll keep ours the parish details had all been arranged surprisingly easily merrily and sophie had fixed up for dennis beckett retired minister goanywhere locum to take on the ledwardine church services for the next two weekends and handle any routine parish business that came up merrily would still be at home at nights but shed leave the answering machine on the whole time directing any calls on urgent parish business across the county to dennis shed tell uncle ted senior churchwarden tonight he wouldnt be happy having to work with dennis at such short notice but when had uncle ted ever been happy since shed taken on deliverance as for siân callaghanclarke and the panel sophie had already dealt with that sophie accepted that part of her role was laundering clergy lies shed told siân that merrilys favourite aunt not her mother who could easily be traced had fractured a hip and as merrily had holidays owing where was this sophie wasnt entirely sure but somewhere not too far away as merrily would be coming home some nights when another relative took over sophie making it complicated enough to forestall questions then george lackland himself had phoned merrily telling her hed arranged for her to meet mr jonathan scole a volatile young man but he could give her information that it wouldnt be right for george himself to come out with and because of what jonathan did hed spent some considerable time in the company of a certain person george said now the only problem here is that i might have to tell him who you are and what you do i have every reason to think hell keep it absolutely confidential every reason my wife works a good deal in tourism and jonathans business depends on a certain amount of goodwill if you understand me no hes a good lad really hes kept us well informed about matters that might have proved embarrassing top and bottom of it is i think hell be quite thrilled to work with someone like you now then is that all right for you well you tell him what you want him to know and what hes to keep to himself and you tell him hes got me to answer to if he dont not that thatll be necessary the mood swings of last night had no longer been in evidence george lackland had a town to run and it had been like talking to some avuncular mafia don whose ethos had long since transcended all moral values so im in your hands jon scole sucked the top off his beer whatever you want and i might seem a bit of a loudmouthed bastard but i can promise you mary jon tapped his nose froth on his beard nothing gets out mary well why not he knew she was a vicar with the diocese but he didnt know her surname and now hed got her first name wrong perhaps even george lackland had heard it as mary she was working undercover she would be mary fine shed met up with jon scole at his shop in corve street the shop was called lodelowe a medieval spelling of the towns name it was a darkly atmospheric gift emporium with lamps made from pottery models of town houses misty framed photographs paintings and books books on the history of ludlow and books about the supernatural jon scole understood from the mayor that unlike some people in the church hed had dealings with mrs watkins wasnt averse to discussing ghosts which had seemed to be the clincher for him they could talk about ghosts jon loved to talk about ghosts and also about the strange ways of the exotic belladonna bell pepper oh yeah i get on with bell as far as anybody does bell loves ghosts i mean thats it mystery solved i could lead you along make a big thing out of it but thats what it comes down to that woman bloody loves ghosts and you know whats so funny about that i mean considering all those spooky albums you know the big joke bell cant see em she cannot see ghosts thats what shes said to you i tell you jon pointed down the comus bar which was unexpectedly modern not at all rustic if the bint in the seethrough whatsit drifted through here now shed carry on with her gin and tonic tequila whatever oh listen i never finished that story did i that was a strange one a bloke investigated it found this actual young girl who every week she used to visit her auntie or her greatauntie anyway they were close and when the auntie died suddenly and the girl moved away she used to imagine herself going back along the same route reliving it a happy time and they reckon thats what people saw a phantasm of the living huw owen called them extras or walkons blimey you do know your way around my backyard jon said i tell you mary this towns heaving with ghosts i can do well here if they leave me alone youve not been doing this long came here not long before bell parents died got killed in the car im sorry was it bit of a shock year or so ago now they had a restaurant well more of an upmarket transport caff to be honest south man cheshire they liked to say i couldnt face taking it over so i flogged the lot to the bloody little chef opportune really and took to the road looking for something interesting so you own the shop no im renting ridiculous bloody rent but its still at the experimental stage this bloke roy liddle who did the ghostwalks before it was more of a hobby for him im afraid im a little bit more of a businessman dont want to invest all ive got in it if its going to flop do i the ghostwalks ties in with the shop mysteries of old ludlow not doing badly but its early days yet i only opened last christmas still feeling me way cant afford to tread on too many toes at this stage so when the mayor sent for me sent for you well asked if id drop into his furniture shop its only fifty yards up the road you shouldve heard him hed been asked to assist senior clergy investigating certain incidents absolutely confidential jonathan me trying to keep a straight face what is that about its about what you might call the spiritual spinoff from two very similar deaths at the castle one an accident unless mmm unless you and george know better little smile there did george indicate that well jon scole thought for a moment i should tell you if he hasnt already that theres a certain issue on which old george and me swap confidences belladonna jon grinned bane of his life lovely lady undermining every bloody thing he thinks he stands for moral decency all this stuff and he cant do anything cos very soon shes gonna be at the very heart of his eminently respectable family respectable hes an old crook like all bloody councillors you ever know a councillor who was in it for the public good but why would he share confidences with im sorry a yob like me because i mix with the kind of people who come into contact with bell and even bell herself now and then better placed than anybody me to keep an eye on her i mean i can see his problem it must be scary having a woman like that around a woman like what a woman with enough money never to have to give a shit for people like councillor lackland a woman whos fascinated by the mysteries of life and death and is open to experiments what kind of jon tapped his nose all in good time mary tell me about yourself well shed spent some time working out what she wanted to say and what it was best to conceal i work for the diocese of hereford youre a real actual priest i yeah he frowned see thats not good mary she doesnt like priests bell likes churches but she doesnt like the church if you get me mmm so whats the churchs angle on this good question all right i work for the division of the church that investigates hauntings and things of that nature thats more or less what george said but i wondered if he was having me on so i said id talk to you so youre actually an exorcist right well i yeah you dont look a lot like max von whatsisname im a disappointment to everyone there isnt some silly bugger wants you to go in and exorcize the castle is there nothing formal as yet because that jon was lifting his glass he put it down with a bang that would be fuckin insane mary apart from what itd do to my business youd be undermining the very essence of ludlow bell would go spare for what its worth i wouldnt like to do that either merrily said but im interested in why you think it would be insane really all right come with me then where not far he stood up and put on his motorbike jacket its chains rattled like an alarm and two retiredlooking couples at the next table all turned round at once jon scole wiped his mouth and beard with the back of a hand you psychic yourself mary no more than anybody as long as youre receptive youll feel it theres some places with more resonance than others especially in this town not sure why but its fact physically its got a lot to set it apart built on a kind of promontory two rivers a very ancient church and i mean very ancient and like the whole atmosphere here you can feel it its rich and heavy like its drenched in some ancient incense you know what im saying actually i do especially in the evening you dont need the evening his element down past tescos towards the bottom of corve street yew trees overhung a high stone wall and they could see the roof of the chapel dogs jon scole said they reckon the dogs know he had to shout over an old yellow furniture van clattering out of town it had one word diagonally on the side lackland dogs merrily said dogs are supposed to go bonkers this end of the street out of control well ive seen it some old dear hauling on the lead brutus heel no chance very strong atmosphere accumulation of psychic energy so anyway this is where she walks sorry who who do you think jon scole led her through the gateway where cars were parked next to a circle of youngish yews gloomily wrestling for the light the chapel was set back regular and victorianlooking like the chapels you found in cemeteries which was what it appeared to have been there was an information board on a lectern it told you that the chapel had been built partly on the site of a carmelite friary dating back to in use until suppressed by henry viii in when its buildings were sold and demolished and then came the cemetery no dont read it mary come and see it jon scole led her down past the chapel which was some kind of print workshop now and that was good she thought much better than dereliction brought a flow of people down here kept up a flow of energy merrily blinked bloody hell she was thinking like jane but there was an energy in ludlow the kind you didnt find in too many ancient towns and even the rolling roof of tescos was urging it in the town was prosperous sure but not in any selfconscious way and what bernie dunmore had said about the buildings being preserved in aspic was misleading nothing that shed seen here was in aspic it was all still in use and it buzzed and it hummed and it chattered even the graveyard a path ran down the middle jon scole was strolling along it but merrily had stopped there were cemeteries and there were graveyards and the thing about cemeteries was that most of them werent places youd want to end up jon scole turned and came back he was beaming surprising eh when they ran out of room at st laurences this was where they came and then this one got full theres supposed to be fourteen hundred graves here very few of them were fully visible any more because someone had taken an inspired decision the result was that st leonards graveyard was vibrantly alive a tangly scuffling mossygreen delirium busy with birdsong rich with moisture and slime merrily looked around saw a fat hollowedout yew tree and two shiny rippling domes of ivy that probably used to be headstones in the summer the air would be shimmering with butterflies haunted at night by bats and moths they gave it back to nature she said they just let it go what you got here mary is part of a kind of secret passageway linking the oldest parts of town and the two rivers the corve down at this end which is this narrow private kind of river and the big one the teme at the other between the trees over the bushes and the rooftops you could see the tower of st laurences as if this graveyard was still intimately linked to it which in a way it was merrily was enchanted not in some flimsy poetic way there was a real and powerful enchantment happening here maybe it was a combination of the rosecoloured glasses and her own disconnection from the diocese janes pagan forces reaching out for her maybe this was just an overgrown graveyard were going the opposite way from the way she walks jon said back on the path she comes up from the weir house up the steps and into the linney which goes from just above the teme up to the church and then starts again on the other side of the church and comes down again and you wind up here magic how often does she walk whenever the mood takes her no thats wrong she probably follows some pattern late at night or in the hour before dawn somethings got to be turning her on though hasnt it meaning well you know theres obviously a lot of places she finds a bit of a turnon thats why she came here like i say this is just a very haunted town and it feels like it know what i mean it feels nice it feels haunted mary everywhere you go look at all the stories you got an old woman in a dressing gown in the churchyard and heavy footsteps you got catherine of aragon allegedly at the castle lodge summat shivery at the readers house you got haunted shops a hairdressers with a poltergeist and look over there a view had opened on the left the kind of view that seemed like it was planned anywhere else thered have been a viewing point with a telescope that you could feed p coins into it was the castle as shed never seen it before it was away on the other side of the town but from here it appeared to be nestling in lush greenery the scene uninterrupted by modern buildings or in fact any buildings as if you were viewing it along a wooded valley as if you were back then when there was only the castle jon its like this place this cemetery is linked with everywhere you turn a corner and magic jon scole said everything in this town is connected up like electric wires like a circuit if you know how you can plug yourself in bell told you that just once and then she shut up like she were giving too much away links through time all the sacred places interlinked and there are special spots where all the like the eras of time come together when she walks here its like you know like she doesnt walk alone or at least she feels feels yeah doesnt see nowt but i tell you if i could get that woman into the ghostwalks as a regular id bloody clean up as it is im just taking it all in i feel like im tapping into her consciousness merrily remembered lol suggesting that inside belladonnas consciousness was not a safe place to be learned a lot about bell jon was saying i mean the music thats only half of it this is a heavy lady mary he paused nodding his head course shes also halfway out of her fuckin tree they went and stood under the dark feathery awning of the yew and she felt stupid with her glasses on turning everything the colour of ripening plums presumably she said youve heard about the other things shes supposed to have done i mean apart from walk naked he laughed with a feller just over there it was apparently where the ivys all thick on the ground youve got to hand it to her at her age they mustve been scratched to buggery the mayor was not amused well what dyou expect i mean george lackland his generation hes not exactly a leftwing espouser of liberal values is he i mean she was in rock music they dont operate according to georges rules they dont live on the same planet george lives on planet ludlow merrily said isnt that where bell wants to be too she wants to be part of it thats true but like if she gets off on doing it in places where making quote marks in the air with crooked fingers the veil is thin i can connect with that sex produces a lot of psychic energy and if theres this vortex of energy there already you probably get a top buzz least you do if youre bell you know what i mean in a way it was still a graveyard though deathfixated erotomania was how nigel saltash might describe it the yew tree was draped around them exposing its insides ancient yews always looked like theyd been dead and come through it shes built a career around an obsession jon scole said if youve heard the music youll know that shes made a shitload of money but shes had a couple of brushes with the big d along the way so she knows what a tightrope life is even if youre loaded and shes not getting any younger so shes not playing any more and she doesnt care what people think she wants to know what shes got coming we all want to know merrily said even the clergy yeah but you got distractions you got other things to do this woman shes done the lot every way you can gratify yourself in this life shes done it whats left think about it you sound as if you understand her i try i mean shes here im here theres potential but you said she was out of her tree halfway out of her tree how would i get to meet her you dont meet her she meets you if she wants to you can hang round here all night and its like waiting for some rare creature you might get lucky you probably wont when she first came to live in ludlow reportersd show up full of themselves and theyd all go back with nowt unless she wanted to talk which mostly she didnt talked to the journal cos that were the local paper wouldnt even talk to the star cos it circulates outside and thats why local people protect her thats one of the reasons shes eccentric mary this town likes eccentrics george doesnt and a few others no well so if i wanted to meet her youd have to be someone she was interested in like robbie walsh lets get back into the light eh jon scole said they stood inside the chapel gateway near the information board their backs to the surrounding wall and corve street a young man came out of the printshop with two carrier bags smiled at merrily dont believe a word this feller tells you most frightening thing youll ever see in ludlow is him at closing time right jon scole levelled a finger that order for four hundred ghostours leaflets consider it bloody cancelled he dropped his grin as the guy walked away turned to merrily and shook his head what happened to robbie that were the worst thing of all great kid great to have around you know all that knowledge he was like a wassername prodigy youd see him wandering around world of his own and youd go all right robbie you ok mate be like he was coming down off something blink blink where am i he used to go on the ghostwalk towards the end he were practically a fixture at first hed just tag along well i couldnt charge him could i sides people liked him he used to do half my job knew everything about every building we came to i didnt hadnt been here long enough loved telling people about the past in his element he was interested in ghosts not so much the ghosts as the istry i did the ghosts he did the istry we were quite a team all through easter see he could give you a picture he was like a kid thatd just walked out of the middle ages when he died i were just fuckin gutted mary jon recalled the funeral only right the service should be at st laurences even though he wasnt local hed made himself local jon had waited to talk to old mrs mumford afterwards telling her how much theyd all thought of robbie including mrs pepper what do you think so how did they meet on the ghostwalk some nights when its a bit quiet shell just show up tag along tourists leave her alone shes a bit forbidding in that cloak anyway one night thisd be around last christmas when i was just getting the shop together robbie was there and i were a bit knackered so i let him do most of it he knew all the stories better than me and he just little bugger brought it alive standing there under a lantern on a stick especially the medieval stuff hed tell you what they were wearing what the streets were like the smells even not in an academic way he were still a young lad no big words but it was like the rest of us were in the here and now and he was walking the same street but he was in the twelfth century you had to see it he sounds remarkable i hadnt quite realized i dont wanna build him up too much mary he were just a lad and bell riveted obviously a young lad who seemed to be seeing things she couldnt what did you think about that me i just thought hed read a lot of books and they became friends robbie and bell she made sure of that guy i spoke to said they seemed like mother and son they were mates jon looked irritated lets not get silly about it did you talk to him about her once or twice and how did he relate to her special interests you mean was he exposed to bells obsession with all things death i dont know this copper asked me that detective you know what theyre like trying to make you say things mumford i mean what is this mary is this some scheme of lacklands to get her out of his hair for good stitch her up for assisting robbie to do himself in turn the whole town against her merrily stared at him what makes you think he did himself in i dunno jon jammed his hands in the lowest pockets of his leather jacket rattling chains it just never made a lot of sense to me that hed just fall off kid knew his way around every passage in that castle with his eyes shut and then that girl not much doubt about that is there she came here to die did you ever have any reason to think robbie was depressed about anything no he were full of life when he i never thought you know he said things maybe i shouldve put together like youd ask him about his parents and his face would cloud over i was thinking maybe divorce so i stopped asking didnt wanna upset him we just dont know do we how to react for the best what do you think i think there are some questions that nobodys been asking and i think everybodys been walking round belladonna as if shes the queen mary next to bell the queens anybodys he looked at her standing a bit too close she could be interested in you i mean you know your stuff dont you its just the priest thing and an exorcist even worse like rentokil for ghosts were not i know youre not im telling you how shed see you doesnt mind being in the church though thats because its where it is its obvious the church is one of the places right at the top of the town at the centre where all the lanes and alleyways come out view from the top of the tower amazing you should see that makes the hanging tower look like jumping off a stepladder you been there yet not yet blimey you gotta see that we could go there now ten minutes you got time merrily looked at her watch it was coming up to one pm she needed a break to think about all this and she wanted to speak to mumford but more than any of this she felt the need to break the spell all right what are you doing around say four oclock jon said suppose i meet you at the entrance to the car park near the castle she nodded shed have to see it sometime at least this guy would know the exact spot four pm would give her time to talk to mumford and try to see the interior decorator who according to george lackland had had some peculiar requests made of him by mrs pepper ok ace meanwhile bell let me think about this i mean i reckon shed take to you as a person jon scole grinned they say she goes both ways not with me she doesnt jonathan just kidding mary the mix there was this feeling of unease now whenever merrily thought about andy mumford wouldnt have been too surprised to spot him back on the prowl here in ludlow she felt he was teetering like jemima pegler had and perhaps robbie walsh over a long drop but when she rang from the volvo he was at home howre you his voice was still higher than usual he would hate that every time he spoke a reminder of the kid with the chain im fine she was in the car park at the top of town close to the castle the day had dulled thin grey clouds windshielding the sun like smoked glass she crumpled up the cellophane wrapping of her lunch one freerange eggandcress sandwich you seen a doctor andy no need its better than it was doesnt sound it thats because it hurts more mumford wheezed out a laugh where you calling from im back in ludlow that a fact ive got a few days off she could hardly tell him about the bishop or george lackland vicar with a black eye doesnt look good in the pulpit and i thought that with you being persona non grata here maybe i could check a few things out good of you so i went to talk to jonathan scole boy tried to bullshit me i think its his way he does seem to have been fond of robbie however poor kid had a virtual season ticket on the ghostwalk in return for lecturing the punters on local history what about the woman she seems to have milked robbie too if i ever get to see her ill let you know thank you mrs watkins mumford said paused oh i had a bit of information too from headquarters you finally spoke to bliss no no another person this was in the division distant relation second cousin to a second cousin kind of thing gives me a call now and then we chats about this and that family in this part of the world no matter how thinly a blood link was stretched it was there to be rediscovered when necessary seems jason mebus finally turned seventeen mumford said and you missed his party they had his party below stairs at hereford attended by former colleagues of mine jason got into a confrontation at the orchard gardens last night pub by the plascarreg two boys finished up seriously hammered in the car park by jason by four of them but the others were juveniles jasons charged with abh his first as an adult hes off the streets then that ent gonner happen till he kills somebody he was bailed if the presiding magistrates in a real bad mood hell get community service the othersll have a stern tickingoff one of the others by the way was chainboy connor boyd his name how do you know its him moron still had the chain ah she watched a young couple loading babies and groceries into a peoplecarrier parked against the wall under the castle where some siege engine might once have stood andy does this relative know what they did to you said i had a throat infection another one of thems connors halfbrother shane nicklin twelve i reckon he was likely the little angel who came in to see us on his own regular at juvenile court shot a toddler in the eye with an airgun when he was seven a good family then an example to us all mumford said im rather embarrassed about this callum corey said you shouldnt be putting me in this position he looked about twentythree and wore a white silk shirt he stretched his legs out swivelling sulkily from side to side in his leather chair on the wall behind his desk were framed photo blowups of the restoration jobs coreys had handled and it was impressive baronial interiors open log fires its all wordofmouth in our profession mrs watkins mr corey said any gossip of this sort gets out it can do us immense harm my father thought he was doing old lackland a favour didnt think he was going to blab it all over town i dont actually think merrily said that confiding it to a priest amounts to blabbing it all over town besides he didnt actually tell me what happened he just suggested that i might have a word with you you dont look like a priest to me whats a priest look like mr corey was the new type of expublicschool painter and decorator working out of this tasteful georgian town house in broad street which sloped to the old town gate and then to the river at the horseshoe weir where mrs mumford had drowned the office was the size of a small ballroom with bluewashed walls and four long georgian windows trestle tables displayed leatherbound catalogues and samples of moulding and dressed stone ok merrily stood up i can see im putting you in a difficult position ill go thank you for seeing me mr corey no look he came half out of his chair wait sit down i just wondered how the church came into it we weve done some work for the church one word from me and all that would be over for good he looked startled for a moment merrily smiled joke mr corey ok how do we come into it well thereve been incidents in st laurences we dont like to involve the police if we can deal with these things ourselves and id be grateful if this wasnt blabbed all over town either a glassfronted castiron woodburning stove was burning low more for effect than heat at this time of year callum corey pulled his chair away from it it wasnt our job originally the weir house was a project by the raphaels hitandrun restorers move into a place do it up sell it move on except in this case they virtually had to build from the foundations up one of the old palmers guild houses look please sit down would you like something to drink just had lunch thanks she sat down across the desk from him im afraid i dont know anything about the palmers guild names now been appropriated by mrs pepper for a conservation trust shes setting up im afraid ill believe that when i see it originally they were welloff pilgrims to the holy land in the middle ages brought a palm leaf back to prove it something like that that was how it started then they became a sort of cooperative movement that employed priests exclusively to pray for the immortal souls of their members they became immensely wealthy and lasted for several centuries just in ludlow began in ludlow spread over a wide area put huge amounts into the fabric of the church and financed the building of about fifty houses in the town including the ruin that the raphaels renamed the weir house mrs pepper bought it off these raphaels very quickly apparently there were still bits and pieces left to complete but thats always the case with these quickbodge merchants its all about appearances so mrs pepper hired you to finish it off perfect it callum said theres an impressive central room with an immense stone fireplace one wall had been improperly finished and was miasmic you mean it was damp theyd used a gypsum mix on top of the stones but it hadnt worked what it needed was something more sympathetic like lime exactly he looked surprised that shed know i live in a fourhundredyearold vicarage ah were asked to renovate churches but rarely touch vicarages and rectories still owned by the church they dont seem prepared to spend too much money on dwelling houses unlike mrs pepper mrs pepper didnt quibble at all about the price however she had in mind certain refinements of her own originally horsehair was often mixed with the slaked lime did you know that ive heard of it mrs pepper had something similar in mind but she wanted to use her own hair i see im not sure you do actually callum looked down at his unused blotter we do get a few odd requests of this nature sometimes the craze for feng shui fuelled by those dreadful tv makeover programmes some of the proposals contravene listedbuilding regulations but we do what we can to satisfy the customer so you went along with it i did the work myself she said too many people trampling around the place that would not be acceptable for reasons of privacy i thought so yes i didnt realize quite well anyway she presented me with a cardboard box with hair in it her own hair is blonde whether its dyed or not im not qualified to say but this hair um wasnt it was darker and clearly of a different consistency it was someone elses hair callum stood up and walked over to one of the long windows which overlooked not broad street but a small flagged courtyard with a tall cedar tree at the bottom that wasnt the impression i had he said my impression by the lack of length and the er texture of the hair was that it hadnt been taken from her head oh and did you go ahead with the job did you mix it in yes i did and was she happy with it er very happy she insisted on helping me she got the plaster all over her hands i did suggest she wear gloves but she seemed to want it on her skin she then at some point she asked me if i would also like to add something of myself to the wall as it were i was quite wary by this time i dont really like working alone in houses where theres only a woman at home merrily smiled i always thought you builders were men of the world i am not a builder well i am but this is a small town and were a respected company and my fathers a town councillor you made an excuse and left i did wasnt just that she was old enough to be my mother she it wasnt healthy she lives there on her own she has a cleaner and a gardener who come in seems to have most of her meals in restaurants in the town that must be costly not a problem it seems for mrs pepper the house is filled with antiques would perhaps not be the word theres a sink for instance fashioned from what appears to be a stone coffin they become available sometimes when old churches are converted into houses so she had a wall plastered with hair not from her head anything else she wanted you to do im not going to elaborate on what she invited me to add to the mix oh dear quite said mr corey carrying a light it was just after three pm when merrily left coreys walking more or less aimlessly up broad street past de greys café and then the clothing shop which bernie dunmore had told her had been retail premises since the fourteenth century she started imagining robbie walsh drifting this way his selfeducated inner vision replacing tarmac with cobbles delivery vans with wooden carts coats with cloaks levis with leggings ending the exercise when without trying too hard she was able to turn a man with a charity tin on the steps of the buttercross into a leper in rags with a peeling face and wretched burning eyes theres some places with more resonance than others jon scole had said all it would take would be a moment of slippage a mental stumbling and shed be seeing through mrs mumfords eyes dead robbie shivering in sunsplashed glass she hurried away and didnt look into shop windows there were times when you needed spiritual advice back in the car she rang huw owen at his rectory in the beacons and thank god he was there how old is she lass late forties fifty hard to say exactly shes wearing well been around in every sense she seems to have had a fairly nomadic existence maybe not able to settle anywhere until she found this place that would figure feels shes come home at last this is the place she should always have been she has to make up for lost time i think thats exactly right shes bought a rebuilt medieval house on an old site when a wall needs replastering she gets the builder to mix in some of her own hair instead of horsehair exactly only this is evidently pubic hair nice touch huw said what are we looking at here then sympathetic magic all magics sympathetic magic lass but this goes back to folk custom when i were a lad i remember an owd bloke saying that if you wanted to really make a house your own you and the missus should make sure you use every room use being the operative word that would figure too from what i hear youd probably also find that shes drawn some of her own blood and mixed it with paint or varnish huw said or she might use urine or any other bodily fluids that come to hand merrily wrinkled her nose so its about belonging or if she feels the house is haunted say a presence from the past appears to be the dominant force there then by infusing her own essence into the fabric of the place shes making it clear whos possessing who youre good huw ah you know all this yourself really lass this is just belt and braces its what i need right now she told him what bernie dunmore had suggested about siân callaghanclarke all rumour and conjecture of course his voice grew concerned so youre really working privately for bloody dunmore not as such just that we havent told anybody serving his agenda though not yours id go home if i were you merrily keep your head down not the time for being a maverick im not kidding theres summat here needs looking at whats that woman after why you dunno i do however want to find out how belladonna ties in if she does to the death of robbie walsh and then ill back off ive got your support havent i counts for a lot huw its kind of strengthening can i tell you the rest theres more the house is only the beginning shes operating on a much wider scale i think this is all about acceptance by the town itself on all kinds of levels she was already halfway to working this out it was always fascinating to watch incomers and how they tried to get themselves accepted grab a stake in the community like in ledwardine it was always the new people who organized the festivals usually for the benefit of other newcomers it drove jane mad but of course belladonnas already famous a bit notorious and she doesnt want to advertise her presence definitely doesnt want to be a tourist attraction but knows shes a stranger huw said and thats how people regard her a newcomer doesnt fit and not entitled to has to earn her place we know shes already given a lot of money for conservation saved some land from possibly unsympathetic development thatll happen win her more friends than enemies but some enemies but i think that being accepted by the living people huw thats only a small part of what she wants because ok this is what she does she walks the streets alone at night dressed in a long cape burning candles following a specific route it looks like through the oldest parts of the town some people find it eerie but theyll accept it without too many questions because poor folk are mental cases rich folk are merely eccentric mmm and then here comes the sexual element again she told him about st leonards graveyard and what jon scole had said but that could be gossip he could be right though fusing her own energies with the energies of the place in the same way as witchesll use sex at the culmination of a ritual at a sacred site stone circle or whatever who was the partner no idea he should be local for maximum benefit or she apparently ah interesting see this is all very practical merrily your womans found the little town she wants to stay in for the rest of her life if shes carrying a light from her home all the way around the town and back again passing through the most ancient and holiest places on a ritual basis time and time again shes taking her spirit into that town isnt she and becoming accepted by the spirit of the town or spirits which spirits we know shes been milking jon scole and anyone else for information about the bestestablished ghost stories and there are quite a lot of them here victorian tudor medieval she wants to know who they are and where they walk happen she sees the ghosts as the oldest permanent residents gain their acceptance and youre in theres another thing too damn take your time put the mobile to your other ear for a bit dont want to fry your brains no quite she switched ears and leaned back in the driving seat eyes closed ah i know the church its old and its big and it has some famous misericords on several occasions belladonna appears to have left a tampon or a pad pushed down the side of one of them this is blood again isnt it even better this is menstrual blood the deepest power of womanhood fertility on every level a woman is at her most fearsome if you like when shes menstruating as most fellers find out to their cost in the ancient world youd have a lot of ritual centred on menstruation its connection with the moon ah merrily said but you knew that anyway you have a great ability huw to make me aware of the significance of what i already might have known just be careful huw said keep looking over your shoulder yes there was still ten minutes to spare before merrily was due to meet jon scole at the entrance to the car park she walked back into castle square where the historic buildings fell away and the timeless greyflecked sky opened up the castle gateway was guarded by a huge old cannon and a line of recently pollarded trees there wasnt time to go in now she crossed the square towards the shops woolworths the castle bookshop she was looking in the bookshop window when worlds collided again there on the fringe of a display of books on local history was a largeformat paperback with a red and white cover and heraldic symbols in each corner in one of those moments of total awareness of everything around her she went into the shop could i just have a copy of that book in the window everyday life in the middle ages in pictures she heard the bookseller saying that he thought it was the last copy making a note to reorder some as she pulled out her purse somebody had laid a wreath at the foot of the yew tree where theyd found jemima pegler no name on it no identifying card some of the pink and white flowers were already browning petals picked off by the wind merrily looked up into the denseness of the yew tree which was said to have grown on the spot where the body of marion de la bruyère had come to rest the tree threw a circle of darkness it was probably hundreds of years old its leathery trunk knobbed and warted and suggestive here and there of twisted faces behind it was the dizzying sheerness of cliff wall tower sky about a dozen black window spaces had been punched in the tower walls irregular like holes in cheese this girl jemima came out of one of them jon scole said didnt look too bad according to what people say ill have to use her eventually shell become part of the myth you think thats tasteless its what you do merrily said walking down from the linney very steep too narrow for cars old houses on one side built up against the castle walls hed told merrily about his efforts to get some kind of relationship going with bell pepper whose weir house was below them hidden in the bristle of pines above the river seeing the look on her face hed gone backing off hands up tangled blond hair bobbing chains jangling whoa no not that kind of relationship when im with her im dead careful to make sure we dont accidentally like touch no blue sparks blue sparks apart from us being not exactly contemporaries mary it would probably ruin any chance of a business arrangement he was probably right to be cautious it was unlikely for instance that callum corey would be lured back to the weir house no matter how much money was on the table what kind of business arrangement did you have in mind dunno really but if i cant make a few quid out of her who can you selling her albums in the shop sore point mary i started selling the albums nightshades very moody cover and then doug lackland georges elder son he drops in one afternoon for a discreet word jon did the accent now we dont want to underline that shes livin here do we jonathan cds quietly disappear dougie bought the lot no skin off my nose but its not on is it theyd followed the rising stone wall to the walkway below the castle along which jon said demure edwardian ladies with parasols had once paraded as distinct from a volatile viking in a motorbike jacket and a scruffy little vicar in jeans a wellworn fleece and tinted glasses see where that shelf of rock projects he said now back of jemmies head hit that with some force so that were a bit messy you know but her face wasnt damaged thats what they say its kind of a what would you say an elemental way to go people say youre dead before you hit the ground merrily said dully or maybe thats when the parachute doesnt open she looked up it doesnt seem far enough for that the clouds empurpled by merrilys glasses were foaming now with notquiterain she walked up to a jagged crevice in the bottom of the rock face or the castle foundations it was like the beginnings of a cave or a recess where a statue should be placed a natural shrine someone had left a small posy of flowers in there anemones wouldve smashed every bone in her body jon scole said i thought you said no im thinking marion now wouldve been all rock down here then i spect its worn away a lot in eight centuries and she most likely came from the top its a very violent way to go merrily said a tumult of emotion there a feeling of betrayal sure but shed also just killed the man shed loved absolute desolation you talk like robbie jon said what robbie the way hed talk you through it this little stunted kid in a woolly hat under a lantern in the dark he didnt use big words like desolation but hed tell you about all these enemy soldiers swarming up the rope ladder swords and knives coming out the guards and retainers not expecting it having their throats cut stone stairs all slippery with blood marion running up ahead of them wi blood all over her nightdress and her hands soaked from hacking to death as you say the man she loved and i remember robbie said she was sick he said she had to stop on the stairs to be sick i mean thats not in the story is it rings true though if you imagine all the adrenalin and the extreme violence the heavy action going on all around with the enemy pouring in everything happening so fast and her own frenzied reaction when she worked out what shed let happen and then she looks back for a moment realizes what shes just done to arnold de lisle and her stomach jon scole smiled you want a parttime job a twig snapped under merrilys shoe and she spun round youre even scaring yourself jon said was he that vivid about all the ghost stories robbie fair to say that were probably his best because if it wasnt an accident and he killed himself because he couldnt bear to leave his beloved ludlow why did he jump off the wrong tower why didnt he jump off marions tower jon blew out his lips got me there i mean i remember he used to say we couldnt really be sure of anything because a lot of the castle were built afterwards after marion died that is which was back in the reign of henry ii or somewhere around there so it wouldve all looked different then anyway but marion didnt throw herself off the keep thats a certainty isnt it its a longer drop though you can go right to the top youd be more sure of a result jon scole walked over to the ancient yew fingered its swarthy resinous skin if this old bugger could talk he grinned maybe it can a lot of mysticism around yew trees so ive heard all about immortality mary yews go on for ever some of them are two thousand years old theyve always got them in churchyards and sometimes theyre older than the church i dont think thats my kind of immortality merrily said rooted in one spot for ever and ever that would depend on the spot the woman said it was hard to say how long shed been standing there on the edge of the path her back to the river and the hills and the forestry she wasnt wearing a cape just one of those anklelength barbour stockmans coats in dark blue fastened to the top the stormflap half covering her chin merrily thought how quiet she looks how demure how genteel actually i understood that yew trees did well in churchyards because they thrived on corpses the woman said tonguing the yew it was strange the fame thing you told yourself that you would never be overawed by people just because youd seen them on tv or they were in the cabinet or the royal family experience had told you that movie stars and government ministers were often narrow and paranoid and that power not only corrupted it reduced but it was different with someone who had been famous in the days when youd been impressed by celebrity and notoriety there was some part of you that wasnt going to let go of that and the old shiver went through merrily historians say the sacred tree of the druids was the oak that voice of dark green glass but the druids wouldnt have got it that wrong merrily said nothing but found she was nodding in that instinctive subservient way she always despised still oaks versus yews wasnt something she had an opinion on anyway i love and venerate them mrs pepper said some protected oaks on my land were apparently removed no big deal oaks are all right solid dependable functional but they havent got the intellect or the cunning or the true key to survival isnt that right jonathan if you say so maam jon scole bowed his head he actually did that so my yew ive got this incredible yew at home something ensured that it was left well alone when they took out the oaks because removing the yew would have been a very bad thing to do wouldnt it even jonathan knows that jon scole did another small bow if there was an underlying disrespect here it wasnt immediately obvious mrs pepper came up onto the path her long coat making a soft slithery sound around her she approached the tree in the great yewtree scheme of things this ones still pretty young but it was born out of death talking as if she was addressing a larger group the yew communicates natures most important message about death within life life within death she had the rhythm going now the glistening seamless voice which used to step down midsong into the spoken word without losing the flow merrily tried to bring up all the loony images the sanitary goods under the misericords the bodies rolling in the ivy among the graves the lime mix fortified with pubic hair somehow none of this diminished her im going to do the lecture now short one dont worry heres what happens after one or two centuries the heart of the tree begins to die which is why so many of them are hollow but the outer layer just goes on growing around the hollow space and the tree gets wider and thicker when a branch breaks off the yew selfheals and puts out new shoots and they go on like that for sometimes thousands of years immortality jon said awesome the sky was a deep soft grey now and mrs pepper shone against it her plaited hair had the remains of many colours in it a woven rainbow she bared her teeth which were small and mischievously pointed and her big eyes were a startling turquoise and whats really cunning about the yew is that the death of the heartwood eradicates the rings by which you can tell how old the tree is so the yew becomes totally fucking ageless my kind of tree she opened her arms and embraced the yew and put out her tongue to its warty pigskin trunk merrily thinking spare us the theatrics please as belladonna began to lick the bark of the yew tree a slow intense liquid lapping for gods sake merrily yelled its pois bell pepper looked over her shoulder gaze locked on merrilys tongue curling up around her upper lip then slowly retracted between small pointed teeth country girl eh i just know its very poisonous merrily said to animals anyway it kills cows and horses another reason its said they were planted in churchyards was so that farmers would keep their cattle out predates both farming and churchyards sweetheart even jonathan knows that mrs pepper bent her head on one side kissed the tree lavishly with her mouth open and then she moved away smiling the neck of her coat undone her throat exposed turning to merrily so who are you darling youre not the woman uh this is mary jon scole said mary this is bell hello merrily said bell bell looked cross jonathan im not sure you heard me i said is this the woman jon scole seemed worried for a few moments he looked down at the base of the tree hacking his trainer into the dust hands in his pockets nervously flapping his motorbike jacket and making his chains rattle when he looked up though his old smile was returning he didnt look at merrily but he beamed at bell pepper yeah he said thats right this is the woman a face projected onto an alreadyfraught night by blue emergency beacons that was just an image this quiet confrontation on a mild cloudy afternoon was something else especially when the face this icon of punkgoth perversity was suddenly behaving entirely in accordance with the legend tonguing the yew for heavens sake merrily trying to be dismissive maybe belladonna just wasnt getting enough attention these days maybe that was the answer to all of it so not picking up at first on what jon scole was doing this is the woman oh shit this is really unfair jon said mary hasnt the faintest idea what were talking about i havent even told her about any of this yet wed just like walked over here and i were im sorry mary i was gonna put it to you later like i know you dont just do this for everybody and money doesnt make any difference but i thought maybe this once you know merrily stayed silent jon scole tossed back his flaxen locks and put his hands together as if in prayer his gaze locked on to merrilys and he raised an eyebrow fractionally bells house just down there tipping a thumb towards the river i was gonna ask you to take a look at it see if you got anything now he was looking at her hard his mouth slightly smiling his eyes imploring i see merrily said as a psychometrist jon said as uh a psychic mrs pepper said im sorry mary is it mary i mustve made a very unfavourable first impression this boy tends to bring out the worst in me its just his way merrily said so im going to carry on with my walk bell refastened her coat let you two work this out she moved off the way theyd come up towards the linney and the centre of the town her feet were bare inside skimpy sandals and it occurred to merrily that she could well be entirely naked under the stockmans coat or maybe that was just the legend talking down the path now the castle opening out on their left as they walked jon scole trampling last years brambles im not gonna apologize for this mary you wanted to get close to her this is your chance you set me up merrily said i were thinkin on me feet i said id help you and i have i told you about her the way she is thinks she senses but she wants someone to help her know if i told her you were clergy you wouldnt get within a mile and if she knew you were an exorcist she wants her ghosts exorcizing like she wants a double mastectomy merrily zipped up her fleece sank her hands into its pockets the day swirling around her out of control she said she gets strong feelings coming off the house jon said i say why dont you get a medium in she goes dead sneery shes like oh i used to go to mediums once spiritualist churches they were a joke plus they kept bringing god into it doing little prayers isnt her house a new house strictly speaking built out of the ruins of the old though she reckons it was connected with the castle shes opened up a pathway so she can walk up here to the yew see this is where it begins bells walk a big circle up the linney through the churchyard down to st leonards graveyard route marked out by ancient yews and then back through the town ok im getting the picture what did you tell her about me well it wasnt about you to begin with this goes back to me saying look bell some mates of mine theyre psychic investigators which is true they got all the kit and theyve had some good results why dont we come in i say give your place a full goingover she says forget it because what it is she doesnt trust anybody she thinks theyre gonna talk about it sell the story and she doesnt trust me because i make money out of it and shes been ripped off too many times by fakes and phoneys so i say ok i know somebody a psychic a psychometrist whos so red hot she wont do it for money in fact she wont do it at all unless its to further her researches know what i mean the real thing well she was interested i could tell straight off she was interested and do you know a psychometrist well kind of but i were taking it dead slow i see her periodically and i go bloody hell i saw that woman and i forgot to flaming mention it bugger letting her think its no big deal to me but avoiding giving her the womans name because this woman doesnt exist right uh not exactly jon stopped there was a bench up against the castle wall near a gateway into the outer ruins he gestured for merrily to sit down you really do sail close to the wind dont you jon what lifes all about mary int it see theres a friend of mine lives over in bewdley does the same business ghostwalks anyway i met this girl when i were just setting up and we had a bit of a thing going and she give me a few tips still do each other favours she was gonna do it play the psychic for me but shes not a psychic well we all are a bit arent we i mean its easy there are staples in haunted houses man in uniform woman at the window baby crying cold spots its how mediums do it you mention something old geezer always wore a muffler somebody goes yeah thats my grandad only in a house they go yeah i did feel something in that pantry piece of piss mary well forgive me for being im telling you you go in there tell her you can hear a baby crying or something i guarantee youll get a result jon have you forgotten what i do normally godll protect you then wont he look you genuinely know about this stuff right what you were giving me earlier about phantasms of the living thats serious indepth knowledge you could carry it off no problem i tell you she thinks shes getting something out of you shes a pussycat and what do you want out of this jon what do you want out of her it was a still day you could hear the weir over wales the sun was just visible like a coin pressed into tinfoil what do you think i want jon scole gripped his knees leaning forward how much you think it costs these days to have a shop in ludlow keep enough stock to attract people in i dont know me parents left me enough to get a bit of a business going but costs are always higher than you think theyre gonna be especially here the ghostwalks dont do badly in the season but its peanuts really and if the mayor and his family wanna squeeze me out they can do it any time could make sure the lease dont get renewed for a start he wouldnt do that he bloody would mary and could i afford to buy anything proper not the way propertys going in this town i thought you sold a café to the little chef jon sighed i sold a bit of land with a prefabricated transport caff on it no comparison with posh highstreet business premises in an upmarket place like this so youre looking for a backer in other words think what shes spent on that house and buying the land to stop the building you heard about that imagine what that cost bought it straight out no financial juggling required imagine so if she sees you as someone whos done her a few favours who knows bit of a tightrope ill give you that he rubbed his eyes im sorry tove hung this on you i just thought well obviously i didnt think at all did i i just come out with it he looked a bit lost he was younger than hed seemed maybe no more than thirty the beard was deceptive as it was no doubt intended to be look he said you go back to your vicarage have a think and if i dont hear from you again well its been interesting hasnt it theres just one problem here jon supposing we find out that she did something that could take her away from here how would that help you what to prison well im not going to arrest her im just a jobbing priest but im under no illusions girl jon said the day she finds it impossible to live in ludlow thats the mayors birthday and you wouldnt shed any tears neither if you found robbies death was in some way down to bell but i reckon whatever you did find out youd accept it wouldnt you you wouldnt try to twist it or move the goalposts so if it turns out shes ok out of her tree but basically harmless thats all right int it well have to see i believe in fate me jon scole said whatevers gonna happen is gonna happen merrily got back into the car and lit a cigarette it could hardly be worse could it either she could go along with it faking ridiculous psychic skills just to gain some kind of access to bell pepper and then what or make an ignominious retreat put the whole issue in front of the deliverance panel let them dismiss it out of hand accept an official rebuke for not informing them earlier and then wait for the axe to fall how the hell had she got into this she supposed the paper bag on the passenger seat answered that question she picked it up and shook out the book everyday life in the middle ages in pictures what had a boy as cluedup as robbie walsh wanted with a picture book anyway she laid it on the passenger seat and flicked through it expecting cartoonlike artists impressions in fact most of the illustrations seemed to be from old engravings stained glass carvings on tombs this made more sense he would have wanted as authentic an illustration as possible of what life in the middle ages had been like it had obviously been important to him as hed walked these streets to see through medieval eyes why had that been so important why had an evidently personable adolescent boy needed to retreat through time what had made the present so unbearable she leafed through the book the reason shed bought it for for where the page had been ripped out just one missing page and the facing one had been about trial by ordeal was that it she turned to the chapter headed medieval misdeeds and retribution page ninetyone had a reproduction of a sombre woodcut depicting a man hanging from a gibbet his head bowed over a tightened noose several people were gathered around watching some appeared to be smiling merrily stared at it recalling how the page had been quite carefully removed from robbies copy the reverse page ninetytwo had a black and white photograph of the reconstruction of a medieval wooden gibbet from some interpretive museum immediately she was hearing bernie dunmore telling her how bell pepper might have been dealt with in times gone by on gallows hill still preserved as open space in ludlow unfortunately i think our old execution site is underneath plascarreg dont you dare make anything of that she wasnt about to it seemed unlikely to be relevant but it was worth mentioning and so she called mumford no answer she rang the bishop managed to get him at home he even seemed relieved to hear her woke up in the night deeply troubled about all this merrily wondering what id let you in for came out in a sweat couldnt get a handle on what i was expecting you to resolve just some great amorphous wrongness ludicrous a great amorphous wrongness i do like talking to an experienced metaphysician pack it in and come home it was stupid of me to even we cant disappoint dennis beckett now bernie erm something that keeps coming up the palmers guild whats that about in what context you remember the mayor told us mrs pepper was setting up a trust to help conserve old buildings in ludlow shes apparently named it after the palmers guild which may have built the original house on the site where shes living theres a window in the church im not an expert on this merrily but you cant operate in ludlow without coming across the guild sometimes spelt gild without the u in the old way they were probably the original ludlow conservationists kept the church standing anyway started i think in the thirteenth century when a great deal of wealth in the town was coming out of the wool industry guilds conferred a kind of pseudoaristocratic social standing on rich businessmen they invested in property a couple of hundred properties at one time some of the income was used for the benefit of members who had fallen on hard times it was a cooperative movement but the religious side of it right the palmers window in st laurences has eight stainedglass panels depicting what we can only think of as a legend put about to give the palmers some authenticity it was said that in the eleventh century pilgrims from ludlow had brought back a ring from st john the evangelist which they presented to the king of england at the time edward the confessor thats what the window illustrates its probably a fabrication on which basis the guild appointed priests right to devote their prayers to speeding its deceased members out of purgatory a medieval conceit difficult for us to comprehend but its clear that this was the main function of the guild started out employing three chaplains who also served the parish church but there were as many as eight in the fifteenth century catering to the whims of four thousand guild members a lot of prayer a lot of masses all focused on immortality they were certainly considerably more concerned about what happens afterwards than our society even if they did think god was open to backhanders i met mrs pepper this afternoon merrily tamped out her cigarette in the ashtray briefly and did she appear mad on one level barking she was kissing a yew tree i beg your kissing a yew tree very sensuously i dont know how to react to that the yew is natures prime symbol of immortality im just trying to find a link here with the palmers guild who built her house and who evidently had a similar obsession no more than anyone in those days and this woman doesnt appear to be particularly well disposed towards christianity but shes very much obsessed with placememories ghosts the way that ludlow exists in more than one timeframe its as if she wants to experience other i dont know i dont know if there are hallucinogenic drugs involved here or what its fascinating in a way my impression was that she was putting on a show today partly because she used to be a rock singer at the theatrical end of the business and outrageous exhibitionism comes naturally and partly because its a good smokescreen people think youre mad they leave you alone how people react to your madness tells you whether they sorry you still there bernie merrily youre not i dont like to think of you being drawn into anything me i realize you must be feeling terribly insecure at the moment insecure merrily said shes evidently looking for some kind of security acceptance but by whom not by george lackland clearly by the dead merrily said do you think all the big words merrily didnt remember when jane had last been this amused turning off the coral on the cd player coming back to the sofa and curling up in the lamplight with a cushion clutched to her chest like she used to do when she was twelve small pulses of amusement producing little choking noises in her throat this fiendish smile could be the longdelayed beginning mum the start of the new you in floaty frocks and snaky bangles and itll be like so cool that you never return to the grim old church and the future opens out for you like like something that opens out a sunflower whatever and well give up the vicarage merrily said and put our names down for a mobile home with windchimes where we have to share a bedroom and a shower block with the neighbours and hell no youll live with lol lol merrily looked at the clock hed be on stage now having dealt with his nerves with the help of moira cairns for whom he was opening the woman who had coerced him back to gigs who had become a kind of talisman for lol maybe he should be living with moira cairns jane was staring at her wideeyed god had she actually said that out loud wow jane said youre actually still paranoid about moira oh thats rid hah im an actual grownup now jane this is because youve never met her jane said for what its worth when she first appeared i used to be worried about that too because she is admittedly mesmerically beautiful but also for someone whos almost a big star shes actually relatively ok she understands things she once called me a wee pain in the arse that was penetratingly perceptive of her seriously jane said there are things you could learn from moira like how to step back from other peoples problems and learn to live because when you think about it neither you nor lols ever had a normal life pregnant at nineteen widowed with a small and delightfully complex child while youre still in your twenties im sorry when did i ever say you were delightful and your only real experience of student life jane wrinkled her nose in distaste is bloody theological college as a mature student toting a kid like where were the years of clubbing and getting pissed and waking up in strange beds actually that was how it all what forget it hmm jane smiled and then her brow furrowed listen theres no penance to be paid mum i mean ok yeah weve finally got lol into the village but youre still not getting it right youre taking a week off the parish to do this privateeye stuff in ludlow for the bishop but you wont take a break to maybe go somewhere special with lol you know merrily repositioned herself on the sofa awkwardly i think i was happier when you were just laughing at the idea of me pretending to be psychic yeah well that was the wrong attitude ive decided to take it seriously jane put the cushion behind her on the sofa and sat up straight you need specialist advice or that woman is going to take you apart shell just like totally dismantle your façade in about ten minutes and you can erm school me can you jane shrugged ive read the books spent a few months if you recall attempting to worship the moon when i was young it was less than two years ago merrily looked into janes eyes surely greyer than they used to be i mean im not claiming to be anything more than some kind of failed neophyte mum but i reckon i could probably save you from total humiliation merrily considered this when exactly had janes paganism ceased to be a problem for her at first it had seemed like a basic teenage rebellion thing jane resenting the church seeing poor lucy devenish with her talk of applelore and nature spirits as a kind of guru and then after lucys death lying about her age to get into a goddessworshipping group based at a hereford healthfood shop in just a couple of years jane had encountered pagans and psychics good and bad and emerged at the age of seventeen oddly clearheaded yes it was still there in some form janes paganism but no it wasnt quite a problem any more all right merrily said can we go through it yew trees jane appeared to have read entire books about yew trees making love to one thats totally i mean i can connect with that are they poisonous to people im not sure i wouldnt personally exchange lifefluids with one to find out jane said but i do get the point shes embracing immortality some yew trees could be the oldest living beings on this planet and thats heavy the idea of a tree being a repository of ancient wisdom is not so crazy so if she has an ancient yew near her house and thats the start of her ritual walk and then she proceeds to this yew at the castle where marion fell wheres the next one bound to be one in the churchyard several apparently i think theres the remains of a yew alley merrily said i asked jon scole about that cool jane spread merrilys new street map of ludlow over the os map of the wider area and then one in this old cemetery st leonards yes so youve probably got an ancient and sacred route maybe even prechristian maybe a processional route up and over the holy hill between the two rivers if you think way back before there was a town or a castle thered just be this hill a holy hill how do you know it was holy hah jane beamed in satisfaction i looked it up its in one of my books upstairs and i got some more off the net this is amazing stuff the name ludlow right low usually refers to a tumulus or a burial mound and sure enough there was one where on top of the hills whats now the highest point of the town the church st laurences there was a tumulus which until the end of the twelfth century was right next to the original church and then they extended the church into the tumulus and found that it contained bodies bones which were alleged at the time to be the remains of three irish saints because in those days if anybody found any bones near a church it would be like more kudos if they were holy relics they were probably the bones of bronze age chieftains which is cool theyve gone now presumably doesnt matter what matters is that the tower the tallest tower on the border ok the cathedral of the marches is rising up directly out of a pagan site so its like jane held up a fist one of ours congratulations its what they did jane said these are geopsychically sensitive sites if the church hadnt built on existing places of power christianity would probably have vanished by the end of the middle ages so if belladonnas making a personal connection with the sacred centres of ludlow thats the big one well she certainly goes into the church even if she doesnt go to actual services there you go shes opening herself up to the vibrations opening herself up all right sorry never mind ethel jumped into merrilys lap and started to wash her paws what exactly is she doing do you think jane wheres she coming from we looking at witchcraft or what she on her own there are some young people who seem to have formed some sort of attachment to her when i first saw her she was with i think four of them two men two women all wearing edwardiantype gear slightly funereal could be part of a coven doesnt seem too likely though they just struck me as basic goths ok listen jane leaned into the corner of the sofa ive been thinking about this could she have any ancestry in the town are there any family roots she maybe wants to pick up on because that might explain why she was always with robbie walsh he couldve been helping research it couldnt he that seems to have been the kind of thing he enjoyed thats actually not a bad theory merrily said or if you want to extend it in a more mystical direction could she have been like hypnotically regressed into recalling some past life in ludlow for instance and this makes sense suppose she believes shes the reincarnation of somebody like for instance merrily brought her hands together marion de la bruyère well its a fascinating thought flower and it explains the suicide links jane said and its exactly the kind of bollocks a mad old slapper like belladonna would go for afterwards lol followed moira back up the m to the severn bridge services where she was spending the night they sat in the café by the big windows where you could see the sweep of the suspension bridge into wales and the lights bouncing off the estuarys dark water ive never done that before lol said never two verses in freezing up in the heat of the lights standing quivering like the mental patient he was singing about you mean it wasnae deliberate moira raised an eyebrow cup of hot chocolate held in both hands like a chalice even i thought it was part of the act and when you started laughing like that couldnt stop doubled up hed noticed her watching him from the shadows at the side of the stage in her long seagreen dress the strand of white in her hair like the crack of light down a doorway at night expecting her to walk on gently detach the mike and salvage his set not necessary as it turned out the audience had started laughing with him with no idea why in the lobby afterwards moiras merchandising guy had sold over sixty copies of alien now he was higher than the severn bridge and every so often he would shiver at the memory it was a wild moment but you never looked back moira said you were soaring like a gull im thinking jesus hes become a performer at last wee lol however just for the record why shed put down her cup her hair was tied up now she wore a grey woolly sweater and white jeans go on just out of interest for m personal files mustve been the song lol admitted its always that song its got something in it i cant always control heavy medication day the day i refused to take the pills lol remembered dr gascoigne said and i remember him leaning over me i was sitting in a highbacked chair in the main dayroom and id turned it away from the tv and he leaned over me and he said in my ear dont go thinking youre ever going to leave here mr robinson you see that door one day when ive been long retired to the south of france youll be straining to get your zimmer frame through it jesus this is a shrink this is how they talk well its been said before but its true that if it wasnae for the white coat youd never know which were the patients right i tell you what by the time youd finished laughing and you did the whole song again they were with you for the duration um to change the subject slightly i was talking to tom storey poor tom moira said wasnae so rich and famous hed probably have been under the shrinks years ago moira had once way back been in a band with tom storey it was a very small pond the british folkrock scene lol told her how hed wound up talking to tom moira rolled her eyes belladonna eh the extraordinary bell used to fancy the hell out of tom simply because he was rumoured to be you know sensitive amazing the number of women went after him because of that to guys a guitar hero to women a psychic guitar hero none of them realizing it was the best way to have the poor guy heading for the airport bell couldnae figure it at all she couldve had anybody at that time you knew her nobody knew her we did a couple of the same festivals you did one i recall thisd be before america discovered her she was older than me and always kind of superior shes an artist slumming and im this folkclub kid on the make and she resented me probably for the same reason she fancied tom because shed heard you were a touch fey aye oh and shed made a wee pass at me and got soundly rebuffed that didnae help went both ways she went a hundred ways laurence although i tend to think the allegations of actual necrophilia were no more than malicious gossip it was all a major fetish thing other bands and singers it was a phase her it went on when goth stuff was no longer bigmoney cool so so there had to be a cause lol said always a cause theyre saying even schizophrenias no something youre born with the guy i did know was eric bryers her boyfriend way back session bassplayer absolutely besotted with bell do anything for her coke smack acid if you get ma point she was gonnae have his child and everything and it was all cosycosy then she suddenly disappears this is erics version of events and the next he hears of her shes in la and a big star with no mention of a baby had it adopted tom said he was furious ah the adoption story thats one version what i heard the baby was stillborn and she had a big funeral for it fancy gothic grave that would be more in keeping last time i saw eric he aw he was busking with another guy in manchester i had a gig at the free trade hall and there he was busking im ashamed to say i couldnae face him so i walked past quick with ma scarf around ma head and slipped all the cash i had on me intae his hat talked to a guy some time later said eric used to follow bells gigs around the country busking near the theatres and getting arrested and moved on i think he had a solid habit by then and nobody was using him dead now aye they got him off the smack and he turned to drink and his behaviour became erratic and one day the poor devil threw himself off the top of a skyscraper block in london like seress lol started to feel a little weird what rezso seress gloomy sunday its late moira said start again there was this song about suicide which according to the urban myths has been leading to people actually topping themselves by a hungarian rezso seress he also died by throwing himself off a building the hungarian suicide song occasionally gets covered by artists feeling a bit daring bell very faithful version exactly like the original down to the scratches see thats just the kind of fuckin stupid thing that woman would do moira said the way eric was i can actually imagine him sitting there playing the damn thing over and over and refilling his glass id like to give her a good slap you ever see her now not in years shes well off the circuit doesnae need it weird kids keep rediscovering her they also began using her music on commercials a lot when tv commercials started becoming so diffuse and surreal you werent sure what they were advertising stroke me poke me invoke me however that shit went only it would be a car you staying here tonight going home i think its only just over an hour home moira said thats such a nice word isnt it it seemed unlikely hed be back yet but around midnight merrily went to the end of the vicarage drive to see if there was a light on at lols there wasnt there were no lights on anywhere in church street it was a warm night with no moon she lit a cigarette looked up at the window of janes attic apartment and there was no light there either good the kid had done enough research for one night kid it wasnt respectful even to think of her as a kid any more she was smart and funny and perceptive and increasingly good to have around and in eighteen months time shed almost certainly be leaving home home merrily turned her back on the vicarage it had never really felt like home seven bedrooms how the hell could she live here alone maybe one of the other five parishes shed be invited to take on would have a smaller vicarage or maybe when jane finished school it would be time to move on out of the diocese maybe the writing was already on the wall next to a hazy outline sketch of siân callaghanclarke in episcopal purple the image made her angry and she thought sod it im going to do it mary the bloody psychic you know the way to be really convincing as a psychometrist jane had said as she went up to bed just wander around and dont say a thing dont claim youve had any visions or sensations at all say absolutely nothing what good will that do because all phoney psychics come out with a mass of crap and when you respond to some detail they snatch on it and thats how it works if you say nothing shell think either you dont want to reveal what youve picked up until youre absolutely certain or you know it would scare the pants off her made sense merrily pinched out her cigarette and went in lol drove across the bridge into wales and slowly up the border along the deep moontinted greenwashed wye valley into the lights of monmouth and back into england and up towards home yes it would be overstating it to say that moira could read you like a book but she could see all the big words in your life as if they were spelled out in neon on your forehead home that was one of them the last time hed lived in ledwardine it had been a refuge the place hed hidden rather than lived in now well now he actually felt he was probably the right person to be in the house of lucy devenish and merrily that would work itself out it had to because she was the real meaning of home he left the astra on the square alongside the oakpillared market hall perhaps he should think about renting a garage somewhere tonight theyd sold more copies of his album than theyd sold of moiras well ok most of the audience would already have had all moiras albums so that was understandable but sixty copies it was twenty to two in the morning friday morning ledwardine hanging in timeless silence a bat flittering overhead lol stood for a moment on the cobbles looking across at the vicarage drive a small dim light on somewhere in the woody heart of the old house there should always he thought be a light in there tears came into his eyes and he hurried away remembering as he often would the first night hed met merrily when ethel the cat had been given a kicking by karl windling and lol had wound up carrying her to the vicarage and merrily had tended ethel and although it had been a very bad night for her in ways that he hadnt yet known about shed sat down and lit a cigarette and had said in a voice full of ironic uncertainty talk to me mr robinson im a priest lol unlocked the door and stumbled through the darkness towards the parlour until he remembered he had power he had power he clicked the switch and the bulb over the foot of the stairs drizzled out its lowwattage light lampshade lol thought lampshade tomorrow a rectangle of white shit before hed picked the envelope off the mat he knew what it was somehow hed forgotten he really had forgotten hadnt thought about it for ages it belonged to the days of oil lamps and painttrays before he had power he almost crumpled it up and threw it away but the night had already darkened he tore it open at the door and held it under the bulb your a sick man how long you been hitting her victim next morning as soon as jane had left for school merrily drove straight to hereford letting herself into the gatehouse office with her own key before sophie had arrived dresseddown again jeans and fleece as yesterday she sat at sophies desk and rang lol on his mobile still switched off she left her second sohowdiditgo message of the morning she knew he was back shed seen his car on the square outside it was raining hard broad street speckled with umbrellas in the dullness of the office the figure was glowing from the message window on the answering machine no glow however in the messages sophie i think we must talk on the subject of office reorganization and mrs watkins call me please thank you callaghanclarke clipped concise and ominous the teacher see me and so barefaced about it because mrs watkins was on holiday finding she could hardly get her breath merrily was close to phoning back herself instead she lit a cigarette her hands unsteady fumbling with the zippo listening to the second message andy mumford mrs watkins tried to get you before you left dont know whether you listened to the local radio actually in the car on the way here shed been listening to lols album with the volume well up his breathy vocals on camera lies reassuring with their sense of his need the camera lies she might vaporize a song hed written in the tingling dawn of their relationship big dawn raid on the plascarreg mumford was saying sophie arrived turning in the doorway and shaking her umbrella over the stone stairwell she heard the answering machine left the umbrella outside and came in to listen large selection of class a drugs removed three dealers nicked it looks like well too much of a coincidence see wouldnt surprise me if mebus and his little mates hadnt grassed up their neighbours with a view to avoiding prosecution i been trying to get my relative on the phone without success so far but ill keep you informed thank you merrily put the machine on hold and then played the message again mumford had not sounded exactly euphoric but then if jason mebus was back on the streets without a stain and where had jason found the nerve to grass up his neighbours something didnt sound right long overdue sophie said half the drugs in hereford seem to have come through that estate i had the radio on just before leaving the house and its now five arrests quantities of heroin and crackcocaine with a street value of somewhere around threequarters of a million pounds thats huge for hereford therell be large and possibly liquid breakfasts in the police canteen no doubt sophie slipped out of her coat hung it behind the door theres also a message from siân callaghanclarke merrily said wants to talk to you about office reorganization one can hardly contain ones anticipation sophie said and about me in which case i ought to call her back while youre still here however you didnt come in to pass on my messages did you im in a quandary merrily said need advice from a wise and entirely balanced individual sophie nodded it wouldnt be arrogance that stopped her denying these qualities she just didnt believe in wasting time she sat down on what was usually merrilys side of the desk tell me merrily had taken it as far as the encounter with belladonna outside the castle walls more bizarre the more she thought about it when the phone rang she motioned for sophie to take it gatehouse sophie said ah good morning canon callaghanclarke merrily pulled her bag across the desk took out the cigarettes and the zippo the call lasted less than five minutes but seemed longer most of sophies replies were monosyllabic and negative no not at all never but her minimal facial responses sent out signals of extreme danger at one point a corner of her mouth twitched sharply as though a wasp had landed there finally she said calmly canon clarke i think youll find that such a conclusion is absolutely and utterly preposterous when she put the phone down the rain was stopping and a gauzy sunlight powdered part of the room when sophie reached out and clicked on the desk lamp merrily sensed this was as was customary with siân going to be worse than she could have imagined sophie straightened the notepad on the desk took a long breath and let it escape slowly as youve probably guessed merrily that wasnt about office reorganization it was entirely about you theres flattering no sophie said no i didnt think it would be to begin with she said she didnt want to hear any more manufactured stories from me because she now knew precisely why youd suddenly felt compelled to take a holiday shes bluffing couldnt possibly know unless bernie nothing to do with that nothing to do with the bishop or ludlow or ms pepper sophie coughed you appear to have taken a holiday to conceal the fact that youve become a victim of domestic violence merrily sprang out of her chair ill make some tea sophie said lol rang how did it go merrily trying to sound bright the way you did in church on grey sundays it was really good his own tone was small and somehow distant as though it was floating inside a balloon they sold over sixty copies of the cd thats incredible lol yes profll be mmm he will and it was ok i mean on stage in the end ill tell you tonight maybe definitely and they went on like that for another minute or so this thick wedge of the unspoken between them furtive fingers of sunlight sliding between the rainclouds and across the desk steam rising as sophie poured boiling water into the pot merrily put the phone down and stared at it as if it might be bugged cant have leaked out through mumford and it couldnt have come out of hereford i didnt even take off the other glasses to try on the new ones in chave and jackson just held them up to the light which leaves only one source you live in a village sophie carried the teapot to the desk with a shop called in the other night for a bottle of wine and some cigarettes and i left my glasses in the car never thought about it but i thought the people there the prossers are fine theyd never no it was nighttime you see and the new girl paris was on the till that is new to the shop not the village ledwardine born and bred she probably told everybody who came in and everybody she met on the way home i didnt think im so stupid and how would it get to canon clarke i can guess merrily stood up and took off her glasses in disgust what exactly did she say about lol she said that theres no nice way i can put this that someone had suggested this was no more than anyone could expect if they became involved with a mental patient with his history who merrily was hot with fury who knowing him would say that canon clarke said how regrettable it was that so many people still had such a primitive attitude towards mental illness but he merrily hurled her cigarette packet at the desk lol was never i know that and she has no reason to think that either but she chooses not to correct anyones impression merrily sat down hands dangling between her knees head thrown back what am i going to do about this soph merrily most black eyes have quite a simple explanation connected with tripping up cupboard doors no they dont most black eyes are caused by people getting hit i go around now telling people ive walked into a lamppost whats that going to sound like at this stage and i obviously cant exactly open the plascarreg can of worms can i i mean apart from implicating mumford it would seem a bit coincidental after todays news im im stuffed here sophie and the worst thing of all ive damaged lol do you want to hear the rest not particularly canon clarke is wondering judging by your recent erratic behaviour erratic how if this violence hasnt been a longterm difficulty not unknown in her experience among the female clergy who are sometimes rather too assiduous about turning the other cheek that woman is so full of crap husbands who resent the ubiquity of religion in the home become violently jealous of god so many cases have come to light apparently that theres a special counselling service operating now within the church for just such situations i know merrily said but this sophie has it occurred to you why shes telling you about it i assume because its the quickest way of getting it back to you exactly why i dont know perhaps rather fewer people than you fear have been exposed to this nonsense however if you start to overreact and go around looking for people to blame youre going to spread it over quite a wide circle perhaps thats what she wants you do think she has an agenda then we both know she has an agenda merrily i think its probably no more complicated than a ferocious ambition you know the archdeacons suggesting they hang a bunch of extra parishes on me oh so thats true who planted the idea i suspect well never get further than a guess its fairly clear that an antideliverance movement is gathering ground within the diocese i dont know how were going to fight it but my feeling is that the best way to frustrate this stupid rumour is for you to continue as normal not rise to it wearing the glasses or not not i should say you have absolutely nothing to hide if necessary tell people exactly what happened you dont have to name the estate anyway the swellings reduced considerably this morning and lol what does he do what does he tell people hes the one they wont ask sophie said im afraid smoke bastards gomer parry accepted a glass of cider thank you boy longer i live the less number of folks i gives a shit about and thats a fact bloody gossipmongering bastards gomer sat on lols new sofa it was coming up to ten am he took off his cap and his white hair sprayed out in different directions like an old wallpaperbrush he said hed been out early giving the churchyard a bit of a trim casually chatting to folks as they came through and it had come filtering out people interested in talking to gomer this morning because they knew he was well in with the vicar all sorts of ole wallop folks remembering how they seen the vicar creeping out of yere at night furtivelike like hers got someing to be ashamed of some daft bitch in the shop her even said the reason alison kinnersley cleared out went off with bulldavies was you was slappin her around a bit too lol shook his head wearily gomer that is just aye gomer put down his cider glass got out his ciggy tin i says listen you go and ask alison you ask bloody bulldavies isself bastards all this ole wallop makes you sick to the gut one day youre a hero next its oh we knew what he was all along that feller look boy im sorry to have to bring this to your door but i figured you needed to know what was goin around im grateful lol was standing by the inglenook the hearth stale with dead ash howd she actually get it boy the bruise you dont mind me kids it was on the plascarreg estate in hereford she was helping andy mumford family thing and there was a struggle with some kids nothing to miserable andy hes off the streets now ent he retired but not exactly off the streets his nephew ar yeard that boy come off the castle was his nephew gomer licked the end of a cigarette paper all goes deep with mumford see not a happy family i remember his ole man reg mumford when he was a copper hard bastard too fond of discipline you get my meaning too handy with his bloody belt was the word has an effect see vicar should take more care you tell her from me i will lol wondered if even gomer might have harboured some small suspicion that the rumour might be true and that was why hed come in or out of a jcb gomer believed in direct action shovelling away all the rubble until you reached the core of whatever it was come on then boy gomer fired up a ciggy spit it out the ole planthires been a bit slack lately see so i been letting danny do the lions share needs the money moren me you and the vicar wants me to hire a loudspeaker van go up and down the streets shaming these bastards i got the time no no god look gomer i was wondering is it possible to trace the source of these stories gomer thought about it lucy devenish could do it only one as ever could just by lookin in folks eyes lucy was so deep into this village herd just go round asking questions and gazin into peoples faces folks spreads stuff they reckons is probly lies see theyll never quite look you in the eye once you finds the one knows its a lie youre getting close so this isnt just gossip lol said no the light boiled in gomers glasses not in my view it ent orchestrated thats the word why some bastard got it in for the vicar cant believe that whats her ever done but her best last vicar old alf hayden he dint give a monkeys bumbling round the village howre you howre you did he care did he hell they dont deserve a decent minister half o these bastards what you got there boy lol brought the two anonymous notes over spread them on the sofa next to gomer gomer took off his glasses cleaned them on his sleeve and then read each note slowly you been to the cops boy whats the point theyre not threatening letters you reckon janes been round checking the parish noticeboard the adverts in the shop window trying to compare the writing worst thing is see the vicar could go in the pulpit on sunday denounce the whole thing in public and folksd still be shakin their daft heads going no smoke without fire kind of thing she wont be in the pulpit next sunday lol said theres another guy booked to take the services bugger gomer took out his ciggy tin that ent gonner help is it folksll think hers gone to one o them shelters whend the last one come last night i had a concert over in bristol didnt get back till the early hours many folks yere know you was gonner be out that long apart from merrily and jane nobody chances were it got delivered not long after you went out then ent much cover in this street likely they was seen you reckon possible gomer chewed the end of his ciggy quite possible around midmorning mumford rang he hadnt quite got his old voice back but there was a crunch to it that hadnt been there since hed retired i was right mrs watkins sorry mebus well he wasnt the grass nor chainboy nor chainboys halfbrother it was another boy with them niall collins he told em where the warehouse was one of the industrial workshops between plascarreg and the barn church crack and heroin turnover of twenty grand a week near enough did we meet this niall the other night i reckon he was the one shouted there was a car coming when there wasnt yellow fleece i remember thinking he looked a bit worried about the way it was going he would be thirteen and no form first offence see mate of robbies as it happened not a big mate he didnt have any big mates but this niall talked to him a bit as distinct from bullying him thats about it this nialls family his dad lost his job house repossessed and they wound up on the plascarreg dad hates it the drug culture the need for five locks on your front door fairly decent family in other words i expect most people there are so what happens the dad talks to one of the uniforms says hes tried to keep his boy away from the scum but its an impossible job on that estate says theres a lot the boy knows about what goes on but if they spills the beans they cant very well go back living next to the families of the buggers they helped put away so the uniform fixes up for mr collins to talk to bliss oh good aye result is when all the police vehicles turns up on the plascarreg at dawn today theres a furniture van behind them while the raids on all the shouting and screaming the collinses flats being quietly emptied of all their furniture and off they goes into temporary accommodation off the patch got to hand it to bliss except that letting the collins boy off with a caution they had to reduce the charges for the others no abh any more for mebus be down to causing an affray or some feeble rubbish like that who told you all this mumford was silent just that it helps to know when im talking to bliss wouldnt like to accidentally finger your contact merrily heard mumford sniff karen dowell it is blisss new bagcarrier second cousin twice removed whatever bloods still thicker than canteen tea keep this very much to yourself mrs watkins of course how are you feeling now andy hard to say mumford said bliss gets a handful of collars hes happy but that dont bring out the truth about robbie walsh do it it might why dont you ease off for a bit you called last night mumford said got you off oh she told him about the missing page from everyday life in the middle ages and what the bishop had said about the execution site probably nothing mumford grunted said hed keep her informed when she put the phone down there wasnt even time to tell sophie about the development before it rang again and she automatically picked it up sophie reached across let me gatehouse merrily said if it was siân this was as good a time as any oh good morning this is smith sebald and partners solicitors in ludlow i have miss susannah pepper for mrs watkins merrily went out to clear her head ran through the thinning rain across the cathedral green and around the corner to the healthfood shop to grab something for lunch for her and sophie came back and spread it all over the two desks bean pasties and rice crackers with sundried tomato dip bars of green and blacks maya gold chocolate she was on holiday it was a picnic what was she like sophie asked she wasnt like anything ok she wasnt like anybody robotic a machine for processing wills and conveyancing houses she talked like merrily nodded at the computer you know the voice that comes out of an imac to alert you to an error she leaned back against the window sill her black fleece open to the old radiohead tshirt that jane wouldnt be seen dead in any more ok im exaggerating she was neither friendly nor unfriendly she simply informed me that shed had a long and detailed discussion with her future fatherinlaw not that she called him that she referred to him throughout as county councillor g h lackland what are you smiling at nothing sophie began to brush crumbs from the desk with the side of a hand go on the substance of it was that if i or anyone in my department wanted to elicit any information from her client mrs pepper all inquiries should be made through her office in writing and what did you say you heard me i said thank you very much miss pepper what can you say to someone like that couldve said that if she wanted to develop her acquaintance with jesus the saviour she should make the initial approach through my office youre annoyed im annoyed im very annoyed bloody lawyers she was remembering her marriage and the seepage of disillusion the divorce that would surely have happened if a car crash hadnt made her a widow who told her about you do you think sophie said could have been anybody callum corey i wasnt trying too hard to be discreet i could tell she just couldnt wait for me to give her an opening to bring up the subject of harassment and injunctions stay away from the weir house or you studied law didnt you merrily till the embryonic jane delivered the first kick about a year i was also married to one who i thought was going to be a crusader for justice but turned out to be a crusader against justice like most of the greedy bastards could they get an injunction to keep you away from this woman unlikely anyway theyd be shooting themselves in the foot bringing it into the public domain merrily stood up decided that she couldnt face lunch after all well they cant do a mumford on me accuse me of impersonating a priest youre going back then youre glad i hate to see you defensive and frustrated shouldnt be too difficult you going home now i need to talk to lol and jane id hate her to find out about these rumours from anyone else quite but first i think ill pop into the cathedral for a while some of the sensations ive been experiencing today could fall under the category of unholy as long as you dont let him talk you out of anything merrily blinked youre very hawkish today sophie sometimes i feel the phrase turning the other cheek should come with a number of getout clauses mmm merrily nodded zipping her fleece it occurred to her for the first time that the level of anger behind sophies cashmere calm might well exceed even her own she never made it to the cathedral it was unavoidable cream suit beard like it had been ironed on he was following his smile in long strides across the green merrily nigel tiresome meeting with the dean and the chairman of the perpetual trust challenging merrily to explain what she was doing here when she was supposed to be on leave stuff it why should she have to tell him anything and how is your poor aunt saltash said it is your aunt isnt it yes she said it is great pity you havent been available i rather thought we might have discussed the difficulties over in ludlow i thought wed drawn a line under that we should however i think decide where we stand on the issue in case any of us is approached approached for assistance or advice i thought you had been by the police and the media purely as a psychiatrist saltash said special adviser on mental health to the diocese as i recall and naturally i cleared it with the coordinator before making any comment you mean siân its so important that were aware of what were all doing effective teamwork acting in unison speaking with one voice saltash looked merrily in the eyes in a way that made it very clear he was looking at her glasses crucial wouldnt you say in such an unstable society media studies by the time merrily heard the school bus rattling onto the square shed been home two hours doing a manic cleanup of the vicarage not answering the phone going over the blackeye rumours situation deciding how much to tell the kid conclusion everything almost she finishing hoovering the hall and looked up into the wizened thorntortured face of jesus christ in holmanhunts the light of the world the picture that said with all its preraphaelite pedantry there are no short cuts jane first and then tonight there would be lol a different approach janes feeling of responsibility towards lol sometimes verged merrily suspected on the maternal it had a long history it was unquestionably jane who had decided that this relationship needed to happen jane who had shielded the sparks from the wind added twigs to the fire jane who when it was going well liked to bask in its glow and when it wasnt going well blame her mother merrily touched her eye experimentally it didnt hurt janes key turned in the lock this would hurt so who was it jane was gazing steadily into her mug of tea as if its surface would ripple and form into a face who do we have to destroy this was after shed calmed down approaching seven oclock and the sun had come out to set and to mellow the kitchen in spite of everything i dont do destruction merrily said im a vicar im a pagan were less squeamish not tonight huh merrily said its clear youve got a good idea who in this village is trying to shaft you narrowed down the list of suspects thats all down to one names merrily shook her head not till im sure i wouldnt like innocent people to die eirion picking you up tonight eight oclock maybe well just go to the swan i think not youre still only seventeen while im not naive enough to think you havent been going in pubs for the last couple of years the rule is still not in this village irenes eighteen anyway the only reason you want to go into the black swan is to broadcast exactly what youre going to do when you find out whos been putting it around that lol hits me so something wrong with that i mean you wont will you because youre the vicar you have to take it on the chin jane pushed her tea away and in the eye look when i first heard about it i reacted just like you well almost it took sophie to explain why that could only make things worse sophie exists to smooth things over sophies like human coldcream whoever started the rumour wants us to react badly and in the process tell everybody who hasnt already heard it thus doing their job for them i think that makes sense doing nothing makes sense letting people think that lols unstable again you know where theyll take it next dont you theyll think back to what happened last christmas and like where that used to be good what a hero saved alices life theyll be like yeah but there was violence involved ok he never laid a finger or did he dont let your imagination mum this is a bloody village jane will you just merrily bit down on it what are you planning to do tomorrow go round the square knock on a few doors hold a kitchen knife to a few peoples throats dunno really merrily thought about this contemplated the lesser of two potential evils it would be unwise to leave jane alone here on a saturday with the village crowded with locals and tourists and the whole day to consume you fancy coming over to ludlow why would i meet a mad woman merrily said make like a pagan she could see the flaring of excitement in janes eyes and how subtly it was extinguished yeah ok jane said jane decided she didnt want to do the clubs in hereford tonight too expensive even if eirion was still living off the loot from his eighteenth birthday and too loud to talk and naturally she wanted to be home nottoolate and up early nice and fresh for the siege of the weir house belladonna oh boy couldnt believe mum was involving her to this extent this was a major ritesofpassage situation not to mention a seminal event in christianpagan relations between them they would really nail this mad bitch to the wall so in the end she and eirion ended up doing the old snogwalk through the white lights of left bank village down to the wye which some of the sad planning anoraks at hereford council were determined to see as like the seine only narrower and with just the one café she told eirion about operation belladonna how she was holding her breath in case mum changed her mind after which it seemed legit to discuss the domesticviolence outrage the trouble is mum and lol theyre both so totally naive jane watched the white lights in the water like a submerged birthday cake plus the rockbottom selfesteem problem they wont fight which means you have to fight on their behalf eirion said im sorry jane but weve been through this before and it doesnt mean that when you think of all the trouble youve caused in the past by acting first and thinking well not thinking at all ah that old welsh caution as you cowards like to call it its how we survived centuries of english imperialism nah she searched his broad face what she could see of it youre too sophisticated to believe that crap however eirion said from my humble welsh perspective i do tend to think that lol is becoming less easy to damage you only have to listen to the new music the very fact that the music is now dealing with some of the bad things that people have done to him like hes absorbing it in a creative way however youre a pretentious git sometimes irene im right though i think hell absorb this too hes emotionally vulnerable jane said stubbornly well so am i eirion going all pathetic and i have to carry the welsh chip on my shoulder and do you have sympathy for me he slid his stubby celtic fingers down her waist to the top of her thigh lighten up jane your mothers right youll only make it worse thats why shes taking you to ludlow well i prefer to think she needs an occult consultant with a pagan perspective and youre fascinated not by belladonna she was always crap now shes crap and passé shes surely part of your mums essential history doesnt that interest you at all goth frocks and fuckme shoes i dont think so i bet your mum looked dont go there irene jane brandished a menacing finger just dont eirion grinned besides jane said if im generously putting my years of intensive pagan studies at the disposal of the bloody church of england even though it doesnt deserve it where are we going isnt there a nice quiet bench somewhere along here where we can watch the play of light upon the river and feel the play of hands inside the bra eirion moaned softly then this shout came from somewhere like a stone skimming over the water lewis oh no eirion stopped whos this two guys were strolling crookedly along the bank from the direction of the bridge jane sighed this was always a problem on a friday night most of eirions sad rich mates from the cathedral school seemed to hit hereford in force so much for the quiet bench they slunk over one was about eirions size the other taller kind of droopy and languidlooking hair flopping over his eyes they stood there gawping at jane total inane tossers clutching long cans of lager hey hey the tall one said this must be the vicars daughter she was only a vicars daughter the other one struck this ridiculous pose then swayed and stumbled he steadied himself der she was only a vicars daughter but she shit i cant think of one whats the matter with me tonight youre pissed eirion said bugger off i cant be pissed lewis its not ten oclock yet well go and get on with it eirion said youve only a couple of hours before its time to start vomiting in the gutter neither of them moved so the shorter one said you two just sloping off for a shag dont let us stop you the tall languid one said weve not had a good laugh all night have we darwin darwin was that his first name jane looked at them and mouthed the word at eirion well come on darwin said theres a bush over there kit off girlie chop chop a fine rain was in the air like the mist from an aerosol oh dear jane looked at the two guys how embarrassing eirion you didnt tell me this was a gay meetingplace jane eirion gripped her wrist dont start little bitch the tall one said kind of surprised he leaned forward lager slurping out of his can and one of the floodlights from somewhere splashed on his face and jane blinked darwin spread his arms hang on hang on its coming that was quick eirion said and i never even saw you slide your hand in your pocket come on jane lets she was only a vicars daughter darwin said she was only a vicars daughter but he pulled out his dick and said pulpit they were both still laughing while eirion was dragging jane away along the bank and back up into the crowds and the lights of left bank village straight through and out into bridge street never he said panting get into a scene like that so close to a river jane looked behind nobody following them they started to walk up the hill towards king street which led to the cathedral eirion was saying something jane didnt hear over the putter of a kerbcrawling taxi and the sound of her own thoughts it couldnt be it was though irene tugging on his hand to stop him what the taller guy how come you know him because i go to school with him jane hes like one of the students well hes not the bloody head is he irene thats i mean jane backed into the doorway of a darkened shop oh god he moved in next to her you all right whats his actual name the streak of piss jd fyneham hes in my mediastudies group media studies huh jane said its a fairly new thing theres only a few of us serious about it the rest are just skiving off whats he like fyneham obsessive also reckons he knows it all on account of his dad was a journalist and hes had tips from all his dads mates refuses to write for the school magazine because its so unprofessional um how longs he been writing for q magazine in his dreams no irene listen hes the guy who interviewed lol silence what are you saying jane irene im not kidding i saw him with lol on the square taking his picture it was definitely him no question that i mean thats not very likely is it jd fucking fyneham gave his name as jack fine lol said eirion stood on the kerb the lights here werent terrific but his face looked like black with rage eirion stepped back onto the pavement turned back towards bridge street right no jane grabbed his arm lets lets think about this as lol didnt have a table yet theyd spread the notes out on the kitchen unit from vicerage to your a sick man same writing merrily said no question if it isnt connected its a bit of a coincidence she was relieved that without having left the house all day lol seemed to know more about this than she did thanks to gomer parry you could always count on gomer the crucial disc in the spine of the village since lucy devenish died the fact that gomer had been round taken the initiative made her feel a little better or the writer simply reacts to events lol said an opportunist do you have any idea who it might conceivably be lol shook his head you well yes you do not the notes but certainly the rumours its a bit obvious but siân callaghanclarke knew everything ok i can see only one direct route from ledwardine to siân and it goes through saltash therefore it has to go via the surgery because every week saltash goes jogging with kent asprey asprey told him breeding ground for germs and gossip that surgery asprey would have been one of the first to know i dont get it does asprey have anything against either of us hed pass it on to saltash without thinking a doctor thing we can take it neither of them wrote these then lol said huh oh too legible grammar too correct also they stood there in lols kitchen smiling at one another like fools making light of it yeah trivial really something and nothing but even though the power was connected now the place was full of shadows it was as if some great cosmic force to which merrily refused to put a name had decided that she and lol this unlikely liaison was never going to be allowed to work out unsurprisingly the confrontation by the river and its aftermath had stripped the night of what passed for romance in hereford and jane got taken home well before midnight eirion normally well balanced and philosophical to the point where you wanted to shake him was seriously pissed off she knew hed been quietly committed for some time to building a career in the media and the idea that a guy at school his age already had one driving back to ledwardine eirion had conceded that it was just about conceivable that this fyneham had contributed snippets maybe even the odd concert review to q but an interview a freaking interview she hadnt seen him like this before saying how he was going to crack this wide open and he wasnt going to wait till monday because if this bastard was scamming lol well right enough shit had happened to lol and so jd fyneham was on borrowed time with jane too but she wouldnt get in eirions way on this shed go to ludlow tomorrow with mum do the dutifuldaughter thing it was good to find when she let herself into the vicarage that mum was still at lols she put the kettle on went up to the apartment raided her shelves for any books that might mention ludlow and brought them down to the scullery where she sat with ethel and switched on the computer j watkins paganconsultant she could very much live with that however paganismwise apart from the siting of the church there didnt seem to be much happening in ludlow itself although there were more suggestions that the wider area had been significant in the bronze age over twenty prehistoric burial mounds had been found at bromfield a mile or two north of the town the bromfield necropolis cool term she checked out the church tumulus again downloading more detail the irish saints whose remains were found inside the mound were identified as cochel fercher and ona who had come to live in the area however holy relics were much prized in those days et cetera et cetera mum had come in was leaning over her shoulder its ok im quite willing to accept they were more likely to have been the remains of three guys with big beards and horns on their helmets jane looked up you sound happier we rationalized the situation lols ok with it yeah lols more ok than i expected jane smiled and nodded best not to tell mum about jd fyneham until it was confirmed one way or the other she pointed at the screen which showed an aerial photo of ludlow with the church and the castle vying for prominence and the church probably winning even though the castle had much more ground and the church was crowded by streets on three sides i think we should maybe check out the church before we see her jane said ok but before that we should pop into our own church jane looked over her shoulder why im not making a big thing of this id just like us to do st pats breastplate and the lords prayer if thats ok you think we need spiritual protection theres nothing lost ok jane shrugged ive never been a chauvinistic pagan but like you really think this achingly sad faded s icon is a source of satanic evil ill be honest i dont know we dont know what shes collected over the years no gold discs thats for sure jane said sorry sorry she thought of the last time theyd done something like this before the boy bishop ceremony in hereford cathedral back when mick hunter was bishop and mum was a novice exorcist it had followed one of the biggest rows theyd ever had and it seemed like half a lifetime ago and it was good to think how much more adult they both were about this kind of thing now look mum said its not that i feel particularly insecure about assuming a role which admittedly is in explicit denial of my christianity if thats what youre thinking didnt say a thing ok mum put a hand to her forehead im probably lying of course i feel insecure and i really dont know if its a good thing to have you along or not i can watch your back jane said you know me mum rolled her eyes and winced at the pain this evidently caused the swelling had gone down now but it was still conspicuously a black eye the phone rang they both stared at it might be lol jane said they carried on staring at it because this was late for any kind of call until the machine cut in then there was a mans voice jane didnt recognize a northern kind of voice mary if youre still up shit i got a problem here with bell i didnt know who to mum picked up jon jane could hear a sound of apparent relief then a lot of gabbled talk mum listening the computer screen turning her face mauve what about the police mum said and then she said isnt there a cottage hospital and then after about half a minute she said all right ill come over and put the phone down and stood there for a moment with her lips set into a tight line what jane said mum let out a breath jon scole the ghostwalk guy she turned up on his doorstep about half an hour ago hes got a flat over his shop and theres an alleyway and some steps and she was on her hands and knees belladonna she was doing her walk and they were waiting for her where the linney goes down towards st leonards and the river dark narrow secluded who were seems to have been girls women they were waiting for her and they started hurling abuse and then they they just beat her up the women did and she wont have the police brought in and her stepdaughters away for the weekend and jon scole doesnt know what to do were going over there looks like im going mum said what about me you get some sleep ill be back as soon as i can and well still go back tomorrow it is tomorrow jane said and sensed that everything was about to go seriously wrong when the phone went again not five minutes after mum had left jane didnt even have the heart to do the spoofansweringmachine bit ledwardine vicarage is that mrs watkins shes not available this is jane watkins its gail mumford here andy mumfords wife oh yeah i know she isnt with my husband again is she jane smiled it was like mum and mumford were having some kind of torrid affair i can honestly say she isnt you havent heard from him

from andy meanwhile if you hear from him you tell him he might not have a wife here when he gets back mrs mumford said lift shaft into heaven merrily left the volvo outside the healthfood shop at the bottom of the row just up corve street from st leonards chapel and walked up to lodelowe its small window misted crimson from a lamp burning in the recesses it made her think of shrines the alleyway next to the shop door was unlit and made her think of the plascarreg estate and that made her want not to enter the alley the night was mild almost warm she peered into the shop window over the painted plaster models of timberframed houses a stack of tourist pamphlets haunted ludlow no movement in there and she backed off and looked up towards the centre of town no movement on the street either apart from shifting shadows and the glimmer of street lamps and the waning moon in old windows and the traffic lights near the crest of the hill always an eeriness about traffic lights in the dead of night when there was minimal traffic as though the lights must be a warning of something else that had always travelled these streets silent and invisible she stumbled over the kerb as a ribbon of female laughter unravelled from somewhere not too close she thought of women and girls bingedrinking in packs beating people up was this a twentyfirstcentury phenomenon or was it happening just the same when this town was young in the days of merrie england when street violence was part of the merrie system and therefore the apparent growth of civilization was all illusion god seeing right through it looking down with weary cynicism the oil running low in his lamp of eternal love night thoughts merrily stepped back as a light was put on and all the bricks in the alley came to life mary im here she stepped into the alley jon scole was standing at the bottom of some steps under an ironframed coach lamp his leather waistcoat undone over a black tshirt a bunch of keys hanging from his belt like a jailers keys hey listen im sorry mary i did try to ring you back damn patting the pockets of her fleece came out without the phone anyway he said shes gone now where you better come in he stepped back for her to go up the stairs which were concrete a kind of fire escape is she hurt not much i dont think sick though sick go on up climbing the steep steps merrily realized how tired she was a long day or was that yesterday the door at the top was ajar it was an old door patched and stained the light inside mauvetinted she went through directly into the room over the shop a room that shouted temporary strip lights were hanging crookedly from a bumpy ceiling shouldered by old beams smeared with new plaster the furniture was secondhand rather than old the kind of stuff lackland modern furnishings might have sold twentyfive years ago there was a widescreen tv and a stereo with silver speaker cabinets and a flatscreen computer that looked expensive the room smelled of curry bit of a mess jon scole said havent had time to tart it up yet can i get you a drink red wine white wine jon its after midnight im a bit knackered sorry his flaxen hair was slicked back and his beard looked damp as though hed held his face under a tap to sober himself up im not thinking she does your head in look at least sit down cup of coffee yeah no really she lowered herself to the edge of a red upholstered chair with wooden arms just tell me what happened its like i said she comes banging at the shop door id not been in long been down the pub with some tourists after the ghostwalk shes like theyre after me who were they just girls women see shes safe more or less if she stays up the posh end of town anywhere else pushing her luck shes not popular in some quarters its like rich slag doesnt give a shit for the poor young people shes forcing out meaning what meaning the land over there below the castle that this guy was gonna build on and she bought off him i thought people were delighted about that some people were delighted the neighbours whove got all the old houses near hers the ones as were faced with losing their view and getting kids on bikes and lawnmowers and radios and idiots cleaning the fuckin car on a sunday morning they were delighted the ludlow bourgeoisie but you see theres a ruling now from the council that if youre building new housing youve got to include a percentage of affordable homes i get it course this guy dickins the feller planning to build down here hed agreed to double the lowcost quota hedve wormed out of it if hed got planning permission but he gets the benefit of the doubt unlike the bitch whos denied young people their only chance of having an affordable house in a decent part of town so thats why they went after her i reckon get tanked up and then its like lets wait for the rich bitch rage and booze mary jon scole went and stood by the window it overlooked corve street a redbrick georgian dwelling opposite under a street lamp the unattainable unless youd sold your house in london what did they do to her jon mucked her up a bit mauled her about she wouldnt go into details its a police matter she dont want the publicity if i rang the cops shed never speak to me again anyway bloody hell he squatted at her feet and looked up into her bruised eye what happened to you i have a dangerous job merrily said wheres she gone so thats why you were wearing them sexy shades how long was she here went in the bathroom to clean herself up and that was when i phoned you i see youre not wearing a wedding ring you told her i was coming she wasnt gonna wait just hung on till it had gone quiet and then she was off about quarter of an hour ago you got a boyfriend mary merrily didnt move if she leaned away from him shed be trapped in the armchair if she edged forward shed be touching his knees he was evidently still a little drunk it would on the whole have made more sense not to come up here what was she wearing aye well jon scole stood up that couldntve helped the keys clunked at his belt he seemed to like wearing things that made metallic noises merrily took the opportunity to stand up too stepping nearer the door shes got kind of a nightdress on he said satin it laces up at the sides it looked strange she was walking through the streets like that i offered to drive her home she wouldnt let me just as well i expect im a touch over the limit you couldve walked back with her mary nobodys allowed to do that when she walks at night she walks alone dont you think you should ring the police now shed know who it was i keep telling you mary i dont want to blow it with her shes like he waggled his hands look if you wanna make sure shes ok i know which way she goes what sort of state was she in how do you mean shocked distressed i dont know he went to the window looked down into the street angry electric in what way merrily moved nearer the door its like something charges her up i went to watch her once i waited for her in the churchyard behind a tree just to watch what she did you know id waited for bloody ages by the time she showed i mean showed faded up not a sound weird she was like she was in a trance like her mind was somewhere else but her body was wooar trembling vibrating you know like it was aglow im probably exaggerating this a bit she was just a woman walking in the dark anybody like that in these streets is bound to look a bit spooky you approach her break the spell shed have had me eyes out i let her go past and i went home what did you think was happening she was getting off on it on what i dont know scole seemed almost angry that he didnt know when she comes banging on the door tonight shes all over me hot and you know burning up its why i called you anybody could see she were burnin up merrily waited by the door there was a dark green waste bin next to it with chip paper in it a curry carton squashed lager cans i dint trust meself all right he looked down at his trainers didnt wanna blow it he looked up across at merrily punched his palm i cannot believe youre a priest whats a woman like you doin bein a fuckin priest which way did she go jon dunno back towards st leonards makes no difference shell pass through st laurences churchyard whichever way she goes it always takes in the churchyard ill show you eh no i think its best if i go on my own thanks we dont want her to feel threatened not after what happened you think thats safe mary on your own its ludlow jon not glasgow i wouldnt touch you jon scole said plaintive i know i just maybe i should talk to her on my own maybe its the best chance ill get as a psychic he laughed something like that she pushed down the door handle and the door sprang against her hand and she was grateful he hadnt locked them in and yes she said for future reference i have got a boyfriend well hes a lucky twat jon scole said bitterly not moving from the window hey what you wanna watch yourself mary she likes women too but not priests apparently merrily said if it gets difficult i can always flash the cross there were still a few people around as merrily walked quickly up through the centre of the town towards the buttercross the inevitable sad drunk the inevitable coupleinashopdoorway and more curiously two women with one small boy trotting ahead of them a good six hours after his bedtime all the untold stories of night streets at the buttercross she slipped like a cat into the tightness of church street narrow as a garden path with its pub and its bijou shops and galleries most windows dark now behind this street seamed by alleyways made intimate by moonlight and scary by shadows was the church of st laurence with its great tower the axle through the wheel of the town she stood at the main entrance looking directly up at the beacon of the marches taller by far than the castle keep the tower with its lantern windows seemed to be racing away from her a lift shaft into heaven and she thought about the palmers guild convinced it was pressing the right buttons medieval christianity two steps up from magic the night was soft and close here the air still sweet with woodsmoke from dying fires in deserted hearths and the sky was olive green lightly stroked with orange in the north she stood listening for a couple of minutes almost convinced that if there was anything abusive or violent occurring anywhere in ludlow shed be able to hear it because this was the nerve centre never had a cluster of buildings felt more like some kind of living organism and she wondered if belladonna of whom there was no sign at all was standing somewhere just like this letting it heal her or perhaps shed simply run all the way home merrily walked past the body of the church into what she thought was college street old walls closing in was this the college where the chaplains appointed by the palmers guild had lived turning a dark corner now and emerging into what could only be the linney the narrow lane that followed the castle wall to the river the backstairs from the country to the heart of the town she walked quietly down the centre of the lane which would be just about wide enough for one car if you were daring enough to risk it terraces and stone cottages were wedged either side most of them unlit backing onto the darkness of the castles curtain wall to the left and the edge of the hill to the right a gap between houses revealing the countryside below salted with tiny lights feeling as if she was balancing on ludlows curving spine she stopped and listened again no movement and no obvious place of concealment in the narrows of the linney there was a sign announcing a new restaurant and someone had stuck a white paper flyer on it that read the lord will tear down the temples of gluttony after the last house a path to the left surely the path that burrowed among the castle foundations the path shed taken with jon scole to the yew tree where marion fell where jemima pegler fell with the heroin raging through her veins here the ground softened underfoot and the texture of the night seemed to have altered the shapes of trees morphing into matt shadows and the woodsmoke aroma becoming the raw stench of damp earth and the castle was a hard form a stronghold again the land falling invisibly away to the right of the track through the trees and into darkening fenced fields sports clubs and the river and the woodland around the weir house and merrily knew then that it was too quiet there should be wildliferustlings foxes prowling badgers scrabbling night birds and and there wasnt anything she stopped sometimes on still evenings before a church clock chimed somewhere you would be aware of a pause in the atmosphere itself a soft hollowedout moment all movement suspended and then a vibration like a shiver as if the air knew what was coming when you spent days and nights hanging around churches it became a familiar phenomenon it seemed like part of the mechanism and maybe it was some ancient acoustic collusion between night and clocks usually it was clocks in a town like ludlow on a night like this it ought to have been clocks she reached up and felt for the ridge of the tiny cross under the fleece and the tshirt pressing it into the cleft between her breasts and heard a voice hollow with pain might have been just an owl inside the castle grounds or a moment later two distinct species of owl in sequence the breathless fluting of the woodland tawny overtaken by an ethereal screech barn owl that was all that was as she was plunging into pockets for the cigarettes and the zippo it started up again bloating into something swollen and visceral that wasnt like any kind of owl but definitely like a woman then a harsh white shriek take me the castle wall was caught by a blade of moonlight turn me merrily stood looking up frozen the jagged windows of the hanging tower were holes in mouldy cheese take me turn me teach me plough me ply me pleach me the words seemed to be crawling up the wall take me rake me she knew it of course it was from nightshades it was twenty years old when it stopped the air was alive again as if the night was frayed and abraded and from below the hanging tower the same voice only different soft and breathy ethereal wee willie winkie running through the town upstairs downstairs in his nightgown rapping on the a stifled sob in the distance merrily heard a car horn the furry rumble of an aeroplane and then there was coughing and the voice came back husky and earthen and bitter you lie like carrion and then rising fainter and frailer but spiralling up again like pale light ill fly like marion mumford the door was on a chain a strip of light sliding out over the concrete landing and her teeth bared at him in the gap never get the message do you youre not wanted yere you was never wanted got nothin to say to each other not at halfpast one in the morning not any time halfone was it really how time flew when you were plugged in again aye hed accept it was a bit late to be calling on even your closest living relative but hed seen the lights on guessing they stayed up half the night and then went to bed till the afternoon the halflife of the worthless just wanner talk a while angela mumford said calmly ent gonner keep you moren half an hour just some things i need to get sorted out well you can fuck off ange said through those guarddog teeth and you leave us alone from now on i dont wanner see your fat face ever again yeah clear enough mumford nodded fair play hed started out politely enough telling her he thought he should inform her it was mams funeral on tuesday and listening without comment to the expected response not even bothering to wipe what had accompanied it from his face being imperturbable he could smell the spliff from here knowing that the reason ange instead of mathiesson had come to the door was that mathiesson would be busy flushing it all down the toilet in case mumford wasnt on his own probably a few ounces of blow wasnt the half of it but when the boys raided the estate theyd likely let this particular flat alone thinking mabbe this family had suffered enough and mathiesson was only smalltime anyway bliss could be thoughtful on occasion well mumford said like his feelings were hurt if thats how you feel ent much more i can say backing off as he spoke his eyes on the tension in the chain and when he saw it go slack as she was about to slam the door in his face he turned his shoulder and met it with the full force of his fifteen and a half stone anges screech was simultaneous with the splintering of wood as the chain came away pulling out a wad of cheap plascarreg door frame the door flying back and mumford going in there fast grabbing her as she spun away desperate to stop her falling because she was after all pregnant holding her arms tight to her side he manoeuvred her backwards into the living room she wouldnt give him the satisfaction of making her scream again but he held on because if he slackened his grip shed have one of his fingers between her teeth before he knew it she was her fathers daughter was angela mumford gave her the heavylidded level stare fore you says a word ill pay for it all right ill leave a hundred on the table when i go and you can tell that scum he can stop flushing cause i ent remotely interested in what he puts up his nose tonight ange breathing through her teeth eyes black with what mumford took as hate he went on staring into them imperturbable all right he saw her mouth working on the saliva and he gave her a little shake no now you listen to me no listen your level now mumford eh mathiesson standing in a doorway stripped to the waist pregnant woman you wanner dispense with the heroics boy seeing as were in your place and its all your stuff that gets broken looking at the stuff in here this was no bad deal he was offering sony tv size of a double wardrobe screening some slasherhorror dvd with the sound down had to be ten grands worth of hardware a subtle hint here that ange and mathiesson were existing on a bit more than the sickness benefit from mathiessons famous bad back mumford thought about robbie walshs broken neck and his snapped spine and a surge of the old volcano went through him and he caught himself hoping that mathiesson would try and take him but mathiesson didnt move and mumford turned back to ange now he said either i holds on to you the whole while or we all sits down nice and quiet and you answer my questions in full on the basis i ent a copper no more and nobody gets nicked or we got nothin to say to each other no more ange said not that we ever had much or i go down the station at hereford and have a chat with a few of my old colleagues wholl mabbe see to it that youre a single parent for a while this time around ange looked at mathiesson and mumford kept on looking at ange she was wearing a red towelling robe the wide sleeves falling over his hands where they gripped her arms youre hurting me ange admitted your decision hes on his own mathiesson said no witnesses mumford let ange go and moved away quickly and went to stand next to the sony ange sat down on the big cream sofa rubbing her arms then pulling her dressing gown tight across her chest not looking at him mumford turned to mathiesson you ever work if thats the word at the old aconbury engineering factory lenny edge of the barnchurch never heard of it mathiesson said i see so thats gonner be the level of our conversation is it its closed down well aye been closed down eighteen months far as engineering goes far as preparation and distribution of crack goes it was turning a tidy profit until oh the day before yesterday if i was involved idve been arrested wouldnt i well mabbe its not over yet that part mumford said and mathiessons jaw twitched ange snatched the remote from the arm of the sofa and snapped off the tv thank you mumford said now im gonner come clean angela im gonner be dead straight with you wasnt the ole lady responsible for what happened to robbie look ange said i was upset that night what you expect i was lashing out course you were and you were in shock but you were lashing out at the wrong person only one member of this familys responsible for the boys death and it wasnt an ole lady with rising senile dementia im pregnant ange yelled i get tired i didnt have no time i mean me angela mumford said i was responsible me for the first time ange shut her mouth i could give you a lot of bloody excuses about pressure of work but the fact is there wasnt much pressure at work that last week no point in giving a man cases he ent gonner be able to see through to a result truth was i just didnt wanner hang round with my family cause that looked too much like the future first time i didnt pick robbie up start of his holidays and take him over to his grans know why cause i couldnt face the ole man leering at me one of us now boy a pensioner thats why ole man never had no tact ange said anyway we put robbie on the train lenny took him down the station normal way of it see robbie and me wed have a chat on the way there hard goin sometimes mind hard goin for anybody ange said lowvoiced eyes downcast unless you was a professor of history truth of it was mumford said mam told me at least three time how the boy couldnt wait to see me i didnt understand i thought she was finding me a bit of retirement work childminding clenched his fists hearing his mam on the phone robbie he wants to show you all his favourite places in the town dont you robbie hes nodding see hes always saying whens uncle andy coming i never went i was angry insulted scared too scared of the future couldnt throw your weight about no more eh mathiesson said couldnt kick the shit out of nobody when you was feelin a bit frustrated you poor ole fuck shut up lenny ange said quietly now i know exactly what he wanted to talk to me about mumford said question is did you ange said nothing i been for a chat with some people tonight see former neighbours of yours the collinses collinses are as good as dead mathiesson said not the wisest response lenny you dont mind me saying so thought you said this was off the record it is but see there was someone else knew what was happening at the old aconbury engineering factory im saying factory not much more than a workshop really a starterfactory nice secluded site though since they stopped building any more due to nobody wanting to run a business so close to the plascarreg nice quiet site next to a little pine wood i dont know what youre on about or mabbe there was a funny feeling about the place mumford said being as it used to be the site of the civic gallows or at least thats what some folks reckon you lost me way back mathiesson came into the room draped himself over the back of the sofa started playing with anges hair she shook him off this is robbie ent it whatd he tell you mumford said i never took much notice ange sat up holding her dressing gown across her throat she looked cold though it mustve been ninety degrees in the room he got on your nerves sometimes poor little sod yeah i do remember he was real excited few weeks ago months maybe i dunno said did i know they used to hang people round the back of the flats said hed worked out where it was theres still a mound apparently on the edge of the pines it was covered over by trees until they started extending the barnchurch thats the most likely site i didnt take much notice he was always going on about something usually it was something in bloody ludlow so i never even took it in i probably only remembered this because it was yere told his mate niall collins all about it niall said you dont wanner go messing round there they ent gonner like it doubt if robbie even took it in what the boy was trying to tell him all these years hed hated the plascarreg because not just because it was tacky and rundown i dont reckon he even noticed any of that but because everything was so new now at last heres some real history on his doorstep wasnt nothing gonner keep him away i dont even know where he got that idea from ange said the gallows local history venture angela somebody got a lottery grant to run a local history project in the south wye area of town you probably didnt notice yeah we something came through the door robbie took it this mumford reached into the inside pocket of his jacket brought out a printed pamphlet south wye history project it was with his stuff project starts end of may they were asking for volunteers to help produce a booklet on the history of the area according to niall robbie seems to have met one of the archaeologists in charge who made him copies of old documents and robbie started doing his own research either he found the old execution site or he didnt but poking around that workshop with a spade night after night threatening to bring the whole team down for a dig ange shut her eyes began softly pummelling her knees going shhhhit shhhit very quietly i dont suppose theyd understand what the boy was after mumford said mabbe somebody else had a quiet word with him told him seriously to keep away somebody like jason mebus he afraid of people like jason angela youd think he would be wouldnt you ange looked up what hed taken for hate just looked like tired black circles around her eyes truth was i dont reckon he even noticed them he just went his own way read his books messed about on his computer and went off on his own seems to me mumford said that robbies enthusiasm for history and the past and that stuff would prove stronger than any quiet warning to stay away so bloody innocent he wouldnt even have known what they was on about ange started to cry i never had time you know what they done finally to make him understand ange shaking her head hands over her face mumford stopped and turned away saw someone walking past the window not four feet away from where he was standing no getting away from anybody here this was what nialls dad mark collins had told him it was like being in a cell block but without any prison officers to protect you as soon as hed left that house mumford had realized that hed finally blown it by now collins would already have talked to bliss or somebody less sympathetic about the lone cop whod come to question young niall at their temporary home in malvern theyd never asked to see mumfords id nobody ever had even when hed carried a warrant card wasted exercise bliss had once said mumford looked like a copper the way a sheep looked like a sheep just hoped he hadnt dropped karen in it what i think he said to his sister is robbie tried to make them understand how important it was this discovery hed made actual site of a middle ages gallows showed them a picture of it in this book he had somehow the relevant page got ripped out niall remembers jason mebus had that page what page ange looked at him through splayed fingers i dont picture of a gallows on it mumford said or a gibbet picture of a feller being hanged and a detailed picture of a working model and he decided there and then that he wasnt gonner say any more about this aspect of it poor bloody ange shed been a crap mother but it was clear enough now that she hadnt known any of this whether mathiesson had and had chosen to keep quiet about it was something to be considered later for now well thered be enough shadows over ange for the rest of her life without the details mumford had finally got out of niall collins the kid refusing to talk about it until mumford had applied the kind of emotional pressure that had brought mark collins and his wife rushing in and would undoubtedly be relayed to bliss and probably annie howe which was why mumford couldnt go home until this was finished what i wanted to ask you he said was how well known was it that robbie went to ludlow during his holidays ange looked up at mathiesson his tattoos gleaming with sweat dont look at me i never told nobody why would i it ent far to go is it mumford said my original thought see was they was just bullying him cause he was a bit of a swot didnt fit in and mabbe they made his life such a bloody misery that he couldnt bear to come back yere and so last day of his holidays stop it ange started rocking from side to side holding herself and robbies unborn sibling mathiesson straightening up in shock suddenly getting the point they wouldnt shit they wouldnt kill him mumford just keep him quiet wouldnt top him just to keep him out their hair mabbe it was an accident lenny mabbe they just wanted to put the fear of god into him but then again i always said it was only a matter of time with jason mebus the collins boy told you this it dont matter where i got it from but what you got with the likes of mebus see and wossisname chainboy connor is kids whos up here with the excitement of it wanner prove themselves as hard men you been through that phase surely lenny mathiesson said nothing ange said if you think lenny had anything to do with it youre wrong and id like to think i was mumford said for your sake if nothing else he had every reason to keep robbie alive ange mathiesson gripped her shoulders theres no need he ent a copper no more you dont have to sit down andy ange said real quiet old stock when the singing stopped merrily was aware that the warm night and the foliage had come alive but not with foxes or badgers or bats or rats unease made her stop on the edge of the path looking all around her over her shoulder the top of the church tower was visible its weathercock spiking a cluster of mushroomcoloured night clouds and somewhere although the singing had stopped she could hear voices rushing through the undergrowth like blown leaves when a giggle crept up behind her she spun round shadows were moving among the bushes skidding feet a girls voice squeaked no nez dont what sounded like a beer can bounced off the castle wall and somebody shouted after it mad ole slapper and merrily became aware of a bunch of them at the side of the track about ten yards away she felt a glow of very basic fear but it couldnt be the women who had attacked bell these were just kids just kids we had some awesome laughs with robbie what do you want her voice coming out cracked and coarsened by twenty years of smoke she started to cough muffled it with an arm a kid said whossat police merrily said with determination this path is closed now push off the lot of you or youll be banged up for the night aw get lost youre not the police then youll be able to pretend in the morning that youre not having your breakfast in a cell remembering the minimaglite torch shed stuffed into a pocket of her jeans before leaving the car she started fumbling under her fleece now do you want to go in the van or the little torch was buggerall use for hitting anybody but it was very bright she flashed it at head height found a girl in a shockingpink top who looked about thirteen and the girl squealed and backed off stumbling a boy said youre never protecting that mad ole slapper are you then oh no the girl was wailing my heels gone nez you bloody wuss i told you i didnt want to come down here ill carry you oh get whats going on outrage and a yellow light probably from one of the cottages in the linney shit one of them whispered its my grandad sorry ok were off now we just wanted to see if it was true all right well leave you to it goodnight erm yeah goodnight merrily smiled she switched off the flashlight waited until it was quiet again and the light in the linney had gone out we just wanted to see if it was true how often did this happen she put the torch on again twisted the neck until there was just a thin beam directing it at the ground following it along the track until it found the fat bole of marions yew tree and bell pepper sitting under it in silence now with something across her knees her elbows resting on it and her face between her hands a small light at her feet i dont want protection she said youve been getting it anyway merrily switched off the torch for a long time oh bell pepper turned her head i thought i its mary isnt it im sorry i followed you didnt like to think of you going back out there after what happened it was very stupid of jonathan to phone you he was worried too can we talk merrily sat down next to her between the roots the space under the yews dense canopy was lit like an earthen grotto by the candle in the lantern and she could make out belladonnas oncefamous patrician profile recalling an album cover where her face had been sprayed with creamy white plaster eyes calmly closed like a death mask children bell said i expect i was some kind of goddess to their parents now im a mad old slapper she gazed out between the trees towards the invisible river when theyre spraying your name three feet high on walls you never imagine that one day youll be normal merrily thought ordinary it was odd shed always thought that lol was the exception in his line of work because he seemed in spite of everything so normal odd how you could be taken in by the intentional mythologizing of rock musicians maybe in ten years time those kidsll think youre a goddess too she said tastes change rapidly in music and then they bounce back again how would you know i was a fan i came to one of your gigs once and my boyfriends in the business business music he plays writes songs you poor cow would i have heard of him i dont know lol robinson ok if i smoke tobacco that is im feeling a bit go ahead christ i remember lol robinson hazey jane they put him away didnt they psychiatric hospital merrily found the zippo and the silk cut packet crushed in her fleece he fell into the system ok now he always was merrily held out the cigs to bell you do nicotine these days only vice ive ever given up mary merrily lit up inhaled and let out the smoke on the back of a sigh it was not comfortable sitting in the dirt at the foot of the yew but not i assure you belladonna said because i didnt want to die that would be positively hypocritical in your case bell laughed am i right in thinking you and jonathan are god no that was emphatic i told you i have a boyfriend how quaint is he as quaint when hes on tour hes so quaint that old ladies want to buy him i see you merrily lowered the cigarette the smoke was making her bad eye smart me what bell said jonathan makes you think that i think hes awfully interested in you most men are but some are also frightened and he i suspect is frightened jon just because he looks like a mad biker with a taste for rape and plunder actually on reflection most men are scared and most women hate me and children peer at me from behind the bushes except merrily snatched a shot of nicotine and went for it except for robbie walsh belladonna looked at her full face in the shivering candlelight and merrily saw that her mouth was slightly twisted blots of dried blood on her jawline dirt still scraped across one cheek a pinkening lump on her forehead above the proud aquiline nose ludlow is my heaven oh god something was very wrong here this woman was not normal merrily became aware of the garment that jon scole had described as a nightdress it was probably satin shapeless as an operating gown she glimpsed a ribbon under one of bells arms merrily tightened up gripping her knees bell said slowly who told you about robbie and me couple of people who saw you with him around the castle i gather some people have been saying he committed suicide and therefore i must have helped him nurture his depression whos saying that he wasnt depressed absolutely not robbie walsh would walk these streets in a state of nearecstasy jonathanll confirm that he was happier than any child i ever saw while he was here yes because he was here he had a passion for history a passion for ludlow and your interest in him is i have a friend who was his uncle he feels he he feels more than a bit responsible we all feel that did robbie come here with you to this tree oh yes i think he was very much in love with marion bell leaned her head back against the tree stretching her neck the garment was torn on one shoulder strands of the white fabric making loops schoolboy crush if robbie was going to have his first crush it would have to be someone from the middle ages wouldnt it only a small part of him was living in the present you know what im saying dont you i think weve all experienced it bell let out a small exasperated hiss i dont know about you only what jonathans said and jonathans prone to the most awful hyperbole i think merrily said carefully remembering janes advice that we all have heightened experiences in a town this close to its own history yes and although i never met robbie walsh hed describe scenes to you like a sighted person interpreting for the blind hed read the names on all the plaques outside the old houses so many times that he knew them all off by heart by heart mary the town was in his heart he knew whod lived in every house and hed describe them to me and hed come here and hed describe marion oh what did she look like quite small brown hair brown eyes passionate angry eyes robbie was an adolescent boy he wasnt sophisticated his terminology was simple he was in love with marion because she was everything you rarely find any more she was all feelings all strong passion and impulse in comparison with all the apathetic jaded kids he had to mix with cant you feel her mary now here i can feel her confusion merrily said and it was true i can feel her uncontrollable rage and her despair this was possibly the time of night she did it hacked the bastard down and took a dive out of the window just above us no tree here then just stones marion plummeting down with a scream of terminal anguish her body bouncing as it lands breaking finally coming to rest coming to unrest merrily said where were sitting now blood issuing from her mouth a fluid thrill like oil under bells voice now oh you do understand dont you i understand marion marions easy she was both the betrayed and the betrayer shed let the enemy in she didnt see a way out except through one of these windows jemima pegler however thats much more complex and sos robbie walsh this friend of mine he took me to see his mother robbies gran because she said she was seeing him around the house and around the town he asked you to help her as a psychic something like that she said she was seeing robbie reflected in mirrors and shop windows and in the water she drowned i was there that night merrily said and you came down to the river with a bunch of goths it looked like bell stared at her her arms in the ragged sleeves lifting what had lain on her knees a black instrument case too big for a violin too small for a guitar and you seemed to know who it would be merrily said who theyd found in the water what are you suggesting oh look all right it was one of the band heard it was robbies grandmother couple of them were in the town and they heard someone the band its a young band called le fanu who come here sometimes theyve been influenced by my music and they come down some weekends and we play theyre my support mechanism if you like we hang out and we get a little stoned sometimes and were putting an album together look i hear stories that im flooding the town with fucking goths but its just le fanu and their hangerson and was one of them involved in a stabbing incident something squirmed some creature rattling twigs in the undergrowth on the other side of the path bell let out a breath yes yes he was a roadie and he doesnt work for them any more it was a very minor incident i she hugged the case i dont mind being considered mad i am mad but i wont be accused of importing violence do you understand her voice was breaking up now and she was trembling youre shivering youre cold i like being cold you mustve heard that cold as the grave i didnt mean to mary are you writing a fucking book about me or something im merrily had to break off take a breath the cigarette lay dead between her fingers her spine was starting to ache and her bum had gone numb if she wasnt careful she was going to come out with the truth i just think some of the things being said about you are probably all wrong jon jonathans an idiot him and his ghostwalk irrelevant an irritant maybe you just want to be an enigma merrily said the mad woman of ludlow who walks in the night and sings her old songs to the moon while sitting under this ageold symbol of life and death and immortality wearing wearing a bloody shroud bell pepper started to laugh i really think youre the first to notice oh god and shed been hoping it wasnt she stared out past the lantern at the ominous black forestry across the river towards the welsh border i didnt think they made them like that any more they seem to use paper now or the bodys dressed in ordinary clothes they dont make them like this any more bell said i had a friend an undertaker he found them in a stockroom six of them old stock years old even then probably postvictorian nineteenthirties i dont know i see this was the guy who did the arrangements for my baby if you were wondering your baby died my baby had no life outside of me when they pulled him out he was dead meat im sorry no need to be it works both ways ever since over twentyfive years a part of me has been where he is im sorry merrily said im going to have to stand up my backs starting to seize up she rose awkwardly and walked out of the penumbra of the yew she was surprised to see the sky like deep copper foil over the hanging tower it didnt mean dawn just another mood of an increasingly crazy night do you want to come home with me mary bell pepper was at her shoulder the musicalinstrument case at her feet her hands around its stem i ive got a daughter at home i how old seventeen hardly a problem then youre obviously not as comfortable here as i am come back to the weir house bell touched her arm her fingers felt like the wet tips of icicles you want to know dont you about robbie merrily didnt reply i was entirely shattered when he died that dark translucent voice the poshest pop star since marianne faithfull it was like for me some awful kind of retribution merrily turned to her why because robbie walsh was my son bell pepper said a resort for the dead the phone was ringing jane woke up under the duvet on the sofa in the parlour ethel on her feet she was fully dressed more or less padded through to the scullery the clock said twofifteen am shed unplugged the answering machine so the phone was still ringing and she snatched it mum jane lol whats wrong lol said wrong all the lights are on im sorry im becoming the neighbour from hell maybe itll be better when i get a bed i woke up on the sofa and i felt something wasnt right and i went to the front door and all the lights are on in the vicarage well not all the lights just more lights than usual sorry she got called out to ludlow belladonna was assaulted jane explained she was wide awake now waking up had never been a problem and she thought it was good in one way that lol had noticed the lights he cared well of course he cared she left her phone behind i dont think it was intentional she was in a hurry but im a bit pissed off actually i was supposed to be going with her tomorrow to sort out belladonna she was going to expose belladonna to you maybe she senses ive mellowed do you want to come over for some hot chocolate or something lol we could sit by the phone together not a safe thing to do in this village at the moment with your mum conspicuously not at home if were awake someone else will be then you happen to trip up outside and cut your lip and im back on victoria ward and lol you could give me a discreet call when she comes in or do you think i should maybe go over certainly not youre right that would be intrusive unforgivable i need to keep my nose out you dont like belladonna do you jane said i dont know her you dont trust her then well not from what ive heard no but we shouldnt always believe rumours should we no lol jane sat at the desk flicked on the anglepoise about that the rumours do you have any idea whos been spreading them not really as long as the right people dont believe them im not going to worry you heard from q magazine yet when the piece is going in should i have you could ring them and ask why would i do that well i wouldnt like to miss it eirion gets it doesnt he yeah so he does is this small talk jane bit late for that jane said ambiguously with no chance of getting back to sleep jane made some hot chocolate and took it back to the computer put belladonna into google and found like six million mentions put in belladonnareligion and got it down to a couple of thousand what it seemed to amount to was that this woman had tried everything and rejected most of it including forms of paganism mostly eastern when she found herself back in the departure lounge with karone the bastard boatman jane typed in you still here karone suggest consult own website and act accordingly she googled the weir house where belladonna lived there were three mentions two negligible one cursory essentially a new house created authentically on the site of a fourteenthcentury ruin with a connection to the palmers guild jane googled the guild and came up with this fairly detailed article about a quasispiritual organization that had played a major part in making ludlow what it was today well preserved and not short of a few quid she printed it out and read it twice it tied in fairly well with what she already knew from alevel history about the medieval social system the need for wealth status and godliness in equal measures like forget all that rich maneye of the needle crap if you had the money you could provide for an afterlife jane was reminded of stairway to heaven the ancient and interminable led zeppelin song that eirion had in his anoraks collection apparently tony blair knew all the chords figured somehow she tried belladonnaludlow and hit on a short item from one of these heattype celeb magazines which included this little gem do you know how many ghosts there are in this place bell has been saying to friends dozens everywhere is haunted this town is like a resort for the dead she printed this out too sensing some significance here and then checked the emails there was one from eirion marked for jane cariad if you get this before you go off to play pagans i couldnt sleep due to underlying blind rage so put some checks in and im certain jdf and q are not any kind of item im now going to find out where he lives so as to plan dawn raid well ok halfelevenish raid will keep you informed the email was timed at am chances were he was still vaguely conscious jane rang his mobile yes im very nearly naked eirion said and sadly alone are you in bed also your body glistening with oriental oils you sound pleased with yourself ive found out where the shit lives its one of those georgian piles behind a tenfoot wall at breinton overlooking the city so youll be going through ledwardine to get there no just that the ludlow trip could be off does this mean i dont get to do something potentially rewarding all on my own you can do what you like after you switch the light out but maybe you could call for me in the morning i feel strongly about this too lols my whatever you call the bloke your mothers having an unaccountably clandestine relationship with and hes hes taken enough shit this week you told lol about fyneham no not a word i mean lets find out what the score is first like if it turns out youre wrong and the guy actually is working for q jane i went through a pile of back copies looking for the name jack fine in all the concert reviews and small stuff and then every known music website i put him into every available search engine if fynehams working for q im going to leave school get a job on a remote hill farm in snowdonia and shag sheep yeah ok we get the point call me when you know if youre going or not i will do that jane noticed a new email for mum from the deliverance office it was highlighted with one of those red exclamation marks conveying urgency sophie who knew mum always checked her emails before bed if i dont hear from you before ten fortyfive eirion said ill just go straight over there ok and like will you be armed jane said she put the computer to sleep and went to the window a fox was standing in the dark garden as though embossed on the wall jane didnt move either foxes were cool she supposed she ought to grab a couple of hours sleep flushing out fyneham would be secondbest to penetrating belladonnas lair but still better than an average saturday and then the phone rang and the fox sloped away towards the orchard and the churchyard mum this time what on earth are you doing still up i was going to leave you a message on the machine running the switchboard you left your phone i know jane im just it doesnt look like ill be back till the morning ok is everything all right yes everythings fine you sound like you cant talk well there you are then somebodys there absolutely right theyd become good at this over the years jane focused on the computers hypnotic lemon sleeplight as it swelled and faded like a nervous sun could this be belladonna youre with belladonna in person very intuitive flower is she mad bit early to say definitely before lunch i mean youre not in need of help no i dont think so so where are you exactly like where are you going to sleep are you going to sleep well just a bit weary been a long day wow youre at the weir house exactly so get some sleep yourself all right oh i forgot jane leaned forward and revived the computer theres an email from sophie marked urgent you want me to read it quickly then ok one sec merrily this came just before i left from a secretary at lackland modern furnishings the attachment is a scan of a petition received by the mayor of ludlow this afternoon it was marked for your information by the mayor this is hard to say if its important or merely an attempt by someone to preempt your inquiries and perhaps pressure you into unnecessary action but i thought you should see it im opening the attachment mum ok if its a virus you know who to blame uhoh what looks like the fundamentalist loonies are on your back again to the mayor of ludlow county councillor g h lackland sir a great godlessness it has come to our notice that you have been in discussion with the diocese of hereford with regard to recent tragic events at ludlow castle we are glad that as our first citizen and a practising christian you have shown such commendable regard for the spiritual and moral health of the community and trust that you will support our call for suitable action to remove what many townsfolk regard as the shadow of darkness and dissolution with respect followed by signatures notice that shadow of darkness jane said as distinct from a shadow of light who wrote this turgid crap well thank you flower mum said thats made my night but what do they mean ok you cant i understand anyway if thats the worst thing that happens to you before dawn youll be ok but like if i was having to sleep in belladonnas house id make sure my bedroom door was well locked the legend it smelled old this was what you noticed first because the trees around it made everything so dark and close and there was a night mist down here near the water there wasnt much to see until you were inside where the smell met you the dusty sweetness of woodsmoke and warm stone like the balm of a small church even when bell put on the lamps it remained dim an entrance hall with a low ceiling the beams merrily noticed were roughcut retaining an element of bark two lanterns projected from the swollen ochre walls electric but the bulbs were no bigger than match flames and so the room was no brighter than it would have been in the middle ages lit by candles or rushlights the phone was in a niche in the wall like an aumbry for the sacrament but this was evidently for the concealment of an anachronism and bell drew the short curtain back across it your daughter was still up then bell pepper was faintly haloed by the claycoloured light shed brushed her fair hair and washed her face it looked pale and puffy like creased linen and there were shadows under her eyes but no blood except down the front of the shroud like an emblem of war she was waiting for me to call merrily said shell go to bed now my son was born dead bell said bluntly he died inside me some belligerence there this was a famousartist thing you demanded privacy railed against media intrusion but it was important that people should realize that your experiences were always more dramatic and significant than theirs i was dreaming a great deal then bells voice softening a hint of the years in california rolling in like surf lucid dreams in which i was walking the streets of an old old town and i had no body i was light merrily said nothing hormonal so many chemicals at work during pregnancy and during this really vivid dream mary a dream full of colours and the scent of woodsmoke during this dream i was aware of someone beside me and i was so sure that my baby had died yes i can understand that and yet i didnt feel the way youd expect bell smiled those crossover teeth what lol had called that strange kind of uneven beauty no sorrow more a kind of come and have some wine mary well its a bit but bell had moved away through a low gothic doorway coffinshaped around her and merrily shrugged and followed her into a passage that was low and narrow and unlit sensing this womans smile moving ahead of them like a guiding light something separate it was more like a kind of awe bell said that i was carrying death inside me that i was containing death that death had happened inside me i knew from that moment that id always have death with me and that death is like love it must be nurtured turning to face merrily at the end of the passage even in the gloom merrily could see that bells eyes were alight but you see mary i was never very good at love merrily stopped in the passage beginning to see everything now the whole purpose of this womans cycle of ritual the candles burnt in ancient sacred places the menstrual blood in the church the shroud her magical apparel on a ghostwalk from the yew outside this house over the spiritual summit of the town to the yew in the overgrown cemetery of st leonards that was humming and rustling with energy death is eternal life without pain merrily whispered we make our own eternity there was a momentary silence except for the small sounds of a sleeping fire in the space behind belladonna where there were glimmerings of red and orange you know bell said in a kind of awe theyd walked from the linney down some steps under the castle wall like descending from the high town into the country once a sensor had found them and set off an imitation victorian gaslamp in the tiered treesnuggled garden of a modern bungalow and bell pepper had stopped and turned around with the musicalinstrument case held by her side her shroud had a high ruffled neck and came close to the ground where her feet were in sandals she seemed for a moment to be flickering in time and that was when merrily had had the first inkling soon the buildings were separating out town houses giving way to farmhouses brick to stone walls to high hedges viridiangrey under the eggshaped moon the pavement narrowing so bell was walking some way ahead of merrily the pale shroud like a waving handkerchief there were stone gateposts at the weir house drive and high iron gates but a smaller gate to the side had been unlocked and bell had led merrily into a pathway which took them not to the house but to a yew tree which the path encircled the yew was the width of one of gomer parrys diggers very softly floodlit from below green and gold like so many in churchyards it was the remains of a long slow implosion the great tree serving up its own entrails in a blackened tangle of pipes like a ruined church organ bell had walked inside not uncommon to find them alive and hollow there was one at much marcle with a seat inside merrily had hung back didnt want to go inside the tree with belladonna emerging a few moments later bell had stepped back and bowed to the tree and walked away with no explanation but she hadnt been carrying the instrument case any more only a long key that was quite a shock bell laughed nervously a glass of red wine at her lips i thought for a moment but i suppose jonathan told you didnt he he was here when we rehearsed it that particular line we make our own eternity is on the album the thing im doing with le fanu which we havent yet recorded jonathan was dropping so many hints i let him in once to listen special treat little bastard i expect he was making notes i wouldnt know about that merrily said jonathan didnt tell me the laugh was snapped off and then bell face glowing in the firelight said with uncertainty there is no other way you could yes im afraid there is there was what looked like half a small tree on the fire in the great stone hearth there must have been some draught system under the hearth because bell had awoken the fire and they were sitting in its sporadic light in these hopelessly uncomfortable oak chairs no more than carved wooden boxes with vertical backrests and the fronts blocked in like commodes velvet cushions helped a bit not much bell leaned out of hers but of course jonathan maintains youre the best natural psychic hes ever encountered i was inclined not to believe him jonathan is how shall i prone to hyperbole carving on the chairs upright spine bit into merrilys back she sat up sinking her hands into the pockets of her fleece mrs pepper i read it on the internet i dont know anything about the internet bells voice rose erratically computers suck your energy you couldnt have the quote was on a website well more of a chatroom i dont even know what a fucking chatroom is its like a forum where people can send messages to each other in this case people interested in suicide what where wouldbe suicides gather to talk it over online it was quoted in a reply to someone who was planning to take her own life i couldnt tell you where they got it from but the internet moves almost as fast as you can think passing thoughts suddenly get shared with thousands of people merrily looked around into the darkness they might as well have been sitting outside in front of a brazier this would be a very atmospheric rehearsal room but as living space despite the heavy tapestries on the walls and the sheepskins on the floor it was too big too cold too rudimentary too starkly uncompromisingly medieval bell pepper was watching her intently over her wine glass why were you looking at this suicide website i was trying to help my friend robbies uncle i wanted to understand robbie and why he died you think he committed suicide his uncle thinks its possible what do you think bells face went blank i dont know he seems to have been victimized bullied on the estate where he lived theres evidence that he didnt want to go back that he took his life to stay here no thats not true so we looked at his computer and he no listen i didnt put that stuff there yeah yeah theres a computer here that le fanu use for the music they download sounds sample stuff i dont know how it works i dont have to im not an internet freak like fucking bowie and i didnt put those words out or any of that song i didnt i never said you did merrily said and for what its worth theres no evidence that robbie went near those sites but since ive just quoted that line back to you somebody must have mustnt they did one of the band do it le fanu your songs appear to be widely available on the suicide network did you know that its nothing to do with me anybody could everybody knows what i did sorry im getting confused what are we its in the books the unauthorized biographies ive never read them merrily said i just know the music i just wore the clothes when i was fifteen bell said a tired incantation i tried to kill myself i took an overdose i spent quality time on a stomach pump i was fifteen and i was overweight bad skin repressed and horribly shy and i had a heart defect and i was not allowed to do games and my parents drove me everywhere even if i went out at night with friends they drove me there and collected me and i also had a disgusting brace on my twisted teeth so i tried to kill myself its in the books im sorry i didnt know about that bell craned her neck forward darling its part of the legend the next part is when i was seventeen and someone said i could sing and someone else pointed out that if you took the middle out of my dreary name isabella donachie you had the magic word belladonna poisonous the most resonant name for a singer in those days and that seemed like some glorious epiphany and i snatched the brace off my teeth and slept with about a hundred men in six months legend bell sniffed you see id grown up to whispers behind my back doctors to parents parents to relatives peering through the banisters ears flapping children have such sharp ears and an acute understanding of the basics by the time i was ten i knew i was going to die before my time youre still here and i still have a heart defect apparently it wasnt a mistake or anything they picked up on it again when i was having the baby i mean i could still die any time i just havent died yet but death and me bell enclosed one hand with another close mary very close always and its been a remarkable relationship its certainly produced some remarkable music all about sailing close to the precipice when i swallowed the pills i was convinced just a handful would finish me off someone already hanging delicately over the great abyss didnt happen when i was twentyone i recorded the hungarian suicide song and had all the scratches put into the mix just like the original singing close to the precipice merrily said hesitantly they say that knowledge and acceptance of death can show you how to live intensively bell leaned back in her box thats not quite true it induces more than anything a sense of the temporary i couldnt settle couldnt settle in a place travelled all over the world or at least back and forth across the atlantic couldnt stay with a man either pepper was the best he was a nice guy why i kept his name but i was turning him into a nervous wreck so he appealed to my better instincts and i let him go but there was only one constant and that was my son because he was dead and then i fetched up in ludlow visiting sauls daughter susannah who was now my legal and financial adviser business manager i guess and it was another epiphany the town youd dreamed of when the baby was yes knew it soon as i got out of the car didnt quite believe it at first so i went away had the dream again came back and the pull was even stronger a town that like me was outside of its time and the child well the child wanted to come back are we talking about robbie youre getting there bell sighed i must be insane you could be a reporter merrily smiled but when youve been courted and worshipped and shafted by thousands of people the world over you pride yourself on being able to recognize the ones whore going to be of some importance when i saw you with jonathan at marions yew i thought yeah no dont say anything mary dont feel flattered ill be a burden to you i always am robbie is my son is my son i wasnt looking for a child for gods sake i was probably looking for a man and then one day youre face to face with your twin soul and its a a bloody little boy bell drank some wine tears like lenses over her eyes someone i spoke to merrily said actually said you were like mother and son we were mother and son birth parents are merely that seldom of any consequence an impedance more often than not we were part of the same spiritual seed essence and we were both connected with this town and realized it wed both come home we saw the town burning with the same golden light i remember in my first dream walking from the castle to the church stopping and gazing up at the steeple and it was like a bar of gold and the sky was red with sunset and i felt well you can imagine how i felt euphoric oh well beyond euphoric like a neardeath experience bell are we talking reincarnation here bell shook her head i dont believe in that shit someone that is i wondered if you felt you were connected with marion de la bruyère no not at all marions an entry point shes important because most of the ghosts here are nebulous presences and shes fully formed we know where she died and how and why and shes very much here like robbie so i went to see his grandmother mrs mumford when hed gone back to school last january i went to see the old woman realized soon as i started talking to her that there was no way i could explain the half of it i said i was impressed with his knowledge and his enthusiasm and wondered if there was some way i could help with his education it was pretty clear that she wouldnt understand would you have expected her to probably not so in the end i went to see the mother i went to this crummy estate in hereford and i met the mother and it became very obvious very quickly that this woman and i would be able to find a common currency currency im not speaking metaphorically look at this place its a shell i walk through this house like another ghost i wanted merrily sat up hard you wanted to adopt him my stepdaughter could deal with the formalities but the essence of it as far as the mother was concerned was a large not to say lifechanging oneoff payment christ merrily said he didnt know i wanted to be sure before i discussed it with him that nobody would get in the way it was obvious phyllis mumford wouldnt be in any state to look after him for much longer as for angela angelas eyes positively lit up at the implications god and then he died bell said he died like marion and everything shifted the whole axis of the town shifted under me she stared at merrily and her eyes looked as if they were melting in the firelight its the endgame now mary the fireplace reared over them bell was in shadow but her breathing was loud and uneven and you could smell the wine this is the endgame she said again its as if were all part of some great tragic tapestry across time and now im walking this house and this town like a ghost like the ghost like the ghost merrily said softly that youll become like in the belfry while jane was in the kitchen scrambling a basic breakfast together the phone rang in the scullery put your mother on please jane shes not here well get her sophie hill said it was about halfnine outside the scullery window the first blossom was ghosting the apple trees although the sky was dull ethel was sitting on the wall watching for movements among the graves in the churchyard not so easy jane said she went over to ludlow last night and shes not back yet and of course she forgot her mobile oh my god sophie said it was saturday so she was probably calling from home shes there now whats the matter sophie drew breath as if she was about to explain something sophie is there something wrong something i can tell her if she thank you jane sophie said and hung up and jane was worried now because sophie was worried conspicuously a woman not known for displaying unwarranted emotion lol had been up for a couple of hours when gomer parry arrived at the back door gomer had a small boy with him about ten fair hair combat trousers tell him gomer said the small boy looked at lol then over the fence into the orchard then he tried to run past gomer into the entry that led back into church street gomer caught him tell him get off me you ole paedophile we gonner do this the easy way boy or the hard way gomer said either you tells this

what i yeard the next caller had asked for mrs watkins jane hadnt recognized the voice but it was too precise to be like emma from everest doubleglazing or somebody in delhi calling on behalf of

hereford and worcester and theres nothing lol please in the dream and she knew all along that it was a dream merrily was at a junction of several old streets with gilded buildings on either side they had timbers like bars of dull gold and small bricks like jewels and the entrance of each street as she approached it was aglow with enticing lights the air perfumed with applewood smoke but the further in she went the darker and closer it all became the brickwork crumbling the beams blackening and the perfume gradually corrupted by a rising stench of dampness and rot and ahead of her slapping of sandals on dry flagstones a woman with a musicalinstrument case swinging like a censer from one hand scared merrily began wading out of the dream she opened her eyes and one of them hurt the light was grey and rationed sweat congealing on her face like a sour syrup she pushed the plain cream duvet away tentatively lowered her bare feet to bare boards no splinters on this floor this was very old wood worn smooth long before it had been laid here could have come from anywhere had its own history the weir house hundreds of disparate histories mingled here their vibrations filtered through reclaimed timbers and the stones of demolished barns from miles away and nothing would be god what time is it in bra and pants and small pectoral cross she stumbled across to the only window a gothic slit with just one pane and peered out she saw a short track with a metal gate at the end there was a flat field a glint of river and above it all sprouting out of the wooded bank and a sky that was as cold and hard as marble something like a ragged and monstrous clump of giant brown mushrooms use the castle room bell pepper opening the door for her but not entering an engaging smile through twisted teeth but if you see marion be careful shes unstable merrily had not wanted at that time to see marion she remembered sitting down on the bed alone to think and to pray st patricks breastplate hold me safe from the forces of evil on each of my dyings shed your light must have slept for she went back to the bed the rest of her clothes tshirt jeans fleece were in a heap beside it her watch on top it was nearly eleventhirty am shed slept for nearly six hours she had to start talking to people jane lol mumford the bishop recalling a bathroom somewhere mercifully modern she grabbed her clothes into a bundle and unlocked the oak door yes it did have a key and she had locked it and went out into a short passage that was daylightdim interior limeplastered walls of wattle and daub which was basically clay and cow muck over a framework of branches and twigs clay and cow muck and animal fat and whatever other personal ingredients merrily stopped clutching the bundle to her chest the woman standing at the end of the passage was not belladonna like hello breinton was on the western side of hereford in sloping wooded countryside that managed to conceal most of the citys lower more modern buildings so that from the road outside the fyneham residence you could see the cathedral apparently poking out of greenery as if the city centre was a neighbouring village eirion parked his peugeot half on the grass verge just out of sight of the solid wooden gates that were like castle gates all you could see of the house was a brick wall a chimney and a burglar alarm homes up here cost an arm and a leg now herefords beverly hills jane said sourly she was seriously uptight the world full of invisible hostility if shed been a hedgehog shed have been rolled up in a ball spikes out if thats meant to be an insult it would escape fyneham eirion locked the car hes a beverly hills kind of person how do you reckon we get to the front door you need one of those little batteringram things the cops have jane eirion was looking at her as though she might have been secretly carrying one dont do anything right leave this to me you know me irene jane put on an icy smile walking definition of the word discretion look dinky little door in the wall there was a black iron ballhandle when eirion turned it the door opened onto a short gravel drive and this imposing blindingly white conservatory porch with a victorian type of bell pull that turned out to be electric and sent big ben chimes bonging through the house the woman who responded was serious secondwife material bleached blonde about thirtyfive and dressed for hovering hopelessly with hitech secateurs she stayed inside keeping a hand on the door eirion treating her to his winning smile oh hi sorry to just turn up like this but jack said if we were ever passing im sorry this is the right house isnt it jack fyneham jack she looked blank for a moment and then she said oh you mean johnno actually we just know him as jd at school oh i see youre this for me tessa jd fyneham appeared in person at her shoulder wearing a halfsmile that faded with gratifying speed into this ohshit expression when he saw who was outside jane smiled at him why dont you take them up to your rooms johnno tessa said ive got this guy coming about the pool which your dad of course conveniently forgot about cool eirion beamed jds told us so much about his rooms in the first hour nobody rang lol went upstairs to merrilys bedroom and brought down the washburn he kept there and tuned it and played fingerstyle to ethel the way he had when hed lived in blackberry lane and ethel had been his cat and hed probably still been halfmental walking across to the vicarage hed seen a woman looking at him and then shed frowned and looked away and lol had thought jesus no and put his head down and almost run across and into the driveway jane in the doorway with eirion waiting to leave had glared at him with a kind of furious pity and now there was a knock on the front door and he put down the guitar and didnt know whether or not to answer it someone had paid a child twenty quid to write and deliver two anonymous letters the latest accusing him of beating up his halfsecret girlfriend the parish priest no smoke not everyone would believe gomer parry he envisioned a drab lynch mob of ledwardine villagers clustered around the porch what have you done with the vicar he closed his eyes and held his breath immediately lucy devenish sprang out of the shadows and he almost reeled back from the draught caused by the admonishing swirl of her poncho sitting there listening to your mournful wistful records its spring open your heart to the eternal let the world flow into you mr robinson just one man at the door closecropped red hair and a blue plaid jacket ah lol said now dont think were targeting you now youre a successful recording artist but experience has taught us that many of your kind still like to conduct experiments of a chemical nature in order to shall we say stimulate the creative juices so how much do you want frannie lol said couple of grams see you through the graveyard shift frannie bliss beamed how are you laurence can i come in well you can lol said but shes not here thats a shame bliss stepped inside followed lol into the kitchen hoped id catch her my day off strictly speaking but with having to go over to leominster to see gail mumford i thought id call in i havent spoken to merrily this morning im just here kind of minding the phone shell be in ludlow then will she why would you say that you know anything about that peculiar business what lets deal with merrily and mumford bliss rubbed his forehead lol being straight with each other now can only save a lorra serious pain later had a call at home this morning from karen my new dc you wont have met her karens current headache is being second cousin twice removed to mumford who seems to have forgotten hes no longer permitted to hit people with his truncheon as it were basically karens feeling guilty because for reasons of family shes been doing pnc checks for him and divulging things she shouldnt have family lol said he didnt seem to have one any more outside of merrily and jane bliss sat down at the pine refectory table its bloody lucky i understand how this area operates this got passed up to headquarters karend be ironing her uniform tonight how much do you know about the robbie walsh business i just live a quiet life mr bliss lol said writing my little songs but you do have the ear of the reverend and other bits too its rumoured lol let me put it this way andy mumford was a fine detective with a good nose but once youre out youre out and andys crossed a line you do not cross bliss talked about a family on the plascarreg estate name of collins who were being looked after by the police after fingering several drug dealers they had a son niall formerly associated with some youngsters who it seemed had not been nice to robbie walsh i had karen looking after them there was a message for her this morning to ring the collinses at their safehouse seems theyre not too happy about this strange copper who turned up to talk to niall in some detail about robbie walsh and things that got done to him drugs are one thing but the collinses are sincerely hoping their sons not gonna be called to give evidence against his former playmates on this one for reasons that may become apparent have you spoken to mumford laurence this is the whole point we cant find mumford his wife says he went out yesterday saying he was finalizing arrangements about his mothers funeral and didnt come back he phoned would you believe a neighbour asking her to convey to gail that he was ok why would he do that he doesnt like confrontation and whether he thinks we bliss shrugged helplessly i dont know lol hes not himself or maybe he is himself and he shouldnt be any more because hes fuckin retired gail is consequently frantic gail knows how hes been lately and how far he might go compulsory retirements like a jail sentence in reverse and probably just as stressful lol said hell have something to prove if only to himself maybe he wont feel able to come home until hes done it i agree bliss said but its worse than that ok our colleagues in shropshire had robbie down as accidental death no evidence to the contrary no suicide note no one else involved they knew of mumford seems to have thought there was more to it and this was getting to him because he thought as a copper he should have seen it and stopped it exactly and it looks like he could be right knowing what we now know thanks it seems to mumford theres reason to think the lad was so terrified of going back to the plascarreg he topped himself and what is the reason to think that i cant tell you that and frankly i dont really want to know lol said but it might help merrily you think hes still in contact with her none of us is in contact with her she went out without her phone the thing is do you want a cup of tea frannie glass of cider no ta i want to know what the thing is i cant tell you that lol said bliss smiled bastard lol shrugged all right bliss said you first she went out with mumford to the plascarreg and she got hurt bliss halfrose she got hairt bruised face black eye some kids mumford found robbies computer and they were seeing what he had on it there in this garage these kids evidently thought there might be something on the computer that could incriminate them so they smashed it mumford got attacked and merrily was hurt trying to get some kid off him kid was trying to choke him with a chain bliss leaned back breathed down his nose and she didnt report this incident to me because because of mumford dont bliss stood up dont say another word laurence i encounter mumford im likely to nick the bastard meself i just urge you if you talk to merrily and shes in contact with him to tell him to give himself up i mean whats he actually done impersonated a police officer impersonated himself in fact its what he could do bliss said to whom i think i need to know dont i yeh bliss said all right ill have a glass of cider please this looks like being a long day holy shit eirion said you bastard somehow jane had expected him to have calmed down since last night but it was clear that his usual chapelwhipped welshspeaking caution had failed to reengage what if going out with her had fatally damaged his equilibrium still she could see that jd fynehams home office occupying the upstairs of what seemed like a whole wing of a very sizeable house was something to inspire strong feelings envy lust that kind of reaction in the male of the species the room was dotted with pinpoint lights and underlaid with a low hum it had this bluemauve ambience from concealed lighting with daylightquality bulbs most of the stuff in here jane was unsure what it actually did there were three computers one was an evesham and they didnt come cheap on plush kidneyshaped workstations a cluster of printers and scanners and other hitechlooking items of hardware which seemed to be connected with well desktop publishing she guessed like on an industrial scale you could eirion seemed to be having respiratory problems you could produce bloody vogue up here pays its way lewis pays its way jd fyneham said the way he kept calling eirion lewis it was like that sneering way that inspector morse talked to sergeant lewis on the tv he was wearing a deep purple rugby shirt and black trousers in this kind of snakeskin leather thats all you need to know he said now what do you want im busy obviously eirion said bitterly look we were a bit pissed last night all right its not about last night eirion said jane had wandered over to a side table stacked with asized glossy magazines the top one had a picture on the cover of a black and white village that she was sure she ought to recognize beside the magazine was a stack of flyers come away from those fyneham snapped but jane had grabbed one do you want to make your parish magazine into a genuine goingconcern a professional publication that every parishioner will want to buy well well its a legitimate business fyneham said sulkily jane eirion walked over jd seems to be the guy behind parish pump irene it offers a service to vicars and parish councils to turn their parish magazines into like hello oh please fyneham said im offering to teach them the basic craft of journalism i dont know anything about this eirion said he probably hasnt hit wales yet mum got the package but decided people wouldnt want to see pictures of the parish council in the nude and like read about the churchwardens private habits you may take the piss fyneham said but seven parishes have already signed up for the introductory package and what does that do for them exactly eirion said they learn the basics of journalism how to spot a story how to write it i spend a couple of weekends in the parish and sub the first issue for them or produce the whole thing for a fee its a shithot idea lewis and its working if a parish magazine looks halfway decent local businesses are more inclined to advertise and they can charge more for display ads that way they get the new steeple before the rest of the church falls down jane was forced to concede that it wasnt such a bad concept you do it all yourself so far but i expect ill soon be able to employ some of the guys from the media studies group on a parttime basis not that lewis would be interested this is all your dads kit eirion said he produces real glossies trade stuff right nah this is just overspill hes got a proper plant down in town with a few staff fyneham shrugged we help each other out there was a noticeboard at the end of the long room with some magazine covers pinned to it microlite monthly you and your digicam the clinical therapist international readersgroup forum what hereford council can do for you all crap really tell the truth the old man hates what he does fyneham said hed rather be a real journalist any day of the week but real journalists dont have a pad like this with five acres and a pool its swings and roundabouts lewis the old man goes on about secure income if i have this to fall back on i can go out there and like soar eirion looked faintly contemptuous but then his family had been loaded since for ever jane started to wonder if fyneham would maybe give her a weekend job hadnt earned a penny of her own since the maid thing at stanner hall but then she remembered why they were here does your dad own q then fyneham stared down at her eyes narrowing she noticed a faint sheen on his face above the weekend stubble that eirion said some guys in his year started cultivating from about wednesday were talking about lol robinson eirion said aw fyneham shuffled out this crooked grin look maybe itll get in maybe it wont youre saying you did it on spec youve never done that written a piece for a magazine and just sent it in see if it gets used cant say i have jd scared of rejection huh ive had quite a few pieces published ok not in q yet but some of the others fanzines oh better than that look somebody tells me about this guy whos just brought an album out and how he used to be halfway famous way back and how he used to be a mental patient with a police record burns me a cd like i dont personally go for that acoustic shit but i get onto the net dredge up some background and think yeah ill go and interview him you told him you worked for q eirion said i told him i was a freelance whats wrong with that you told him it was definitely going in jane said i told him i couldnt be sure when it would go in and i couldnt jane looked at eirion he was redfaced and tightlipped and looking far younger than he had when he was smarming the second wife at the door it was all turning out to be no big deal just another wannabe chancing his arm ok a wannabe with a head start well a head start on eirion anyway she wished theyd never come now she wished she was in ludlow with mum she wished they could just get out of here anyway it wasnt fair she said to fyneham more for eirions sake than anything lol robinsons a really decent guy with a lot of talent and you conned him you wont say that if it makes it into the magazine fyneham knowing he was on top now his grin turning into a sneer or maybe it had been a sneer all along anyway why should you be worried about the guy being conned when hes beating the shit out of your mother a few seconds later jane was hearing eirion saying like from a long way away jane no but it was like when shed tried on mums new glasses the whole room had gone red all the printers and the binders and the scanners and the copiers and the stateoftheart flatscreen computers including the big handsome one that she was holding in her arms maybe sixteen hundred quids worth its cables wrenched out of their sockets and dragging along the carpet as she backed away towards the window fyneham snarling youre insane youll be paying for that for the rest of your it fell off the desk jane said through her teeth our word against yours keep away from me you scumbag she tripped over an extension cable and had to go down on one knee to prevent the computer slipping out of her arms and fyneham let out a screech for christs sake lewis do something about this bitch out of my hands jd and itll be out of mine jane said if you take one more step what do you want i want to know where you got it from got what you know what youve been trying to bullshit us all along you think were like hicks or something and youre this bigtime professional journalist i dont know what youre you jane hefting the computer above the level of her chin further to fall more damage you do put it down fyneham like went into spasm put it down and well talk well talk first its not paid for you stupid bitch oh dear look fyneham said i was just told what to ask ok and he bought me eirion came over then and jane clutched the computer to her chest in case he snatched it but he just stood between her and fyneham who looked close to tears eirion just looking puzzled bought you what fyneham looked down at his trainers arms stiffened fists clenched by his sides the evesham your dad bought you the evesham he bought it and im paying him off week by week my dad he came up the hard way he doesnt do anything for nothing but he got you the evesham if you asked lol some questions hell kill me is that what happened lewis will you please tell that bi your girlfriend to put it down could you put it down jane jane stood for a few moments trying to work out what was coming out here when all shed wanted to know was whod told fyneham this evil crap about lol giving mum the black eye jane she looked into eirions worried eyes and picked up what they were saying if you drop that thing now weve lost it whatever it is she carried the big computer across the room to the nearest table to the door and let it down slowly keeping her hands on the base in case she had to snatch it up again this was a relief frankly but it was fyneham who nearly sobbed all right lets go right back to the beginning jd eirion said bliss said there were some small factories not much more than workshops on the edge of the barnchurch industrial estate not the halfway respectable part where the shops and warehouses were but at the rough end where it joined the plascarreg only one of these had ever been let a lightengineering plant there had gone bust fairly soon but a small business syndicate on the plascarreg had paid the tenants to pretend otherwise and sublet part of their unit for the preparation and distribution of crack cocaine and other commodities it was a relatively foolproof arrangement and nobody had ever disturbed this enterprise until robbie walsh discovered that the site to the rear of the workshop was of archaeological importance being a onetime place of execution such was robbies enthusiasm for firsthand knowledge of the past that he was disinclined to take piss off son and forget all this exists as a useful piece of advice and so particular youngsters on the estate were encouraged to take an interest in robbie and his leisure pursuits to the extent of borrowing some of his books what did they do to him lol asked eventually wanting to get this over with each of the workshops has a storage shed at the rear bliss said wood shed traditional design with exposed crossbeam bliss stared into his glass of gomer parrys cloudy homemade cider the colour of rust and border clay threw down names that lol had never heard before jason mebus connor boyd shane nicklin the first time they hanged him bliss said they cut him down fairly quickly raw madness the backstairs were a dim halfspiral coldly lit by one vertical slit too high to see through merrily was halfexpecting the kitchen below to have a greasy spit and dead meat hanging from hooks but it wasnt like that good morning again the woman said the kitchen was warm and glazed with light tinted orange and emerald from illuminated glass in gothic tracery around the tops of two long thin windows pale ash units with olivetiled work surfaces were built around a doubleoven aga a rack of oak shelves displayed an apothecarys collection of coloured jars and stoppered bottles bell asked me to take care of you the woman who hadnt yet introduced herself had tufted brown hair wore a whiteandgreychecked suit no jewellery if not quite i have to say in those words coffee was percolating and she was making wholemeal toast have a seat mrs watkins oh merrily said nothing a stone trough of red and orange tulips sent up a warm glow from below the twin windows which opened up views across the fields to where the town rose in steep tiers to the church tower its rather late for breakfast the woman said but i dont suppose you particularly feel like lunch tea or coffee would be merrily had noticed that the tulips were in fact growing out of a stone coffin its interior shaped for a body fine life directly out of death symbolism everywhere the woman wrinkled her nose tapped the coffin with a shoe im still trying to persuade her to put that morbid artefact outside having already bribed the plumber to say there was no way it was going to work as a kitchen sink no way shed have it outside either bell must have been cosying up to death since her teens she must be a challenging person to accommodate merrily said actually we accommodate each other fairly well i call in most days on the way to or from the office or for lunch organize all the maintenance people and the services and the cleaner and the gardener and everyone else shes far too vague to deal with do grab yourself a seat there was a round table with wooden chairs reflecting the design of seventeenthcentury glastonbury church chairs with stubby xlegs merrily slid one out and sat down cautiously i think we spoke on the phone briefly susannah pepper put the tray of coffee and toast in the centre of the table and sat down opposite her and smiled ominous a friendly relaxed lawyer was rarely a good omen wheres bell i dont know susannah looked merrily in the eyes she was about thirty and she seemed fit and confident and capable her skin was softly furry like a peachs i persuaded her to go out and let me handle things shes awfully disappointed in you feels betrayed silence the sun had come out setting fire to the orange glass in the tracery at the top of the windows and the tulips in the stone coffin reached up like small goblets waiting to be filled all right merrily said at last im going to have to ask arent i how did you know who i was susannah stood up and went out of the room and came back with a leather briefcase extracting a folded newspaper and tossing it on the table this mornings edition merrily opened the paper and stared down growing cold with dismay at two pictures one of the hanging tower the other of herself in colour full face under the headline exorcize our castle of death evil ghost must go say townsfolk she looked up this is crap i think you should read it she read it it was overdramatized and dumbeddown it was crass it was full of conjecture but at the centre of it the mayor of ludlow george lackland confirmed last night that he had discussed the issue with hereford exorcist the rev merrily watkins its very much a matter for the church he said whether you believe in ghosts or not theres no doubt in my mind that a religious service or an exorcism would make many people feel more at peace its been suggested that these tragic deaths have brought tourists into the town but to my mind notoriety of this kind is no good for anyone in the long run ok its not crap not entirely thank you its misleading but its come from an actual petition sent to george lackland someone obviously sent a copy to the press but nobodys spoken to me about it i mean one reason im here is to try and avoid anything drastic or laughable susannah said holy water and incantations or am i misrepresenting your occupation dont know where this picture came from either merrily said looks like an old one couple of years old anyway she was outside ledwardine church and she was in the full kit it looked like an official picture from the diocese she didnt remember it being taken and now bell pepper had evidently seen it bell who disliked the clergy had learned that she was not only a minister but a working exorcist and she wasnt called mary everything was now entirely clear and the situation couldnt be worse would you mind if i had a cigarette yes i would susannah said cigarettes are disgusting and lets drop the bullshit shall we why are you associating my client with what youve come here to do bearing in mind before you answer that ive talked to george lackland in which case youll be aware that it was george lackland who approached us the diocese george is an oldfashioned man susannah said he still thinks the church should have a role in the way this town is run and he seems to have fallen for the myth that the deaths of two children and one old woman are manifestations of some kind of spiritual malaise and is he entirely wrong there hes in danger of becoming a laughing stock well now that george had dropped her in it there seemed little point in dressing this up a lot of people saw bell with robbie walsh in the days before he died a woman famously obsessed with death last night she told me shed been taking steps to adopt him which would explain quite a lot can you confirm that i dont have to confirm anything to you susannah said your ridiculous role with a failing religion gives you no right legal or moral to probe into peoples private lives up to you susannah but adoption at least offers a plausible explanation for all right yes susannah leaned back and opened her jacket it was already in progress it was to have been a substantial settlement and the mother was practically biting our hands off kept ringing me up just to make sure we werent going off the idea figures merrily thought of all the things mumford had said about his sister the extreme bitterness towards their own mother after the boy died big money maybe lifechanging money had just gone down the pan hed have moved in here susannah said and gone to school in ludlow and his gran of whom he was fond but who was becoming unfit to look after him would have seen far more of him than she already did i dont claim to have fully fathomed out the relationship between bell and the boy but they certainly had shared interests which he seems to have been unable to pursue at home and perhaps she needed an heir of sorts would that be you mean for the new palmers guild trust what exactly is that no big secret the trust into which most of bells assets will pass when she dies will support in perpetuity specific historic features of the town merrily nodded like the maintenance of the st leonards cemetery as a wilderness with corpses be assured that i and my successors will administer the trust entirely according to my clients wishes and the conservation of certain yew trees preservation of public rights of way connecting sacred places and perhaps keeping particular viewpoints open in the face of possible future development the specific details have yet to be sorted out and you still havent explained what youre doing here im getting to it merrily said but im trying to find out how much you know and how much you understand about bells other plans for when she dies dont know what you mean dont you i mean you really dont perhaps you should spell it out im wary merrily said i think id rather be speaking to her stepdaughter than her lawyer i mean what does your father say about all this dad dad says be kind to her never exploit her and keep me the hell out of it susannahs eyes narrowed what do you know about my dad music producer bewitched by bells obvious charms maybe liked unusual music but couldnt handle the extreme lifestyle which in her case went with it he lives in sacramento now has three children plays golf your mother was his first wife whom he left for bell but thats all well in the past my mothers second husband if you want the full nepotism bit is david sebald brother of peter sebald one of the original partners in the firm im working for but you and bell never got on all that well with davids other kids so i used to spend quite a few weekends with dad and bell who was so completely out of it most of the time that i sometimes felt at the age of about fifteen like her stepmother like i said weve always accommodated each other im not judgemental mmm bringing smith sebald one of their wealthiest private clients would have done susannah no harm at all with the firm thats to say where no criminal law or local statutes are infringed i dont question her behaviour susannah said this towns full of eccentrics you must be worried about her though put it this way my private life would have been a whole lot easier if the firm had been based in birmingham because then bell would have come to visit and gone home the next day but this being where it is she doesnt want to leave not ever in fact do you know what im saying through the long window the town glittered on its hill the sun gilding the pinnacles on the church tower and coating what you could see of the castle walls with crusted honey no motor vehicles visible a living dream of olde englande thats pretty ridiculous susannah finally looked unnerved you must realize that if i started dismissing ideas that seemed ridiculous i wouldnt get very far in this job then its a ridiculous job its apparently been estimated merrily said that one in three people has had a paranormal experience and one in ten has seen a ghost it all makes perfect sense to bell youre saying shes become completely insane no i dont think she ok its not good its not healthy its spiritually a bit squalid frankly but its not insane in fact its all been worked out very practically im sorry susannah backed away folding her arms but if there was any truth in what youve just outlined shed in my view shed be guaranteed certifiable then how do you explain it how do you explain her nocturnal perambulations shes a night person in every sense her albums are dark and doomy she likes to mix with goths and weirdos and shes a bloody exhibitionist an exhibitionist who wants to protect her private life and wont talk to the media except the local media thats not so unusual its part of the starmentality they like to have it both ways look merrily said shes led what she calls a temporary kind of life she says she was diagnosed at an early age with a congenital heart defect and shes lived her whole life with the angel of death standing outside the door sharpening his scythe i dont know if thats true or not id like to get her to a heart specialist but she wont she has a fear of dying in hospital or anywhere but here shes moved from place to place shes had the money to do that and she cant settle anywhere until she arrives in the place of her dreams literally all right whether she had been dreaming about ludlow for years is anybodys guess but shes convinced herself she had and she comes here and she connects its a town where you can walk from century to century and its not been overcosmeticized its as it was and for bell the atmosphere everywhere is dense with eternity oh for heavens sake its pretty and its a good place to work i can understand her falling in love with it for bell those streets up there sing especially at dead of night when shes on her own they sing she sings oh please ok you dont get it you dont feel the density thats fine well hey im sorry susannah threw up her arms im sorry im not a bloody airyfairy artist merely a humble solicitor we just grease the wheels that keep the world turning and im really sorry but we dont have time to drift off into the ether unlike poets and priests apparently im not saying i can feel it on that level or anywhere near she walks around at night in unorthodox clothing and she sings sometimes wow shes feeding herself into the fabric of the town i realize this is bollocks to you but to her its everything and she doesnt know how much time she has left and when that times up she wants to to be a ghost to be a ghost here catherine of aragon prince arthur marion de la bruyère belladonna susannah snorted and turned away saul peppers regular daughter with a solid job and no weird musicbusiness links did you bring this paper in here this morning merrily said i mean you actually showed this to her its all over town someone would have told her sooner or later and what exactly did she say susannah turned round she became distressed she told me you were in the house upstairs that shed invited you into her house and you were betraying her i told her to let me handle it i didnt want her wailing and screaming at you like one of her albums i told her id get rid of you make sure you never bothered her again and how would you have done that some kind of injunction idve had you restrained gone to a higher authority merrily put her head on one side god dont be stupid after i spoke to you the other morning i wasnt satisfied that youd taken any notice damn right so i spoke to some other people in the church and i was referred to your superior the director of deliverance what canon clarke ive got it written down at the office it felt as though the room shook she told me that youd now virtually resigned from your official position susannah said because of personal problems she said you were overstressed she said if i had any more trouble i should contact her immediately i see she said we could deal with it between us i hadnt realized she was a barrister that mustve been a comfort to you if you want the truth susannah said i had the feeling of some personal friction and thats why i decided to talk to you myself and now im wishing i hadnt ok merrily took a breath i want to get something right did bell actually use the word betrayal about me she said youd won her trust and entered her fortress by deceit and youd betrayed her in the worst way possible she she lost it for a while i was glad to get her out of the house how long ago hour or so hour and a half any idea at all where shes gone susannah shook her head she just put on her long coat and walked away and then a minute or two later she just you know screamed just once shes always been a screamer hasnt she you mean you took no notice i went to the window there was no sign of her well i think i have to find her dont i merrily said dont you ever give up no look tell me if im wrong here robbies death the way it happened and where it happened took something out of bells life that i dont think shell ever get back now she thinks were about to try and take something else away doesnt she i just cant believe any of that susannah moved away across the flags a trickle of sweat gleaming on her forehead its not rational even for her its very rational for her and now she thinks the towns turned against her did she tell you she was attacked last night did you see her face she said she tripped susannah stood with her back to the window her mouth half open her control slipping away fast tripped coming down the linney but now worst of all the towns conspiring with the church to have marion exorcized marion and all she represents youll lie like carrion ill fly like marion look that petitions virtually a fake susannah shouted im sorry most people here couldnt care less about all this nonsense yes there were petition forms in a few shops but hardly anybody signed its george cant you see that my bloody soontobe fatherinlaw god help me george is behind it why would ask him you go and ask the old bastard on the way back to the road midafternoon now merrily stopped to look back at the weir house a shambling timbered and stone farmhouse born again trees on two sides were thickening into spring and the grass was getting longer and either she could hear the river or the hissing was in her head she walked across to the yew tree where the paths converged the hollow yew growing anew around its own exposed entrails wondering if shed dreamed last night that there was a door in it like in a fairy tale bell stowing something in there the mandolin in its case was this the same mandolin that had appeared on the cover of nightshades if so what was its significance she couldnt play it she probably couldnt play any instrument and anyway there was no door only a black and gaping hole as if the tree had been shot with a cannon ball merrily paused glanced over her shoulder and then stepped over the roots and into the tree the ripe and resinous yew scent all around her the door was here it was in the tree loose separated she edged it out it was the real thing beautifully shaped to fit the elliptical hole in the tree into which a solid frame had been moulded the door looked like oak and had strong castiron hinges one hanging off the key presumably was kept hidden somewhere in the tangle of tree but there was no need for it because the door had been brutally removed you could see the marks left by the crowbar or whatever had been used to wrench it off merrily went back into the hole and kicked something with her trainer picked it up and brought it out a prayer book no need to look inside to know this was going to be the one that george lackland said had been taken from st laurences someone had forced an entry and bell must have discovered it when she left she just you know screamed just once merrily went back in further this time pushing up her sleeves seemed there was room to fit a couple of people in here at least her fingers found something regular and rigid and jutting out at about chest height a ledge a shelf she felt around on top of it and drew back with a shudder something slick and slippery like fat on bone right she brought out the zippo the fatty item was a candle two of them on the wooden ledge she lit one and watched the ancient organism becoming a brackish grotto around her parts of its walls hanging like fragments of a rotting roodscreen other segments moist and alive like hard flesh the candle flame was reflected in several small jars with stoppers like the ones on the apothecary shelves in the kitchen only clear one had what looked like water in it with some sediment at the bottom others contained sandy soil crumbled dead leaves and what looked like chips of stone two bigger jars held coils of hair yellow and white and there was a small one with what seemed to be thin woodshavings but were probably nail clippings no mandolin case just you know screamed what are you doing merrily came out of the tree susannah pepper stood in the grass her business suit vainly buttoned against the raw madness in the air you knew about this susannah i thought you were going to look for her somebody broke into the tree that would be why she screamed it cost her a fortune she had this guy who does wood sculptures up from herefordshire she told him she was going to make it into a summer house not exactly do you know what she kept in there private things that was the point we werent supposed to know good an excuse as any merrily said i was once married to a lawyer the thing he used to say that i was most uneasy about was you can sleep better if you know when to stop asking questions theres one thing missing from here i dont the mandolin case she put in here last night i dont know anything about that i think ive seen it obviously she play the mandolin often susannah she play anything she plays games susannah said mumford waited on the spare land round by the old greyhound dog pub and he was wearing the new clothes hed bought at millets sort of clothes hed never worn in his life before joggers clothes felt real strange too loose like he was naked also had on robbies baseball cap the one that was always far too big on the boy made him look dafter than hed known mabbe there was another reason mumford was wearing that cap but he didnt want to think about that thing was nobody was looking at him half his life folks had seen him coming looked like a copper the way a sheep looked like a sheep and now feeling more conspicuous than at any time since his first day in uniform thirty years ago he was aware of folks passing by and nobody noticing him and he realized the socalled plain clothes hed been wearing for work all those years werent plain clothes at all these days they were obvious coppers clothes stayed at the green dragon last night biggest hotel in hereford therefore the most anonymous money no object emerging this morning in his jogging kit dumpy middleaged bastard casual civilian and even jason mebus never noticed him after hed come out the pub round about halfone jason had been straight down the chip shop the fries tuck and he was walking up now over greyfriars bridge loping along eating his chips and still making faster progress than the two lines of cars queuing up to get into town saturdayafternoon shoppers it was all queues in hereford now more useless chain stores and still no bypass on the schedules be gridlocked soon this city mabbe jason was meeting somebody in town a girl or one of his scumbag mates mumford let him get close enough to the end of the bridge and then he started jogging smiling at himself this was what retired bastards did to stay alive all looking like mumford in his tracksuit top and his pale blue trousers with elasticized bottoms and his trainers nobody else even walking this side of the bridge he could see the traffic lights up ahead now the vehicles nosetotail over the wall on his left was the river wye where there used to be a restaurant all this kind of recreation happening across the road now at left bank village so it was lucky jason wasnt heading towards town on that side no chance there far too crowded thirty yards behind jason now and the sound of his trainers was muffled by the growling traffic had his baseball cap pulled down over his eyes looking down at the footpath and just as well with fifteen or twenty yards to go jason heard him and glanced over his shoulder and then back into his chips just some sad ole jogger what mumford did next was start smiling beaming all over his face it didnt come easy never had but he did it dumpy middleaged genial smiling bastard civilian drawing level with jason now puffing a bit and slowing up as the traffic lights turned fortuitously to green all the drivers attention fixed on getting through and jason stuffing a chip in his gob never seen it coming soon as the boys hand was back in the chip bag mumfords shoulder connected with the muscle near the top of his arm the bag flying up in the air oh sorry mate sorry you fuckin clumsy let me help you boy mumford said and with his back to the traffic smacked jason in the mouth not too hard but hard enough the boy was still choking on the chip while mumford was propelling him down the street to the left and across the car park back towards the underside of the bridge figuring that under the bridge was best be nobody about on this side nice bit of dereliction fair bit of cover plenty of time plenty of river and he had the bastard who one way or another had murdered robbie walsh heavier than you know ledwardine vicarage lol said is the vicar there womans voice local accent lol said the vicar was out and asked if he could take a message he was unhappy hed answered two calls so far from parishioners both of whom seemed to have recognized his voice neither of whom had wanted to discuss the nature of their business with him the tones suggesting that they thought the vicar was not out at all but was perhaps upstairs sobbing into her pillow aching from dozens of bruises in places where they wouldnt show when will she be back i mean can you contact her has she got a mobile no she hasnt not at the moment i cant contact her im afraid lol heard a door opening behind him jane came into the scullery looking flushed followed by eirion damn the woman said look if she comes in can you get her to ring me like just me ok anybody else answers dont talk to them can you tell her that my names karen dowell tell her im andy mumfords something or other relation shell know oh youre calling from police headquarters pause who are you exactly karen dowell said my names lol robinson im a friend jane was making handleturning motions at him to wind this up he tucked the phone between his shoulder and his cheek and raised both hands at her ok karen dowell said i know who you are mr robinson have you heard from andy no but ive had bliss here i know that he said he was going to talk to the vicar they all seem to trust the vicar he talked to me instead where exactly is mrs watkins shes in ludlow damn karen said listen can i really trust yes you can not a word to bliss not to anybody apart from the vicar and andy if he calls i understand lol said dont even make notes you only need the sense of this ok ive been doing pnc checks for andy police computer yeah right and following stuff up im good with computers its my thing checked out a number of people connected with the plascarreg which you dont need to know about the one you do need to know about is jonathan swift the writer its a guy in ludlow who andy asked me to check a few days ago he calls himself something else there but this is the name in which his cars registered he hasnt got a record but im always suspicious when theres a name change involved so i made a few calls we had a previous address for him in cheshire near stockport so i belled a bloke i was at the police college with works at greater manchester police keeping it off the record and he put me onto another guy ok im stressing again that this is unofficial mr robinson and only for a andy b the vicar right my necks gonner be on the block here is this a man called jonathan scole thats correct his real names swift and the crux of it is his parents were shot dead both of them they you there mr robinson yes you on your own lol caught janes eye pointed at the door yes all right swifts parents ran a transport caff greasy spoon yeah they were shot as they were leaving at closing time just before midnight takings stolen i remember this one actually although no reason you would major police hunt but nobody ever caught very efficient head shots with a handgun well no shortage of them in the manchester area these days recently lol nodded as jane shrugged and slipped out with eirion last year ive got the date somewhere but that dont matter bit of a puzzler though because the takings came to just over three hundred peanuts in other words two people shot dead at close range for three hundred even in manchester you dont get that it was on crimewatch and they got zilch from the public it was all very carefully planned and kids after money for drugs arent that careful take my word and so whats the significance contract killing karen said thats the whisper thats the unspoken not a shred of evidence mind the parents were like underworld figures good god no they were respectable people who worked day and night and didnt even have any points on their driving licences contract killing ent what it used to be mr robinson too many guns about now and too many evil little buggers wholl do it for a thousand or less so this guy in ludlow changed his name because his parents were murdered he changed his name originally on police advice because people started pointing the finger collected a lot of money see sale of a house sale of a café to a national chain looking for a site now he was personally in the clear away on a businessstudies course full alibi but as i say neighbours and friends of mr and mrs swift were whispering about terrible domestic rows had a temper on him see not a happy family look lol said feeling his chest going tight can you spell this out what are we worrying about in particular i dont know this guy but i think merrily does well mr robinson i dont know do i im just passing on what ive discovered it might be something or nothing but id feel real bad if i hadnt passed it on and then something happened which is why im telling you now rather than wait till andy shows up and thats another problem ennit if im allowed to write your number down lol said ill call you back if i hear from andy that would be very good of you long as you remember dont talk to anyone else if youre not there thats exactly right karen said jane didnt even ask who hed been talking to she pressed him into a chair in the kitchen knelt down facing him gripping the chair arms lol listen just listen and then answer the questions when jack fine from q magazine came what exactly jane we need to swap over lol pushed himself up patting his jeans to make sure he had his car keys you need to stay here and i have to go over to ludlow huh mum is ok isnt she im sure shes fine just some things i need to tell her what things janes eyes were concentrated and glittering with so much awareness it was scary age of transition old enough to drive almost old enough to vote for a new government and get drunk in pubs with the states blessing old enough to have no more adult socalled secrets being whispered behind your back but telling her about her mother and a man who the police didnt like because his parents had been shot dead and about the kids on the plascarreg whod shown robbie walsh what it was like to be hanged how could any of this really help youre feeling sidelined arent you out of it jane said she never thinks about that she doesnt have time you make too many excuses for her sometimes she needs to put her own relationship first yeah ok do it you go well stay but first we need to ask you some things its called the weir house right and its down below the castle near the river she might not even be there now lol its a small town ill find her lol you can spare like ten ok five five minutes you do want to know who set you up dont you the anonymous notes it was a little kid ive just it was a big kid actually lol eirion said shes right for once this is heavier than you know for starters jack fines not from q magazine hes this bastard i go to school with and he was here purely to get information out of you i dont want to hold you up or anything but basically jane recognized him and this morning we went to his dads house to face him up his dad publishes magazines jane said he used to be a nationalpaper journalist and now he publishes all kinds of trade and like professional magazines and junk like that he also tips off the papers on stories and the son jd fyneham jack fine his personal weekend job is on much the same lines hes got all this desktop publishing kit and he does this churchmagazine scam and hes open for commissions and it seems to me hes not fussy where they come from we got so far with him eirion said and then it became clear there were people he was more intimidated by than like jane what you mean he edits the yardies international newsletter lol stood up look guys im sure this is significant stuff ill really want to know about tonight just tell us what questions fyneham asked you eirion said and then you can go and well stop here by the phone well he he did try to find out about merrily and me i suspect hed heard something but i headed him off i said i wasnt in any particular relationship at present oh we know hed heard something eirion said in fact any day now you could open the sun and find like villagers have been shocked by the violent loveaffair between their woman vicar and a rock singer with a conviction for a sex offence well more guarded than that obviously hes not kidding lol jane said watching his eyes jane i didnt tell him anything well somebody did either hes been sniffing around the village in his spare time or somebodys been feeding him sick gossip all right lol told them about gomer parry and the small boy and the ten quid youre actually saying this guy was behind that we dont know to be honest jane said we think hes got to be but whos behind him what else did he ask you about he went into the court case and what led up to it and the loonybin years all that he knew about it already and i just made sure he got it right told him it really wasnt much of a story any more hmm jane said and the rest was mainly about the music was i putting all my bad experiences into songs like heavy medication day which was fair enough he said it sounded like this dr gascoigne had done some unpleasant things to me he was trying to find out what they were i didnt tell him anything else i dont think so if i think of anything else ill call you on the mobile well leave it switched on jane said ok lol paused in the doorway so jack fine really wasnt doing an actual interview for q or anything im sorry ok lol said he walked across to the square to collect his astra a nobody again thinking that it was always harder for a nobody to defend himself his loved ones his reputation when lol had gone jane switched on the computer thinking how wise it had been of her to persuade mum to have an extra phone line installed where do we start eirion raised his eyes to the ceiling meaning janes attic apartment where last summer shed lost her virginity to him not realizing that despite all his manoftheworld crap he was simultaneously losing his to her never quite forgiven him for that out of the question jane said i didnt say anything the way you were sitting said it all jane clicked into internet explorer what are we looking for like has lol really told us anything we didnt already know it had become interesting when fyneham had admitted that the new evesham computer jane had been threatening with extinction had been bought for him in return for helping one of his dads hard to say if it was a friend or just a client but the guy had wanted to know about merrily and lol particularly lol which was bizarre what hed wanted to know basically as jane had understood it was like well dirt anything damaging lol and mum someone wanted to damage lol and mum just then unfortunately fynehams dads alfa had pulled up outside backup so fyneham had become braver presumably the old man was as bent as his son so jd had gone back on his story claiming hed been like just saying that about this guy to wind them up eirion pulled out a parish pump leaflet hed picked up from a pile in the office suite jane at once snatched it and screwed it up parish pimp more like no eirion grabbed it back smoothed it out i made some notes on this listed all the titles his dad publishes does that help us might do what hereford council can do for you do we know any bent councillors your mum might have offended most councillors wind up bent after a few years what else is on the list i forget microlite monthly digicam anorak rags i was saving the best one the clinical therapist you reckon google it eirion said the clinical therapist biannual digest of new developments in clinical psychiatry aimed primarily at hospitalbased psychiatrists and allied practitioners est lord shipston dclinpsych msc not many cartoons then eirion said lol once told me in one of his more embittered moments that the majority of shrinks rise to the top by having nothing at all to do with people but just writing papers for dismal publications like this i mean lord shipston how many neurotics has he ever had on the couch lets go back and snatch fyneham when he leaves the house were supposed to be minding the phone well just have to sit here and amuse ourselves actually irene jane said i think im probably having a frigid day too much exposure to male greed male dishonesty immorality hypocrisy that kind of stuff thanks dont you put your bloody huw edwards chapel face on youre no better you told me you werent a virgin you totally spoiled my first experience all the time im thinking oh no im going to be such a disappointment compared with all the others what do you think i was feeling i remember exactly what you were feeling i just didnt realize youd never felt one before the phone rang jane snatched it shes still not back no im sorry sophie i see sophie still thought jane should call her mrs hill too bad what did you want exactly i wanted to talk to her jane sophie jane said how old will i have to be before you recognize me as someone of mature intelligence and perception in your case jane although its possible i may live long enough to change my mind yeah yeah look can i sound you out about something while youre on eirion and me weve been talking to this guy who was set up to interview lol maybe to find stuff out about him and mum whos this guy called jd fyneham his dads a magazine publisher fyneham does this have you come across this parish pump thing offers to revamp parish magazines i have actually sophie said bryce orford left some leaflets for me to hand out to whos bryce orford the dean whats this about again somebodys trying to damage lol and mum thats the bottom line i mean you must know thats happening yes i believe it is i just hope this isnt one of your this is absolutely on the level sophie i swear on on the grave of lucy devenish and i think you know something dont you jane held her breath watching eirions stony chapel face awaken into human interest all right tell me everything sophie said jane had relented and about twenty minutes later she and eirion were into some mild petting on the rug by the desk when sophie called back that was um quick jane im in the office now and its very important that i talk to your mother well lols gone over to ludlow now and hes got a phone so we expect to be in contact soon the best we can hope for i suppose jane you should know that im now treating you as a person of mature intelligence right jane had a hand under her top repositioning her bra she blushed thank you ive had to come into the office after a call from the bishop somethings happened and the bishop was in a quandary and in the absence of merrily im afraid he was forced to refer it to the deliverance panel telling me at the same time of course in the hope that the information would also reach merrily she rang jane remembered the callaghanclarke woman when this morning she thought the media might be after mum i forgot so much was do you know what that was about i think i do but this is something else thats just developed merrily probably knows about it already which is why she hasnt been in touch jane i can hardly believe it sophies tone indicating that she just had to talk to somebody or shed go crazy whats jane raised her eyebrows at eirion who was on his feet face full of questions its the castle again sophie said bleakly another child part four sam if man does survive does he produce ghosts i think this could only be assumed if he retained his psychefield t c lethbridge ghost and divining rod rapping on the windows and crying through the locks anon big bump when merrily came hurrying onto castle square the whole space seemed to be vibrating duss duss duss to the dampened thud of some saturday buskers bass drum set up down by the deli duss duss duss the sound of an execution day she crossed the square and stood by the tourist office and looked around through the crowd bell where the hell are you the clarity had gone from the sky gauzy mauvish clouds were smothering the sun and there was no breeze to flutter the red and white pennants hanging between gables like a row of teeth set in bleeding gums shed been down to the bottom of corve street to fetch the volvo a parking penalty under one of the wipers turned the key seven times and it kept failing to start another sign of mortality to join the ticking behind the dash the rattle under the chassis the grinding on corners shed still been shaking the wheel in frustration when she found that it had somehow started two wheels crashing down from the kerb to charge up the battery or whatever shed driven through town down by the side of the castle to the stooping community of dinham with its twelfthcentury chapel dedicated to murdered st thomas and then to the hissing river teme a vain search for the woman who wanted to fly like marion back in the car park at the top of town shed paid for a full day near enough and then found a phone box to call jane engaged singlelane vehicles were threading around the square but the main traffic was people scurrying about like figures in a brueghel so many clothes now tshirts sweatshirts fleeces and hooded tops reflecting in their myriad colours the outerwear of merrie englande and so many people talking to one another a sense of community you seldom saw anywhere else robbie walsh would walk these streets in a state of nearecstasy he was happier than any child i ever saw she felt she was inside robbie again seeing images of how things were how they worked the nuts and bolts of medieval life looking at now and feeling then as if in some mystical way this might point her towards bell mrs watkins a man was wading through the crowd towards her a brown overall flapping around his knees like the uniforms of shopkeepers when she was a kid his eyes glittering under the jutting shelf of his forehead a prophet from a childrens bible duss duss duss mr mayor we told that boy to keep on playing the mayor nodded towards the busker who also had a guitar and a harmonica but it was the drumbeat that carried like plodding boots across the square anything to make it seem like a normal saturday you havent seen bell have you i dont go looking for her mrs watkins besides youll have seen the papers i suppose now look there was nothing i could do about that ive had three radio stations on already this morning thats why i left the house and now this my god mrs watkins is there no end about the petition merrily said i think its time you arent you going in he stared down at her in where you only just got here or what i more or less yes you mean you dont know about the girl before merrily could ask him what he meant george lackland had taken her by the elbow and was steering her towards the castle gate where for the first time she noticed that nobody was going in which probably accounted for the excess of people on the square the big gates were open as if to let vehicles in and out but the way was blocked by police two men and a woman george striding over to address them wheres steve britton gone back in mr lackland only i got mrs watkins here from the bishops office the male cops expression said so merrily saw that the gift shop where visitors normally paid their entrance fees was closed unattended stands of booklets and postcards pottery tapestry stationery all halflit again topheavy with clergy already you ask me the policewoman muttered but george lackland wasnt listening can we come in or not the policeman thought about it maybe remembering georges toptable seat on the west mercia police committee but then he shook his head cant sir sorry can you wait for the sergeant merrily followed george lackland back towards the big cannon and the pollarded trees outside the walls again they got scaffolding up see george said on the inside of the hanging tower idea being theyre going to bar them windows stop this happening once and for all his accent was broadening under stress fellers doing the work they gets here bout halfnine so obviously nobody could get up while they was there girl teenager mustve known that too waits till they breaks for lunch and then shes up the scaffolding like a monkey and well up on the ledge before anybody spots her the square seemed to tilt like a giant board game and she merrily looked up this close to the curtain wall the only tower visible was the keep from which robbie walsh had fallen the girls still up there fars i know aye they blocked off the footpath back of the castle somebody told me shed warned em if they brought the fire brigade with a ladder shed well shed go off shes threatening to jump oh aye oh bloody hell yes they know who she is i dont they got this psychiatrist there now reckons hes got it all worked out reckons shell come down if they keeps it lowkey police got all the visitors out and theres an ambulance standing by this psychiatrist i dunno who he is but what i reckon is you should be in there george sank his hands into the pockets of his slacks looking at the ground it was me rang bernard see i wanted him to come over but he wouldnt that was no surprise bishops didnt do handson certainly not in a situation this public this critical and who apart from george and a handful of cranks would think it was anything at all to do with the church she looked at the crowded square with a new awareness saw that most of the shoppers and the tourists knew exactly what was going on but were putting on an act of responsible british disinterest not glancing at the castle walls at least until they were past the police and the animated sense of community that was simply locals and tourists united in veiled voyeurism the local kids were less circumspect small gangs of them gathering a boy of about eight dancing around the policewoman on the gate kelly how will we know if she jumps kelly youll hear a big bump now go away same laconic policewoman whod dealt with bell after phyllis mumford drowned the boy looked mildly shocked for a moment then let out a cackle of laughter kids merrily said all heart and thought bell realizing then that shed been aware for some moments of a familiar bmw sports car parked near the castle bookshop she could see a notice in its window guessed it would say doctor on call well of course and she was in no position to say anything while claiming she was on leave shed gone behind saltashs back and worse callaghanclarkes and had had a meeting with george lackland to discuss the possibility of an exorcismofplace must be true it was in the papers with a nice big incriminating picture merrily watkins deliverance consultant had lied from the beginning and she couldnt in her own defence mention bernie dunmores role in the deception because after she fell bernie was likely to be the principal target all she could do now to save him from an ignominious exit and the diocese from the possibility of a disastrous successor was to resign quietly take on the extra parishes and disappear just around the corner at the end of the block an elderly man in a hat and a woman in a pink puffa jacket were standing outside the assembly rooms a placard made of corrugated cardboard stretched between them its message scrappily written in thick fibretip the innocents are dying only the power of god can stop this now friends of yours mr mayor i know them mmm what you saying mrs watkins why did you want bernie here mr mayor you know why because whatever he says he believes theres something evil here george looked over merrilys head across the town hes seen it after all merrily watched a fire engine rumbling onto the square no speed no lights no warbler the emergency services apparently did not take their instructions from a disturbed teenager and here was the mayor of ludlow still publicly hanging all this on an yearold ghost rather than a living woman in a period shroud an increasingly pitiable woman who for some reason he regarded as his nemesis why if youre a real friend of the bishops george merrily said you wont mention that tenquid bet ever again another policeman was approaching the castle gateway from the inside ah heres sergeant britton george said lets see if we can get you in there but she was uncertain this was no time for a confrontation with saltash and was it really a young girl up there or do something lucy devenish had told him how many times had lucy said that lol drove due north up the welsh border under an unsure sky in which clouds would gather and then fall away like discarded underwear spring was an unbalanced time made him nervous he didnt really know what to do apart from act as some kind of messenger boy all he was doing as he drove was thinking about andy mumford without whom none of this not least that perfidious eyeinjury would ever have happened thinking about mumford not something that enough people seemed to have done over the years what had this glum anonymous man stirred up miserable andy was what gomer parry called him because he rarely smiled never seemed to be particularly enjoying his work gomer must be twenty years older and still riding his jcb like he was part of some heavymetal rodeo but gomer was selfemployed and could retire if and when he wanted to while mumford had been forced into it and like dylan thomas had advised he wasnt going gentle retirement maybe this was the most savage rite of passage which made lol think about himself and the received wisdom that said that if you hadnt made it in the music business by the time you reached thirty it wasnt going to happen ever so it probably wasnt going to happen was that worse than being like belladonna an international cultfigure at twenty and now some eerie sunset boulevard ghost as he was approaching the lights in the centre of leominster lols phone broke ironically into the first bars of sunny days the nearest hed ever come to an actual hit he pulled off the road into the forecourt of the petrol station on the corner eased up against some secondhand cars all of them at least ten years younger than the astra jane said youd better pull over lol what i have to tell you could cause an accident one moment he switched off the engine ok right jane said first off first off she told him hed be well advised to start looking for mum in the general area of ludlow castle where a girl was threatening suicide yes another one and it was no use asking who or why because this was all sophie had known therefore it was all jane knew christ lol said ok the second thing you sure youre off the road get on with it jane id like to claim total credit for this but it was sophie i didnt think even mum meant that much to sophie well not in comparison with the cathedral just shows doesnt it so like sophie talked to the dean the dean at the cathedral the steelyeyed numbercruncher in charge of the cathedral its pretty clear sophies got some serious dirt on the dean that shes been like saving up and now its really come good i mean circumstantial evidence more than anything else but the dean is the missing component that connects everybody i dont understand lol said what are we talking about this is about mumford belladonna the line seemed to fracture and we checked it on the net and its a bit of a gobsmacker start again jane lol said cant be done steve britton said sorry cant allow it tense as hell in there george that girl goes out the hole therell be an inquest on all of us the hole george said well window jagged hole in the wall shes up on this deep window ledge and they cant reach her she made us take away the scaffolding leaned back half out the window said if we didnt take it away shed you know dont look that big a drop from below but when youre up there steve britton was probably in his forties nearly as tall as george with a scrubbed face and invisible eyebrows he nodded at merrily across the castle gate friend of andy mumfords right you seen him lately mr britton he laughed im glad to say no poor old boy whos in with the girl inspector gee and dr saltash i think you know him too my superior suggested he go in seeing he was around also the woman minister canon callaghanclarke thats it seems they been studying the situation steve britton said its not an easy one its not normal this is it do you think you could tell them im here and i might just be able to help steve britton coughed like i say a bit difficult in there just at the moment mrs watkins perhaps if you could come back later i see seemed clear hed been told that if she turned up she definitely wasnt to be allowed in she could imagine saltash briefing steve britton in confidence not for me to try to influence you sergeant but a woman with a stress problem in a situation this volatile would that be wise inspector gees also very much the right person for this steve britton said youll remember sandy gee george dc here four five years ago went back into uniform to take charge of family liaison in shrewsbury plump person three kids now needs somebody a bit mumsy i reckon seems very young this girl so it is a girl merrily said i mean youve seen her yourself whod you think it was steve britton eyed her curious do you know her name yet steve britton pursed his lips george lackland snorted gods sake stephen how long you known me boy he turned to merrily people help each other in a small town its how things get done how good connections get made the mayor turned back to steve britton and gave him a long considering stare as if their future relationship and all it might promise was on the line here samantha cornwell steve said and it wasnt me told you goes without saying stephen local ledbury like the other one merrily blinked that means she knew jemmie pegler steve britton looked uneasy hed already said too much thank you boy george said it wont be forgotten merrily followed the mayor back onto the square everything reshaping shed assembled a scenario in which bell betrayed had fled to marions tower all ghosts together but it was wrong now the scene in her head was a corner table at the café in a mews across the car park from hereford police hq on the table a computer printout email format if i emptied every packet and every bottle in there and swallowed the lot well just be sick as a dog most likely how sad is that sam im not going out sad im not when i go theyll fucking know ive gone samantha cornwell sam over by the tourist office she saw the eightyearold boy who was waiting for the big bump he was staying very close now to a woman pushing a pram presumably his mother and he was no longer laughing often the way with children the bravado melting in the suddenly frightening heat of reality the policewoman kelly had known her psychology just about the last thing this kid wanted to hear was a big bump that would resound in his room at bedtime merrily too but what the hell could she do the sun bulged like a damaged eye behind purplish cloud the couple known to george lackland had shifted their cardboard placard closer to the castle wall only the power of god can stop this now tell that to nigel saltash duss duss duss mumford just the once after denying everything with his usual contempt and arrogance and bravado jason mebus tried to leg it choosing his moment perfectly when mumford and it could happen to anybody there was nothing you could do let go this unstoppable sneeze bringing his knee up into mumfords crotch not quite getting it right but enough to break free would have been well away too up the river bank through the grounds of the derelict restaurant under the pines if he hadnt stopped for the parting gesture like he always did on the cctv pictures vicious sneer and a rigid finger up at the camera with what he thought was a safe distance between them he turned round and did it at mumford who was on his knees in the dirt mumford did nothing made a point in fact of showing no pain and looking unimpressed like hed merely bent to pick up a coin which was when jason started screaming that if hed had his way theyd have finished hanging robbie walsh finished off the job by the time the collins kid had started crying and run out of the shed and gone to fetch his dipshit dad as it was theyd cut the little gayboy down and they were out of there which was a shame all the trouble theyd gone to to fix it up like a suicide even ripping the hanging page out of the history book so it could be left by the body and then putting the book back in walshs school bag jason telling him all this just in case mumford thought he was dealing with an amateur how it wouldve gone down as suicide no problem cause everybody knew walshie was having a bad time on the plascarreg but enough people would know what had really happened to make it crystal clear that there were certain individuals on this estate that you did not fuck with now thats a lie ennit jason mumford said back on his feet strolling nonchalantly towards the vermin no way see that youd leave a body in a shed next to a crack factory nah that was gonner be over anyway jason said couldnt trust that unit no more he mightve told somebody might evenve told you dad jason backing off the whole time along the edge of the water knowing he was safe with his long legs from this overweight old bastard telling mumford that if his fat face was ever seen on the plascarreg again it was gonner get sliced off bringing his hand down like a guillotine sliced off like a side of bacon dad and it was as he was saying these actual words making the gesture that he backed into an empty petrol can with one of his heels and turned round too quickly and lost his footing and nearly went in the river thank you boy mumford brain inflamed with the images of robbies suffering that jason had so lovingly invoked and moving pretty near as fast as when he was a promising athlete in his teens and early twenties went to rescue the boy at the same time taking him down with a sharp little knucklepunch to the throat jason retching pitifully but all mumford could hear was him saying with his casual hardboy confidence we was only his very best mates dad we had some awesome laughs with robbie the last laugh being at the top of the keep at ludlow castle all added up they wouldnt have known about the significance to robbie of the hanging tower the keep with steps all the way to the top was so much easier what was also useful was that instead of landing on the public footpath outside for all to see the body would drop privately into what they called the outer bailey all locked up for the night jason or more likely two of them jason and chainboy say wouldve hidden out somewhere in the castle with robbie till the place was closed and then taken him up there thrown him off quietly vacated the premises with all the time in the world no they werent amateurs these boys so why hadnt robbie told anybody about the hanging or had he could be robbie had told mathiesson mumford could hear the toerag laughing gotter be a man stand up to em telling himself that robbie had exaggerated the story not telling angela anything mumford drew back his foot as jason tried to get up pity it was only a trainer still jason was cowering away his eyes alive with fear or mabbe it was the look on mumfords face that did that mumford listening to his poor drowned mother and robbie he wants to show you all his favourite places in the town dont you robbie hes nodding see hes always saying whens uncle andy coming uncle andy who could easily have gone that very morning to the house opposite tescos and had a long and meaningful chat with robbie probably ending with a full statement and robbie not having time to go to the castle that afternoon and therefore still being alive had this not been the same uncle andy who just couldnt face the thought of his old man formally welcoming him to the wonderful world of retirement another time another place andy was going to weep and he wasnt stupid knew that what he was doing now was no substitute was unlikely to make him feel any better but at least uncle andy was finally here for robbie walsh and all the other robbie walshes who would be hanged cut beaten by this scum who had every reason to think the useless bureaucratic cpsconstricted police service was never gonner touch him mumford looked down at him this river jason the wye when i was a boy much younger than you folks used to say the river wye demanded a sacrifice every year used to say the mothers was always scared to let their kids go anywhere near the water till somebody somewhere had been pulled out dead you yeard that one jason said nothing there was drool all over his mouth and his eyes were wet his famous jacket with all the zips had split under an arm some very old man was considered best mumford said or a drunk or a tramp jason snuffled and rolled away from the waters edge or anybody that wouldnt be missed mumford said thinking how primitive and tribal this had been for the s but we was told we better be good kiddies else we might be the ones wouldnt be missed a few minutes later as he began a more formal interrogation of the suspect the possibility that this would not end with jasons death and disposal in the river wye had dwindled to a minuscule point of light at the end of a very long tunnel already fogged with a suffocating rage against a world that had no further use for the imperturbable detective sergeant mumford like heat she looked so lonely when he found her this small figure hunched up in the fleece with the torn pocket shed been trying to get it over to a policewoman on the castle gate that the girl in the castle was linked with the last one jemima pegler and the policewoman had looked at her like she was just another voyeur determined to get in on the action thank you the policewoman said coldly they know that was it a blank snub you are irrelevant to this youre as useless as the people with the powerofgod placard you are wasting my valuable time go nobody else wanted to talk to her she said shed been looking for belladonna but there was no sign of her either this was merrily watkins any responsibility going spare shed accept it lol virtually dragged her into the assembly rooms there was a café upstairs with big windows from which you could see the edge of the square and they sat close together like sad young lovers watching the light beginning to fade although it was still two hours to sunset you shouldnt have come all this way you shouldnt have forgotten your mobile lol said who poisoned the local cops against you saltash he was watching her eat guessing this was the first time today she was forking up salad in a desultory way as though if he turned away she might empty her plate into a pot plant and where is saltash in the castle dispensing psychological wisdom shed explained about jemimas emails to the girl called sam and told him a lot about belladonna as if she had to justify her continued presence here even to him when merrily was starting to seem less fraught lol ordered some more tea and told her about jonathan scole and the killing of the ghostours mans parents she pushed her plate to one side staring at him bombshell he said theyd died in their car i was thinking road accident dont know where the car comes in unless they were shot getting into it after leaving the café the police think jon scole killed his own parents couldnt have done it himself he had an alibi lol said but the proceeds of the robbery were so meagre the shooting so professional that the cops were thinking cutprice contract killing he just seems to have been the only one likely to profit from having them dead what about she scrabbled around i dunno protection maybe they refused to pay protection money or a rival caféowner with a grudge sure or they were dealing drugs under the counter but youd expect the police up there to have checked all those angles wouldnt you do you like this scole hes merrily was looking around for ashtrays he guessed to see if it was ok to smoke in here apparently not hes driven a lot of energy enthusiasm yes hes likeable someone who could have both his parents killed a monster no lol said perhaps scole had been forced to leave the area to escape the damaging gossip understandable in that case that hed changed his name understandable too that hed simply say that his parents had died rather than have to go into it all with strangers over and over again i just thought you should know lol said aware that for merrily more knowledge was more responsibility but the main responsibility tonight was his he finished his tea what was the name of that other guy what other guy the guy who came to you with saltash and the woman lol stood up maybe i can get us into the castle merrily was disturbed yes it felt so much better with lol here it always did but there was something he wasnt telling her he had this almost startled air like someone reanimated after a long time in hibernation this sense of purpose coming off him like heat a guy who normally felt safer in the shadows and who wasnt as far as she knew familiar with this town she stood with her back to the castle wall out of sight while lol talked softly to the policewoman kelly a big sign said castle closed almost all the shops were shut by now and the crowds had thinned and the busker had gone and cautious lowkey lol was chatting up a policewoman in a futile bid to get inside the castle it was not like him i dont get this with you guys kelly said to lol i dont see it trust me lol said i dont trust anybody outside my own family and i wouldnt trust them with any money kelly said stay there a man was walking quickly up to the top of mill street something swinging by his side that reminded merrily at first of bells mandolin case and then she saw it was a tv camera had to happen at some stage lol came back to stand with merrily the days spring heat was spent and he held one of her cold hands between both of his as george lackland strode up from the direction of woolworths george without his overall dark grey suit tie watchchain a newspaper under his arm mr mayor she saw the reporter with a short boommike attached to the camera homing in on him amanda patel of bbc midlands today that woman knows me she pulled lol behind the big cannon as the cameraman positioned george with his back to the castle gate rolling the cameraman said to amanda and then george was telling her he didnt know who the girl in there was and it was beyond devastating that this should happen again were all praying they can talk her down there are people in the church now praying mr lackland amanda said a small audience mainly kids forming behind her you were reported this morning to be calling for an exorcism here and now this happens do you see a connection not in so many words george said you know me amanda weve had many a drink together in the feathers and you know i only act on what i believe the majority of people here would want me to im sorry george amanda said could we start again without the personal stuff this is likely to go network she turned to the cameraman can you wipe that neil george had clearly done this before many times knew how to kill a question he didnt want to answer amanda was repositioning them for a second take when merrily heard the voice of the policewoman kelly from the other side of the castle gate wheres he gone mr longbeach lol hugged merrily quickly and went to the gate all right you can go in mr longbeach kelly said across the green over the bridge through the gate at the big tower sergeant britton will be there dont talk to anyone but sergeant britton you understand thank you lol said the sun was hanging like a tarnished penny over distant midwales hills as they opened the castle gate for lol a diminutive figure in his gomer parry plant hire sweatshirt merrily stared what was he doing his interview over george spotted merrily and came across they were almost alone on the square now except for police press people and the couple with the power of god placard who had been away and come back the cameraman was trying to shoot the placard instructing them not to look into the camera come and have a coffee mrs watkins george said just had some tea thanks im fine youre wasting your time theyre not gonner let you in no she knew how pathetic she must be looking george you want to come back to the house talk to nancy george what happened between you and bell she was watching his face and saw it flinch saw his whole frame rock the way a telegraph pole sometimes seemed to when hit by a sudden gust but george recovered quickly mrs watkins i think i told you and bernard that i have as little as possible to do with the woman yes but why because shes not my type of person all right the petition then she leaned against the great cannon why did you feel the need to manufacture that petition what do you care about exorcizing marion de la bruyère reflecting public demand bollocks george there virtually isnt any not the most seemly language from a lady of the cloth why dont you let those poor people take their placard home theyd much rather be watching casualty not very well disposed towards you are they the mayor said those folks in the castle youre changing the subject woman with white hair and a dog collar doesnt seem to like you at all nice try george she looked across at the tv team on the corner of mill street could be a long night for amanda i wonder if shed like another interview expressing serious doubts that anyones interested in disposing of marion as such only that someone might be hoping someone else might be damaged in the in the slipstream of an exorcism or is cleansing a better word a general cleansing the removal of something dirty which wouldnt necessarily be my word but might be yours mr mayor george adjusted his watchchain leave this alone mrs watkins youre on your own here even bernards keeping his head down besides youre not even wearing your clerical uniform he looked across at amanda she wouldnt amanda knows me im like you done this before learned how to use the media to put the cat among the pigeons and sometimes to take the cat away before it does any damage not that i normally go in for that i just dont seem to have much to lose tonight i cant talk about it george backed away not to a woman oh you can merrily said softly im very nonjudgemental and awfully discreet please and its not as if you were the first just the first citizen the inner bailey was more impressive and better preserved than you would have expected from outside a serious bit of building walls and towers archways and openings defensive holes expanded into stone window frames entrances exposing stone stairways spiralling into the dark and it was quite dark in here the retreating sun already cloaked in aspiring rain clouds had slipped away behind the outer walls and lol was feeling the chill of second thoughts just that they werent expecting you sergeant britton told him no sorry about the casual lol tugged at his gomer parry sweatshirt i just had the message from the bishops office and i thought better not waste any time not to worry they said you were slightly unconventional sir in the centre of the inner space was a squat round tower with a norman arch and a mullioned window but no roof a group of people had assembled outside it mainly uniformed police and paramedics lol kept his distance hows the girl sitting tight nearly four hours now dr saltash is convinced she has absolutely no intention of doing it just wants an audience steve britton sniffed wouldnt bet on it meself shell be quite rational one minute accepting a pack of sandwiches can of coke and then shes back up into the window space all hunched up and you know that all shes gotter do is lean gently back and its all over salt nigels talking to her himself sandy gee our family liaison officer shes doing most of the talking sometimes the canon when the girl starts on about being possessed dr saltash is watching and making observations offering advice he says hell come out and talk to you in a few minutes if you just hang on here theres really not that much space in there and they dont want her to feel crowded or threatened when you say possessed things were a bit rushed the bishops office didnt have time to explain much on the phone they watch too much tv sir too many dvds and what was in the morning papers didnt help obviously all i know is she apparently turned up this morning hung around for a couple of hours found nothing was happening and got herself in a state then she sees the scaffolding in the tower and up she goes first shes come to kill herself then shes waiting for the exorcism confused have they done anything any kind of mumbojumbo sorry sir forgetting who im talking to long day no dr saltash advises against it and i think hes probably right in my experience you need to calm people like this down not overexcite them sarge the policewoman kelly appeared by the gatehouse holding up a mobile phone di bliss hereford theyve found the parents they were shopping in worcester ok steve britton said better have a word excuse me mr longbeach and so lol was on his own when saltash came out of the castle never seen him before but there could be no mistake something in the walk something in the cursory inspection of the police and paramedics gathered by the sawnoff round tower sometimes lol wondered if there really was some trait some aspect of demeanour that united psychiatrists or if it was simply something that he projected on men once he knew that this was what they did and they were men nearly all of them maybe most women didnt have the arrogance for it maybe they wouldnt be able to sleep so easily saltash wore a creamcoloured cotton suit his tie was loosened his face was narrow and evenly tanned lined rather than wrinkled and his grey beard was barbered to the length of his grey hair he stood on the short tufted grass where shadows converged looking around for a man whom merrily had said was plump and friendly and conspicuously camp he didnt move expecting the man to approach him lol wandered over dr saltash saltash stared through him im looking for martin longbeach is he here i think youre looking for me i dont think so saltash said because you dont appear to be martin longbeach and you dont appear to be lord shipston lol said aware of so many years tumbling into this moment but i think you know him nobody but god the palmers window told its tale in reds and blues and gold merrily made out a ship bound for the holy land a stylized ship like a floating horn with people far too big to fit into it she saw king edward the confessor and st john the evangelist whose chapel was dominated by this window the mystical ring passing between st john and the king via the palmers all dressed in blue mostly myth and wishful thinking the saxon king edward had predated the first of the ludlow palmers by about two centuries the chapel of st john the original palmers chapel was to the left of the high altar in st laurences a dark threeaisle palace of a church not far short of a cathedral george lackland stood at the entrance to the chapel his back to a narrow door set in stone looking down merrily saw she was standing on an inscribed tombstone guild wardens buried under here george said he and merrily were alone in the church george having obtained the keys from the verger on his way out who could anyone trust with the keys more than george former churchwarden and a merchant of quality who in the middle ages would surely have been a prominent palmer himself not that the lacklands had been in ludlow in the middle ages they hadnt left east anglia until the eighteenth century but george with his tiered face and his slowburn eyes looked like part of the story part of the myth it would have been enough for bell one weekend a saturday we were all here in the church his voice was dry and ashy nancy and susannah and stephen and me and her merrily recalled georges description of bell on that day or a similar one dressed decently and conservatively her edwardian summer dress her blonde hair neatly styled quite girlish rather attractive a day in the rosy dawn of bells love affair with ludlow tripping and gliding around the buttercross her smiling face upturned to the sun like a buttercup george said now his voice laden with a damp sorrow and then she wanted to go to the top of the tower he turned to the narrow door behind him this is the way behind here see famous viewpoint merrily said id guess spectacular see for miles but its a long old haul couple of hundred steps and it seems like more bell said would someone like to go up with her nancy said no thanks once was enough and her legs ached for days afterwards susannah wasnt particularly interested either so i said because i suppose i didnt want her to think i was an old man i said aye ill go ill go up with you george turned his back on the door he said the steps were very narrow and twisty so it was necessary to go up in single file there was a rope that you could hold on to to help pull yourself up bell went first you can catch me if i fall george she said she didnt fall she was very light on her feet oh yes merrily recalled the stage act split black skirts bare feet i tried to leave a bit of space between us see but when youre on a tight spiral the person in fronts apt to disappear around a bend you know what i mean mmm vicars knew about church spirals so three or four times bell would come to a sudden stop on a bend and id go bumping up against her which was embarrassing for me but shed just laugh that laugh that she has far back in her throat george wouldnt look at merrily while he was talking his gaze was raised to the palmers window as if he was wishing he could sail away to the holy land or anywhere merrily felt that the closer georges story took them to the top of the tower the more it was plummeting to the bottom of his own deepest well hed refused to tell her about this in the street insisted on coming into the church knowing it was about to close for the night as if it was part of his penance to unload it all before god and a woman young enough to be his daughter who also happened to be an ordained priest george in purgatory anyway he said when we finally emerged at the top bell starts dancing around with her arms thrown out well theres not much room up there big sort of pyramid coming out the middle with the weathercock sticking out the top such a proud cock bell had said and giggled outrageously the sleeves of her dress rippling up her arms georges halfshadowed face was blushing a deeper red than king edwards footstool in the palmers window as he described how hed turned away from the woman and gone to look out at the view to the west doing a bit of a commentary over there in the west behind those hills thats towards knighton see which is in radnorshire and thats wales not many folks know that ludlow although its in england used to be the main administrative centre for wales the military capital when hed stopped talking there had been no sound from behind him no rustling of her papery frock when he turned she was nowhere in sight ludlow was spread out far below them like a model village and his heart had lurched and hed shouted in alarm bell and heard her laughing again a dry brittle chattering sound looking down in horror to see her coiled on the stones at his feet those arms and hands weaving in and out of his legs like white serpents serpents george spat there was an invitinglooking gift shop at the foot of the vast nave with cards and all the books and pamphlets about ludlow and its church merrily went to stand there while george stood in the nearest aisle with his feet together and his head hanging down like a victim of selfcrucifixion of course it went without saying that hed never behaved like that in his life before not even when he was a young man before hed been married to nancy well no george was the epitome of old ludlow an honourable man conservative in every conceivable sense of the word and on the church a bony hand tightening on a pew end of all places on the tower itself where where nobody could see them but god as if they were putting on a show for him on the monday george said i formally handed in my resignation as senior churchwarden said i was not able to perform the duties as assiduously as was necessary due to my impending mayoral year and this im afraid is the first time ive been in here since apart from services and even then i feel dirty soiled every sunday soiled a disgrace im the first person youve told other than in my prayers merrily didnt know what to say it wasnt exactly a huge surprise there had to have been something she wondered if susannah had actually known from bell or if shed just suspected george she said bell well shes a bit of an expert at this sort of thing knows how to there can be no excuse georges knuckles shone like marbles if i hadnt already been mayorelect id have turned that down as well but surely you realize it was but how could he how much could he possibly have known or even surmised about bells behaviour not for her to explain to him the probable truth about why belladonna had seduced him here that the tower was the spindle in the centre of the wheel of ludlow and he was its human equivalent bell gathering in all her magic her charisma and spraying it out in what jon scole had called blue sparks spraying her sparks all over poor george lackland first citizen sympathetic magic huw owen had said all magics sympathetic magic george merrily moved away from the table of books erm it was just the once wasnt it george sprang away from the pew good god mrs watkins what do you take me for a bloke george she smiled youre just a bloke and for all his localgovernment guile a very naive bloke even for his generation he hadnt seen it coming the innocent edwardian dress the childlike glee at being in his town and then his sudden exposure on the top of his world to this scented siren from another planet and what else was there besides the guilt and the shame at betraying his wife his church his status and his town had he also fallen hopelessly disgracefully unforgivably just a little in love with mrs pepper or maybe more than a little oh god yes i dont go looking for her mrs watkins you cant bear to be near her can you george she said gently george walked out of the aisle his back to the high altar a whisper cant bear to see her it seemed to spiral like smoke to the timbered ceiling the prostitutes in this town they knows their place and you will agree that place is not for instance st leonards graveyard could be that nothing of that nature had ever occurred in st leonards graveyard george perhaps had been expanding bells myth for his own reasons and always living in fear of it coming out you want her to leave i need her to leave he said she was still possessing him like a dark spirit and his town as well did he know that george and bell fighting for possession of the essence of ludlow lets go he said yes we better had maybe lol would be waiting he stepped back for her to go past she wanted to do something vaguely priestly if it was only patting him on the shoulder but that would make him freeze up so she just walked out as he stepped down after locking the church an elderly man was walking up from the direction of the old college with a german shepherd on a lead the narrow street a valley of shadows around him cant hardly credit it can you george george spun round oh tom half of thems touched you ask me youngsters drugs most likely you ask me this girl in the castles on drugs thats what theyre saying about the other one yes george said i ive heard that too do you know mrs watkins from the diocese this is mr tom pritchard has the hardware shop just down from us got broke into couple of months ago tom said severely to merrily drugs again i reckon i hears a noise now i dont think twice i sends this young feller in first he patted the dog suppose ill get sued if one of em gets bit but i reckon ill risk it gotter protect yourself ennit he looked up at the mayor towns not what it was george our shops opened every morning bar sundays and christmas since the war come snow flood flu you name it that boy gets drunk of a night shops shut all day whats that tom george pocketed the bunch of church keys scole calls himself a shopkeeper makes you laugh im sorry merrily said jon scoles shops not been opened all day they got too much money these days thats the thing tom tugged on the lead come on tyson theyre always called tyson arent they merrily said as tom disappeared into the alley to the buttercross her gaze met georges we better take a look george said lab rat standing with his back to the sandstone he might have been a norman baron his beard like fine chain mail around his face a baron addressing a serf barons lol imagined would seldom actually look at serfs and then when the name of lord shipston came out saltash did look at him really looked at him for all of a second at the little round glasses the toolong hair the sweatshirt from some minor rural service industry enough for saltash to avert his eyes having dismissed him lol guessed having chosen to forget that lord shipston had ever been mentioned because the onesecond inspection had told him that this couldnt be a contest i dont think i know you at all do i saltash said the inner bailey enclosed in stone was more extensive than a prison exercise yard but with police on the gate just as secure and it reminded lol of the psychiatric hospital although that had been victorian but victorian gothic and so just as dominating as the castle with one tower at least as high as the keep im lol robinson lol said in the hospital daring to be a person had always been the most difficult part remembering you were a person not just a file a subject for assessment and monitoring a lab rat for the multinational pharmaceutical industry no saltash said smiling starting to walk away across the great courtyard throwing out sorry in his slipstream and if he reached the gatehouse where two police officers stood there would be no second chance all right lol moved in front of him if you want to take the scenic route lets talk about gascoigne saltash expelled a hiss of exasperation look my friend you probably know that theres a young girl in there threatening to take her own life i dont have time to talk to you or anyone about anything if you want to make an appointment to see me that might be arranged only one pc on the gate now but he was watching them vital to keep saltash down here if they reached the gatehouse and the police saltash would have him thrown out or maybe even detained dont go thinking youre ever going to leave here mr robinson you see that door one day when ive been long retired to the south of france youll be straining to get your zimmer frame through it but gascoigne had not retired to the south of france didnt know something throbbed in lols gut and he started talking too fast to quell it didnt know until today that hed gone to the department of health and the house of lords now a health spokesman bloody hell lord shipston saltash said is a fine psychiatrist and a former pupil of mine now i dont know how you and a good friend a very good friend which is why i dont propose to discuss him any further with a stranger excuse me saltash pushed lol but hed been halfexpecting it and moved in front again only im not a stranger if you dont not to him anyway used to see each other every day once ah i see saltash smiled his mouth smiled a patient makes you think that might have been a psychiatric nurse could have been a porter you could not have been anything other than a patient are you in what some people still like to call the care of the community now no im one of the few people lucky enough to leave dr gascoignes ward almost as sane as when i went in saltashs mouth kept smiling but his eyes frowned off balance lol remembering what hed learned about facial signals in his period assisting the hereford therapist dick lyden youre in keep going and i was like so impressed with my treatment that i wrote this song its what i do bit sad really but we cant all anyway its about this guy whos dispensing unnecessary medication like he has shares in the industry which he probably has and i didnt bother to change the name in the song not imagining that gascoigne would ever hear it or id ever record it it was just lol grinned therapy and then suddenly there it was on the cd without me really thinking of the implications but you knew about that anyway saltash didnt react a woman came out of the castle carrying a tray with mugs on it as if there was nothing going on in there except minor conservation work i mean it was bound to get back its had a few reviews and of course the reviews tend to mention the singers history and a couple referred to that song specifically because its the only explicit loonybin song on the album maybe its been followed up on the net i dont know maybe another of gascoignes expatients picked up on it maybe several things spread so much faster these days dont they who was it played you the song saltash gascoigne himself or maybe you just heard about it from young fyneham if you actually think saltashs smile went into an incredulous slant as he shook his head if you think that a man in lord shipstons position has time to even listen to some piffling pop record youre not exactly supporting your assertion of sanity mr robinson its the name on the album well get out of my way now please mr robinson ive listened to enough of this drivel anyway some friends of mine they had a long chat with the fynehams the fynehams of breinton who produce a magazine in which it appears that you have a stake along with its founder lord shipston saltash sighed youre on such thin ice my friend ill be honest lol said i dont quite know what youre doing but then im not sure you do either but i strongly suspect gascoigne as a public figure now would feel a lot happier if my recording career ended here and neither merrily nor i retained any kind of respect or credibility this is a start a complete loss of respect in the eyes of the community would be a start wouldnt it just in case it ever got out do you and im guessing because this is not the kind of smear campaign that gascoigne or even you would want to be involved in that you helped finance jacks little business venture and left the details to him sadly hes nowhere near as clever as he thinks he is and neither are you saltash said no i think ive become a fairly harsh judge of my own limitations saltash looked at him again his eyes were like stone but not this stone not sandstone colder than that mr robinson do you know how easy it would be for me to have you removed to a place of safety i mean removed now this evening we have most of the people for the preliminaries we need close at hand and i can tell them whatever i consider to be pertinent memory jolt gascoigne who must have been quite young then no more than late thirties murmuring in here i can say what i like about you never forget that laurence and everyone here listens to me and acts accordingly and no one will listen to you and gascoigne had said many things and written them too and had them duplicated passed them into the heart of the system reports assessments if gascoigne hadnt moved on first lol sometimes wondered if he might still be there on victoria ward on extra medication i could tell them for instance saltash said about your personal grudge amounting to dangerous obsession against people in my profession and i can tell them about your absurd but clinically quite explicable suspicion that i had seduced your lady friend lol stepped back im sorry what did you just say your very attractive lady friend already under immense strain after being appointed to a post for which she was quite clearly emotionally unsuitable as a result of which i and my colleague a senior cleric had been unofficially assigned to try and advise her and perhaps restrain her from the kind of erratic behaviour that you really are psychotic arent you lol said the policeman by the gatehouse looked up saltash smiled oh no mr robinson im not the one who consumed by jealousy and a sense of inadequacy attacked my girlfriend causing at least one serious facial injury for which with regard to her social position she will no doubt have attempted to concoct a plausible explanation but of course it fools nobody in her parish certainly not my good friend dr asprey do you think that policemans about to come over no need to go back into town george lackland said there was a quicker way to jonathans place he led merrily through the churchyard down a path with yew trees either side six of them through a garden with the small stones of the cremated flowers everywhere and the ancient readers house opposite an entry led down to an inn yard where horsedrawn coaches must once have been unloaded it was enclosed by black and white brick and timbered buildings given a mauve cast by the evening sky the bull hotel george strode across the courtyard and then they were on corve street close to lackland modern furnishings and tom pritchards hardware shop so much a part of the town that she hadnt noticed it before only its swinging sign like a pub sign with a painting of a shirehorse on it oldestestablished ironmongers in ludlow eighteenth century maybe earlier and a farriers before that same site george stopped whats going on mrs watkins i been straight with you told you the truth before god george i dont know most of its in bells head shes feeling persecuted betrayed by who you the women who may or may not have assaulted her in the streets last night in the streets when did i dont know if that even happened forget it and by me i spent some time with her under under false pretences then she sees that nice picture of me in the paper and now im the enemy and the person who introduced me to her therefore the real traitor is jon scole theres a hollow yew shes had a door put into with a lock where she keeps items of importance to her and it was broken into last night and something was stolen she thinks thats scole even im beginning to think its scole and oh god it was true who else would have followed them last night his own song started playing in his head tuesdays on victoria ward we always hated tuesdays reminding him how that song those opening lines had conquered his concertblock at the courtyard in hereford because of the suppressed rage behind them the spontaneous reaction of the audience making it suddenly all right someones got to pay now dr gascoignes on his way and its another heavy medication day the police constable whod been walking across to them had stopped and had begun talking into a radio or a mobile phone lol looked at saltash with the round tower behind him in the middle of the inner bailey with its norman arched doorway the tower was roofless hollow a shell its not enough is it lol said it wouldnt hold water theres no way you can touch me you arrogant bastard the sky was low and tight and redveined and he was aware of his own voice crisp and contained like in a recording studio with acoustic panels and gascoigne hes not worried about that song because even with the very remote possibility that the album got into the outer reaches of the charts the song doesnt really say anything apart from describing his fondness for handing out pills its whats not in the song that hes worried about and i really wasnt going to do anything about that not my place especially with him out of handson psychiatry which considering some of the places his hands went is no bad thing constable saltash shouted excuse me constable the policeman was still talking he looked up lifted a hand to saltash so i suppose normally id just have left it at that lol said glad that at least the poor sods whod been sectioned were no longer exposed to his attentions especially the women like helen weeks because i dont have time to deal with you now mr robinson saltash said softly i might simply tell the police youre a journalist whos talked his way in by assuming a false identity i used to wander around the hospital as much as i could lol said watching ordinary people people who worked there just to stay familiar with normal behaviour the outside world helen weeks was schizophrenic so nobody ever believed what she said she was very pretty and heard voices and sometimes what the voices were telling her to do she needed to be protected from that so yes in case he was wondering i did see gascoigne giving her a special consultation that wasnt exactly my idea of protection i climbed on a chair to look over the horrible frosted glass of his office and through the clear glass over the top you sad little man saltash said and lol finally hated him enough to start lying well nigel i dont think thats how theyll see it at the three counties news service you know them news agency in gloucester serving national papers the sun mirror news of the world the thing about the three counties its all about money to them if one paper turns it down theyll try another and then another until everybody knows or a story like this theyll maybe just send it all round not if i obtain an injunction to prevent you youre too late a friend of mine has a long email that we put together detailing the full story including a phone number for helen weeks and her sister who looks after her and two former porters we contacted who knew of other cases if this friend doesnt hear from me by ten tonight the email goes to the three counties lol looked into saltashs eyes and felt a surprising calm in his spine like a soft shiver try me nigel have me thrown out attempt to have me detained sectioned oh and youre in the email too of course in an attachment transcript of a recorded conversation with jack fyneham i think hes god forbid your godson isnt he is there a problem dr saltash the policeman said and the dean of hereford lol said to saltash hes quoted too quite extensively saltashs smile was like glass everythings fine now officer thank you always knew there was something not quite right about this boy george said lowvoiced when they were in the alley at the side of the shop someone that age just turns up in town goes round the estate agents inquiring about flats to rent cheap and then he takes a shop at the kind of rent would turn me pale how do you know that merrily asked but he was walking up the steps with the wroughtiron lamp at the top and didnt answer she thought masons or perhaps some old ludlow traders network that was even more mutually supportive and exchanged intelligence on outsiders george took the steps two at a time and she had a picture of him not going up the steps of the church tower that overheated afternoon but coming down very fast and collapsing against the wall at the bottom blinded by shame and some forbidden guiltgilded exultation that he didnt to this day dare acknowledge jonathan banging the door with a knobbly fist wed like a word boy councillor lackland and mrs watkins no answer try the door george recalling how it had sprung open when shed flipped the handle from inside and how glad shed been because jonathan had been coming on to her in the wake of his apparent rejection of bells advances shes all over me hot and you know anybody could see she were burnin up its open george went in jonathan its councillor lackland she heard him tramping around a door opening inside a muffled jonathan a silence by the time she was halfway up the stairs he was out again lets go he said hoarsely george he gripped the iron rail and then breathed in sharply and let go of the rail as though it were whitehot he drove her down the steps waving both arms as if he was herding ewes go down her first thought was that he must have walked into something of a sexual nature but then when he began to step carefully down himself keeping close to the wall away from the rail she saw the blood on the hand that had touched it there was a bulge like a knuckle in the mayors forehead and it was pulsing some things a woman shouldnt see he said marion look siân saltash said martins here they were in a high but roofless space some onetime great hall with the remains of huge fireplaces one above the other timeblurred stone heads projecting from the walls along with the weeds the sergeant steve britton was there too as siân callaghanclarkes pewtereyed gaze flicked across to lol and then back to saltash where she must have caught a warning look hello martin she said finally a woman with presence and authority lol thought but not comfortable here in her dark grey business suit over the clerical shirt and collar not at home in ruins look saltash jangled keys or something in a trouser pocket im afraid i shall have to leave you for a short while i need to make some phone calls this time siân didnt need a signal she followed him out saltashs calls would be to lord shipston the fynehams his friend the dean plans to make defences to erect only the jittery keys expressing nerves i dont think the canons happy with this steve britton said no lol saw two lightless narrow openings one of them had to be the way in to the hanging tower mr longbeach let me be frank with you steve brittons hands moved as though he was hefting invisible weights theres a very disturbed little girl in there and we dont want it to get dark on her we dont want to have to bring lights in make a circus of it so what id like to know are you the bloke who does this stuff i mean i dont know what you do and im pretty damn sure that kid in there doesnt either you know what im saying if you havent got the full bell book and candle with you just fake it fake something we dont need to fake it lol said theres someone not liking this steve a plump woman in an orange fleece with a reindeer motif had come through one of the dark doorways black country accent i thought we were getting somewhere now shes gone back into herself getting just a bit spooky again if i must use that word this is mr martin longbeach sandy britton said another er colleague of our friends out there this is inspector sandy gee from our family liaison unit sandy gee narrowed her eyes at lol ive seen you somewhere before havent i never forget a face martin itll come to me meanwhile i hope youre prepared to do something thought we were getting somewhere but im getting a teensy bit anxious i think the doctor was right about her being delusional but if we have to go along with a delusion to save her life lets do that eh lol nodded at the opening from which inspector gee had emerged shes on her own hell no female parameds in with her more than two people she feels threatened moves further into the window space were trying to keep her talking because once or twice shes nearly fallen asleep now youd think that would mean we could nip up and snatch her but shes so very close to the opening it could just as easily mean shed rock backwards and gone sandy gee shuddered she was about lols age had frizzy hair dyed a deep red and earrings like joinedup multicoloured paper clips family liaison was this the halfway point between policing and social work what id like to do he said is bring in someone to be quite honest martin for the reasons ive just outlined we really dont want the world and his wife in there one person he hesitated merrily watkins sandy and steve swapped glances sandy said dr saltash and the canon have changed their minds about her lol said theyre probably discussing it now sandy gee sucked in her small mouth thought about it all right go and find her steve she turned to lol both of them were very firmly of the opinion that any kind of ceremonial would only fortify the fantasy that sams constructed dr saltash insisted that the only sensible strategy would be to gradually make her aware of the reality of her situation and the fantasy is she seems to think that a number of i dont know spirits dead people want her to join them thats oversimplifying it its a lot to do with guilt at what she thinks shes done which dr saltash tried to tackle but in the end she feels crowded by influences she cant get rid of sandy glanced over at the entrance to the tower weve managed to find the parents now and were bringing them across although she insists she doesnt want to see them but well argue about that later you know she was jemima peglers best friend lol nodded i know about the emails do you know about the boyfriend situation lol shook his head sandy took his arm and guided him up to the main way out a police van was parked in the inner bailey now near the separate round tower jemmie pegler the only friend she had was sam but then she stole sams boyfriend harry so that was the end of that sam says jemmie was letting him have sex with her which sam wouldnt this obviously gave jemmie a feeling of power shortlived when she heard what the other boys were saying jemmie was fat you see like me and when youre a fatty at school life is hell your selfesteems rockbottom and you absolutely know youll never find a boyfriend because youre so disgusting if anybody ever got round to compiling statistics on this im pretty sure theyd find that well over half the teenage pregnancies are fat girls we dont want to be chubby and mumsy martin we want to be lithe and slinky and do parties but in the end we go for what we think we can get sam and jemmie had a falling out sam didnt like her any more at all because jemmie even before she pinched sams boyfriend had been going well off the rails for a long time i think sam was getting frightened of her at this stage big girls when they cease to be jolly and philosophical can be very dark and threatening doing drugs doesnt help nothing heavy at that stage in jemmies case es and whizz a bit of blow but she was moving up you know also hitching rides with stupid little younger boys whod nicked cars very ominous taking risks doesnt care what happens to her maybe hoping something will happen to her jemmie was coming apart no question about that didnt having a boyfriend oh well that didnt last did it thinks shes finally got something steady with sams exboyfriend hoo terrific im a real woman and then having had his evil way this lovely harry dumps her like an old sofa so jemmie is now very depressed indeed because shes lost the feller and shes also lost her very best friend the only real friend shes had so then shes desperately trying to get back with sam bombarding her with pitiful wheedling emails the way these kids do they were at different schools you see jemmie was manicdepressive that was certainly what dr saltash thought now sam the thing with her shes a very softhearted girl basically shes quite pretty but not too pretty and perhaps a bit short on confidence this is my opinion you understand from talking to her and listening to what shes got to say id guess that sam was friends with jemmie very much out of pity in the early days because sam doesnt yet have the confidence to make her own way shes drawn to the underdogs well its nice to be needed isnt it but at the end of the day shes a little girl shes not a saint and shes really not going to forgive jemmie that easily if at all for the business over the boy and i think she was very glad actually to be free of jemmie only to find herself im afraid with another underdog on her hands sandy gee folded her arms bulky in the fleece and looked at lol guess she said lol shook his head behind the clouds the sun was setting and the stones were full of detail and texture robbie walsh sandy said theres a turnup eh in the drabness and dereliction of the hanging tower the first window the one you could easily reach was barred or partly the two bars didnt reach to the top of the window so it would be possible for anyone determined enough to climb up and squeeze over them this window offered a view of the river teme and the pine woods where the weir house apparently was hidden inside the tower the window was on the ground floor but outside there was a very long drop to the path at the bottom of the rocks into which the foundations were sunk was this how jemmie pegler had gone above it it would have been one storey up if the floors and ceilings hadnt all gone leaving the tower as a hollow funnel was another window the second of four a window that would have been inaccessible but for the scaffolding they were going to make it safe sandy murmured ironic isnt it the skeleton of galvanized metal tubing ended about three feet under the window two planks along the top a brown mug on the end of one a wooden ladder extended to the top of the scaffolding a second one had evidently been pushed away and lay at an angle against the wall the girl was huddled like a squirrel in the deep recess around the second window about fifteen feet above the floor a small girl in a pink hoodie and jeans short brown hair and the glint of a ring at the end of an eyebrow the window space almost directly behind her was about four feet high and two or three feet wide and all you could see through it was the darkening sky you want another coffee sam sandy called up sam didnt reply how about a hot chocolate you must be getting cold up there no thank you sam said they thought she was fourteen or fifteen but she sounded younger she must be needing to go to the loo by now sandy whispered to lol then she called back up to the ledge sam if you want to go to the loo we can organize something no thank you lol said tentatively im martin sam didnt acknowledge him he wished steve britton would get back here with merrily sandy whispered in his ear try again eh lol said about robbie it really wasnt your fault i can explain why can i do that there was silence sandy gee looked at lol showed him fingers crossed on both hands a bird fluttered at the top of the tower you just keep telling me lies this small lost voice from the stone ledge sandy said this is not a windup sam he knows stuff i didnt know before they came in shed told lol what sam had said earlier when shed been more talkative it seemed her mother had come to spend a week in ludlow before christmas to look after sams auntie kate whod broken a leg and shed brought sam with her as sam was very miserable at the time having just found out about jemmie and harry at first sam had been really bored in ludlow didnt know anybody nothing to do the turning point was the friday night her mother had taken her on the ghostwalk this guy ran which sam expected would be totally crap but it had turned out to be kind of fun and scary too because she basically believed in ghosts and all that stuff and there was this boy there about sams age and hed said if she was interested there were some things he could show her maybe call for her the next day and she said yeah ok so the next day they went to gallows bank where people used to be hanged and then this robbie took her to the castle where she was quite impressed by him being able to get in for nothing anyway theyd spent most of the week together they came here quite a few times to the hanging tower and robbie told her about marions ghost being seen and theyd stood here and listened for the breathing noise but they hadnt heard anything they were just like mates that was how sam had seen it she didnt want another boyfriend so soon after harry but it seemed robbie was more serious about it than sam was when shed gone home robbie had kept writing and emailing and sending her stuff about ludlow and she was interested but not that interested sam sandy gee said no reply sam had halfturned so she was looking out of the window space from below lol could hear ragged singing a hymn oh god our help in ages past oh no sandy muttered its this bloody religious group we blocked off the path at both ends specifically to avoid this kind of thing they must be on some footpath coming up from the river or somewhere damn damn damn tell them to go away or ill jump sam suddenly shouted tell them she stood up and leaned out over the drop shut up shut up shut up well get a message to them sandy said all right what else could she say from less than twelve feet away from them sam was holding all the cards when the kid turned to face them she was in tears this was pitiful an obvious cry for help people rarely kill themselves as selfpunishment dick lyden the psychotherapist had once told lol they kill themselves because life isnt worth living any more thats it basically nothing subtle but what had begun as a cry for help had often ended in tragedy dick had emphasized a cry for help wasnt that easy to stagemanage and they often lost control suddenly lol was remembering something that merrily had told him the night after mumfords mother had died about a letter that robbie walsh had written to a ghost sam he said were you marion sandy gee looked at him in some alarm like he was suggesting reincarnation the hymn outside had become rock of ages did robbie call you marion lol said did he write to you emails and stuff sent to you as marion sam moved away from the window leaning over the scaffolding shes frightened who marion sam said sandy leaned in whispered this is whats been happening be careful sam looked down at lol it was getting quite dark in here now her face was white tell me about robbie and marion lol said sam sat on the ledge under the window we met up one saturday after christmas you and robbie he just wanted to come here again walk round the town and stuff and then come here i mean i liked him but i couldnt i felt did he call you marion then while you were with him went home you were feeling bit suffocated and then he kept sending me all this stuff from the net pictures that took ages to download it got cos this was when she was who was jemmie sam sniffed giving me all this grief how she was going to take an overdose how she was going to dope herself up and jump in the river rings up at night and texting and stuff i had to switch my phone off said id lost it and like every time i switched on the computer thered be like nineteen emails and a pile of attachments and stuff from robbie yeah sam started to cry again steve britton ducked under a low doorway and came in and straightened up shaking his head sandy gee waving at him to keep quiet and hes like making plans for the easter holidays sam said how i can get there on the train and what well do and shes like oh im really depressed youre the only friend ive ever had and why dont we go away together that mustve been difficult up all night some nights on the computer dear sam dear marion it just you didnt tell anybody nnn i was really tired this night and i sent robbie one back and im like please stop sending me stuff ok and no i cant come to ludlow at easter cos were going to france and like i couldve been nicer about it you know but you were overtired right sandy said read it back next day and i thought like whatve i done so i emailed him back and i said i was really really sorry and how id been really tired and i had a headache but he never replied when was this lol asked the kids face was moonpale two weeks before he died there was no connection lol said youve got to understand that he killed himself sam breathed in like a hollow shudder they said it was an accident but i knew it wasnt he kept writing to me that he could feel her me her with him he used to come here at weekends and he said he could and i was really like sam lol moved to the foot of the scaffolding held on to the bars so she could see his hands know he wasnt trying anything what happened after he died she was a long time in replying somebody thank god had managed to stop the choir through the groundfloor window halfbarred you could see the river silver and black couldnt sleep sam said i had these nightmares there was this one where i switched on the computer and there were all these emails and they all said dear marion and id be like scrolling up and scrolling up and theyd just like go on for ever dear marion dear marion dear she made a noise like a yawn that pitched up into a kind of squeak of distress let me get you some hot chocolate sandy said noooo all right its ok what happened then lol said it was clear that steve britton hadnt found merrily where was she this was becoming told my friend sam said at school her names bex i thought she was my friend i told her like in confidence you know and shes like wow this marions ghosts taken him and she went and told these other kids and then everybodys like oh you killed robbie walsh you killed robbie walsh youre like a witch or something sandy gee sighed so im getting all this grief at school and i dont want to go and im faking being ill and stuff and im getting into rows at home cos my mum and dad they think im going to be like a brain surgeon or something lol glanced at sandy weve managed to find the parents now insists she doesnt want to see them and then i saw jemmie pegler in ledbury and shes telling me how shes found all these suicide websites about how to kill yourself with a plastic bag and stuff copied one of them over she copied the suicide site to you and like i was sure shed heard about me and robbie walsh and she was just being cruel cos she was like that you know and i was like really angry and i just started sending her all this stuff robbie had sent me about marion and the hanging tower and im like why dont you like try this instead of a poxy plastic bag and take it easy sam sandy said this is very important what youre telling us so she starts phoning me at home on the main phone and i keep pretending im not there and then somebody tells me at school like do you know jemmies got a syringe and shes shooting up and i thought like shed just told them to tell me that so id feel sorry for her again and then she emails and says will you come to ludlow with me and well throw ourselves off the tower like together and become free of our bodies what did she mean i dont know it was all this stuff shed had off the net like somebody got hold of the robbie story and theyve twisted it all around and i couldnt take any more and it was late at night and i sent back yeah yeah well go tomorrow oh god sandy murmured and she bloody did she went she came here and i didnt and she threw herself sam let out a wail of despair and spun herself back at the window space sandy gee shouting sam but grabbing lols arm as he made a move towards the scaffolding he could hear sam vomiting out of the deathfall window and then she slumped back down squatting under the window with her head in her hands sandy hissed now will you do something no merrily no sign at all theyre still looking youll have to do something sandy listen no you listen to me sandy pulled him through a doorway he hadnt noticed into a chamber the size of a lavatory steps going up sealed off with masonry there was an incident earlier on when we nearly lost her when she thought jemmie pegler was hovering on the other side of the window as if shed come rising up again from where shed fallen that even spooked me i can tell you and its what shes been seeing in dreams martin night after night and now shes afraid to go to sleep and shes keeping herself awake all night look at her shes overtired overwrought well have to bring lamps in soon or shell use the darkness to twice shes started talking to somebody who isnt there what did nigel saltash say about that he talked about hallucinations and psychological projections he said there are look it doesnt matter what he drugs he could give her to sort it out yeah more or less we sometimes assume if someones a highly qualified psychiatrist theyre also experienced in counselling and if hed talked to me the patronizing way he talked to her id have jumped two hours ago im not trying to discredit what he does all im saying is if shes hallucinating jemmie pegler and her fatgirl talk leave our bodies behind jemmie was clearly a dominant parasitical presence lol said from whichever side of the fence you want to see it that doesnt necessarily go away with death youd know better than me but this morning its in the papers about the exorcism and like steve keeps saying shes seen the films shes convinced shes haunted convinced herself she deserves to be haunted exactly by jemmie and by robbie walsh and by the very thought of this place so shes caught a train and shes here and shes in the famous hanging tower saying why arent they doing it so dont you tell me to wait any longer martin because its going dark and when its dark theres even less reality isnt there and im afraid youre the only priest weve got gridiron merrily didnt know what shed expected and shed walked into the doorway of jons flat before she could change her mind and the smell the mixture of smells came out at her so dense it was like a smearing of dirty colours on her face oh god god god what she saw she had nothing to compare it with you could live in the countryside for years but contrive never to enter an abattoir dont go in george lackland whispered please dont go in no she stood in the doorway no need at all to go in stood in the doorway for how many seconds minutes georges echochamber breathing behind her and no breathing no movement at all inside only silence full of stench as if the atmosphere itself had congealed around it something so terminally extreme that it had to be environmentally contained oh god god god what made it worse was that jonathan it was jonathan wasnt it keep looking be certain be absolutely certain appeared to be naked no clothing to soak up the blood and obscure the wounds only the paper scattered like toilet tissue in a public lavatory when the drains were blocked i cant use the phone in there george said no no we mustnt touch anything she saw that the papers were newspaper and magazine cuttings and also photocopies of news cuttings and printouts from websites and there were scores of them hundreds in fact most of them about music all of them about belladonna pictures of her and words about her belladonnas highgrain monochrome face soaking up the lifeblood of jonathan scole who had been jonathan swift and was now she must have sobbed it was what happened to your breath in moments of immeasurable stress felt georges hands gripping her shoulders she said not in my worst the papers had been torn and slashed like jonathan who was curled on his side foetal except for the angle of his head where his throat had been pierced his face flung back and opened up like a blood orange a face of multiple expressions now like double exposures like a portrait by francis bacon tornup news cuttings had been scattered over his lower body glued to it by the blood where jonathan had been cut and stabbed and slashed and cut and stabbed and slashed over and over and with the full acceptance that if she was any kind of a real priest she should be saying a prayer for the eternal peace of the savagely senselessly slain merrily stood back and kicked the door shut with a wheeze like an explosion of breath it sprang back and there was jonathan again the wafting of air lifting a piece of newsprint from one of his eyes as if hed blinked at the repeated intrusion and merrily slammed a foot flat against the door and pushed it hard away from her keeping the foot clamped there on the stained panelling as if she was holding back a tide of blood until the door clicked and then she stood at the top of the steps with george a few steps below her and just took in air whoever did this george looking up at her the knucklebump in his forehead gleaming like a big pearl must look like like a bloody butcher how can she be walking the streets in a long coat she followed him down the steps at the bottom they just stood there and george said are you all right well no she said not exactly come to my house merrily sagged her lighter fell from the torn pocket of her fleece and bounced on the cobbles i made a terrible mistake george she bent to pick up the lighter but denied herself a cigarette the worst mistake ive ever made and by god ive made some mrs watkins i have a qualified not to say eminent psychiatrist im supposed to work with and because i didnt like him much i kept him completely in the dark about most of this mrs watkins we all kept people out of this i wanted bernard to see to it as a friend and bernard passed it on to you it was all in confidence i wanted to keep the lid on thats the top and bottom of it and i resisted putting a hand to the top of her chest to try and stop herself panting every inclination to think this woman was clinically insane even as shed stood clamping the door shut with her foot shed been resisting it thinking could this have been someone else some enemy from back home in the north someone whod been trying to find him if his parents murder had been contracted oh sure and plastered him with belladonna cuttings there was no storybook twist here it was as messy and unfathomable as any openandshut killing the level of rage that could have driven a woman to this was beyond all comprehension but wasnt that always the case dear god well go to my house george said as though he was helping a child to cross the road phone the police from there come on they came out of the alley into corve street into george lacklands town plenty of people still around in the powdery dusk tescos still open a tourist coach waiting at the lights over the gravelly sound of the coach engine came the church clock chiming eight instinctively merrily glanced up to the tower and glimpsed movement at the top a figure in palmers guild blue moving across from one corner pinnacle to another or the distinctive blue of a stockmans coat they had reached the first narrow window of lackland modern furnishings george she said casual as she could manage do you think you could report it i was going to i mean without mentioning me not yet please i need some time he stared down at her youre feeling ill no im whats the matter do you think i could borrow the keys to the church i have to work something out as if she meant she needed to pray she hoped he would understand that and anyway hed know the truth of it soon enough everybody would lol leaned against the wall outside and knew why merrily smoked he felt faintly sick he wanted to be on the other side of these walls looking for her she would not just have walked off she would wait she was good at waiting he needed her and the girl needed her needed someone who could legitimately intercede the movements of police and paramedics around the inner bailey were becoming shadowed the keep now the gatehouse was a charcoal monolith i hope you know what youve done mr robinson he didnt know how long the woman had been standing by his side wheres saltash hes gone she didnt look at him i dont think hell be coming back tonight he suggested i might be wise to leave also let mrs watkins the name was expelled like prune stones take over youve seen her no i thought she might already be here or perhaps shes with the television people doing what she does so well lol looked at her austere profile the clouds that had suffocated the sun were relaxing into evening admitting a wafery moon her hair was curling up from the collar of her jacket what is it with you ms couldnt remember her damn name siân will do whats up with me as i think you already know is that my and merrilys attitudes to the practice of christianity in a secular age are incompatible never made much of a secret of that putting it simplistically i think theres no room for superstition in what we do while she appears to nurture it in which case sorry to be so naive why would you want to be connected with deliverance whats your agenda siân looked across the enclosure dark as a stagnant pond now towards the keep with its drooping flag she sighed it begins to look she said as if the agenda was mrs watkins herself doesnt it the ubiquitous selfeffacing photogenic merrily watkins had her picture in the paper too often well lol shrugged that was always going to happen she hates it but if you do what she does and and you look like she looks then youre going to get your picture in the papers who wasnt here when we the women of hereford were battling for the priesthood wasnt out there with her placard wasnt part of the movement and was then presented with this outdated but inherently sexy role by a rogue bishop subsequently discredited managing to emerge after his inevitable departure smelling of lavender and honeysuckle and continuing for heavens sake to get away with it not always and not undamaged and all of it built on superstition siân finally turned towards lol do you know what really got to me how when she restored evensong in ledwardine church evensong with a fashionably esoteric tweak it became an immediate talking point because some local woman had apparently been cured of a lifethreatening condition which she probably hadnt had in the first place misdiagnosis or the medical records got mixed up doesnt matter it was still all over the internet apparently that the mystical vicar of ledwardine had healing powers and the following week it was reported not in the church times thank god one of the other rags that her congregation had doubled trebled i think but she squashed the rumours and it slumped again so everyones happy except i expect you were really pissed off that she hadnt run with it gone the way of all the other messianic cranks always one step ahead siân said you make it sound political she doesnt think like that she offended you just by being there yes siân said i suppose she did so when you were approached by the dean whose good friend saltash had decided he should make his skills available to the church no the approach came from nigel himself what did he tell you just now he didnt have to tell me anything hed walked out on a disturbed child that was enough whatever merrily may think of me im still a christian of sorts she looked down at her hands crossed on her abdomen so ive come back and i dont quite know what to do about this mr robinson youre asking me a recovering psychiatric patient an abuser of women siân was silent they cant find merrily lol said and they think my names longbeach and im qualified to dispel spirits theyre now telling the girl that ill do it do what exactly i was thinking about an exorcism of place seems appropriate doesnt target anything in particular lightens things takes away the tension and produces a feeling of calm psychology rather than superstition also its the only one ive ever watched siân looked into the pool of darkness in front of them is that what merrily would do lol shrugged i couldnt siân said lol didnt say anything im not sure id know where to start if you were planning to reform it you must have done some research with the deliverance handbook it appalled me its fundamentally medieval this is a medieval town were in a medieval castle i dont carry a copy anyway as i understand it lol said its only a set of guidelines that book one can hardly make it up you dont have to make it all up yes i do realize that elements such as the lords prayer are mainstays of all deliverance ritual ritual lol said i quite like you when you talk dirty siân said i want to say that i wouldnt insult either of you with an apology but sometimes ones own gullibility results in the most indefensible behaviour you can get holy water from the church or somewhere lol said i was with merrily at a hopkiln in the frome valley where something unpleasant had happened a lot of the routine stayed with me good memory for verse and things something you develop in my line of work otherwise youre liable to dry up in the middle of a gig of course siân said whats your first name i did know lol laurence like the poor guy they named the church after someone once told me what happened to him but its slipped my mind he was roasted on a gridiron over a slow fire yes now i remember lol said tinted by the last of an invisible sun clouds hung like a sandbank over the round tower that sat in the inner bailey like a great turreted cake for gods sake siân said lets not either of us be bloody stupid just have one last attempt to find merrily leaving the churchs main door unlocked merrily entered through the huge stone porch and found the lights the acoustics of the great church giving out a sigh as she went in entering a church alone at night was disturbing some secret alchemical process and increasingly shed thought that jane was probably right about this being at least partly connected with the site itself partly a pagan thing but it was all mixed up in those days she knelt in front of the altar in the chapel of st john the evangelist took off her fleece to expose the pectoral cross and prayed for the wisdom to see this through to drop the curtain before the final act in an insane tragedy prayed that a very cursory knowledge of forensic pathology acquired over two extraordinary years had not led her to the wrong conclusion about the death of jonathan scole prayed for the courage to go up the tower and face the mad woman of ludlow she had to no one else would know how to approach it if the police went up as surely before long the police would it would all be horrifyingly over before the first of them put a boot on the parapet how long had belladonna been here had she been behind that door when merrily came in with george lackland had she listened to georges account of events leading up to their fevered coupling under the weathercock merrily pulled on her fleece opened the tower door into total darkness obviously there would be lights here most likely bulkhead lights at intervals all the way to the top but if she switched them on shed be advertising herself not good only one solution she padded into the nave came back flicking her zippo to light a tealantern from the gift shop and found she was no longer alone what are you doing lol said point of transition the cluster of candles on a small tray on the floor lit up her face like some renaissance madonnas over a glowing crib she was sitting with her back to the wall directly below one of the corner stone pinnacles its conical notched prong sharp against the last amber in the west the pole bearing the weathercock sprouted from the apex of a leaded pyramid that occupied most of this small platform in the sky a duckboarded walkway around it it felt isolated scary if you didnt like heights which lol didnt but the gathering of candlelight against the glistening backcloth of new night made it weirdly intimate who the fuck are you belladonna said she was wearing a long blue stockmans coat hanging open over something lightcoloured two hundreds steps did something unprecedented to the backs of your calves lol set the lantern down on the deck and sat down behind it the two of them facing one another across the width of the tower if you wanted to be alone he said you shouldnt have gone walking around the battlements with your candles when everyone knows the church is closed im not alone you been up here long stopped counting the chimes a while ago came in with the tourists decided not to leave i asked you a question lol lol robinson lol said oh she said i see we almost met once at a festival you wouldnt remember it wasnt glastonbury or anything im not in the mood for reminiscence bell said go away the halfdozen stubby candles on the tray had probably been taken from the votive table in the church in their glow her face looked moist and quietly radiant she hadnt changed much really the lines seemed to have added movement vibrancy lol felt an electric curiosity and the need to exercise it as if the saltash episode had freed him up for this do something whatever shed done he didnt want her to be insane you shouldnt be alone he said not now im not alone i told you that but they cant talk to you i can talk to them they dont listen lol said they dont care merrily had said shell be in a bad way theres only one reason shes gone up there if the police go up to try and bring her down she wont even wait for them to reach the top can you get that over to them is she with you bell said your girlfriend no shes in the castle has she done it yet did she mean sam he didnt reply its a gesture bell said a meaningless gesture shes wasting her time whats heres too powerful he realized that she must mean the exorcism maybe she didnt know about sam he saw that each of the stone pinnacles was tipped with a tiny cross but this is the centre of it isnt it he said this is the soul of the town the point of transition im not sure what you mean by that would it would you mind if i stood up i think i can feel a bit of a cramp coming on as long as you dont come near me belladonna said sure tell them to keep right away from her merrily had said she might still have the knife this was after hed reminded her that he couldnt stand heights shed been worried about walking away from this hed told her hed stay in the church and try and explain to the police if they showed up holding one another for a few seconds and then shed walked away kept looking back there was of course no reason the police would think bell or anyone was up here now the tray of candles was in the shadow of the walls lol looked over the battlements once before turning away lights were coming on all around the church when he turned his head it was like a catherine wheel dizzying he caught a thin sharp smell from somewhere one hundred and thirtyfive feet bell said i watched the police cars converging on jonathans shop did you find him merrily and the mayor after the ironmonger told them his shop hadnt been open all day garrulous old fool she what can i say about this rage gives you unlimited strength bell said he guessed shed raised her voice to deal with the tremor but it was there what had he done to you i dont have to answer your questions no he looked over the town to where arrows of pale pink were enfolded in a cloud bank over clee hill in the east i was talking to a couple of people about you tom storey how is he still working still a bit scary bell laughed he was always scared of me she turned to look up at lol why arent you what do you want im just scared of what you might do that is what you meant by the point of transition isnt it she didnt reply he felt the hours shed been up here had been spent coming down from something some wild and terrifying trip she couldnt quite believe shed made you knew about scoles parents i suppose how they died a pause then she sighed you mean his adoptive parents or his parents he stared at her she was watching a distant plane barely audible crossing a clear patch of night sky like a firefly jonathans father was a man called eric bryers she said lol gripped one of the battlements bloody junkie tracked him down bell said vindictive little smackhead bastard but he watched the plane disappear into cloud emerge the other side there were two versions of this story moira cairns had told him the baby had died it was tom whod maintained shed given up the child for adoption on learning she had a recording contract but tom was neurotic his version had been the least likely scole was your son eric tracked him down a couple of years ago not long before he died bell pulled her coat across her knees and gazed into the mesh of candlelight the revelation rather altered jonathans view of himself or i suppose he would have said it confirmed what hed always felt his adoptive parents were working the clock round in their seedy little greasy spoon and just wanted a son whod take over the business perhaps buy another greasy spoon so they could retire to morecambe or some other windswept purgatory sent him to college to learn business studies all desperately short of glamour he hated it thought hed been born for better especially when he found out who his mother was i imagine lol said and what his mother had denied him oh yes he hated me and presumably eric filled him up with bile before he did what he did jumped from a high building you ever work with eric lol never i saw him last when he came back to play bass on my determinedly faithful version of gloomy sunday i was told he carried a copy with him everywhere like a form of temptation bell laughed far back in her throat like a secret agent with a poison capsule but of course thats the sort of person eric was jonathan wouldnt have known that not a lot to discover on the internet about eric i suppose not like you that wouldve been a serious voyage of discovery cuttings everywhere merrily had said face twisting at the images in her head papers fanzines website printouts scattered over his body like some kind of sick confetti oh yes bell said hed compiled quite a dossier on the woman whod deprived him of a life in various mansions the california coast the company of rock stars unlimited lines of coke strings of delicious girlfriends leaving him with a dreary businessstudies course and a future serving burgers to fucking truck drivers and then he followed you here hed attempted indirectly to contact me before he came here an approach was made through some agency to my solicitor from someone claiming to be my son i told her it was a tryon because my son was dead anyway i refused to meet him what was the point i gave birth to him that was all and gave him away for a career lol for the first time her face registered pain i gave him away because i didnt expect to see him grow up the one certainty in my life had always been premature death what he didnt know was that id made financial provision for him my wills always included a substantial bequest to my surviving son it wasnt money he wanted though was it he had money like you said he just wanted to be part of your life well i didnt want him certainly not after meeting him he was crass he was probably the greatest living authority on you he got to the heart of all your obsessions putting himself in a situation where your paths were bound to cross buying into the ghostwalk no no he there was a small breeze like a puff of breath bell looked up smiled faintly heres someone lol blinked listen bell said he never told me who he was and i even when i suspected i said nothing there was no future in it every time i saw him i saw eric besides i hardly wanted a murderer you really think he was hadnt seemed like a murderer to merrily not even a murderer by proxy hes driven a lot of energy a lot of enthusiasm likeable rather than just a victim of rumours he was bell came to her feet and teetered forward as though she was on stage a little stoned and about to grasp a mike stand he was a despicable murderer he destroyed the most important thing in my life lol didnt move bells voice dropped to a hiss that boy wouldnt fall off the keep he knew every stone of that castle he was as surefooted as a goat and the suicide theory that he was afraid to go back to the bullies in hereford thats shit too his mother must have told him about our arrangement his mistake was to tell jonathan bell plunged her hands into the pockets of her long coat and wafted it tightly across her turning away and making the candle flames shiver as if the tower itself was shaking lol thought of what hed learned from merrily and what hed read it made sense jonathan scole watching bell form an increasingly intimate relationship with the history boy whom he had introduced to her whom hed made a part of his ghostwalk just to get close to the mother whod rejected him rejected him twice and now now the final insult the adoption of a son lol thought about andy mumford and his plascarreg theories if this was true then mumford was sailing dangerously close to the wrong wind bell she turned towards him strands of whitegold hair across one cheek when exactly did you come to this conclusion lol asked i dont know been staring me in the face for it came to a head last night i fell i was walking in the churchyard among the yews and i fell hit my head on a root i was half stunned and suddenly bitterly angry everything was falling apart on this night of all i decided on impulse to go to his flat and confront him and and he was drunk i told him id been attacked in the street he thought the crass bastard thought i wanted to sleep with him so like his miserable father he said he was going to phone your mary so i walked out and then merrily came found me singing under the castle its the only way i stay sane on nights like this singing to marion singing wee willie winkie to anyway he must have followed us back he saw me put the the mandolin case in the yew tree and then he came back with a crowbar or something and he forced his way in and he took it she bent down and moved the tray of candles to one side not much left of some of them now flames shrinking down into half an inch of hollowing wax and lol saw that the tray had not been on the floor itself but on a small black musicalinstrument case which she lifted now and cradled in her arms the mandolin case she took it to the battlements it was almost dark now youll have to go soon bell said i cant let the candles burn away bell it makes no sense its all the sense theres ever been she said ive always had what i regarded as a temporary life all im looking for in death is a kind of permanence she was on her feet the heavy coat hanging open to reveal a long creamcoloured dress soiled now with large conspicuous stains their colours indeterminate in the candlelight standing close to the wall and hugging the mandolin case to her breast she began singing in a tremulous littlegirl voice wee willie winkie running through the town upstairs downstairs in his nightgown rapping at the windows crying through the lock are all the children in their beds its past eight oclock sandy gee was up against the wall of the fat round tower in the inner bailey she had a rubbercovered torch kept nervously testing its beam on the stonework having sent one of the uniforms off with a plastic pepsi bottle to find a tap and salt merrily said salt holy water involves salt maybe we should hold it in one of the bloody restaurants sandy gee said i wish we could hold it in there merrily nodded at the round tower plenty of room and apparently it used to be the medieval chapel of st mary magdalene not an option however it certainly isnt we need to do it now in that dirty little tower erm a warning merrily said the aim of this is to bring release and create calm but we dont know what were dealing with and if theres any kind of if you want to call it energy in there and the kids in a position where shes very close to a long drop sandy shone the torch beam into her face i hope to god youre not suggesting this might actually have the reverse effect longbeach said you knew what you were doing siân callaghanclarke cleared her throat inspector i think what my colleague is saying is that this is not an exact science or a science at all merrily said perhaps under cover of the service you or one of your officers should move closer so that in the event of any unexpected reaction you often get unexpected reactions there is no expected reaction siân said its about faith christ sandy said running through the town sam said was that you in the paper its a lousy picture isnt it merrily was standing in the beam of sandys torch all she could see of the girl was a silhouette against the opening in the wall it was cold and damp in here colder than outside a rank and clingy cold why arent you wearing you know i sam its like the police siân said inspector gee isnt in uniform either inspector gee and mrs watkins when you reach their level you dont have to wear the uniform merrily glanced at siân stonefaced on the fringe of the torch beam wow how do i sam inched back towards the window how do i know its not a scam why you doing it now its taken a lot of preparation merrily said we dont take it lightly weve had holy water and things to prepare and i have to walk all around the area sealing off points of access we dont want to let bad things seep through there was silence and then sam said im the bad thing who told you that she wont let me sleep sam said who are we talking about sam siân whispered to merrily give me a moment ok two minutes sam some final things to organize around the corner in the onetime great hall siân said i dont know if what nigel managed to elicit from her might help anything might help i dont see this as a cosmetic exercise any more in which case nigel i think also became aware that we might be dealing with something unexpected to which counselling might not provide a complete solution he admitted that i said i think he became aware of it ah go on the pegler girl was a bully its hardly unknown for someone who is herself subject to emotional bullying to find someone else on whom she can inflict stress pegler was taunted by her peers boys mostly i would guess for being overweight and unattractive she initially sought solace with samantha a slightly younger and somewhat malleable neighbour but jemima was a very angry rather vindictive person and soon began to control samantha making her do things she would not normally have considered at all appropriate behaviour like experiments with pills and shoplifting and then seeing how far she could push it jemima lured away samanthas boyfriend with sexual favours thus enhancing her own power and her superiority and then sam meets robbie and although she might not particularly fancy him he certainly represents a more innocent less pressured world its literally a holiday but is it less pressured siân said robbies fallen in love maybe for the first time at least the first time with someone whos not been dead for centuries and he wants sam to share his world even calling her marion thats pressure our feeling was that samantha was finding it disquieting to be associated with marion the ghost of a young woman who died in a situation of appalling violence shes not particularly interested in medieval history certainly not even close to robbies level of obsession and when he kept appealing to her to come back to ludlow to spend weekends with him visiting historic remains she eventually rebuffed him and then unfortunately he died and she already feeling horribly guilty was unwise enough to share her anguish and became the target for personal taunts by her peers at school and then all this came to the notice of jemima pegler did you see the pictures of her i saw some party pictures not those nigel had a school photo in which shes glowering and looks almost demonic you know that famous myra hindley photograph with powerfully hypnotic eyes i would guess thats the side of pegler to which samantha was exposed the tactic is that after stealing the boy harry she professes shame and selfhatred to wheedle her way back into samanthas life once shes there however shes worse than ever we thought that at one stage sam was on the verge of admitting that the girl had been physically assaulting her she was certainly a violent person subject to mood swings and severe depression of which her parents by the way were aware and in fact siân moved away into the darkness she had been receiving medical attention she was seeing a psychiatrist for a time nigel discovered shed been prescribed medication seroxat we understand where have i heard of that you probably read about it in the papers serotonin increasing serotonin in the brain as an antiodote to depression seroxat was given to thousands of children in the uk it then began to be linked with suicide and selfharm in some of them im with you nigels initial somewhat superficial suggestion that jemima peglers suicide was a form of escape from the mundane was bollocks basically was a premature reaction because he simply wanted to be involved when he found out more it became clear that jemimas suicide as the very circumstances with an overdose of heroin suggest was an act of terminal aggression and it does seem to have been related to this legend of the woman marion who herself committed an act of extreme violence and then killed herself exploiting samanthas vulnerability to taunts in the wake of robbies death jemima sends her distressing material from a suicide website samantha a little unbalanced by now sends jemima in return the internet material shes received from robbie relating to marion to which jemima reacts by suggesting that they leave behind their bodies or some such im probably not putting this very well youre putting it brilliantly merrily said what were looking at if we go along with it is jemmie first attempting to lure sam into what might be a suicide pact maybe bringing along enough heroin for them both and then when sam doesnt turn up we cant know what was going through her head all that matters now is whats in samanthas head which is jemmie superimposed over marion sam believes jemmie is still out there and demanding sam fulfils her side of the bargain shes taken up residence in sams subconscious she appears in dreams i think were looking at a severe case of bullying from beyond the grave how did nigel propose to deal with it in the short term siân said my guess is he had absolutely no idea now we can talk bell said now i feel safe just looking at her turned lols stomach cold she was sitting up on the wall between two raised battlements shed slipped off her shoes the way she used to do on stage and she was rubbing her bare heels against the stone through the hem of her long dress shed casually leaned the mandolin case against the wall and then he couldnt believe how lightly shed swung herself up there couldnt believe how anyone who wasnt a seasoned steeplejack could sit where she was sitting with her back to that drop all she had to do was tip herself gently back a hundred and thirtyfive feet to the street unless some jagged stonework broke her fall and her spine they let me hold him bell said in the hospital private hospital my father paid i had a room the dead one id asked for a guitar to take my mind off what was to come but i found i couldnt handle one over my huge pregnant belly so somebody brought me a mandolin i couldnt play it properly but i could fumble out simple tunes and when they brought him in i laid him there and played to him wee willie winkie when did you know there were going to be two of them he had to keep her talking now i became aware of a death having taken place inside me pulling the mandolin case up onto her knees turned out that one baby was strangled i think by the cord i didnt ask too many questions wasnt about to become a student of obstetrics i know they were nonidentical or apparently they might both have died i didnt want to see the survivor he was going to be someone elses but this one hed died inside me id absorbed his spirit you see yes of course you see youre a sensitive soul ive always known that from your songs so yes i played to him he lay dead on the bed and i played to him and told him that one day wed go to wee willie winkies town im not sure i understand that reference lol said bell leaned forward when i was a baby i had a book of nursery rhymes and each one had a fullpage coloured picture and the one i loved the most was of wee willie winkie gliding through an old old town with tall chimneys and houses of warm brick and timbered gables and lights shining in mullioned windows i would look at it for hours entranced it was where i wanted to be often id dream of floating through that town it was this town soon as i got out of the car that magical connection was made with my earliest memory i think i wept with happiness you kept the babys body lol said how was that possible when i was a little older bell said as if she hadnt heard the question and i began to realize there was something wrong with me and it was quite serious i said to my mother what happens when you die and she said you go to heaven and i said whats heaven like and she said heavens like the most beautiful place youve ever seen so there you are she lifted the mandolin case and folded her coat over her dress and began to swing backwards and forwards in the air with the case across her knees and all lol could hope for was that somebody down there would see her and and what i got to know the undertaker we had a big phoney funeral the undertaker was a fan a nico fan actually do you remember nico she was with the velvet underground gothic teutonic played the harmonium deliciously doomy thats how it happens you know you move on from nursery rhymes to grimms fairy tales and they have the same kind of pictures ancient moonlit towns with spiky churches and towers and cobbled streets only it grows darker and all the children who love the wee willy winkie picture rather than the jack and jill picture with the green fields and the big sun theyre the ones who become goths theyre the ones who grow to love death willie winkie had a candle in a lantern and his nightgown was like a shroud youre right of course willie winkie was death a ghostly presence i recorded the song once i remember this heavy bombastic thunderandlightning rock and suddenly it all stops and there are these little light footsteps and wee willie winkie running through the town bell giggled her face upturned and then she frowned some soulless philistine in the nme wrote that it was sexual a song about a sexual predator they spit on innocence the undertaker its not really illegal some health regulations might have been infringed thats all he squared it with some guy at the crem and they burned a coffin with a doll inside and the baby was embalmed and sealed in the mandolin case and i kept him in yew trees nobody could understand why id buy particular houses ugly houses in unsuitable locations but there was always an ancient yew tree with a hollow big enough for a mandolin case and id seal him there and know his spirit was being kept alive hed have been buried here though i thought wed both found a home robbie had his spirit is that what youre saying it seemed so right if i died it didnt matter any more the spirit would go on and hed keep seeing me just like he saw the others robbie walsh saw life in four dimensions the thought of robbie walsh seeing me growing up to administer the trust with the money to conserve the environment in which we both this heart condition lol said i dont know havent seen a doctor in years i dont want to know why did you take the baby with you on your walk through the town last night you dont normally do that do you bell smiled it was his birthday yesterday today the early hours caesarean they wanted to do it in the daytime i said no this is a night baby cost extra she looked down the cluster of candles was about a foot below her feet bell lol said should i move the candles she laughed at him then she was serious i dont want you to see this lol you are sensitive youll never forget it please go down go down now no itll be very quick i promise you bell the beacon of the marches did you know they called it that i possibly im going to make it a beacon again bright light and no pain when it kicks in ill smile and ill wave and flip over like a fireball and become in that one climactic moment a brilliant part of history her voice softened and fly like marion you cant theres nothing left now but this when he moved towards her she put up both hands you wouldnt make it lol cant you smell it bell the bottom of my dress is soaked in lighter fuel belladonna said an intimate eternity merrily said lord you gave your church authority to act in your name we ask you therefore to visit tonight what we visit and bless whatever we bless and grant that all power of evil may be put to flight and the angel of peace enter in defend from harm all who enter and leave this door doorway and give us protection in our coming in and our going out people had come in and people had gone out using the two narrow openings there was so little room in here sandy gee hands together as if concentrating on prayer had moved next to the scaffolding within just a few feet of sam one of the paramedics was a christian and hed joined them and so had steve britton holding up a hurricane lamp no harsh light if possible merrily had said no crisscrossing beams quiet light the kid had her eyes wide open her back to the window she was calm and looked a little shellshocked and vacant shed refused to have her parents in said shed tried to tell them about it and had been accused of making it all up to get out of school it would be necessary to talk to the parents afterwards preferably with sandy gee present because people were suspicious of religion and you could easily be accused of indoctrination and mindbending if sam needed personal attention this was usually a longterm process with repeated sessions in the faith of christ jesus we claim this place for god father son and holy spirit a minor exorcism of place was not enough merrily looked around for siân but she must have stepped out of the tower it was already crowded in here and perhaps she was still doubtful about this exorcism would never be siâns thing her gaze met sandy gees and sandys was saying hurry it up heightened pressure now sandy getting some hassle from cid before they began in here shed said the dci was on his way from shrewsbury in connection with something else did merrily just happen to know anything about something else well yes she did had they spoken to lol lol martin longbeach merrily had said at the church and the word had gone out amen merrily said and the people in the tower repeated it not much echo as if the voices had been sucked out like smoke merrily prayed for help praying for a foothold on this where should it be directed what needed to be brought to peace ideally there should be a requiem for jemmie pegler but without the cooperation of her family this was not an option anyway no time robbie robbie was not somehow quite part of this and robbie had fallen from the keep he still in some way stood for an innocence it left marion marion who had made a mistake and accepted the consequences marion who so many people robbie and bell and jemmie pegler had moulded to match their own requirements poor marion erm thank you id like everybody to leave now sandy gees eyes flashed urgently in the light of the hurricane lamp id like to work with sam sandys stare told her that shed better know what she was doing she didnt when theyd all left steve leaving behind at her request his hurricane lamp she said ok if i come up there with you sam lol stood up he could see lit up like a distant dolls house the complex chessboard façade of the feathers the main street a chain of lights the whole town like a jewellers counter hed have to deal with his own fear make a rush at her it was unlikely hed get close enough even to reach for her before she let the inflammable dress brush the candlelight but what else could he do what else bell yes do you really think marion flies if youre going to throw your girlfriends dogma at me no no its not but weve all heard endless accounts of what a ghost looks like what a ghost sounds like what a ghost does but we dont and nor does anyone know what a ghost feels and what do you think they feel i doubt they feel anything they just exist transient twodimensional in flickering shades of grey just existing in little cold pockets of nothing beautiful its not immortality existence without pain but without any prospect of happiness i sometimes think our highest aspiration is the avoidance of pain thats deeply sad lol said coming from an artist and saying that he realized that being an artist was the explanation of most of it it was not spiritual not about transcendence only a projection of a grand design developed over many years from a single lurid image in a picture book shed found a place on which to impose her vision of a multidimensional heaven an oldfashioned concept album in a beautiful gatefold sleeve not madness but it was a fine distinction something else occurred to him then something far more prosaic if it was the dead babys birthday it was also jon scoles no wonder the poor sod had got drunk bell how did jonathan die he was thinking of merrilys vague suspicion about the blood how there had not been enough of it youre a creator he said youre not a killer you couldnt kill could you because it was clear she didnt see her own death as an act of selfdestruction it was a great display a rush of ferocious light that would launch her spirit into an intimate form of eternity shed gone still with her head on one side like a halloween mannequin someone had wedged between the battlements as a joke lol said did he kill himself did he take an overdose or something did he prise open the mandolin case on his birthday and see where all your maternal love had been going she tilted suddenly and he thought she was going over unlit and he ran at the wall no throwing her hands out then slapping them back down when the case began to slip tugging it into her lap he stopped he must have gone on drinking taken his clothes off and gone to bed and then i dont know maybe he got up to make a phone call how do you know that because there was a message on my machine this morning it was full of bile so drunk he could hardly speak it was like you fucking old bitch you gave away a baby and kept lol could hear voices in the streets and alleys below guessed that bell finally had an audience without one there would be no point kept something she began to play with the clasp on the mandolin case flicking it up and down with her fingers something looks like a kentucky fried chicken he was dead when you found him right come on bell everybodys going to know after the postmortem she let the clasp snap back her sigh was irritable maybe he went on drinking and choked on his own vomit i dont know i was just so angry at him hed killed robbie and hed got away with it for what such a sordid ignominious such a little death he wouldnt even he wouldnt have wanted that i i went into his hovel of a kitchen and i found a knife in a drawer lol imagined the resulting scene like a conceptart tableau tracey emin meeting damien hirst in their own perfect purgatory bell said its how i imagined arnold de lisle dying naked cut to pieces jonathan if he was nothing else at least he looked like a warrior like eric all they ever had was their looks arnold de lisle huh lol was suddenly furious at her except that with arnold thered have been masses of blood when someones already dead nothing pumping you can cut through arteries and just get a dribble i didnt know or if i did i didnt think so that was pretty sordid too really and you know something else with your luck you could throw yourself off this roof and and land on the porch or something and just wind up a paraplegic well see bell said she straightened up with a kind of magisterial calm and flicked up the catch and opened the mandolin case releasing a very strong smell of what could only be more lighter fuel the other difference with arnold lol said in desperation was that at least he had some love first bell smiled sadly with those lovely crooked teeth a glint of moving light in her eyes as she came down with the open coffin to the candles side by side looking out of the window space towards the river and just a few lights merrily and sam prayed together for marion de la bruyère merrily murmuring snatches from the requiem eucharist weve come to remember before god our sister marion robbie walsh had probably chosen well marion might well have resembled sam physically even if in a border fortress full of tense wary men shed have grown up faster and probably harder you promised eternal life to those who believe remember your servant marion as we also remember her bring all who rest in christ into the fullness of your kingdom where sins have been forgiven and death is no more and then busking it god we pray for the release of marions spirit from the deluded and the misguided and those who would use her to further their own agendas we pray that marion may it was very cold now in the hanging tower sam crept close to merrily she was shaking her face was in shadow but the tiny ring glittered at the edge of an eyebrow fly merrily said quite prepared to become aware of long slow breathing in the tower or even what bernie dunmore had described as more like an absence of smile a smile so cold so bleak so devoid of hope only this perpetual bitter terminality unprepared for a long and hollow scream from somewhere else dead person watching coming up to sunset lols living room was like the inside of a terracotta plantpot even jane didnt like it any more who gave you this number lol said into his mobile that doesnt matter ill have to change it now dont bother lord shipston said i doubt youll be hearing from me again i just wanted to say do you really want to start all this well lol said the albums already out i dont care about the album if im ever asked i think i shall accuse you of shall we say political satire anything beyond that well see each other in court and ill win because i can afford the best youre threatening me again lol said nothing changes im just pointing out to you the problems of a long and costly libel action its nothing to do with courts gavin lol said in the end mud just sticks it went on like that for a while lol considered the options but with guys like this compromise was not one of them the situation is that im quite happy for you to remain with all the other iffy bastards in the house of lords he said eventually id just be worried if id heard youd gone back to having direct responsibility for psychiatric patients that isnt likely to happen shipston said in that case as long as neither merrily nor i have any further problems with saltash or fyneham or anybody else who may have been unknowingly dragged into it you wont hear from me again or from helen weeks is that blackmail mr robinson is that paranoia lol said and shipston cut the call lol just hoping he didnt go so far as to check out poor helen weeks and find out that shed died in one of those notorious train crashes on the outskirts of london some years ago shed been going back to hospital at the time accompanied by her sister some people never had any luck the sun was setting behind the stubbypillared market hall as lol crossed the cobbles to the vicarage sunday evening and the street was full of people but very few of them coming from the church where in the absence of ledwardines own vicar the rev dennis beckett was conducting evensong lol didnt recognize most of these people or their posh fourbyfours its all changing laurence lucy devenish murmured at his shoulder frowning down her nose which had been a little like belladonnas except not so well not so attractive not that lucy would care the new type of incomer lol reflected in the days not so long ago when property in herefordshire and shropshire and midwales was still relatively cheap youd get the pioneer type the urban romantics with rural dreams who wanted a smallholding their own veg garden a few sheep and chickens now the border had become the new cotswolds and it was the wealthy people who were moving in and they were not satisfied with a lowkey existence side by side with the farmers and the old village families they wanted to possess there were two more modest cars in the vicarage drive and he thought he recognized both of them were not here laurence frannie bliss said neither of us ghosts lol pulled out a chair next to merrilys at the refectory table everybodys a ghost mumford looked up from his tea his eyes muddy andy here didnt want to come to hq bliss explained and i didnt want to be seen with him either annie howes much too close to that prick from shrewsbury lol didnt understand and couldnt see any reason why he might need to janes out with eirion merrily poured him some tea i think theyre celebrating something so i thought it would be a good time to you know complicate my life bliss said it might be rubbish frannie bell might be absolutely right in her belief that jon scole killed robbie maybe but i just dont want it to be him i dont think he had his adoptive parents killed either the people you liked you dont want them to have been the bad guys whereas the people you dont like merrily looked at mumford who for his part had wanted it to be this jason mebus mumford didnt even look up he was wearing a suit and tie and didnt look retired he looked safe again retired people lol had decided were the new delinquents lol had heard that following a phone call from gomer parry mumford might soon be headhunted by jumbo humphries welsh border garageowner feed dealer and private investigator it would keep mumford off the streets you must be awful glad you didnt kill the twat andy bliss said mumford grunted was never on the cards bliss smiled looked at lol and merrily and lifted his eyebrows merrily said im probably just being stupid look bliss said its pretty clear that nobody thought robbie was an accident and suicide looks increasingly unlikely so if there has to be a third suspect fair enough im always happy to get another lawyer out of the system i just lay awake thinking about it and then i woke up thinking about it merrily shook out a cigarette i thought that well if jon scole wasnt bothered about all the money going to robbie here was somebody who definitely was go on then spell it out well her childhood was disrupted after her father dumped her mother for bell she was virtually expected to be bells nursemaid whenever she spent any time with them and after her father went off to america it was her real mother who got her the job with smith sebald and then she gets saddled with bell again she couldve said no merrily with bell in the same town and her father saying please look after her ok on the one hand a good client but it must have been hell constantly covering things up wondering what the firms good name was going to be dragged into next and then theres her future fatherinlaw who well a lot of unexplained alienation there that must already be putting a strain on her relationship with stephen lackland and then bliss said the mad woman announces that shes adopting the son of pardon me andy this grasping bint from the plascarreg and making arrangements to ensure he and the new palmers guild get the bulk of her considerable estate do we know if susannah pepper attempted to talk belladonna out of it merrily shook her head dunno but something else that occurred to me if bell died susannah wouldve been left as robbies guardian not the way anyone would want to start their married life could she die thats her lifetimes ambition frannie anyway you could never prove it about the lawyer i just wanted to unload it sorry no no ill pass it on discreetly no doubt the lads in ludlow will be observing them together when bell appears in court to face charges of wilful damage to a stiff or whatever we cobble together charge might of course get thrown out who knows bliss finished his tea so youve placed her in the custody of huw owen interesting for both of them lol thought it had been merrilys idea to ask huw owen to take care of bell theyd told her last night that the weir house was already surrounded by the media and theyd brought her back here to the vicarage it was safe enough for her and safe from her lol had thought in that it wasnt ludlow although at one stage shed become disorientated and appeared to think that it was a countryhouse hotel bell had slept for perhaps the first time in over twentyfour hours by the time she was awake this morning around eleven huw was already here looking like the standin keyboard player from some acidrock band that had never made it into the s bell had acted strange and subdued and seemed in some way hollow as though some part of her had indeed rolled like a fireball from the church tower and was already haunting the back streets of ludlow well huw knew all the spiritual retreats and the sanctuaries that could turn people around plus he had a murky kind of charisma and he liked strange women they hadnt consulted susannah pepper just after dawn lol had awoken suddenly in merrilys bed well it had been late when theyd got back here and there was belladonna to see to convinced for a knifeedge moment that he was still up there on that tower and that the remaining two candles hadnt inexplicably gone out when bell had lowered herself over them it seemed like a bad joke now no it didnt it still didnt seem like any kind of joke maybe it had been the sudden disturbance of the air that had done it or maybe the fact that the flames already burning very low had been deprived of air bells dress acting like a big snuffer or maybe maybe it had been an act of god they had after all been votive candles you believed what you needed to believe all lol wished was that he hadnt accidentally glanced into the open mandolin case even though it was early may now it was still sufficiently cool to justify a fire in the vicarage drawing room and they sat on the sofa and did things together that you werent supposed to do over the age of seventeen especially if you were a minister of god and this was a sunday exploring one another maybe wondering if they were intact i still feel happier here im afraid merrily said i know this is really stupid but at your place i always feel lucys watching giving us a slow handclap no lucy had a certain decorum all right big question merrily said seriously do you think lucy could be seeing us in her house processing the information and responding to it intellectually or emotionally a dead person watching can someone be earthbound in a benevolent way what do you want me to say i dont know i dont know what this has taught me if anything about the nature of ghosts why did siân suddenly scream when you were there in the hanging tower with sam lol said and was this the same moment that the candles on the church tower went out wouldnt say a word you know merrily said not to me anyway siân white as a sheet said shed felt faint and gone out for some air perhaps thinking commendably i suppose that her own inherent scepticism might damage what we were trying to do and she walked across the inner bailey to the gatehouse the keep where robbie fell and marion probably the hanging tower wasnt built in marions time but the keep definitely was maybe the evening he died robbie had taken someone to the top of the keep to explain to that someone his theory that this was actually where it happened what do you think siân saw or felt whatever she was terrified i suppose its so much worse for someone who despises superstition maybe she saw whatever remains of marion whatever it was the bishop once saw not terribly benevolent that anyway siân wants to resign from her selfappointed role of deliverance coordinator merrily leaned back into a corner of the sofa i asked her to stay on amazed myself i liked her lol said you like everybody who isnt a psychiatrist ah lol said about that he told her about the call from the ennobled gavin gascoigne bloody hell merrily said governments scare me more than spooks they think theyre protecting themselves for the wellbeing of the nation is saltash going to back off hell do whatever gascoigne wants when you think about it what he did this kid fyneham and everything that was incredibly stupid people like saltash and gascoigne theyre treated like gods for years gods who can see into the minds of men and then they retire and become delinquents lol was thinking anyway saltash is my problem unfortunately inflicted on you our problem a problem shared what about sam youll go and see her with sandy gee tomorrow for a start pastoral care sams not out of it yet she started talking about the emails robbie sent her about the bad time he was having on the plascarreg all the things she should have done and then theres jemmie maybe itll need a requiem for jemmie a dark presence there needs attention there was also the question of what to do about the contents of the mandolin case so much to sort out yet nothing ever finished jane and eirion were planning a raid on the internet suicide sites tonight well safer with two of them merrily said she suspected that belladonnas ubiquity on death sites and in chatrooms had been in some way down to jonathan scole karen dowells first dissection of his hard disk had shown that hed been posting messages on the net purporting to be from someone very close to belladonna someone calling himself revenant death is eternal life without pain know that we must make our own eternity how much of that would scole have understood at the time had he adopted that name scole because it was the name of a village in east anglia where experiments had famously been carried out into the existence of spirits something else theyd never know scole had been his mothers son merrily said layered and what about robbie walsh lol said does he get a requiem ill see what andy thinks about it some tension there mumford mmm bliss i really think bliss thought andy mightve killed jason mebus do retired policemen in hereford routinely kill suspects they couldnt nail mumford took him down by the river merrily said near the old campions restaurant mebus kept insisting he hadnt you know gone to ludlow to find robbie but mebus is such a smartarse hardened villain already at janes age mumford said he didnt believe him admitted he completely lost it had mebus on the edge of the water he told bliss he thought mebus mustve hit him with a stone or something and got away mebus did get away not for long however he and chainboy nicked a car last night and turned it over on the a chainboy has head injuries mebus broke his collar bone and fractured two ribs karma lol said dont go there lol heard a car door slam and then jane outside laughing jane had a laugh like a firework going off so what did mumford say to you at the door after bliss had left lol remembered seeing them together by the print of the light of the world mumford looking uncomfortable mumbling something quickly and then leaving without turning back merrily standing on the mat exchanging thoughtful looks with jesus he said something about about the face hed seen reflected in the wye when he was forcing mebuss head down towards the water not mebus no merrily said not mebus closing credits well its all there if you want to check it out marion de la bruyère the hanging tower the yew tree the palmers guild the hungarian suicide song visit
