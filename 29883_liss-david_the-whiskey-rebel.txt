david liss the whiskey rebel for eleanor and simon ethan saunders it was rainy and cold outside miserable weather and though i had not left my boardinghouse determined to die things were now different after consuming far more than my share of that frontier delicacy monongahela rye a calm resolution had come over me a very angry man named nathan dorland was looking for me asking for me at every inn chophouse and tavern in the city and making no secret of his intention to murder me perhaps he would find me tonight and if not tomorrow or the next day not any later than that it was inevitable only because i was determined not to fight against the tide of popular opinionwhich is to say that i ought to be killed it was my decision to submit and i have long believed in keeping true to a plan once it has been cast in earnest it is a principle i cultivated during the warindeed one i learned from observing general washington himself this was in the early days of the revolution when his excellency still believed he might defeat the british in pitched battle continental style with our illdisciplined and badly equipped militias set against the might of british regulars it was the decisive military victory he wanted indeed in those early days it was the only sort he believed worth having he would invite the officers to dine with him and we would drink claret and eat roast chicken and sip our turtle soup and he would tell us how we were going to drive the redcoats back at brooklyn and the unfortunate affair would be over before winter that was during the war now it was early in and i sat at the bar of the lion and bell in that part of philadelphia euphemistically called helltown in that unsavory scene i drank my whiskey with hot water while i waited for death to find me i kept my back to the door having no wish to see my enemy coming and because the lion and bell was as unlovely a place as helltown offeredand those were mighty unlovely the air was thick with smoke from pipes plugged full of cheap tobacco and the floor naught but dirt had turned to mud with the icy rain outside and the spills and spitting and tobacco juice the benches lay lopsided in the newly made hummocks and ruts of the ground and the drunken patrons would from time to time topple over and tumble like felled timber into the muck perhaps a drinker might take the trouble to roll a friend over to keep him from drowning though there could be no certainty helltown friends were none the best it was a curious mix there the poor the whores the desperate the servants run off for the night or the month or forever and alongside them throwing dice upon uneven surfaces or hunched over a hand of cards spread across ripped velvet were the gentlemen in their fine woolen suits and white stockings and shimmering silver buckles theyd come to gawk and to rub elbows with the colorful filth and most of all theyd come to game it was the spirit of the city now that alexander hamilton that astonishing buffoon had launched his great project the bank of the united states as secretary of the treasury he had singlehandedly transformed the country from a republican beacon for mankind into a paradise for speculators ten years earlier with a single stroke he had transformed me from patriot to outcast i removed from my pocket a watch currently my only possession of value if one did not account my slave leonidas i had despite the decisions that had prevailed among the wise drafters of our constitution never quite learned to think of leonidas as property he was a man and as good a man as any id known it sat ill with me to keep a slave particularly in a city like philadelphia whose small population of owned blacks numbered in the dozens and one could find fifty free blacks for each bondsman i could never sell leonidas no matter how dire my need because i did not think it right to buy and sell men on the other hand though it was no fault of his leonidas would fetch at auction as much as fifty or sixty pounds worth of dollars and it had always seemed to me madness to emancipate such a sum so the timepiece in practical terms was currently my only thing of wortha sad fact given that i had removed it from its rightful owner only a few hours earlier its glittering face told me it was now half past eight dorland would have eaten his fashionably late dinner well over two hours ago giving him ample time to collect his friends and come in search of me it could be any minute now i slid back into my pocket the timepiece id taken on chestnut street the owner had been a fat jackanapes a selfimportant merchant hed been talking to another fat jackanapes and had paid no mind while i brushed past him id not planned to take the watch nor did i make a habit of such things as common theft but it had been so tempting and there seemed to be no reason not to claim it and then disappear in that crowded street clacking with the walking sticks of bankers and brokers and merchants i saw the watch saw it might be taken and saw how i might take it even then if that had been all i would have let it go but then i heard the man speak it was his words not my need that drove me to take what was not mine this man this lump of a man who resembled a great and corpulent bottomheavy bear forced into a crushedvelvet blue suit had been invited to a gathering the next week at the house of mr william bingham that was all i knew of him that he a mere maker of money nothing more than a glorified storekeeper had been invited to partake of the finest society in philadelphia indeed in the nation i who had sacrificed all for the revolution a man who had risked life in return for less than nothing was little more than a beggar so i took his watch and i defy anyone to blame me now that it was mine i examined the painting in the inside cover a young lady of not twenty plump of face like the watchs owner with a bundle of yellow hair and eyes far apart and open wide as though shed been in perpetual astonishment while she sat for the portrait a daughter a wife it hardly mattered i had taken from a stranger a thing he loved and now nathan dorland was coming to avenge such wrongs too innumerable to catalogue handsome timepiece said owen standing behind the bar he was a tall man with a head long and narrow shaped like one of the pewter mugs into which he poured his ales with wheatcolored hair that curled up like foam timepiece like that might go a way toward paying a debt he held out one of his meaty hands covered with oil and filth and blood from a fresh cut on his palm to which he paid no mind i shrugged with all my heart but you must know the watch is newly thieved he withdrew the hand and wiped it on his filthy apron dont need the trouble but i ought to send you to fence it now before you lose it at game should i turn the watch to ready i would not use it for something so ephemeral as a tavern debt i pushed my empty mug toward him another if you please my good man owen stared for a moment his tankard of a face collapsed in purselipped indecision he was a young man not twoandtwenty and he had a profound nearly religious reverence for those who had fought in the war living as he did in such a place as helltown and moving through indifferent social circles he had never heard how my military career had met its conclusion and i saw no advantage in sharing information that would lead to his disillusionment instead i favored other details owens father died in the fighting at brooklyn heights and more than once had i treated owen to the tale of how i had met his father that bloody day when i was captain of a new york regiment before my true skills were discovered and i was no longer to be found upon the battlefield that day i led men and when i told owen the tale my voice grew thick with cannon fire and death screams and the wet crunch of british bayonet against patriot flesh i would recount how i had given owens honored father powder during the chaos of the ignominious retreat with blood and limbs and musket balls flying about us the air acrid with smoke the british slaughtering us with imperial fury i had taken the time to aid a militia volunteer for we had shared a moment of revolutionary comradeship that defied our differences in rank and station the tale kept the drinks flowing owen took my mug poured in some whiskey from an unstoppered bottle and hot water from a pitcher near the stove he set it down before me with a considerable thud some would say youve had your fill he told me some would i agreed some would say youre abusing my generosity impertinent bastards owen turned away and i opened the watch once more setting it upon the counter where i might stare at the tick of its hands and the girl who had meant so much to the merchant to my right sat an animated skeleton of a man in a ragged coat that covered remarkably unclean linen his face was unshaved and his nasty eyes lodged between the thinning brown hair of his crown and the thickening brown hair of his cheeks stole glances at my prize id seen him come in an hour earlier and slide a few coins across the bar to owen who had in exchange handed a small parchment sack to the ragged man owen did a brisk trade in that greenish powder called spanish fly though this man his magic dust in hand seemed content to sit at the bar and cast glances at me and my timepiece i say fellow you are looking upon my watch he shook his head wasnt why i saw it fellow i saw you setting larcenous eyes upon my watch this very one aint he said looking closely at his drink dont you speechify at me fellow you were coveting my timepiece i held it up by the chain take it if you have the courage take it from my hands while i observe you rather than skulking in the dark like a sneak thief he continued to gaze inside his pewter mug as though it were a seeing crystal and he a wizard owen whispered a word or two to him and the skinny gawker moved farther down the bar leaving me alone it was what i liked best the hands of the watch moved it was strange how a man could find himself in so morose a state only a few days before i had considered dorlands pursuit of revenge as a vague amusement now i was content to let him kill me what had changed i could point to so many things so many disappointments and failures and struggles but i knew better it was that morning coming from my rooms and seeing the back of a woman half a block ahead of me walking quickly away from a great distance through the tangle of pedestrians i had seen a honeybrown coat and above it a mass of goldenblond hair upon which sat a prim if impractical widebrimmed hat for a moment from nothing more than the color of her hair from the way her coat hung upon her frame from the way her feet struck the stones i had convinced myself that it was cynthia i believed if only for an instant that after so many years and married though she was to a man of great consequence cynthia pearson knew i now lived in philadelphia knew where i lived and had come to see me perhaps at the last moment recognizing the impropriety she lost her courage and scurried away but she had wanted to see me she still longed for me the way i longed for her it lasted but an instant this utter unassailable conviction that it was cynthia and then disappointment and humiliation struck me just as hard and just as quickly of course it had not been she of course cynthia pearson had not come to knock upon my door the idea was absurd and that i should after ten years be so quick to believe otherwise testified to how empty was my sad existence when owen returned i closed the watch and put it away and then i drained my drink be so good as to pour another owen hovered before me shaking his head his mug handle of a nose blurring in the light of the oil lamps you can hardly keep yourself sitting go home captain saunders another i am to die tonight and i wish to do it good and drunk i daresay he is already quite drunk said a voice from behind me but give him another if he likes it was nathan dorland i neednt look for i knew the voice owens eyes narrowed with contempt for dorland was not an imposing figure not tall not broad not confident or commanding unless youre a friend of captain saunders and from the look of you im guessing you aint id say this is none of your concern its my concern because when this wretch is done with his drink i mean to take him outside and introduce him to a concept called justice with which he has been all too unfamiliar and yet i said i am familiar with injustice such irony i dont know your complaint said owen and i know the captain well enough to trust youve got your cause even so youll not harm him not here if youve a grievance with him you must challenge him to a duel like a gentleman i have done so and he has refused my challenge dorland said sounding very much like a whining child duels are fought so early in the morning i said to owen its barbarous owen looked over at dorland youve heard it he has no interest in fighting you and you must respect that this man is a hero of the revolution and i owe him a debt for my fathers sake ill defend his right to fight or not fight whom he wishes hero indeed dorland barked i suppose when he is spinning tales of his time with washington he may have neglected to tell you the one in which he is cast out of the army for treason havent heard that one ask him if you doubt it captain saunderss career ended in disgrace and as to the matter of your father be assured he tells every tavern keeper in philadelphia that he fought with his father or brother or uncle or son our friend here has given so many doomed men powder he is like the angel of death owens eyes glistened in the light of the fireplace and i shrugged for i had been caught i would not shy away from an untruth but it seemed a contemptible thing to lie about a lie i was at brooklyn heights i said i might have seen your father and no matter what you may hear said of me i can promise you i was never a traitor never my words only served to make owen more teary he looked over at dorland leave now i dont want trouble and nor do you what does he owe i heard the ease of wealth in dorlands voice ill pay his debt owen said nothing so i spoke tis near eleven dollars it wasnt true i owed less than six but if dorland was going to pay for my death at least owen should profit from it i heard behind me the music of metal on metal and then a purse landed hard upon the bar theres three pounds of british in it said dorland near fifteen dollars now saunders comes with me i nodded at owen tis my time thanks for the drinks lad i pushed myself off the rough wooden stool and the room turned to a wild and topsyturvy thing with the floor leaping up toward me and bar stools taking flight like startled birds i reflected on the danger of drinking so long without risingthat it is often hard to say precisely how drunken one has become if there is no new movement against which to test oneself and then i believe i lost consciousness t he rain fell hard and cold rousing me lest i sleep through my own murder my head ached along the temple from far too much whiskey and from what i judged to be a rather cruel kick delivered to an already fallen man very uncivil sharp pain jabbed into my ribsfrom i surmised the ongoing kicks to my side but in these i found less fault what is there to do with a fallen enemy but kick him in the ribs the head howeverthat is bad sport i gagged on the metallic taste of my own blood and the soot of filthy snow which was piled high against my face the blood i presumed was mine as i had no memories of biting anyone i pushed my face numb from the cold away from the snow and saw the alley was wet with rain and mud and horseshit my pants were wet too and i could not be absolutely certain but i had likely pissed myself had this event transpired it cannot be reckoned the result of fear i believe this point worth making i had decided that death was an agreeable outcome and was not only determined to be philosophical i was philosophical life death i had no strong predisposition for one or the other no if i had pissed myself it was because one of those kicking feet had made contact with my abdomen and pressed into my full bladder nothing but anatomy natural philosophy human mechanics there are diagrams in books to explain get up you are a disgrace the feet stopped kicking in the heavy rain nathan dorlands face shone spectrally in the sliver of moonlight that peeked through the cover of charcoal clouds dorlands features twisted into a snarling rage simultaneously wolfish and petulant sharp despite his plump jowly looks his nose was too long and carrotish his chin too weak his teeth unhealthy and his eyes baggy nature had been unkind to him and so had i there was no victory in taking liberties with the beautiful wife of an ugly man and had i known him before i met the lady i would have restrained myself for i am not unfeeling i managed to gain my feet in slow and awkward motions my hand sliding in a pile of shit as i tried to gain leverage a loose nailrusty by the uneven feel of itcut into my palm once standing i remained doubled over unable to straighten my hat had fallen off somewhere between the tavern and the alley and now the cold rain ran down my face washing the blood from my sundered lip there were four of them dorland and three friends all of about his ageperhaps ten years older than i wasand all as plump as uncomfortable in their bodies as unlearned in the school of war these were not men to fear but i was drunk they had the numbers and most significantly i had no fight left in me dorland held out his hand and one of his companions placed within it a military bayonet in past days men carried swords upon their person but our times have decayed he altered his grip upon the blade weighing it in his hand he drew close as did his friends two of them as near as he though one hung back have you anything to say before i end your life i cleared my throat dorland i am sadly disappointed with the man i have become i am drunk not only at this moment but perpetually i have had no steady source of income in half a decade and i am incorrigibly addicted to gaming so that the money i steal or borrow or on those rare occasions earn is gone as soon as it is in my hands my clothes are old and tattered and frequently pungent to the nose and above all of that i believe that during your attack i lost control of my bladder and pissed upon my own person you think this should make me spare you dorland asked do you think your pathetic condition will stay my hand no i only wished to make note of the sort of man your wife admitted to her bed for a moment despite the dark dorlands face glowed white a second moon and then disappeared back into the blackness i had seen faces contorted with rage before i had killed men with such looks upon them but that was war and this was murder a crime even i considered too base for contemplation id wanted to anger him of course id wanted to seal my fate but even then having scorned his pride having insulted him before his friends i knew i could have altered events it was but the work of a few words wellchosen comments to appeal to their mercy to make them feel grand and gracious id saved myself from worse for it was my particular talent it was why fleet my mentor during the war had chosen me to work with him and it was what he had taught me to refine the blade rose high and i fought hard to keep my eyes open better this had come at the hands of the british ten or twelve years ago when i might have died a hero now i was much decayed but that was the world after alla series of things that were not so good as we would wish i awaited the blow ready and determined if fearful of the pain no blow came instead i heard a voice call out stay your hand youll not want to commit murder before a witness there not fifteen feet from our little confrontation obscured by sheets of rain stood the massive shape of a man all silhouette in the downpour and darkness he stood upon the prop of a broken keg his greatcoat fluttering in the cold wind and under the coat his arms were raised as to protect two pistols from the wet i knew the voice but dorland would not just as i alone knew there could be no real pistols secreted away this is a matter of honor and not your concern dorland called out if it were a matter of honor you would be meeting beside the schuylkill at dawn my defender said here are four men setting out to kill a fifth and i see no honor in it dorland snorted and wiped rain from his eyes what will it cost to be rid of you poor dorland believing his money should answer all knew nothing of how to regard an enemy to measure his worth and his means no dorland was a product of hamilton s new america standing in the shadow of the bank of the united states and dorlands defiance came from wealth from his utter assurance that it made him superior to any ball of lead to any martial prowess this man with his arms outstretched in the thunderous rain was but one more thing to be bought and sold like dorlands wifewhat was her name sally or susan or something of that sort lovely woman very red lips all at once the clouds shifted the rain lessened and a full moon shone above casting light upon all including my rescuer who towered above us wild and demonic tis but a nigger said one of dorlands friends hear me said leonidas for it was indeed my man i am a slave and you threaten the life of my master ive a rare opportunity to kill white men and be excused for doing so i would not have chosen to save myself but leonidas was involved and now i had a duty to him he would not rest until i was safe and i would not risk his life tis but one man said his friend again and only a nigger begging your pardon i interrupted but there are in fact two men this point might have given my enemies greater pause had i not punctuated it by vomiting on my shoes reckon how you like then dorland said you are yet outnumbered we are four to your two are you certain asked leonidas his voice quite arch what the devil do you mean i mean look at me when i speak yes over here thats right what a negro is not worth your attention i mean you miscount i could not see his face but i knew his tone he spoke slowly and he drew dorlands attention for a purpose something had turned we are three to your one it had not been so and yet now impossibly it was i had not seen the third man arrive nor note what he didgranted the rain beat loudly and i was distracted by pain and the rush of blood in my head and a bit of vomitingand had i not later come to know him to see what he could accomplish if i had only known him from this one act i would have believed him a ghost some phantom from hell untethered by earthly laws he was not there and then he stood by my side but it was more than that dorlands three companions were now in the mud one lay on the ground clutching his middle another pressed a hand to his throat a third lay flat on his back his eyes wide the strangers boot on his chest he held a thin knife not particularly long yet i did not doubt its deadliness in his hands i stared at this man who stood still with his shoulders wide in a stance of readiness a bound coil ready to spring he was slight of build evenly proportioned but a little inclined to be short and even stranger he was bearded i could not be certain in the poor light but i thought he might be dark of skin a lascarlooking fellow dorland shook his head at the scene before him having no greater understanding than i he set down his bayonet and backed away his hands out to make clear he would offer no more tricks let him go he said looking at his friend writhing under the strangers boot dorland however was now no longer in a position to negotiate without taking his foot off the chest of the fallen man the stranger had lashed out and pulled dorland to him the way a frog pulls in an insect with its tongue he pressed dorlands back tight to his chest with his left elbow left hand gripping dorlands right hand the strangers own right hand now held his knife to dorlands thumb youre going to feel a hot sting he said and then excruciating pain he had done so much and so quickly and i did not know him i could only presume he truly meant to cut off dorlands thumb and i could not allow it yes dorland was a fool and yes he had thought it a fitting thing to kill me but he was hardly the first to think that and i had done him harm id injured him and then refused to meet him on the field of honor having his thumb cut off in a helltown alley struck me as a bit more than he deserved or if not then at least more than i wanted upon my conscience better to let him go i said to the bearded man i think not the stranger said hell likely return to make another attempt i must insist you let him go i said this time more strongly its my rescue id like to think i have some say in it the bearded man pushed dorland away he stumbled but did not fall perhaps it was the darkness but the strangers expression seemed to me coldly even frighteningly blank he had not been out for blood before and he was not disappointed now he had judged mutilating dorland the best course and he would have pursued it had i not insisted otherwise now with dorland away he released his foot from the friends chest and took several steps back from his victims who were apparently not so badly hurt that they could not struggle to their feet these were dandified gentlemen with no stomach for street brawling in the mud and rain a little taste of violence and pain proved sufficient there you have it i said you may flee dorland gazed upon me saunders dont think our business concluded he said apparently eager to prove the strangers point you did not find this encounter decisive i asked then vomited once more you are repulsive i wiped my mouth with the back of my hand ladies are known to find me charming he took a step forward but one of his friends the one who had been struck in the throat held him back dorland grabbed his fallen weapon and he and his friends hurried off leonidas hopped down from his broken pedestal sending out a splatter of cold mud and placed an arm around me for he sensed it was only with great difficulty that i remained on my feet lets get you dry and warm he said then ill present this gentleman and we shall all have a talk i found the strangers coldness unnerving but i knew a worthy fighter when i saw one and i owed him my politeness i am in your debt i said to him the man grinnedthe first sign id seen that he possessed anything like human feelingand it was a wide open likable sort of grin but also strangely false it was not precisely insincere but rather had the air of being an afterthought something he had to remember to do when interacting with human beings in such a way that involved no violence entirely my pleasure he said and i did not doubt him with the stranger lagging behind perhaps making certain our enemies attempted no late ambush leonidas led me limping back into the lion and bell we took a table near the fire attracting no little attention as we did so my man shrugged off his greatcoat hanging it to dry and then his hat revealing a round head of closely cut hair next he took his pistols and checked the powder the sight of this big negro examining firearms caused a few men to gaze upon us with apprehension philadelphia white men are more at ease around negroes than those in southern climes but the sight of a muscular and broadbacked african checking his pistols is never a comforting sight no one dared say a word thoughin part because it is unwise to be rude to a large man with firearms but also because there was something in leonidass countenance that allayed suspicion he was black as midnight but handsome as oroonoko possessed of a natural dignity and if there was but one negro in the country you wished to see with primed pistols surely this was he you did have weapons i said i thought you were posturing his mouth twitched in the merest hint of a smile i should have hated to shoot a hole through my coat tis a fine bit of tailoring why do you have pistols i demanded i have to do something with my money as i am not permitted to purchase my freedom i often had no need of his services and i let leonidas hire himself out as a laborer down by the docks he had saved enough to purchase his freedom at a fair price should i wish to permit it it seemed to me an unnatural cruelty to ask a man made a slave through no fault of his own to have to pay for his freedom while i dried myself and let the pain wash over me and crystallize leonidas fetched for me more whiskey for the events of the evening had created a void within me that wanted filling and soon he handed me a mug and sat down next to me all this time the stranger stood by in a pantomime of anonymity he shook off his coat by the fire he patted his hat against his forearm he rubbed his hands together again i thank you i said to him i never asked for it but stillvery kind he nodded and i had the distinct impression he grew weary of gratitude youre fortunate we arrived when we did leonidas said you looked quite defeated i met his eye this notion that you cannot look into a mans eye while dissimulating is of course an utter falseness i could stare into the eyes of jesus and tell him i was john the baptist and should the chance ever arrive to do so unlikely a thing i meant to try it just to see how it would go a few more minutes would have set things right still i am always grateful for timely assistance leonidas turned to the stranger may i present to you mr kyler lavien lavien i said what sort of name is that are you a frenchman the stranger met my gaze with something hard and unflinching i am a jew i suppose he might have been prepared for some unkind words but he would not get them from me i have nothing against jews i have nothing for them of course but nothing against them nothing against anyonenot papists presbyterians lutherans methodists mennonites moravians millenarians or mohammedans i have nothing against members of any religionexcept quakers whom i despise with all their sanctimonious peacemongering and propertyowning and thees and thous and what is your business with me i asked him that is rather the question isnt it said leonidas he looked pointedly at lavien when he spoke and i felt very much a stranger to events in which i ought to have been central lavien cleared his throat i was outside your boardinghouse when this good fellow left in search of you because in the capacity of my work i followed someone to your rooms whom did you follow and what is your work i said my head is too hurt for circuitous answers say what you mean sir i am employed in the service of your old acquaintance colonel alexander hamilton i serve him now in his capacity as secretary of the department of the treasury despite my pain and drunkenness and general confusion i felt my senses sharpening i had suffered a decade of ignominy because of hamilton and now here was his man to save me from a vengeful husband it made no sense what does hamilton want with me i asked that is the wrong question said leonidas ask him whom he followed to your house enough of this nonsense i said tell me what you do not say in the capacity of serving the treasury department said lavien i followed to your home a lady who wished to deliver you a message what of it ladies like to send me messages i am a good correspondent this lady said lavien i believe is known to you though you have not spoken with her in many years her name is mrs cynthia pearson all pain all confusion and disorder were gone and i saw the world before me in sharp detailfine angles and defined colors cynthia pearson whom i had once intended to marry the daughter of fleetmy dead and muchabused friendbetrayed as i had been by hamilton himself i had not spoken to her in ten years i had seen her yes glimpses upon the street but never spoke she had married another man married for wealth i believed and our paths were forever diverged or so i thought for leonidas and this stranger now told me that this very evening she had come to my house why i spoke to leonidas forming my words slowly and methodically as though being careful with my question might help him produce a more lucid response for what reason did she come to see me leonidas met my gaze and matched my tone he had been with me almost as long as i had been apart from cynthia and he understood the importance of this question he understood what this must mean to me it has something to do with her husband i shook my head never had i believed that cynthia pearson even knew i lived in philadelphia and now she had come to my home at night to speak to me of her husband seeing the confusion upon my face leonidas took a deep breath she believes her husband possibly herself and her children to be in some danger she came to see you tonight ethan to beg for your help joan maycott summer i wanted to produce one sort of story and i found myself producing one entirely different much of what transpired was born directly from my own decisions my own actions if i had not been what is called willful in women it is called energetic or ambitious in men my life might have unfolded quite differently when we make decisions that lead us down a difficult path it is easy to imagine the untaken course as peaceful and perfect but those neglected choices may have been as bad or worse i must feel regret yes but it does not follow that i must feel remorse i shall therefore tell my story and explain how i came to be an enemy to this country and the men who rule her i do so with the full expectation that even if these words are read they will find few sympathizers i will be called a base and treacherous woman diabolical in my unnatural resistance to the paternity of nation even so there will always be those who have lived through what i have similar or worsefor i know there is worseand they will understand it is small compensation but there is no other for me i was born under the name of joan claybrook and i lived on lands near the town of albany in new york my mother was one of six children from a poor family and my father had come to this country from scotland an indentured servant so they set out upon the adventure of life with few advantages but they struggled and land was cheap and by the time of my birth they were possessed of a moiety of property upon which they farmed wheat and barley and raised some cattle occasionally pigs and always a prodigious number of fowl we would never have and never aspired to true wealth but my family had reached a state in which we had no fear of starvation and at least before the war we managed to save more each year than we spent i had one older brother and two younger and the family being well situatedquite overstocked reallywith heirs and farm hands my parents and my brothers too were most indulgent of my whims i was disinclined to farmwork and as the only girl child found my family tolerantunwisely tolerant some would sayof my wishes it was not that i did not have responsibilities by my estimate i had far too many but they only asked of me what they could not do without i tended the chickens and collected their eggs i kept them fed and cleaned their coop i did a bit of spinning and sewing beyond that i read it is to be expected i suppose that simple folk such as my parents who grew up with little more than their letters who had neither time nor money for reading would have discouraged these pursuits perhaps they ought to have but they were kind people and they found my love of books and reading charmingperhaps as dr johnson found charming the dog that walked upon its hindquarters they bought for me what they could and cultivated friendships with people of means in albany people who would be willing to lend me books of history and natural philosophy and political economy i hardly cared what it was so long as it imparted knowledge i would sit outside on fair days by the fire in foul and i would forget there was a far smaller world around me by the time i was twelve i had read hobbes and locke and hume i knew adam smiths theory of moral sentiments enough to quote chapter and verse and his wealth of nations nearly so well i had read macaulays history and bolingbrokes essays all of the spectator i had readin translation of courseherodotus and thucydides and homer and virgil my father quizzed me though he was little read himself over meals i would tell him of the follies of xerxes or of how zeus suffered when made to stand by powerless to stop the death of his son sarpedon he found these talesthose from classics and historiesfar more interesting than the thoughts of hume or berkeley and this desire of his that i tell him stories might have colored his choice of books for me so it seemed when i was sixteen and he brought home a book that changed everything of course i knew all about fanciful tales i had read the epic poems of antiquity and i had read milton and dryden the plays of shakespeare and marlowe and jonson but thisthis was something else entirely even today though ive read it more times than i can count i sigh a bit to name it it was called amelia and it was a novel inevitably i had come across references to novels in my readingin magazines and occasionally in pamphlets and works of philosophical discoursebut they were always dismissed as frivolous things for silly women composed by silly women or disreputable men so conditioned was i to regard novels as trivial nonsense that when my father put fieldings three volumes in my hand borrowed from a merchant he knew in town it took considerable will to smile and act in some small way appreciative my efforts proved insufficient however for my fathers countenance fell dont ye like it his eyes went wide and slightly moist he was a proud man broadshouldered with strong though strangely flat hands and more than his share of physical courage but he found my reading mysterious and vaguely frightening i could see he thought he had made a foolish error embarrassed himself before his clever daughter perhaps even offended her or evenfor who knew how these matters of books workeddone her harm ii dont know not having read it i said then i smiled at him smiled as he deserved i shall let you know anon had he not looked so sad i should almost certainly have set it aside as something unworthy of my notice and returned it unread after a few days now however i felt obligated to give fielding my attention so it was i began to read perhaps it was my good fortune that the first novel i read should be so unusual of its kind novels so often concerned women looking for husbands but in this book the principal couple was already married the hero william boothe endures debt imprisonment the temptation of lust and the guilt of adultery while amelia his loving wife struggles to preserve her family in the face of ruin and reprobation i wept for its pathos and i wept upon its conclusion not only for the depth of the emotion it produced in me but because it was over by the time i finished reading my father knew he had brought me something i loved i recall that i sat in the field behind the house the sun warm though not hot on my face the completed final volume on my stomach i stared at the misty blue of the sky and i had the strangest thought of my life never before as i read books produced by the ancients books of philosophy or history essays written by men of this very century had the notion of writing myself ever possessed me what could i write about when i knew nothing but what i read now everything was different why could i not write a novel i could not hope to produce anything of amelias majesty but i could surely produce something i set my toowilling and indulgent father upon his task he was to borrow every novel he could find i read them all fieldings other lesser works joseph andrew and tom jones richardson s pamela and clarissa and sir charles grandison i read the bawdy humor of smollett the social explorations of burney and heywood and lennox the sentimental nonsense of henry brooke and henry mackenzie i made copious notes on each quantifying what i loved and what i hated when my empathy for a character led me to weep or laugh or fear for her safety i spent hours determining by what means the novelist had effected this magic when i cared nothing for suffering and loss i dissected the want of craft that engendered such apathy by the time i was seventeen i believed myself ready to write a novel of my own the only obstacle was that i had not myself experienced enough of the world to describe life with the novelists verisimilitude i had read but i had not lived i was determined that i should do so not only for the sake of my craft but because i was now old enough to understand that books might not by themselves be enough for me forever one afternoon near the end of the war before the peace was made official but subsequent to the surrender of cornwallis i was in town with my father and theodore my elder brother when i happened to see a pair of gentlemen emerging from a tailors shop one was older clearly the father of the younger for they shared the same long face patrician nose and penetrating eyesthough i could not see their color from the distance i marked their glowing intensity the younger man moved stiffly and with the aid of a cane he seemed to wince with each step despite these grimaces however i knew he was the most beautiful man i had ever seen with his fair hair and kind face angelic in its proportions both revealing and reflecting the world around it like a cold still lake granted when i say his beauty exceeded all others i own my life had been sheltered having come of age during a war in which many young men had been off fighting or hiding that they might not be made to fight or imprisoned upon suspicion of fighting for the wrong side i had not seen many young men and fewer still in other than a state of desperation but this one was indeed beautiful and had i gazed upon a hundred thousand of the finest specimens of the sex i do not know i should have seen one i liked better i asked who he was that my brother said is andrew maycott i remembered him for their farm was not far from ours he had been four years younger last i saw him hardly seventeen and i had been thirteen no more interested in men than i was in military tactics he had matured in those years and i even more so perhaps he felt a strangers eyes upon him for he turned to look at me across the street and our eyes met he leaned upon his cane and tipped his hat to meto usand i feltwell i hardly knew what i became lightheaded and weak and terrified and yet i was determined to know him better i thought to speak of it to my father he was indulgent and should no doubt have done all in his power to arrange a meeting of the maycotts and our family but i had no wish for that sort of introduction i had no mind to make small talk with his farming parents more to the point such a conjoining of two farming families did not seem to me sufficiently novellike at least not in the best sense i did not want my story to begin with a quotidian gathering of squires b and western far better i should do something of note something replete with adventure and strong feeling and new sentiment to that end i took atossa a spotted mare who was my favorite and rode the five miles to the maycott farm perhaps i ought to have been apprehensive for i knew what i planned was quite scandalous and would anger my parents i was calm however for even at its worst my parents anger was mild and i spent my time imagining how when i returned home i would makes notes that would later provide detail for my novel i arrived at the farm and approached the house the maycotts had more land and wealth than we did and if it was not a great deal more it was enough for them to hold themselves above us and for us to consider ourselves humbled in their presence the house itself was a large and handsome thing of two stories all recently whitewashed neatly tucked in a sheath of sheltering maples none of us had fared well during the war for it was hard to profit when there was so little money in circulation and it was a sorry thing to grow crops when they might be appropriated by the enemy to feed its army or appropriated by our own troops and paid for with worthless promises nevertheless the maycotts had kept up appearances and as i approached the house i felt like a frumpy rustic approaching the lords manor my dress a homespun nutcolored thing was clean enough and my plain bonnet was neat and not overly discolored but indifferent for all that i had longed for a new ribbon to wear on such an auspicious occasion but there were no new ribbons to be boughtand if there had been we would not have had the money under my bonnet such as it was my mass of unruly brown hair was pinned as neatly as nature and impatience would allow i had been careful to wash my hands before leaving and my fingernails were free of dirt i had planned a speech to give to the servant who answered the door but i was never afforded the opportunity i had not yet knocked when i heard footsteps behind me and i turned to see andrew maycott himself hand upon his cane coming with some difficulty up the path leaning upon the cane he bowed slightly good afternoon miss his smile was correct and polite and there was nothing ungentlemanly in his words or his manner and yet i felt his eyes linger upon me i enjoyed the feeling i straightened my posture you are andrew maycott the very man ive come to see why i believe its joan claybrook he said shifting his head this way and that like some collector of curios who has come upon a new and exciting specimen i remember you when you were a little girl which i am no longer i said hoping to sound more confident than i felt he made no effort to hide his amusement i dont think there is any room for discussion on that score there was nothing lecherous in his tone but he flirted i could have no doubt of it his attentions distracted me and i did not wish to be distracted i wished to be the one who distracted who made the rules but now so close to him i found it hard to keep my thoughts clear does it hurtyour wound i kept my voice calm and even no easy thing when my pulse pounded in my ears it is painful sometimes he said but i will not let that keep me from doing what i like and i am told it shall abate byandby i smiled to best disguise my anxiety and then taking what i hoped was a surreptitious deep breath i said as airily as i could i shall not wait for byandby let us take a walk i astonished him i could see as much he shifted a bit and did a charming stammering thing and then swallowed hard miss claybrook i do not think it would be proper for me to take a private walk with a young lady perhaps i might have been stung by this rebuke i might have attempted to retrench to recast what i had said but i felt no shame or remorse and the absence of regret gave me courage oh rabbit proper youll walk with me wont you i do not think your father will thank me for it he said why do you not come in for some maple wine with my sister i did not like this suggestion and my tone revealed my irritation i havent come for your sister i came for you then you shall prosper he said in having the both of us all at once i found i was no longer performing i did not act bold i was bold and i liked it i put my hands on my hips mr maycott i have no interest in stilted conversation with your sister i wish to talk to you and i am sorry to see you are afraid to walk with a young lady i merely consider your interests he said both surprised and amused even if you do not perhaps the impropriety of what you propose has not occurred to you i believe sir in making my own propriety if you do not come with me i shall tell the world you did so there is nothing to be gained by demurring he laughed and his blue eyes mirrored the sky i see you have quite defeated me let us take a short walk along the road then i should prefer privacy the woods and i he said holding up his cane prefer to depend upon wellpacked earth i could not argue with this requirement so i compromised happy so very happy that i would now be walking with this beautiful man who had been i must think charmed and not appalled by my speech we took a few steps and mr maycott began to comment on the fineness of the weather on how even now he could not quite believe he was safe from the terror and tedium of war then perhaps feeling awkward at his own seriousness he changed to more agreeable topics he spoke of how good it was to be home of the simple pleasures of living upon his familys landand he said of resuming old acquaintance of course i found all of this interesting and i loved to hear him speak and in particular i loved to hear him speak of his feelings he was more open and direct about such things than any other man id known and yet i was impatient i wanted to speak of the two of us of this moment of what i had done to make it possible at last i said you do not seem shocked by my addressing you as ive done would you rather i were shocked he asked no of course not i am only surprised pleased of course but surprised there has been a revolution said andrew a king has been replaced by the people it can hardly be surprising if other changes follow he looked at me calm and easy and yet his eyes were distant as he considered the implications of his own words later i would come to see this as the moment i fell in love with him he was so glorious to look at so strong and well formed and elegant and yet contemplative he took me seriously regarded my words as thoughtfully as i could want i felt no one had ever before truly listened to me i searched for the right words sir i am in need of a sentimental encounter i saw you in town and i thought i should like it if you were to begin courting me he had seemed beyond shocking yet this shocked him miss claybrook given our new familiarity it would be better to call me joan miss claybrook he repeated if i did not know better i should think you had just arrived here from some distant island or newly freed from captivity with the indians if i were not a man of honor you would be placing yourself in grave danger then i depend upon your being a man of honor i do not suggest anything untoward andrew men court women with a great deal of regularity and it is perfectly acceptable it is possible that once we spend some time together we may discover that we do not like each other well enough so that will be the end of it i only propose we find out but this is not the way it is done you are obviously a clever girl and know that what happened to the revolution i asked he laughed perhaps you have outsmarted me oh there is no perhaps about it but i have no doubt you will have your revenge he bowed you are too kind i am just kind enough i was thoroughly myself now he and i were comfortable and his beauty ceased to frighten me it charmed me and thrilled me but i began to feel at home in its presence the truth is andrew that i hope someday to write a novel and i thought it might provide for an interesting experience if i were to make bold with you he blinked at me like a sleepy cat you speak to me this way so you can turn our conversation into a novel you do not really wish me to court you oh of course i do i said but my being so direct was i admit a sort of experimentation for i require some experiences i have had too few come pray dont be cross i should not have spoken to you thus if i did not like you but what sort of novel it was not a question i had anticipated and it delighted me the one i like best is mr fieldings amelia thats a good one he said you see already we are compatible not only do you read novels which im told most men do not or at least do not admit to but your taste in novels is sound do you not think that courting me would be a good idea miss claybrook i do not believe there is anything anyone could say that could possibly dissuade me from courting you with this he began to walk again upon the road bringing his walking stick down more jauntily than before we spent some moments in comfortable silence then he said would you be so good as to tell me about your novel how like him i thoughtthough i hardly knew him and had no business deciding what he was like or unliketo get so quickly to the heart of it thats precisely the difficulty i havent a notion of what to write about andrew laughed perhaps it was childish but i felt wounded you think my difficulties amusing not at all he said i only like the thoughtful way your brow wrinkles when you wrestle with them but pray tell me why you have such trouble telling your story even as i had been studying his face glorying in his handsomeness it had not occurred to me that he would regard me the same way and i felt myself blush if i am to write a novel i wish for it to be an american novel not a mere imitation of what is done in england i dont want to move tom jones or clarissa harlowe to new york and set them to running about with indians or fur trappers the book must be american in its essence dont you think again he stopped and stared at me you are a clever woman and if i may say so a true revolutionary i believe the war would have been over three years ago had you sat in the continental congress you tease me i said he looked me in the eye so i could see his earnestness i do no such thing i promise you you on your farm in isolation have understood more about the revolution and the new country than half our politicians and generals we cannot do things the old way but must make our own new way though to be honest i am not entirely certain what an american novel would look like english novels are almost always about property i said estates miraculously inherited or diabolically stolen there are marriages of course but these marriages regardless of protestations of affection are ever about land and estates holdings and rents not about love not really i dont want to write a novel about property here in america property is abundant so it is held cheap it is not what it is in england precious and scarce and hard to retain andrew stroked his chin and then nodded as though listening to a voice only he could hear the american novel if it is to be honest must be about money not property money alonebase unremarkable corrupting money the moment he spoke i knew he was quite right i would write a novel about money the notion contained such power over me that it was as though we were already married and i took his arm and pulled him toward me his brilliant suggestion i knew would be important but i could not yet know that it would change everything ethan saunders cynthia pearson had come to my home to ask for help so many questions so much confusion and yet this fact stood out this fact and one otherthat it had been cynthia id seen hurrying away from my house that morning i was not a deluded fool dwelling pathetically on his past the past it seemed was coming back for me i drained my whiskey and turned to lavien why were you following her i did not like the thought of someone so ready to slice off a mans thumb slinking around in the dark after cynthia pearson his expression was calm and easy i have been looking for her husband jacob pearson but with no success i remembered jacob pearson well during the british occupation id been in philadelphia for nearly three months attempting to infiltrate an enemy spy ring richard fleetmy friend my teacher my fellow spy the man who had recruited me into the businesshad asked me to look after his daughter then living in the city he had not asked me to fall in love with her granted but these things often come unexpected during those months id met her future husband jacob pearson a successful dealer in properties who managed to remain in the city avoid the taint of royalism and grow even more wealthy after the end of the war by snatching up properties from british sympathizers who were forced to flee pearson was perhaps five years older than i not unattractive in person and while he and i had never been friends i had never had any reason to dislike the man not until circumstances forced me to flee philadelphia to leave cynthia for her own happiness and pearson so successfully took my place why are you looking for him i asked lavien so i might speak to him he answered holding my gaze a moment longer than he needed to as if daring me to treat his answer as anything other than illuminating speak to him about what mr lavien speak to him about things that do not concern you captain saunders once you start slinking about in the shadows following people who come to visit me it becomes my business does it not no i cleared my throat well youve quite thoroughly demonstrated your inscrutability and now i know that if there is to be giveandtake between us you wish to maintain always the upper hand but you are going to tell me more of what you know so let us not pretend otherwise you came to find me sir and if you came to find me it is because you want something from me and since you shall not get it without telling me more we might as well move forward to that part of the conversation a faint smile crossed his lips for a beaten drunkard you know your craft i liked him for saying so now you work for hamilton and you want pearson and cynthia pearson herself is looking for me tell me what i need to know i cant and wont tell you why i want him i have taken an oath of silence to reveal what i learn to none but secretary hamilton or the president and ill not break that oath i can tell you that the man is missing and has been for several days i believe that is why his wife wishes to speak with you she knew you from the war i believe her father and i worked together he was my friend i see he said evidently seeing a great deal he was no fool this lavien youve already spoken to mrs pearson i imagine of course lavien answered she was kind enough to grant me an interview but she claimed total ignorance of her husbands whereabouts did you believe her asked leonidas he and i had been together a long time he knew what to ask lavien nodded i did mrs pearson did not at all strike me as a woman dissembling only as a woman uneasy a woman whose husband is missing may very well display concern but she struck me as agitated i believe there were things upon her mind she did not speak of but i doubt if she lied about knowing where to find mr pearson so you followed her to my home tonight then what happened after she was admitted she emerged a few minutes later in the company of leonidas she proceeded to return to her carriage so i inquired of leonidas the nature of her business and you told him i asked leonidas he serves the government he answered i saw no reason to withhold what was said especially since he already knew many of the particulars mr lavien asked if he might accompany me to find you it was my hope said lavien that in your company mrs pearson might be more forthcoming and say things she had withheld from me i took a moment to consider everything he said and to make myself comfortable with these surprises then i asked an obvious question why does cynthia believe herself and her children in danger that i cannot say leonidas answered i pushed myself to my feet pain exploded within my head and i had to grasp the side of the table to keep from falling over but i steadied myself and the worst of it soon passed time to find out i said to leonidas may i join you asked lavien and what if i should say no laviens mouth twitched better not to explore that possibility i looked at him prepared to let him know that his company was provisional and if i did not like what he did or said i should banish him at once i said nothing however because id witnessed him in a flash of lightning in the blink of an eye overcome and disable three men if he wished to join me against my will i had no notion of how i might stop him b y the time we left the rain had mostly abated and we walked through the muddy ruins of helltown the walk did me good set my blood to flowing worked the pain out of my system ive never been particularly good at fighting it being a rough sort of work best left to rough men and id learned long ago how to handle a beating with equanimity also i had more important things to consider cynthia was in some sort of trouble and she came to me id only been in philadelphia for four months following my flight from baltimore and a misunderstanding involving a cousin or niece or some such cynthia somehow knew i now lived here and in her time of trouble shed turned to me no pain could compete with my curiosity my buoyant and irrational enthusiasm at the thought of having once more some contact with her i was not so ready to disregard reason as to believe that somehow against hope and propriety we might be together i only wanted to see her to hear her to have her near as we moved silent and huddled in the cold toward the center of the city the landscape metamorphosed from an outlying camp of poverty and debauchery to the height of american propriety the streets as if changed by magic were all at once bricked with lamps lit on walkways and watch houses occupied the homes were no longer makeshift affairs serviceable and expedient huts of castaway wood and thatch but philadelphia redbrick stately and handsome with stone fences that hid clever little gardens jacob pearsons house at the corner of third and shippen was one of these it was no great monument to american wealth like the bingham house or like the morris mansion where the president resided but it was a large and stately home of three stories surrounded by denuded apple andappropriatelypear trees shrubs bushes and plots set aside for flower gardens when the weather turned warm pearsons home was made of the same redbrick as the house where i rented yet here was wealth on an order i could never hope to attain looking upon this fine building could i wonder why cynthia had married him during our walk id heard the church bells strike ten but pearsons home was bright with lit candles and from the outside it looked a hub of activity the rain light though it had become undid my time before the fire and we were quite wet by the time the three of us approached i stood upon the porch and contemplated the knocker there was i understood no way to prepare myself for what must happen next no way to make myself ready there was nothing to it but to move forward i wished i could face cynthia in a clean suit unbloodied and neatly ordered but it was not to be she thought herself in danger and i would not ask her to wait while i made myself fit for presentation do you require that i knock for you asked leonidas having apparently noticed the gravity with which i regarded this moment no i believe i can manage i am quite willing to bear the burden he said and with the rain beginning to fall harder i am even eager to undertake the physical labor required to bring a servant to the door hes very cheeky i said to lavien and then knocked myself i was after all capable enough requiring only a little browbeating from my negro to make it happen a footman soon opened the door his livery was rumpled as though a dirty set of clothes had been thrown on hastily and he had dark circles under his eyes id seen the look before and i had no doubt this was a household in distress captain ethan saunders to see mrs pearson i intoned with an importance my hatless wet head beliedor at least contradicted the footman tall and rugged in build as was common for his species of servant looked to me like a stage actor who had only been waiting for another player to speak a line that he might speak his own practically biting off my words he said im afraid mrs pearson is not accepting visitors at this hour of course she is i assured him as she went to the trouble to summon me and i have gone to the trouble of answering you need do no more than go to the trouble of inviting us in and presenting us he looked me over perhaps for the first time taking in my deplorable condition that shant happen sir good night the fellow was actually going to close the door in my face once a door is closed it is not an easy thing to get it open again so i stepped forward pressed one hand upon the door and strode directly toward the footman the primary responsibility of such a servant is to see to the safety of his employers so he ought to be possessed of a great deal of courage nevertheless surprised and faced with my alarming appearance he took a fatal step back this proved enough for my pair of worthies to move past him it was an effective ploy but i had no doubt that had it not worked lavien would have dispatched him with little trouble i was glad to avoid that outcome however as i did not wish to begin my reunion with mrs pearson with the hobbling of her footman regaining his confusion the serving man stammered a moment and then managed to utter a coherent sentence i must ask you to leave at once my god man have you never had a wet drunk a negro and a jew call upon mrs pearson before i said dont just stand there tell her were here get out or there will be trouble you shant like violent trouble sir if this fellow thought he and a handful of kitchen boys were a match for leonidas and lavien he was sadly mistaken nevertheless it all proved unnecessary for at the end of the front hall a figure emerged silhouetted by the light of the sconces behind her i could only see a shadowy form but i knew her at once its all right nate i shall tend to this the vibrating in my chest reverberated through my body i could feel my pulse in my fingertips my breath came in short bursts after ten years i stood in the same room with the woman i had once loved once believed myself destined to marry i wished to rush to her and i wished to flee instead i held my ground and attempted to conduct myself with the greatest possible dignity for a man so befouled and ill used as i was i attempted an awkward little bow though my middle sections pained me considerably mrs pearson you have summoned me and here i am she advanced a step and at once became visible she wore a gown of pale green perfectly chosen to match the shade of her eyes her hair was piled into a bun from which a few delicate goldenstraw wisps escaped and she wore a prim little bonnet that did no more than suggest the possibility of a head covering once a month or more ago near the covered market i chanced to observe mrs pearson upon the streets as she went shopping with her maid her two childrena boy and a girlin obedient tow it had been fleeting for i dared not let her see me in ten years id not had the chance to gaze upon her face when id known her she had been a mere girl of nineteen but now she was a woman and the soft features that had made her so pretty had sharpened into beauty her eyes wide and liquid her lips full and red her nose sharp and distinguished if her loveliness were not enough to move me i should have been undone by the sadness overlaid upon it for it was apparent that mrs pearson was a melancholy woman and indeed a fearful one i had not been a student of human nature for so longit was what distinguished my service during the warwithout being able to see such things captain saunders i am sorry to have troubled you but it would appear i have made aoh dear god what has happened to you she stepped into the far superior light of the foyer and i was pleased to observe that her beauty was unharmed by greater illumination you are hurt sir is this becausewhat i mean to say are these injuries the result of my having she did not know how to finish and were she anyone else i would have let her dangle upon her own words to reveal what she feared and i would have as much information as i could but this was cynthia pearson once cynthia fleet and i would not be the cause of her suffering i have had an unfortunate encounter with some rough men i told her but you may be assured that it has nothing to do with your circumstances indeed i may owe you my life for had you not sent my man to fetch me i cannot say how things might have concluded but that is not important you must tell me why you summoned me she shook her pretty head it is nothing she said and attempted a weak little smile my husband has gone away on business and neglected to inform me of where he visits and when he returns i grew worried and called upon you as the only person i have ever known who might be able to find him but now i see that i am foolish i have no reason to fear for him and certainly no reason to trouble you you have assured me several times that your husbands disappearance does not trouble you said mr lavien and yet you sent for captain saunders a man with whom youve had no contact for more than ten years mrs pearson spun and gave lavien a most terrible look i believe she had not seen the little man for he stood near the door and hadno doubt intentionallyobscured himself behind leonidas mr lavien ive indicated our conversations were finished she turned to me i would never have called upon you if i had known you were an associate of this gentleman we never met before tonight i assured her and though i owe him a debt if he is odious to you i shall remove him at once i did not know how i would do such a thing but i hoped he would not take too much offense at my offering to do so she forced a smile he is not odious merely persistent which can be rather tiresome lavien bowed i do not mean to be so but i serve a demanding master hamilton is your burden to bear not mine said mrs pearson and captain saunders you have obviously had a difficult night and would be much better served by going home and resting i am a silly woman to have begun this business and i hope you will forgive me i will forgive you i said as long as you are being perfectly direct she looked away of course i am then why asked mr lavien did you wonder if captain saunderss injuries were the result of your attempt to enlist his help i said no such thing she said to him it was true that she had not but she had certainly implied it it was clear however that she did not wish us to stay and that no amount of badgering was going to alter her opinion on the matter there would be time for further contact as though seeing my thoughts mrs pearson retreated a few steps i must ask you to leave captain saunders and not return very well i thought it wisest to agree as quickly as possible before promises were extracted the more said the less able i would be later to pretend to have misunderstood come mr lavien we need not belabor the point i held the door open for lavien and leonidas and turned back for one last look good night mrs pearson good night she said she caught her breath as if to say something more but stopped herself she blinked once and looked at me very directly and captain saunders it is good very good to see you again was it my imagination or was there something pleading in her tone in her looks i did not think she longed for me or my company but for something else to communicate something of import i had loved her father as though he were my own and he and i had been brought low together because of alexander hamilton i had loved her and perhaps still did and now she was married to another man those children in the house sleeping their quiet childish dreams were meant to be my children i could not have her or this life but if she were in danger i meant to resolve it and i pitied anyone who would stand in my way i was not like mr lavien capable of miraculous feats of martial prowess but i had my own methods my own tricks and i was eager to use them joan maycott autumn andrew and i married not immediately of course for there was all that courting to tend to which was interesting and emotionally rewarding enough that i did not wish to rush it particularly not when it produced such excellent notes in my journal all those sweet and awkward moments wanted describing the long talks the vibrancy of stolen moments in barns and kitchens and under a vast summer sky i enjoyed one marvelous first after another less enjoyable but perhaps equally novelistic was the tedious gatherings of our families full of forced conversation and compliments on cheeses and pastries the excellence of eggs or the sweetness of apples my mother delighted at the prospect that i should marry into such a family with so handsome a man snapped at me constantly to remove my nose from my books and cease my endless writing in my journal andrew however loved me for these things he admired my learning and my ambition my mother said i was being foolish for americansand particularly american girlsdo not write novels why andrew asked her should his joan not be the first this was a new beginning for a new country and there was no reason i could not be the foremost woman of letters in the new republic at first i worried that i had somehow tricked andrew into offering to marry me that i had been too forward with him that i had confused his emotions time however soothed these fears he would greet me always with a decorative carving or a piece of jewelry he had made for me a bouquet of flowers or even on occasion a new ribbon with which to trim a hat at family gatherings he would contrive some means to secrete me alone if only for a minute to steal a kiss full of passion and desire and a yearning to have me to himself to take from me all i would yield when we parted i saw the yearning in his eyes and i felt it too i had begun my dealings with andrew as a kind of girlish experiment but it had changed truly changed into womanly love we spent two years in courtship attending family gatherings dinners and dances in town once he was able to make do without the cane though he continued to limp in damp weather or when much put upon concerns of money wanted sorting but his parents did not insist upon a dowry that my family could not afford for they saw his affection for me and were content that their boy who had seen so much horror in the war should enjoy a portion of happiness andrew was the third of three sons and so was not to inherit his familys farm this fact caused him some sadness for he loved to work the land he had spent little time in cities but what he knew of them he did not like yet i for my part had always longed for city life though i knew it only from novels and it was my firm opinion that we should move to new york prejudices from the war when new york was the british capital colored andrews opinion and he at first resisted but he had never been an unreasonable man we were only six weeks married when we arrived in new york city where andrew hoped to set himself up as a carpentera trade he knew well from the farm and which he had honed during the war building bunkers and fortifications and redoubts and then once he had studied under more capable men furnishings for officers tents our plans met with trouble almost from the first we had less money than would have been ideal for such a venture and we could not afford to live in any of the charming old dutch homes off the broad way instead we rented a house between the collect pond and pecks slip this was lowlying land inhabited by immigrants and the desperate the streets were muddy often choked with dead dogs and cats the horses did not last long before they were stripped of their hide and flesh and hooves sometimes when it was dry piles of bones could be found stacked alongside the decaying wooden houses when it was wet the streets were thick rivers of slowmoving mud that flooded our house it was a poor place for a carpentry shop but we could pay for no better we had however our own house and our privacy and though we could afford only the scrawniest of chickens and the thinnest of cheeses we made do happy to be alone and together new york had suffered under the occupation and remaining everywhere were signs of careless treatment of a place that was never to the british more than a campground and a plaything much of the city had been burned and even now some buildings were but charred beams others had been left in terrible conditions of decay and the peopleso many of whom had sided with the britishwere now reduced to penury those royalists who had not fled wandered the city as though dazed unable to believe they had bet upon the wrong horse and lost everything yet for all that new york was a city on the rise though the dominant argument in the air was whether or not the new constitution would receive ratification by the states many new yorkers were so convinced that they were to be the center of a new imperial experiment that they had already come to think of their city as the empire city their state as the empire state everywhere decayed streets metamorphosed into rows of charming brick houses with tiled roofs great boulevards of shoppingwall street the broad way and greenwich street became almost daily more refined in the distance to the north were quaint villages and farmland and beyond that sublime outcroppings of mountain and forest we walked the cobbled streets of the new imperial capital the rivers filled with forests of merchantship masts yet we were surrounded by the untouched sublimity of nature there could be nothing more american though i lived in this city of commerce i continued to have trouble writing my novel principally because i still did not know what i wished to say i sat when i could find the time with my books on finance postlethwayts universal dictionary of trade and commerce thomas mortimers every man his own broker smiths wealth of nations and a thousand bonedry pamphlets arguing on all matters from free trade to taxes to tariffs to pricing somewhere in all that reading i was certain was a novel though women were not welcome on a few occasions i made my way to the merchants coffeehouse on wall street where commodities bank issues and government loans were traded in a kind of organized frenzy men shouted out prices while others attempted to buy to advantage or sell before the price further declined here i thought was something else uniquely american in england jobbers traded their issues in london in france they traded in paris but in america we traded in boston new york philadelphia baltimore and charleston what effect did a decentralized market have upon prices and upon a traders ability to profit it seemed to me even then that an unscrupulous jobber with a few fast riders in his employ could exploit the system and profit handsomely this too seemed to me fundamentally american for we were a land where cleverness and ingenuity bled quickly into chicanery and fraud how easily i thought in an untamed land did the steady energy of ambition become the twitchy mania of greed t hat we had no child also lay heavily upon me i became pregnant three times in the five years we lived in new york but always i miscarried before the fourth month the surgeons and midwives gave me all manner of medicines but none served as the years passed i began to grow despondent for no want of effort i could produce neither book nor child i wish to make it clear that andrew was perfectly capable as a carpenter and equally so as a man of business he was thrifty and hardworking skillful and exacting and could we have afforded to establish ourselves upon a better street i have no doubt he would have risen to prominence but we were trapped in the horrible cycle of poverty made inevitable by our neighborhood andrew offered his services cheap and we had business enough but once we were done paying our rents and our bills there was little left some months we earned less than we spent and after years of trying to make the carpentry business pay andrew began to wonder if it would not be better if we gave it up and attempted something new though what this would be neither of us could yet say like many soldiers andrew found that after his service the continental government had no funds with which to pay him but he had long held on to his promissory notes rather than as had many others sell them to speculators at a fraction of their face value then late in andrew came home one evening in a thoughtful mood after a spare meal he told me he had something of great importance to discuss he had met a man named william duer an influential merchant in the city and an associate of alexander hamilton who was rumored to be the new treasury secretary when general washington took office as the first president in april no one knew what future if any there might be for war debt held by the various states some said the federal government planned to assume these obligations and pay all promissory notes other said it would declare the debt void with magisterial apologies and soldiers like my husband would be forced to accept that they would never receive their due there was no way to tell this duer had said but there were men who were willing to hazard the risk they had acquired land inexpensively in western pennsylvania near the forks of the ohio and they were willing to trade this acreage for war debt assuming the risk of its future payment i knew nothing promising or inviting of western pennsylvania but andrew had always regretted leaving farming behind so was this not our opportunity the western land duer claimed was wondrous fertile once we had been willing to put farming behind us but after years of struggling in the city perhaps what we required was something familiar i always believed andrew to be more innocent than i and said i wished to meet with this mr duer myself so the next day we had him in the sitting room such as it was on the second floor of our little house it rained outside and all the while i was in a fret that the first floor would flood while there was company there to witness it duer was a small man in build and stature in his forties well groomed with delicate features that made him look vaguely girlish but not effeminate he was too fussy for that like a squirrel worrying a nut his pale brown eyes darted rapidly but lingered on nothing for long andrew and i sat on a cushioned bench while mr duer sat in a finely crafted chairandrew had made it himselfacross from us sipping tea and smiling with a small mouth full of very small teeth with the cup in his hand he rocked slightly with what i supposed was enthusiasm or an excess of energy it is a considerable undertaking he said his voice was slightly highpitched slightly whiny it cracked upon long vowel sounds you must decide if you will move to western pennsylvania a land you have never visited and start anew the journey west is long and it is far from everything you know however it is also a marvelous opportunity for many people people who were never paid by the country they served to exchange their intangible notes for land of real value if the land has value and the notes do not why do you propose such a trade i asked he raised his teacup to andrew in salute i noticed the cuffs of his sleeves were unnaturally white this is a clever woman you have here clever and observant there are some smallminded men who regard a clever woman as a curse but i am not one of them i admire a clever woman prodigiously and i congratulate you upon her and yet you have not answered her question said andrew my own wife lady kitty is also such a woman and cousins you know with the wife of colonel hamilton you clearly have an excellent domestic arrangement i offered yes thank you most excellent now you see mr maycott western land is fertile but cheap because it is so plentiful there is far more land than there are people to settle upon it the land is cheap for me to buy but for those who wish to live to farm to have a life of plenty away from the city it is of real value for the land will grow nearly anything and livestock will thrive winters there are mild summers are long and pleasant without being oppressive and unwholesome as they can be here he handed andrew a pamphlet entitled an account of the lands of western pennsylvania which we discovered when we later read it described an agrarian paradise rows of corn and vegetables that grew almost without husbandry because the land was so easily worked families there had more free time than they did upon other farmlands and balls with fanciful homemade gowns and suits had become something of a passion it was a place of rural refinement unlike any other in the world for only in this new country where good land remained unclaimed could there be such independence and success the dream of the american republic might have been born in the east but it was reaching full flower in the west i shoulder the risk in this investment duer said should the new government decide to assume the war debt then i will profit if it chooses not towell the land was got cheaply and the loss will not do me great harm in any exchange of this sort each side makes a wager that he will be better off than he was before but a speculator must also look at the consequences of losing in my case i will be poorer for the loss but i must lose sometimes and i do not chance what i cannot bear to part with in your case if you hazard and losewhich is to say you do not like your new circumstancesyou have parted with paper notes perhaps worth some cash someday perhaps not on the other hand you will still have your lands your wealth in food and crops and your independence andrew wore a serious expression but i knew it belied his enthusiasm he would be imagining the farms of our youth a table on which a suckling pig steamed surrounded by bowls of cabbage and carrots and potatoes and warm bread all arising from the work of his own hands maybe the land would not be worth much to sell but that was now what of our children andrew believed the city air unhealthy we would have children in the country and they would inherit the land which as the nation moved west would increase in value i was not however so eager i am concerned about indians i said i have read more than one account of westerners set upon by them men killed children killed or abducted women forced to become indian brides it is a clever woman duer said to andrew who thinks of such things and she is well informed i see i congratulate you sir upon her excellence perhaps you should congratulate the lady directly andrew suggested duer smiled very politelyat andrew yes the savages were a menace during the war but that was owing to the influence of the british now the indians have been run offall but those whove embraced our savior just as their pagan brethren can be savage beyond imagination the ones who accept religion become like saints they live upon the most christian principles never raising their hands in violence all say they make better neighbors than the white men not that white men have excessive faults but the novelty of christianity inspires the indians to take its teaching to heart and to keep its doctrines foremost in their minds perhaps we could go look at the lands i said then we will let you know your excellent wife proposes an excellent idea duer said many prefer to do so i know of a group traveling out that way in two weeks it should take them no more than a month and a half to make the journey though it may take you some time more to return for you will need an eastwardheading party in the lands we speak of the indians have been quite quelled but in the wilderness between it is still safe only to travel in large groups andrew shook his head i cannot afford to keep my house and yet not work my shop i do not see how we can travel out there to inspect our property if we cannot see the land we cannot buy it i said i am sure you understand that absolutely if you cannot see the land then of course you cannot buy it mr duer began to collect his things and spout pleasantries about how if we needed anything of him we should not hesitate to call then he stopped himself in midsentence a thought occurs to me it is the very germ of an idea hold he held out one hand in a gesture directing us to halt while he collected this notion from the ether would it have some effect if you could speak to someone who has seen the landswho has lived upon them i cannot say for certain andrew said it should very much depend upon the person it should depend upon the person i agree and it would help to speak to such a man as it happens i know of a landowner who is in town this very week he said perhaps i could persuade him to take a few moments to answer your questions w e agreed it would be a worthwhile conversation to have and two days later he was back in our parlor this time accompanied by a roughlooking fellow called james reynolds he was perhaps no older than my andrew but his face was cracked and windbeaten and sunblasted across his right eye a scar stretched from his forehead down almost to his mouth half an inch wide a deep gulf of violence that had mysteriously left his twitching eye intact he wore homespun clothes of a rugged material but they were nicely tailored and by no means out of fashion indeed he carried himself with the rigid posture of a proud gentleman planter though his manner was a bit more coarse his teeth were sepia from a tobacco habit and he was inclined to wiping his nose with the back of his hand he sipped at his tea holding the whole cup with a strange caution as though he might forget himself and crush it like an empty eggshell so mr duer here wants me to tell you about libertytown his voice was thick as if his throat were coated in gravel libertytown andrew repeated reynolds smiled most of us served in some way or another during the war are you satisfied with your life there andrew asked you have to understand i wasnt born to money my mother was a seamstress and my father died young in libertytown i work my own land and i take orders from no one i grow more than i need trade some of the surplus to the other farmers and the rest we cart back east ive got a little bit put away now i didnt have that much debt to exchange not so much as you so ill never be rich off my land but ill tell you this i wont never be poor neither in your opinion it is every bit the paradise that mr duer describes he ran a hand through his hair which fell freely to his shoulders was unevenly cut and was very black but flecked with gray or perhaps ash i wonder he said to mr duer if you could give us a few scant minutes alone come sir duer protested there is nothing you can say that i may not hear surely we are all friends to be honest with one another only a moment if you please only a moment then duer stood offered us a bow and left the room in but a moment i could observe him out the window pacing upon the street he did not seem to me particularly uneasy but more like a man who had other things to do with his time and did not care for matters to run longer than he had expected with duer gone mr reynolds let out a sigh of relief like a man who has overdone himself at feasting and now unbuttons his trousers he set down his teacup and leaned forward slightly in his seat heres the truth of it duer there hes as straight as they come even so you have to understand he wants to exchange land for war debt thats his business and so he puts things in a particular color it is not paradise andrew said aint no paradise on this earth mr maycott nothing even close so dont believe those stories the winters aint as mild as he might suggest we get big snows just like everyone else summers can be hot and muggy and full of flying things that you sometimes think will drive you mad weve had problems with bears from time to time couple years back a friend of mine was mauled to death when his rifle misfired hitting the thing in the leg instead of the head do you regret exchanging your debt for the land i asked not for a moment he said it aint perfect but i aint never had a chance at anything better the land is wondrous fertile and the crops nearly grow themselves the societywell you couldnt ask for better folk he told you about the dancing i reckon he loves to talk about the balls theres all sorts of societies and clubs we get newspapers and pamphlets and bookswe get them late but we get them and the indians andrew asked he appeared amused at our silly question the bad ones been run off the good ones are like children to look at them they dont do nothing but work and pray you ask them to trade you one of your ears of corn for their six theyll take the trade and thank you for it to some folks the redskins are a bit unsettling but they dont never do harm do you feel that most people out there share your sentiments andrew asked theres always some that dont take to it theres some that never worked land before even easy land and they find they dont care for the labor or they come from philadelphia or boston or new york and find they dont like our simple houses and simple clothes there aint nothing in this world thats good for all folk and thats the truth but when someone wants to leave theres always been a neighbor whos done well and is willing to buy him out i thank you for your candor andrew said reynolds shook his head no more than i ought to do we aint that big a settlement mr maycott and we dont want people who dont want to be there but a patriot like you i can promise that youd find yourself most welcome and ill tell you another thing he said looking about our parlor his eyes falling to the shelves of books we could ill afford i see you got books so be sure to bring them youll get a better price in the west if youre looking to sell and if youre willing to lend you wont find no better way to make friends mr reynolds left mr duer returned and we talked more when we were alone we said nothing of it merely going back to our respective duties but the next morning i woke up with andrew holding my hand and studying my face in that way he did when his love felt fresh and new i understood then that all was decided andrew after struggling to keep his shop profitable could return to the independence of working the land i for my part had become convinced that this was the opportunity for which i had been waiting if i wished to write an american novel what better opportunity could i have than to experience a uniquely american way of life i would go the frontier live among settlers write of their ways of landclearing and farming of indians and traders and trappers of western folk who lived by their strength and wits and force of will i would write the novel that would define for years to come the very nature of its american form my enthusiasm grew so great that i could not have imagined the land would fall short of our expectations in any way yet i would soon enough learn we had been tricked into trading the hope of our future for nothing but ashes and sorrow ethan saunders the rain had mercifully abated and so the three of us strolled away from the pearson house with at least some comfort i did not know what to make of this strange experience how had mrs pearson learned i was in philadelphia why had she chosen to contact me and then sent me away once more did she truly think that upon seeing my injuries they were somehow linked to her husbands disappearance yes all these questions raced through my mind old habits the ones fleet had taught me die hard silently i made lists and checked fact against fact weighed theory against knowledge proposed notions and dismissed them almost as quickly yet while i did this one thought dominated cynthia pearson called for me she was in trouble and i was the one to whom she turned this filled me with hope and joy yet at the same time i found myself wracked with bouts of unspeakable melancholy i would have to wait until i was secure in my own rooms bottle of whiskey in hand before indulging my sadness while the stranger walked with me there was work to be done how long has mr pearson been missing i asked lavien perhaps a week he said his voice neutral even distant it was the voice of a man who wished to reveal nothing except perhaps his wish to reveal nothing why would she change her mind about wanting help leonidas wondered i dont know said lavien but i cannot believe her when she says she has dismissed her concerns as silly perhaps captain saunders i can call upon you tomorrow and you can tell me more of your impressions knowing mrs pearson far better than i you may have some useful insights but i believe we are all too tired to be very productive tonight of course i said not at all certain i would share anything with him i believed i liked him but i did not precisely trust him he knew or suspected far more than he was willing to share with me and i found it irksome that he expected my notions to be given gratis while his were tucked safely away i shall make my own way home he said it is but a short walk to third and cherry i thanked him again for the service he had rendered me earlier and so saying we parted ways leonidas and i meanwhile turned toward the river and my own lodgings at spruce and second what is your impression of him i asked leonidas his face assumed a series of lineseyes squinted lips pressedas it did when he grew thoughtful i dont know he is certainly competent when we came upon your trouble in the alley he immediatelyor i should say instantlybegan to set forth a strategy telling me what i must do and how i must do it and i had no difficulty doing precisely what he said such was the confidence and authority in his voice but that matter with dorlands thumb he is cold in a way that is almost unnatural a kind of stoic efficiency i said like a surgeon exactly leonidas said he knows his business ive no doubt but i dont think he is telling us everything its strange i would think hed want your assistance in finding mr pearson why should i wish him found i asked id rather he went to the devil it would be very pleasant if mrs pearson were to become a wealthy widow in search of an old love but i would not depend upon it you are ever a delight i said to leonidas we now found ourselves outside my boardinghouse so it was time for my man to take his leave my rooms were cramped and leonidas did not choose to lodge with me had i larger and more spacious rooms he still would not have chosen to lodge with me like many philadelphia slaves he had his own home which he rented with his own money i had in the past for reasons not entirely clear to me arrived at his door late at night knocking loudly calling out once crying like a child leonidas had responded quite soundly by changing his address and neglecting to inform me of where he now resided indeed all local taverners merchants peddlers and landlords knew not to inform me should i come asking this sense of independence was my own doing i won leonidas in a long and vicious card game not five or six months after my ignominious departure from the army i was living in boston at the time and his owner was as compassionate and caring as a slave owner might be prior to his purchase and therefore through no fault of his owners leonidas had been separated from his parents when he was little more than an infant and had no recollection of them his boston owner had seen to his education and when he came into my hands he was eleven clever and already large for his age i thought it best to continue his education and until he concluded his studies at sixteen i always found the means to pay for his tuition at a negro school even if i could pay for little else the young leonidas had been inclined to dark moods and i could not blame him even then he expressed with hot eloquence his hatred of slavery so i agreed to free him in ten years time when he turned twentyone that milestone had come and gone the previous summer and though leonidas had been so good as to remind me of my promise i was reluctant to let him go i had been prepared to do so when events conspired against me and i had to make a hasty retreat from baltimore then i had to establish myself in a new city and i hated the idea that i must be made to do it alone once we reached my boardinghouse i sent leonidas home and knocked upon the door my landlady had never seen fit to trust me with the key yet she was always majestically resentful when i awoke her upon returning there is no reconciling with some people and i was admittedly disinclined to reconcile myself to this one she did not care for me much though i did not know if it was because of my general habits or because i did not pay rent or that during my latenight returns to her house i would sometimes behave unquietly once while too full of drink i had reached out and pinched her nipple it was now nearly midnight so i was surprised that my knock was answered so rapidly my landlady mrs deishera stout german thingwas in the habit of answering my late knocks with a taciturn scowl clad only in her dressing gown tonight she was fully dressed and though she opened the door she did not stand aside to let me in indeed she blocked me holding a candle her hand trembling slightly we must speak mr saunders she said in her heavy accent captain saunders i told her must i always remind you do you not value patriotic service or do you perhaps mourn for some hessian officer i am sorry to say to you this but here there is a difficulty with your rent my rent there was always a difficulty with my rent perhaps because i was so very undisciplined about paying it then we shall discuss it in the morning but i must now sleep she grunted she winced she shook her head you owe me for three months and i must have payment what nonsense over a mere ten dollars i have ever been good with words good with the gentle art of persuasion but i rarely could summon the will to speak to this creature with a smooth tongue instead i took a step forward and gave her my most charming smile mrs deisher we have ever been friends have we not never wait for an answer to such a question we have ever been on excellent terms i have always been your admirer you know that do you not mrs deisher have you the money she asked a mere ten dollars of course i have the money i shall have it for you tomorrow next week at the latest but not only for this month sir you owe for the past months you must pay thirty dollars to clear the account my mind had only been half engaged in this conversation for it was a dance we had danced before and we knew each others moves as well as old lovers instead i had been turning over thoughts of mrs pearson and to a lesser extent lavien while i absently charmed my way into my unpaid rooms the demand for thirty dollars arrested my attention however thirty dollars i said mrs deisher is this the time to speak of such things in the cold darkness when as you can see from my face i have suffered great injury tonight she shifted her squat weight and squared her squat shoulders i must have money now there is a young man with wife a baby who can take your room in the morning you will pay me or you will go if you dont do either i will summon the watch are you trying to ruin me i demanded my irritation caused me to forget if only for a moment the value of good manners can this not wait until morning can you not look at me and see i have had the very devil of a damnable night her face settled into hard woflishness do not use such language i dont love it tell me only have you money now she asked the question through trembling lips it is clear that there is more to this than meets the eye what is this about has someone paid you to cast me out it was dorland wasnt it have you the money now she repeated but with less selfrighteousness i had hit upon something and thought to test my theory so i said yes i do i shall pay you and then i shall go to sleep too late she shrieked it is too late you have used me ill and i do not want you no more you must pay me and go this was dorland it had to be and yet i did not quite believe it it was not that he was above such mean tricks just that i did not think he had the wit to conceive of them if you are going to cast me out you can hardly expect me to pay you i observed youll not get a penny then you get out you do it or ill call the watch by itself the watch was nothing to me but i feared public knowledge of my eviction should word spread that i had lost my rooms my creditors would descend upon me like starved lions on a wounded lamb i could not disappear into the airless bog of debtors prison just when cynthia pearson had reappeared in my life it was not the first time id been cast out of a lodging nor the first in the middle of the night i had done what i could and would not humiliate myself by prolonging the argument very well i shall collect some things and i shall quit your miserable house be so kind as to pack what i do not take now and keep your fingers off what does not belong to you i keep your things as surety and if you try to get them ill call the watch the watch shed seen it in my eyes sensed my fear with her low animal cunning and now she held forth the word like a talisman i call the watch and they take you away forever forever seemed a bit extreme even for a flight of fancy but i did not dash her dreams i was too angry and she must have seen that too in my eyes for she took a frightened step backward in response i offered her a very stiff bow and set out once more into the rain i t is a sad thing for a man to realize that once he has lost his home he has nowhere to go my life in philadelphia brief of tenure was such that i knew many men but had no friends i dared approach this late at night to request shelter i could not go to any of the ladies who were generally kind to me even the unmarried ones for if i were to appear in my current sodden beaten and hatless state i believe the spell i had once cast might dissipate as for leonidas i would this one time violate his desire for privacy and throw myself on his mercy if only i knew where he lived as if in accompaniment to my bad humor the rain had begun once more with the cold numbing my fingers my boots nearly soaked though with melted snow and mud i trudged back to helltown and the lion and bell i asked owen to let me have a room and to put it upon my account which was now ironically in excellent order if not precisely warm owen was at least agreeable recognizing that in what i had believed to be my dying moments i had deceived my way into doing him a good turn surely this act of kindness undid my early misrepresentations he would not allow me a private room but sent me to a mattress of sack and straw on a floor in a room full of drunk farting belching men who smelled as though they had never seen the inside of a washtub i was one of these creatures and i fell asleep regretting that dorland had not killed me after all m orning came as it insists upon doing and my head ached from drink and violence my ribs were purple and inflamed my ankle was swollen as well i hadnt noticed it the night before but i must have given it at least a minor twist during my adventures with dorland i had no time to nurse my wounds however for i had money to earn and how does a man such as myself fill his purse in a pinch unfortunately the secret involves a clean and handsome appearance even were my face not in its current contused state i would still need to bathe and gain access to better clothes now held hostage by my ogre of a landlady were i in possession however i should proceed with the confidence of one pleasing to the female eye i am told it is so i am tall and manly in stature and i know how to direct a tailor to shape clothes to advantage my hair remains thick and dark brown in color and i continue to wear it in the rugged queue style of the revolution once i am properly appointed it is off to a public place perhaps a park or a walk or skating pond where i find a group of promising women preferably a gathering in which all or most wear wedding bands it is far easier and less vexing to my sense of propriety to convince a married woman to compromise morals in which she no longer believes than an unmarried woman to abandon a purity to which she yet aspires so i fall in with a set of ladies conducting myself as though i already know them so that each will presume that she has met me and ought to recollect me orfar worsethat she alone has been omitted from the frolics where the others first had the pleasure of my company once at ease with these ladiesperhaps walking arm in arm with two of them for a time to introduce them to comforts of physical proximitytalking with them flattering them bringing them to unseemly convulsions of laughter i begin to drop hints of my past i make allusions to my time as a spy though i never use the word because of its ungentlemanly connotations serving general washington risking life and freedom behind enemy lines there is always at least one lady who expresses a wish to hear more and though i plead reluctance to dwell on those dark days i can in the end be convinced to speakbut pray not in public no it is a hard thing to talk of here in the daylight in so beautiful a place perhaps a quiet chocolate house just the two of us no your home yes that is much better we may speak there without a spectacle being made of my pain from here it is a simple thing a story or two of danger of friends lost of torment in enemy camps a bit of a choke in my voice a sympathetic caress of the hand that is what i would do were all means open to me the thirty dollars i needed to retrieve my goods were nothing and would be mine by the end of the afternoon should i put my mind to it without my good clothes and with a bruised face and smelling like a dead dog in an outhouse i had no such options i sat in owens tavern enjoying a breakfast of stale bread dipped in whiskey followed by a refreshing draught from the mug i could not mistake owens gaze nor the distance granted to me by the other morning patrons in a state of agitation i took a piece of thick twine id discovered in my pocket and rolled it over my bunched fingers unrolled it and proceeded again while owen stared at me what is it i demanded is it my twine do not think to take from me my twine i dont want your twine a man ought not to be without his twine i told him forget the twine you look like bloody death he said to me i but need to clean up a bit and to do that i will needoh what is it ah yes a bit of cash what say you owen to lending me thirty dollars get out he said i decided it was time to move on i took leave of the good barkeep retrieving from the insensible head of one of his inebriated customers a hat of indifferent quality even after a quick reshaping and delousing it sat poorly upon me yet a man cannot endure to be hatless dorland would be out with his business this being tuesday his wife would be hosting her weekly luncheon a salon with ladies of her acquaintance i had never observed the ritual myself but she had spoken of it while we lay together and i would pretend to find it interesting on the way i grew thirsty from the days cold and i wished to make certain my credit had not been harmed by rumors of eviction so i stopped to quench my thirst and test my luck three whiskeys a mug of ale and a less than fortuitous game of dice my wager on credit later i concluded that my reputation was in good health and so resumed my mission at dorlands house i pulled the bell and the servant who answered regarded me with considerable disdain now i am not an unreasonable man i knew i appeared poorly but i firmly believe that servants ought to regard every gentleman as though he were perfectly appointed i suppose i could be a vagabond but i could also be a wealthy gentleman just come from a carriage mishap it was not for him to judge i should like very much to see mrs dorland i said i am captain ethan saunders though i do not have a card upon me no matter the lady knows me the fellow quite old with a face cracked like dried tar stared at me sir what do you mean sir what have i said that requires clarification there is no call for sir have you no manners no respect sir i am sorry sir but im afraid i cannot understand you sir your words are running together somewhat he licked his lips thoughtfully as though working hard to determine how best to render his thoughts into speech from drink perhaps i had no time to bother with servants who cannot comprehend spoken english so i pushed my way past him he was old and frail and it required no great effort though i could not have guessed how easily he would be knocked to the floor many times before i had been in the house so i made my way to the sitting room where i believed i should find the lady and there she was she and seven or eight friends sat about in handsome little chairs displaying themselves to one another dressed in a stunning array of blues and yellows and pinks looking like a sampling of exotic birds like french royalty they sipped coffee nibbled upon dainties and discussed i know not what i know not because they ceased discussing when i made my entrance a bit too abruptly i admit i lost my footing as i pushed open the door tripping upon the rug stumbling forward catching myself on the sideboard and finally bouncing a bit righting myself only by grabbing hold of a portrait upon the wall this came off having been hung improperly it fell to the floor where i believe the frame may have cracked i however remained aright the ladies stared at me their coffee cups suspended in an eerie tableau of fashionable life finally mrs dorland spoke captain saunders lord why are you here note she did not ask what had happened here i was looking as though id clawed my way out of my own grave and yet she did not come running hug me caress my injuries ask me how she might be of service could she get me anything could she put me to bed could she call a surgeon no she wanted to know why i would interrupt her gathering susan my dear i have been laid low by unfortunate circumstances i gesticulated like a stage performer and knocked over a vase though i have excellent reflexes and so caught it and returned it to its place i am afraid susan i am in a bit of a difficult situation i should be most grateful susan if you might offer me some assistance she gazed upon me with disgust i wish it were not so but there is no other word why do you look at me so susan have we not been friends has not our friendship brought me this state will you not help me for what has been between us then she spoke four of the most withering words i have ever heard my name is sarah i clapped a hand to my forehead of course sarah it is what i meant sarah things have grown a bit difficult for me a few dollars would help me smooth over my troubles you have always been a generous woman i have need of your generosity now i looked at her my eyes wide and moist masculine but also childlike in their raw naked need but it was all for naught she only turned away in horror it began to occur to me that visiting the lady while she had guests was not a sound idea it may in fact have been a poor one i had hoped to charm her and her friends i had hoped to have many women offering up coin and sympathy but i now saw that i had only embarrassed mrs dorland and she wanted nothing more than that i should leave her be and not only that lady the others looked away as well one held her head down with her hand raised so that i could see nothing of her face only her mass of coppercolored hair it was a distinctive color and i began to think at once that i knew it i took a step closer and stooped a bit to get a look upon the shaded face why its louisa chase i cried lovely mrs chase i know i can rely upon you for a few dollars it shall not be missed by so magnanimous a creature as yourself louisa chase did not raise her eyes she and i had enjoyed some lovely afternoons together some months before i had no notion that she and mrs dorland were friends i had the notion now and i saw that things had turned out very very badly i beg you leave said mrs dorland i want only fifty dollars i said that is all a mere fifty it shall not be lost to you come good woman a pittance for a patriot a soldier of the revolution a man upon whose back the republic was built her eyes had reddened considerably as i spoke and now tears were flowing freely down her cheeks get out she said i hate you knowing when i am unwelcome i took my exit no better than when i had arrived but surely no worse and i chose to count that a kind of triumph s ince the previous night id given a great deal of thought to what had happened with mrs pearson she had summoned me taking the trouble to travel to my roomswhich meant she must have made an effort to discover where i lived i had been in philadelphia only a few months and had never been upon the social scene i did not believe we had acquaintance in common unless some ladies i had known were friends of hers even so i never took such companions to my own rooms nevertheless she had found me and when i obeyed the summons she sent me away she had lied and done so quite badly she had wanted me to come but once there she had an even more pressing reason for sending me away now as i walked along spruce street i contemplated the possible reasons for her behavior the first was that circumstances had changed either she had obtained intelligence of her husband or had reason to believe he and her family were safe the second was that her disposition had changed she had either concluded or been convinced that whatever her concerns they did not justify renewing an association with a man she once intended to marry but whose companionship was not now appropriate the third and the one that had me moving in the direction of her home was that she had been forced somehow against her will to tell me that she wished me to leave a threat against her husband herself or perhaps even her children it was that possibility that and my desire to look upon her face in daylight and perhaps even a desperate knowledge that i had nowhere else to go and nothing else to do which brought me once more to the pearson house in the light of day it seemed even more luxurious and stately though the leafless branches and empty gardens gave it a forlorn appearance dignified but terribly lonely i knocked upon the door and was addressed almost at once by the same footman with whom i had dealt the previous night he appeared neater and better rested but i supposed i did not look better for the time that had passed my injuries developed into bruises and while i might be certain that the light of day would only elevate mrs pearsons loveliness i knew it served to make my own appearance even more dreadfulbeaten rumpled and tattered given that my clothes bore the odors of my recent adventures i must have seemed no better than a vagabond a pitiful unfortunate and though this footman and i had locked horns not a day earlier he at first had no notion of who i was beggars are dealt with at the servants entrance he intoned and im sure they are grateful i answered i however am captain ethan saunders and would like to speak with mrs pearson he studied me again attempting to contain the disgust so visible upon his face yet the typical sneering so common among footmen when confronted with those beneath their masters station was not evident indeed he took a step forward and spoke in a low if sympathetic voice sir i believe the lady herself asked you to go and not return she did but i doubt she meant it please tell her i am here she will not see you but youll tell her he nodded but did not invite me in instead he closed the door and i remained upon the front porch cold in my insufficient coat light snow fell upon me and i watched as gentlemen and ladies traveled along spruce glancing up at my vigil with dismay in a moment the man returned his expression neutral mrs pearson will not see you i could not argue this point with him if i was refused nothing i could say would alter his mind and unless i was prepared to force my way inside which i was not that would be the end of it you seem like an honest man i said is there something you would tell me he opened his mouth as if to speak but then shook his head no you must go very well but if you this little speech was interrupted for he reached out and pushed against my coat i said go he cried rather more loudly than necessary leave and return no more i turned away slouching in a performance of shame feeling the stares of passersby upon me on the surface i should have been dispirited by these events which might now appear as one more disappointment and humiliation in a string of such since the previous night that was on the surface look beneath and you may find several things that surprise you such as a footman with more cleverness and dexterity than that for which perhaps you gave him credit you may also find a piece of paper cleverly secreted inside the coat of captain ethan saunders a piece of paper from the lovely and oncebeloved cynthia pearson though i may have been eager to tear open this piece of paper i knew better than to do so if the footman had taken the trouble to disguise the delivery of the note it suggested he believed the house was under scrutiny the streets were populous enough that there might have been someone following me at that very moment i knew i had to read the note at once but i had to find a way to do so without betraying its existence i crossed the street and turned to look at the house on the second floor a curtain was parted and there stood the lovely mrs pearson her children by her side looking out at me our eyes met and she did not look away we looked upon one another for half a minute perhaps longer and in that time i saw her as the woman i had loved fully and entirely and i saw in her too her fathers face proud and wise then the curtain closed eclipsing an expression unspeakably sad she had her fathers bearing and dignity and earnestness and it was for his sake as well as hers that i would do what i must he had been the most resourceful and clever man id ever known i cannot say what would have become of me if it hadnt been for fleet for good or ill hed made me what i was id grown up in westchester new york the son of a successful tavern keeper who died five years before the declaration my mothers second husband was of a staunchly royalist bent and politics proved a useful means of separating me forever from my inheritance i had graduated from the college of new jersey at princeton and once the war began my education was sufficient reason to grant me the rank of lieutenant when i enlisted in the cause yale and harvard men generally became captains i made a poor officer however and often incurred the anger of my superiors for disorderly behaviorand once for slipping behind the lines to occupied new york to learn if a favorite whore had survived the famous fire that nearly destroyed the city it was suggested to me by the captain of my regiment that it might be in everyones best interest if i simply ran away from the service but i had enlisted and no amount of regimental displeasure would make me break my word then one afternoon when we were encamped on harlem heights captain richard fleet came to see me tall and slender whitehaired serious yet with an unmistakable look of mischief in his eyes he was unlike anyone i had ever known he was one of those men whom others instantly like and as determined as i was not to fall under his spell it took no more than a quarter of an hour before i thought of him as a trusted friend we sat in a tent while he poured us wine and said he had heard i found some difficulty in settling into the life of a soldier but general washington needed men with skills such as i possessed what skills were they i wished to know why i was told my ability to lie and smoke out a liar my ability to slip across enemy lines and then back across our own all without detection my ability to ingratiate myself with women with strangers with men who thought only a moment before they found me most detestable in short i was a man like fleet himself and general washington wanted me he wished to make me the son of a westchester landowner into a spy i was young and brash and proud of my honor and was not eager to adopt a way of life scorned by gentlemen as disreputable but fleet was persuasive he convinced me that i could not be but who i was so i might as well be that in the service of my country yes he said spies have long been despised by gentlemen but was this war not proof that the world was changing and who could not say that in its aftermath spies would not be embraced as heroes the first step he said was for us to see ourselves as such it was all as he had said we became heroes up until the time we were disgraced up until the time hamilton had broadcast that disgrace that man had ruined my life and essentially killed fleet and now here was fleets daughter afraid and desperate i felt the note that had been slipped to me and swore an oath to myself too primal too raw to find form in words i walked north to walnut street and turned west moving through increasingly thick crowds of people men of business men of trade women about their household duties and less savory business as well carts moved this way and that hardly knowing how to get past one another and the pedestrians and the animals that crowded the street in such chaos i might perhaps have risked taking out my letter and reading it but i did not do so i dared not look back to demonstrate that i searched for someone upon my trail but i felt him there once i reached fifth street i turned north and walked quickly up the stairs and through the front door of the library company building directly across from the statehouse it was a new building envisioned by an amateur architect who had won a design contest and it was a glorious thing to behold the massive redbrick structure boasted two stories columns and above the front door a statue of the late benjamin franklin the librarys founder in classical garb inside all was marble and winding staircase and books books upon books upon books lined the walls for the library company though a private organization had become the official library of the congress and so considered it its business to acquire virtually everything once through the doors i was struck by its stately appearance in the lobby a half dozen or so men all of whom were finely dressed turned to look at my unpleasant intrusion upon their cerebral seclusion i had not long and i hoped it was not a lengthy message or i should run out of time i turned to the gentlemen staring and said yes i know i am too unseemly to be here i do not wish to stay give me but one minute so saying i took from my pocket the note and broke the stillsoft wax seal inside in a hasty hand i found the following captain saunders i am sorry to have sent you away last night but i had no choice my house and my person are watched which is why i could not see you it has not long been so and i can only wish you had responded to one of my earlier notes but there is no helping that now the die is cast you must not come again or attempt to contact me i do not know who they are or what they are or what they want but they are very dangerous my husband is missing and i believe in danger and that danger may extend to me and my children i wish i could tell you more but i know nothing other than that it has something to do with hamilton and his bank i beg of you to help me find my husband and discover the danger to which he has exposed himself and his family i have no right to ask this of you but i know of no one else and if i did i would still want you for i know of no one better for the sake of the memory of my father please help me yours c cynthia pearson nothing could have been more shocking jacob pearson missing and mrs pearson herself in danger her house watched a connection to hamilton and the bank of the united states most troubling of all however was the fact that she had sent me notes previously i had not received any which meant someone had intercepted them i could not contact her again that much was clear for i would not expose her to more danger not for the world and yet i must help her i knew not how to do it but i must i crossed fifth until i reached the grounds behind the pennsylvania statehouse across walnut street from the jail and perhaps more ominous for me the debtors prison the statehouse offered handsome gardens full of trees even if they were devoid of life in the heart of winter with no better thing to do i brushed snow off one of the benches and sat alone in the growing gloom the cold jabbing its sharp needles into the armor of my tattered clothes and the dimming warmth of drink the park was near empty but not entirely here there was a small group of boys playing with a lopsided leather ball that made an unappealing wet noise whenever it struck the ground there an old man watched his trio of dogs folic closer to the statehouse only yards away from the courtyard where this nation declared its liberty a young man attempted to obtain the liberty of a young ladys petticoats behind me on walnut street a steady stream of pedestrians and carriages passed i was tired and despite the cold i thought i might fall asleep captain saunders a moment if you please sir i opened my eyes and saw before me a tall man with long reddish mustaches and a widebrimmed hat that sat high enough upon his crown to reveal his apparent baldness he spoke with the thick brogue of an irishman and wasi guessed from the lines upon his faceperhaps fifty years of age but a rugged fifty he had the look of a man used to hard labor physically imposing but not menacing do i know you i asked we have not yet met answered the irishman but ive a feeling were to become excellent friends may i sit he gestured toward the bench i nodded and moved to give him more room but i was on my guard and already thinking through my options he removed the rest of the snow sat next to me and reached into his beaver coat i am told that you are a man who enjoys whiskey from the coat came a corked bottle which he handed to me it is the best produced upon the monongahela i pulled out the cork and sampled the contents it was indeed quite good it had a depth of flavors i had not known before in the drink a kind of sweetness i found surprising and pleasing it hit my empty gut hard though and a warm feeling built there to near hotness i bent over hard holding out the bottle so as not to spill it too strong for you lad the irishman asked i shook my head once id sat upright again tis a mite powerful but thats not it the stomach is a bit queer these days powerful or no i can see by your face that you enjoy it its good stuff quite unlike any ive had before i took another drink bending over only slightly this time now tell me who you are and what you know of me i am an admirer he said i have heard of your acts during the war my guard was up those who have heard of me are generally not admirers i for one do not believe the charges leveled against you i know the taint of falseness when i hear it and i know a patriot when i see one you see i fought in the war myself sir serving under colonel daniel morgan i was now interested you were at saratoga he grinned i was lad in the thick of it with morgans riflemen have no doubt of it i congratulate you then and i think as one soldier to another you perhaps can tell me what you wish of me i know you have come upon hard times i believe i can help you and how can you do that you require money i looked at the irishman he had a ready grin and the sort of face that most men would find easy to trust but i was on my guard you want to give me money for what you are concerned about mr pearson though i know he is no friend of yours mrs pearson may be another matter and perhaps for her sake you would search for her husband i want you to understand that he is in no danger none of them are we only wish for you to no longer trouble yourself with mr pearsons whereabouts if you do that you shall find many of your own difficulties will be gone they will vanish like smoke mr pearson is in no danger but it is vital that you not pursue him you convinced mrs pearson that i ought not to pursue him i said she understands what is at stake and what is at stake the future of republican virtue he said nothing less sir nothing less do you want to stand with the virtues of the revolution or do you submit to hamiltonian greed i am no hamiltonian i said not failing to note the significance of his name appearing in this conversation i thought as much he answered i can tell you little but there will have to be trust between us as we are both brothers of the revolution and patriots mrs pearson is concerned for her husband and perhaps even for her own safety you would need to convince me that her family is in no danger i promise you he is unharmed they are in no danger from us and yet you watch her threaten her never he said we would do no such thing and you have seen fit to have me cast from my own home he shook his head i have heard of that but again it is not our doing you have enemies unconnected to us captain saunders you would be better served cultivating friends think on it why should we harm mr pearson we do not seek to harm you only to aid you in your current embarrassment were we villains were we interested in doing violence to those who oppose us we could simply kill you im hard to kill i said he laughed no one is any harder to kill than anyone else and thats the truth i knew otherwise but saw no point in saying so not when i might offer a demonstration i took a deep drink of the whiskey and then doubled over once more coughing and gagging from the corner of my eye i could see the irishman looking away politely pretending to watch a pair of antic squirrels rather than listening to the prolonged sounds of my retching at last i sat up and wiped my mouth with the back of my hand and took another drink of whiskey this time i remained upright you see i said to him hard to kill he took from his pockets a piece of paper sealed with wax you need only trouble yourself with these matters no longer fifty dollars in notes to do nothing a good bargain i held out my hand and he gave me the paper which felt warm in my ungloved hand suppose i take the notes and continue to look for pearson you do not want to do that captain oh we are not people to cross i put the notes into my coat pocket why should i not i was not a person to cross either i do not fear you irishman and i believe you have erred significantly the lady is frightened for her husband and for her children and i believe she is frightened of you i shall find out who you are and what youve done with pearson and put an end to whatever you plan the irishman folded his hands together and a ghost of a smirk appeared under his orange whiskers he was very confident that one youll do all that will you have another drink lad vomit once more upon the ground thats what youre good for now and not much else you wont help your lady friend by pretending to be what you were before you became a ruin of a man now if youve no mind to behave sensibly agree to my terms or return to me my notes and what shall happen if i dont choose to he grinned again showing me a mouth full of even brown teeth look across the street upon the roof of the prison near the cupola there is a sharpshooter another of daniel morgans men so you know what that means youre in his sights and if i give the signal or if he thinks me in trouble youll be heading home tonight without your head if you had a home to go to i should say i looked over my shoulder and saw upon the prison roof the unmistakable flash of sunlight against metal i estimated the distance at near yards if the rifleman was good enough to have served with daniel morgan i doubted not he could make the shot only the day before i had surrendered i had regarded death as a thing of no consequence now i wished to live and i was fully alive these men whoever they were with their schemes and bribes and intrigues and efforts to buy my loyaltyand most insidiously their willingness to underestimate mehad awakened a slumbering dragon who would now unfurl to show his might i turned away from the prison building you think me an idiot irishman whoever you are whatever you do you crave secrecy that is why you do not wish me to seek out pearson go ahead signal your man that he must kill me over fifty dollars you see i do not move his face darkened youve made a mistake there are more of us than you suspect and we are in places you would not credit we are determined and we cannot be defeated then you will have to know triumph with fifty fewer dollars i rose from the bench and strode away alas for forms sake i could not watch what happened next though i heard it clear enough the irishman pushed to his feet and attempted to pursue me but he took only half a step before something suddenly jarred him shortened his step a moment of disorientation in which he could not account for all that happened and then his falling upon his face i heard the satisfying thump of aging irishman upon snowy earth it had been but a little thing to pretend to vomit while encircling my piece of twine around his ankles it would not keep him entangled for long but it would be enough i now looked back to see him force himself up and back to the bench that he might examine my little trick his hat had fallen off and i saw he was indeed hairless his skull like a tanned and leathery egg he dusted the snow off said hat and replaced it it did not afford him the dignity he had hoped i believe youre the one who has made the mistake irishman i said i fear neither pain nor death the only thing in the world i feared this morning was that i should not be able to find thirty dollars anywhere in this world i took out from my coat the gathering of notes and held it up i waved it at him i mocked him with it now i have twenty dollars to spare so get gone under cover of your sharpshooter i care not ill find pearson and then ill find you i actually did not get to the end of that sentence for at some point around ill find pearson a third party crashed into my back knocking me to the ground so that i struck my head once i was down the irishman cut himself free while his friend pulled the banknotes from my hand and the two men ran off leaving me down in the snow cold and despondent happy only that he had left me his very good bottle of whiskey joan maycott spring we were told that we must limit our belongings to necessities the roads they said were not serviceable for wagons or carts and all we needed would be provided for us once we arrived at libertytown we sold nearly everything taking a few clothes andrews tools and some favored items including some booksthough not so many as i would have liked we convened in philadelphia where we were to be guided by mr reynolds and two others who sat astride old horses tattered and slow with rheumy eyes and puffy red sores that jutted out through their hair like rocks at low tide there were mules to bear our packs and we traveled at their sluggish pace on dirt paths sometimes wide and clear sometimes little more than a hint of an opening in the forest sometimes so soft and marshy the animals had to be aided to keep from stumbling in the worst places logs had been set down to make the road passable on the steep paths through the alleghenies the beasts were often in danger of falling over entirely there were twenty of us excluding our guides reynolds wore somewhat rougher clothes than those in which we had first seen him these were undyed homespun and a widebrimmed straw hat that he kept pulled down low in our parlor reynolds had seemed a kind of rusticated country gentleman the sort of rude clay that the american experiment had molded into republican respectability now he was revealed as something far less amiable he showed no friendly familiarity toward us and acted as though he did not recall our previous meeting andrews efforts to converse with him were met with rude barks and at times i found him staring at me with cold predatory intensity the scar across his eye which i had taken as proof of his revolutionary duty now appeared to me more the mark of cain of the other two hendry was of some forty years slender of form highpitched of voice with a long nose narrow eyes thin lips and a face that appeared designed for spectacles though he did not wear them in attire reynolds cut the form of a hardened country farmer but hendry seemed a parody of a stageplay country rustic yet i was to learn that this was the true garb of the border man a raccoon hat and buckskin leggings and an upper garment called a hunting shirt a fringed tunic made of doeskin that came down to his thighs on some men these clothes would look manly even heroic on hendry with his foxlike face they looked absurd in new york or philadelphia he might have with different clothes passed for a poor scholar in the wilderness he looked to me nothing but a cunning low creature cruel and heartless and more foulsmelling than any other species of man like the majority of the tribe of the west he either did not approve or had not yet been made aware of the functions of the razor but his miserly face yielded only a scraggly outcropping of pale whiskers here and there clearly visible under this sparse growth was a most lamentable skin condition cursing him with a reddened and scabby appearance it must have caused him considerable discomfort for he scratched at himself almost incessantly sometimes with absent interest other times with the repetitive fury of a cat with an itchy ear the third of their number phineas was but a boy or what should have been called a boy in more civilized climesfifteen or sixteen by my reckoning with fair hair and sunburned skin and a narrow bladeshaped face he dressed in frontier clothes but his gaunt frame left him aswim in his hunting shirt which came down so low on him as to be almost a gown phineas took to me at once perhaps he saw me as a kind of mother or perhaps he merely noted that i looked at him with compassion he would often ride alongside me a portion of each day and if he did not speak he took some pleasure in the companionable silence at mealtimes he made certain that i enjoyed a superior portion and he often reserved the softest and most secure spot for me he looked at andrew with indifference but not hostility for phineas it was as though andrew did not exist of the settlers eleven were americans the rest were french andrew had learned serviceable french during the war and so was able to discover that these people had sailed all the way from paris lured by agents of william duer into settling the lands of western pennsylvania these french pilgrims gave us our first true cause to wonder about mr reynoldss veracity he had told us that all the inhabitants of libertytown were veterans who then were these frenchmen he had told us that crops they grew on their fertile lands had made them comfortable but whence came the money if there were no roads that could support cart or wagon how were the crops brought to market they could not be sent east without spoiling they could not be sent west for the spanish did not permit american traffic upon the mississippi for the first few days of our journey reynolds listened to our questions though he would not answer but only grunt or shrug or shake his head when we were a week or more out he began to exhibit signs that this reticence was for him the height of patience and manners when i asked him about the means of transporting goods he looked at andrew and spat does that bitch ever shut up andrew who had been walking alongside me only a few feet from reynoldss horse rose to his full height sir step down and say that to my face the boy phineas turned away but hendry let out a shrill laugh shockingly like a tiny dogs bark you aint challenging me maycott reynolds said you live and die as i please so keep your mouth shut and that goes twice for that woman of yours shes pretty enough but by god does she ever stop talking sir called out my husband in his most commanding voice i had no doubt that during the war such a tone would have made even the highestranked officer stop in his tracks but here it meant nothing as he called out hendry rode astride and kicked andrew hard in the back just below his neck he lurched forward and fell into the dirt hendry let out another burst of shrill laughter and a horse whinnied and then all fell silent the horses had stopped the mules held still the settlers milled in place i knelt by andrew making certain he was unharmed and heard nothing about me but the endless singing of birds once i had found it melodic but suddenly it became cacophonous the unnerving music of chaos the orchestra of hell andrew looked up at me his cheek bled from a cut of some three inches below his left eye but it was not deep and would heal well enough the wound to his pride was another thing i met his gaze and shook my head honor demanded that he not let this pass but i demanded he did he could not hope to defeat these men and even if he did then what we were at their mercy for another month or more of hard travel the luxuries of pride and reputation were no longer for us listen to me cried reynolds he held up his rifle by the barrel pointed to the sky like a brutal general rallying his barbarian troops in his rage the scar across his eye had turned as pink as the inside flesh of a strawberry this aint the east youve left the lands of manners and justice there aint no law here but force and while youre in this traveling party that law is mine if i choose to call your woman a whore then a whore she is until i say otherwise he unlocked the catch upon his rifles flintlock and pointed it at andrew then he swiveled around and pointed it at one of the french settlers i dont care who among you lives or dies he said it aint my trouble to care ill kill one of these frenchers to make my point unless youhere he glanced at andrewget on your feet and start walking and keep from looking at me for the next few days maybe until we get to pittsburgh so up with ye and keep your tongue still how can a man be made to endure such a humiliation i did not think andrew could have been made to bury his pride and his rage to save himself but he did it to save the stranger he pushed himself to his feet and keeping his eyes straight ahead he began to walk in so doing the entire procession began to move i put my arm about andrew but he did not respond i do not know that he could have made himself speak reynolds returned the catch on his rifle and lowered it hendry rode alongside us and laughed softly as though he recalled a joke from a long time past then he scratched at the rash under his beard next time you forget yourself maycott youll be sorry for it reynolds might like to kill frenchers but i think ill fuck your wife instead he did not wait for an answer but rode ahead leaving us to our silence and to watch phineas glower at hendry for the rest of the day t he weather at least was fair we made our trek in the first full bloom of spring and the sun wreathed with unthreatening wisps of cottony clouds was warm but not hot at night the cool was refreshing rather than uncomfortable and mosquitoes were not out in full abundance at times it rained but a little wetness did us no harm and it did not persist long enough to make the roads such as they were unbearably muddy far more distressing was the tense disposition of our guides who clutched their rifles perpetually keeping them taut and ready like the muscles of a crouching beast ceaselessly they scanned the tree line for signs of danger though they never spoke of what form it might takebears panthers indians one of the frenchmen attempted to inquire of hendry but he only told him to shut his frencher mouth one day followed another with blunting drudgery and though the memory of andrews conflict with the guides lingered the wound grew less hot reynolds or hendry would from time to time make some trivial comment to andrew perhaps to make him feel that all had been forgotten three weeks in we had begun to make camp for the night in a grassy clearing we sat huddled by a small fire that danced in a strong breeze and ate what the guides had hunted during the daya medley of rabbit squirrel and pigeonand a porridge made of cornmeal we rarely spoke to the other settlers and andrew and i who had so often passed countless days and night in easy conversation now spoke to each other with increasing infrequency while we ate i looked up and observed emerging from the trees an indian woman and a little girl the guides raised their weapons and i believe hendry would have shot them as they approached but reynolds stayed his hand he bared his teeth like an animal dont be an idiot he said and hendry lowered his weapon grinned a largely toothless grin and spat tobacco onto the dirt near a frenchman his wife and their little boy the indians approached tentatively the woman walked with a limp she wore a ruined dress of animal skins perhaps once quite pretty but now soiled and torn and as we found when she approached rank to the nose the girl not above ten or eleven wore a cotton shift formerly white now the color of all things unclean she had been the victim of a burn her face was scorched and she was missing her entire right eyebrow there being only a horrific red welt the woman might once have been a regal squaw but circumstances had brought her low her face was filthy smeared with mud and hardened i had no doubt by much violence for her lower lip was split as if by a fist it took little imagination to see that these poor wanderers had walked through chaos and might yet trail it behind them andrew must have felt it too because he took my hand and held it in a firm grip once the indians were no more than ten feet from our little camp the woman moved her hand to her mouth making signs of eating she had i observed lost several fingernails and a fresh cut on her thumb bled freely though we could have spared enough for a meal charity would no more occur to reynolds than would sprouting wings and taking to flight he waved his weapon at the poor creatures git on he said we cannot let them run off those unfortunates andrew said i felt my stomach lurch andrew was anxious to restore his honor if only in his own eyes and i knew he could not remain still while these refugees were sent away yet i knew full well that he could not challenge our guides on this matter there was nothing he might say to persuade them and he would only make them more determined to be cruel they know their business i said hoping for the best we know nothing of indians he would not be moved we know of human beings and these are in want he began to rise but before he could do so i pushed hard upon his shoulder forcing him down and rising myself andrew had no time to object before i was several paces away and had begun talking to reynolds perhaps we can be charitable and spare some food hendry laughed his unpleasant laugh the veins in his neck began to bulge i did not let my attention waver from reynolds it is the christian thing they aint christians said reynolds theyll repay your kindness with blood the boy phineas nodded his young head showed his teeth and made a triggerpulling gesture with his finger his stringy hair fell into his eyes and he did nothing to brush it aside even that burnt girlll kill us if she gets a chance reynolds said tis what they do how can you be certain they are not christianized i said both men laughed the way adults laugh at the whimsical wonderings of children phineas looked down as though the notion somehow embarrassed him the woman pointed at her neck and then made the eating gesture once more i saw now that she wore a necklace an elaborate and filigreed carving of bones in the shape of a beautiful starburst she said something which sounded not to me like the language of savages i realized only once andrew had cocked his head that she was speaking in a kind of broken french yet i required no translation to understand she will trade her jewelry for food i said i doubt she has anything else of value i think shes got sommit else hendry said sommit id trade for shut up said phineas surprising everyone what you dont want that nice jewelry he said to the boy shut up said phineas just shoot em thats all id rather wait till they do something i dont care for and then shoot em said hendry but i might take that pretty thing shes got round her neck surely i said you are not so base as to let her give up the only thing she has in the world for a few morselsnot when we can spare the food maycott reynolds shouted sit your woman down shes come off her leash again i would not give andrew a chance to respond for any response would almost certainly be incendiary they may be savages but we are christians we shall feed them and if you dont like it you may certainly shoot us andrew blanched and i knew what he feared that he would be humiliated once more and then be given no recourse to preserve his honor yet reynolds seemed untroubled by my speech he picked up a rabbit bone and stripped it of its boiled meat then after due consideration this solon of the west nodded his head his ruminations complete green idiots he pronounced let em stay then but tis on yer head i gestured for the two to sit we understood they were not to be given their own food and that andrew and i would have to give of our own portions some of the others did as well but many of the settlers steered clear not wanting to stand with us against reynolds the indians sat by our fire hunched over the food wed given them eyes darting about like wary animals they ate with their hands smearing dirt and blood on their food the woman was missing two fingers on her left hand and the wound looked recent and raw i had thought phineas a sensitive boy but he watched the two indians from the outskirts of camp hands on his gun never taking his eyes off them waiting for some menace that never manifested itself andrew tried to make conversation with them but the woman said nothing more and the child if she could speakour language or her ownnever showed a sign of it they ate their pigeonit was what he liked best so of course it was what andrew had volunteered to first giveand corn pudding and when they were done they moved some fifty feet from the rest of us curled up upon the ground and went to sleep without delay andrew said nothing to me of what i had done for the indiansand for himbut when we went to sleep he wrapped his arms about me i about him and we slept together as lovers in a way we had not since leaving for the west i awoke in the night to the sound of two gun reports in rapid succession it was distant but i knew the sound i sat and looked about me the fire burned and no one was disturbed i convinced myself that i had dreamed it but in the morning i knew better the indian woman and child were gone when i opened my eyes reynolds and hendry acted as though nothing had happened and offered no comment but hendry i saw wore the elaborate bone ornament around his own neck he leered at me evil delight in his narrow eyes the boy done it woke em up dragged em off and done it like reynolds told yer tis on yer head he walked away laughing as though it were the greatest joke in the world a ndrew and i chose not to speak of the incident instead i rode by phineas the suggestion that he might have shot those indians in cold blood terrified me but it fascinated me too what i wondered would drive a boy to so unspeakable a crime they say you hurt the visitors i said after a period of quiet i had already observed that in the west conversations often began with a respectful period of silence i aint going to speak of it you may speak of it to me i said hoping my face showed warmth i did not feel phineas said nothing for some time and i thought better than to repeat my inquiries yet he surprised me by finally breaking his silence perhaps an hour after i had first raised the subject in a flat and lifeless tone like an oracle whose mouth is but the instrument of a remote spirit he told me he had lived since the age of seven or eight in a settlement some twenty miles from pittsburgh the great metropolis of western pennsylvania as mr duer described it haint no philadelphia phineas told me but tis big biggest place i ever saw afore i come east maybe a full thousand people there he and his father traveled to pittsburgh five or six times a year and phineas had grown up knowing how to read the ground the leaves the sky he was a tracker as i saw every day we were on the road with him he tasted the earth and sniffed the air as much beast as human being as much indian as white man one day he traveled the road not only with his father but with his mother little brother and older sister as well both his mother and little brother were illfeverish and vomitingand were in need of a physician the only one in hundreds of miles was to be found in pittsburgh or so they thought but when they came to town they discovered that he had been killed three weeks earlier in an argument over the best way to dress a roast duck they had no money to remain in town not even for a single night and so with an ailing woman and child they returned to the woods to make their way back to their cabin they were not a mile and a half outside of pittsburgh however when they were set upon by a trio of indian braves it was late autumn but it had grown warm in what is called indian summer for it is the season when indians go on the warpath one last time before spring accordingly these men were near naked their heads shorn and shaved into savage designs their faces and bodies covered with demonic symbols that made them seem creatures of hell indeed they must have been for they paused hardly a moment before one slit phineass fathers throat that atrocity was hardly complete before a brave held phineass mother so she would be made to watch then another picked up her younger son by his foot twirled the toddler about over his head and dashed his skull into a tree only then did they do her the mercy of slitting her throat one brave grabbed phineas the other took hold of his sister each man clamping a hand over the mouth of his prisoner at this time phineas was but nine years of age his sister eleven they had witnessed the death of their parents and of their sibling and they were not permitted to cry out in grief and terror while one of the indians held his sister the other began to cut off her clothes with a fierce knife long and twisting and gleaming in the flicker of sunlight the one that held phineas entranced by this orgy of violence let slacken his grip upon his prey and phineas managed to stomp hard upon the braves moccasined foot it was too futile a blow to do serious damage to so strong a creature but it was sufficient to loosen his grip phineas was free and he fled into the woods leaving behind the bodies of his parents and his brother and consigning his sister into the hands of monsters where she most likely remains today presuming she was not burned alive as is sometimes the custom he made his way back to pittsburgh where he told his story and men ran out into the forest armed with guns and hatred of the indians the idea that indians might be human beings with souls capable of good as well as evil is disregarded as romantical rubbish every evil the white men have done the indians is forgotten but every crime against the white men by indians is branded into their souls these men hate indians with a passion hardly to be understood if not felt and no opportunity for taking an indians life must be neglected phineass story was the sort of thing that unleashed their most feral passions they muttered curses blaming not only the savages but also the men back east who would spare no money for the protection of the west they had no choice they said but to take matters into their own hands in the woods they found nothing not even the bodies but their blood was up and they could not let the incident pass instead of killing the fiends who had committed these crimes they marched back toward town with phineas in tow to a small cabin just outside the city full of christianized indiansseven in all including two small children of their own the indians did not resist they had no weapons to fight with but the men barricaded them inside their home and set it afire as the flames rose phineas could hear their voices rising in song calling upon the lord to carry them home phineas told me this story without inflection or emotion it was as empty and hollow as an old legend one from a strangers childhood without connection to his own experiences when he finished he turned away from me at first i thought it was shame but i soon decided it was something far more visceral the story had been like phlegm that lodges in the lungs it must be expectorated and once gone is thought of no more after a long silence i said did you kill those indians last night he did not look at me i aint never going to let an indian live if its in my powers to kill it i aim to be a great indian killer like lou wetzel you ever hear of him hes killed more indians than any man in the west is that truly what you wish i asked not knowing what else to say wishing dont signify tis what i am now you know what i done you wont be my friend no more but theres no helping it not now youll see though the west changes you it dont let you be a christian im what the west made me and youll be what it makes you it was now near the end of the days travel and soon he was occupied in the business of making camp i left the poor boy and made my way back to andrew who asked nothing of what phineas had told me and i told him nothing i told him nothing because i sat there lamenting the horror that was now our lives we had traded what little we had in exchange for a passage to hell and i could not end the question that repeated itself in my own mind what have i done i would not have andrew asking the question of himself as for phineas he was never again kind to me in truth he grew hostile even predatory he had regarded me before as a mother now he joined with the other men in gazing at my body with hungry interest he glared at me if i walked too slowly if i stumbled he pointed and laughed i grew fearful of him and kept my distance the men were fiends and i could hate them but his youth made phineass hardness far more frightening t en days later days filled with tension and fear but no further incidents we arrived in pittsburgh though only with the greatest of difficulty we could not simply stroll into town the way being made near impassable by great mountains of coal instead for the last few miles we were piled beasts and all upon a great flatboat that made its way down the monongahela propelled by burly men muscled and bearded mostly shirtless who thrust great poles into the riverbed to force the lumbering conveyance forward the landscape was both rugged and beautiful certainly sublime in its untamed majesty of undulating hills and thick forest the city itself was another matter even before our flatboat docked i could see that to call pittsburgh a town would be like giving the name of feast to a moldy crust and a sliver of hard cheese rind it was but a muddy clearing with the most uneven and haphazard log cabins all stained with coal dust there were no roads to speak of but mud passageways that were to the credit of the city founders arranged with a quaker regularity the people looked more savage than civilized the better sort wore rough homespun in cuts that were a mockery of fashions some five years past though i looked with relief upon even the most outdated satin petticoat or laced waistcoat otherwise it was naught but buckskins and hunting shirts for the men rough burlap gowns for the women the men were all bearded and rugged and a disproportionate number were missing an eye the women for their part were often misshapen and hunched with faces ravaged by weather hands clenched and arthritic like demonic claws it was the rare citizen who possessed even half his teeth and all the people like the buildings were black with coal dust we trudged through the muddy streets of pittsburgh looking at the ramshackle houses in stunned silence growing more filthy with each step this we knew was going to be our dream from now on this dirty muddy grid of rude shacks would come to seem to us as weeks turned into months and months to years as a glorious metropolis how long until this decrepitude came to seem like the glories of new york how long until we lulled ourselves to sleep with the fanciful notion of what we would do once we arrived in this city of delights duer had arranged for us to lodge separately with different residents of the city for the night in the morning we were to be led to our plots of land andrew and i were given a space on the floornaught but dirt packed hard and smoothof a miserable cabin somewhat larger than most others but cramped and cold and smelling like a tannery this room which seemed to me little better than a rangers tent was shared by a couple with three children and indeed a pair of pigs which wandered in and out of the house at their leisure it had a single room though there was a separate bed for adults and offspring they had rough furniture made from barrels and shipping crates and hewn logs and the meal that night was a stew of indian corn and potatoes cooked with a sour meat from their freshly slaughtered old milk cow only later did i learn that our hosts were one of the most prominent families in town the meal was served not with water or wine or tea but with liquor a kind of western rum of which i had never yet heard the husband the wifeeven the childrendrank it as though it were sweet nectar but i could hardly manage a swallow it tasted to me like poison set afire but andrew perhaps savoring the distraction of something novel and unthreatening sipped as though it were a prized claret how is it made he asked with what varieties how is it aged aged our host had asked yes said andrew who had some limited experience making wine in his youth like wine it is aged is it not our host laughed tis aged from the time we put it into the jug to when we drink it dont last that long around here you see there aint no money where would money come from aint no roads back east and the damn spanish wont let us use the river you want to buy something you buy it with whiskey you want to sell something you get whiskey for it this here is our money friend and aint no one can be bothered to turn money into prettier money theres nothing to be gained by doing so but there was something to be gained andrew saw itnot yet clearly but i believe an idea was already forming in his mind he now knew how the locals did their business and he already sensed there was opportunity for a man willing to do it a little differently he had never in his life made his own whiskey never even considered doing so he was nevertheless already mulling over in his mind the things he would do that would in the vicinity of the four counties elevate his name from obscurity ethan saunders evening descended and cherry street was full of middling people in their middling clothes going about their middling business exchanging with each other their very very middling sentiments they stepped with manic precision avoiding mud and filth and mounds of snow piles of manure clusters of animalschickens cows goats pigsbeing driven here and there by angrylooking minders waving their sticks they ignored the looming blackness of chimneys spewing soot they bustled and bumbled and bumped about returning home attending to their evening meals engaged in conversations so quotidian i could scarcely comprehend when shall i mend this pillow what thought you of that piece of ham no the other piece have you had a moment to speak to harry about the crate of salt cod i do not condemn these creatures for living their own little lives and discussing the things in them but the smallness of it pained me yes i was brought low but what of it had i not lived fully such a full life does not allow for the petty and trivial concerns of domesticity that was the palliative i applied when i thought of how fate had robbed me of cynthia all those years ago even then i understood that i would never have conversations with her about salt cod and pillows men who had lived as i had with dirt and blood and death were not made for the comforts of domestic quiet mixed in with the sooty air lingered the scent of hearth fires and stews and soups and roasting meats and i recalled that i had eaten nothing since breakfast here where cherry intersected with third street near the hebrew house of worship was where lavien had told me he made his home so it was here i looked for him i saw a pretty young jewess and thought that if i were in better form i should surely present my question to her but nowtattered and filthy and bruised wearing a poor and stolen hati feared i would frighten her instead i found an israelite peddler pushing his cart of rolls and asked him if he knew a man named lavien he directed me to a house in an alley half a block away with a bright red door and said in heavily accented english that i might find him within i knocked at this narrow twostory house and a servant at once appeared she was aged and unappealing with that distinctive and unpleasant oldperson smell and yet she sat in judgment of me go on she said with a wave of the hand we have nothing for you how can you know what you have for me when you know not who i am i asked get gone you with your fancy talk we have given to beggars enough today all at once a woman appeared behind her and she was like the sun rising against the black sky this was a very pretty hebrew with a wide round face large black eyes and arched eyebrows i beg your pardon madam i said directing myself to this new and infinitely more pleasurable creature but i am an associate of mr lavien and i must speak with him hes a beggar missus the servant said and drunk by his smell here was a woman whom clearly no one had ever married and i could not blame mankind for not asking for her withered and meanspirited hand for shame old prune to speak to me so the wife however demonstrated her superior perception hes no beggar but something else then to me you know my husband i do madam and i apologize for my appearance but things have gone hard for me this last day a story with which your husband is familiar in part show him in she said to the servant ill fetch mr lavien the house was narrowas was common for in philadelphia houses are taxed according to their breadthbut it was also quite deep the crone led me through a wellappointed hallway with a handsome rug and several fine portraits and into a sitting room that was very full of books for so modest a home i sat in a slightly lowbacked but wellcushioned chair and there the woman left me without offering refreshment which i thought rather uncivil lavien was apparently at hand and had no interest in impressing me by making me wait i had hardly had time to study the pale green wallpaper flecked with bits of pink before the hebrew attended me and was good enough to present me with a glass of madeira i drank deeply from itvery good stuffand we settled down together you are bleeding from your head he told me prodigiously no only a little i shrugged then it is no matter i shall come to the point sir i need you to give me thirty dollars perhaps another twenty for comfort i need you to give me fifty dollars he made little effort to mask his amusement i have no such sum to spare my position pays well enough but i am hardly a rich man i thought all you treasury men were wealthy i said he snorted you have been listening to the lies disseminated by that rascal jefferson you are not one of those men so blinded by hamilton that you are set against jefferson i asked lavien clucked like an old woman jefferson is a liar and scoundrel and in my opinion an enemy of the state i think he is in fact secretary of state i suggested common mistake though his eyes narrowed and his expression darkened ever so slightly i suspected he was attempting to measure my sincerity my level of enthusiasm for jefferson and his republican followers lavien struck me as the sort of man who always measured a mans opinions who felt for strengths and weaknesses he was the sort who could not step into a room without noting the location of every door which windows he might jump through in a pinch which tables might be toppled for a shelter from bullets i knew the sort i had spent the war as just such a man hamilton has had cause to lament that washington puts his faith in that man he said soon enough washington will regret it jefferson has opposed us at every turn and he will stop at nothing perhaps hamilton wants opposing i said you cannot defend jefferson in his wretched newspaper he even insults washington calling him old and feeble of mind i knew it and i hated that jefferson did not have the sense to leave washington s reputation alone that ought not to be i admitted but despite all that you are against hamilton s great achievements captain saunders you were against the assumption bill you an old soldier opposed paying out the debts the states incurred during the war and the bank bill you think it a mistake for a nation to have a bank upon which to draw funds in times of crisis the bank bill the act of congress that had established hamilton s pet project the bank of the united states cynthias note said that her husbands disappearance the danger to herself and her children had something to do with the new bank best to take this slowly i thought i would not show too much interest i would listen he spoke very calmly but each syllable landed like a hammer blow the entire world knew that jefferson hated hamilton and his federalist policies but hamilton and his supporters were generally much quieter i suppose they had the advantage of success since washington so often sided with hamilton and the congress though it grumbled had voted his policies into law hamilton and his followers did not need to spit venom in the press the way the jeffersonians did for they were instead making laws and shaping policy but if lavien was any measure it seemed the hamiltonians were filled with just as much resentment as the jeffersonians i opposed the bank bill in my own way i said indeed i distinctly remember sitting in a tavern and cursing it very colorfully lavien shook his head i am sorry to hear that but it hardly seems the time to discuss policy what has happened to you captain saunders my landlady has very suddenly cast me out i told him providing a description of events from the previous night and hinting that perhaps my expulsion was linked to his inquiry he pointed to my head that new injury of yours is that related very likely i answered not quite ready to tell him about the irishman when he shared what he knew i would consider dispensing my little store of knowledge it is as i told you last night he said perhaps noting my skepticism pearson has been missing a few days perhaps a week i would like to find him and lest you ask i cannot tell you why i am not to share information regarding my inquiry with anyone uninvolved you would need to speak to colonel hamilton do you hold everything you do in such secrecy or just this i cant tell you that either he said without irony you must know i dont want state secrets my questions are about pearson if you wont tell me why you seek him tell me at least if you believe his family to be in danger in danger he repeated no i dont think so but you cannot say for certain he shook his head there is so little of which one can be certain i made an effort to hide my frustration by refilling my glass though he was a small swarthy bearded man i liked lavien and while he certainly was possessed of some rather significant abilities he did not strike me as a gifted spy he was alert and no doubt was possessed of a kind of cunning but did he have the sort of expansive intelligence the curiosity and openness that is required of the best of those in the trade i doubted it i wonder if there are things of which you might be more certain i said if you went about your affairs in a different way or had the benefit of more experience at once it all became clear to me like a vision lavien and i working side by side his curious physical prowess and my abilities as a spy id had too much to drink i suppose and had been confronted by the past too unexpectedly i had not thought of being in service for some time nowyears perhapsbut suddenly it seemed close enough to touch were i to find myself a coequal with lavien would that not erase the tarnish that had been placed upon my name all those years ago could i not appear in better circles without the whispering and pointing and awkward conversation the encounter with this remarkable man in service to hamilton and my contact with cynthia pearson who made all things seem bright and wonderful left me with the unexpected notion that i could rejoin the brotherhood of respectable men that i could be useful once more the thought of it was every bit as intoxicating as the wine you misunderstand me he said i have been sworn to secrecy on this matter and on all matters relating to my work for the treasury department i am sorry captain saunders i understand that you have a personal interest in this but i cannot tell you much not without the express permission of colonel hamilton but he shall never give me permission hamilton despises me lavien looked distraught like a child told there were to be no sweets i am certain you are mistaken i have heard him speak of you and he has had only flattering things to say he tells me you were an exceptional spy what else has he told you i could not help but suspect that lavien was lying to flatter me or for some other deceptive end he smiled he said you were remarkably clever in your dealings with peoplethat if you wished you could talk the devil himself into selling you his soul these words surprised me perhaps hamilton had spoken of me after all and in these flattering terms still it did not change things nevertheless he dislikes me i suggest you visit him put your case to him yourself in the meantime captain if you know of anything that can help me find pearson or aid his family i hope you will tell me i thought about the note in my pocket the one from cynthia i thought about my encounter with the irishman surely he would like to know these things if he were unwilling to aid me however i would not share with him indeed it seemed increasingly necessary that i conduct my own inquiry i would find the wretched pearson and i would protect cynthia from whatever dangers lurked around her where did you learn to do such things i asked to move so quickly and silently his eyes moved this way and that a sure sign that he considered a fabrication but in the end his words sounded like truth i was in surinam sir the maroon uprisings i am not a man easily impressed but here was something the maroonswith their mixture of african and indian bloodwere said to be among the most vicious fighters in the world ruthless in their quest for land and liberty they lived by a rigorous code of honor but any man they called enemy would die and die hard good lord i said softly you fought the maroons you must have seen hell itself at the hands of those godless savages you misunderstand me he said i fought with the maroons for their freedom it was they who taught me to do what i do had he told me he fought on behalf of the moon in its war against the sun i could not have been more surprised i had never before heard of a white man siding with the maroons i had never even heard of a white man being allowed to live by the maroons you fought alongside those dusky savages i managed neither their complexion nor their degree of civilization interested me he said his voice rather flat only that they were wronged there was nothing to say not to a man who would help a pack of cannibals slit the throats of white men yet i do hate a silence so i rose and refilled my glass from the decanter i drained it and filled it again before returning to my seat as for my difficulties i said lavien perhaps eager to change the subject himself waved me off he told me he had no sums of money to give away but he would be honored to have me as a guest for his evening meal and to spend the night he would have his woman make up the garret for me if i wished to refresh myself with a washbasin that too could be arranged he managed to make the suggestion sound generous and not an unkind comment upon my state i took him up on his offer and cleaned myself as best i could in the meantime his sitting room had been turned to a dining room with the table assembled from its various pieces the old crone laid it out quite elegantly with fine silver and handsome drinking glasses the room was well lit and the food was plentiful yet for such refinement lavien conducted himself like a peasant by bringing his children to the table we sat with a pretty girl with fair hair whom i guessed to be seven years of age and her younger brother no more than two the food was of the hebrew variety filled with strange spices and flavors but by no means unpalatable to a man open to alien sensations the wine was superb for jews ever have connections for good wine the conversation was quite lively for the little girl called antonia was a champion conversationalist and bade me speak at length about my wartime adventures interjecting quite often with her own opinions upon all matters political it astonished me that lavien whom i had judged to be so hardened and cruel cut off from human society by his past and by his skills was a different creature altogether with his wife and children he was open and easy obviously delighting in their company once when his daughter made an unusually mature and earnest observation he and his wife burst into peals of rich laughter lavien had seen and drawn blood hunted white men for maroons eaten human flesh for all i knew and yet found comfort in domestic quiet the envy i felt for him made my heart ache after dinner once the women and children departed lavien poured more wine and i inquired as to how he came to stand with the maroons and what he did with them but he demurred saying that he would tell me some other time he did not like to speak of it particularly not in his own home yet he did provide me with the most skeletal of explanations i did things which i am now ashamed to own he said though i am not ashamed of the cause i believe that all men african indian and european alike are equal in the eyes of god and of nature it is only in the eyes of one another that inequity lies i grew up in the west indies upon the island of nevis and pressed into the family business i visited surinam there i was abducted by the maroons who thought to use me as a hostage or perhaps they would have killed me out of vengeance i convinced them however that i was of a different tribe one as despised by their oppressors as their own and through a series of circumstances i shall not now relate i remained with them for two years embracing their cause though at the same time attempting to temper it it must have been trying to live among them i said at times it was but i did not live wholly among them i would travel to white settlements where my connection to the maroons was unknown and i would learn of the outside world i became enchanted with what i read of your new country after so long in the jungle i knew i must live in a land founded upon the principle that all men are created equal so i came to philadelphia for it has a large population of jews and here i met my wife how is it that you came to work for hamilton having done what i did with the maroons i did not wish to return to a life of trade though that is how i first supported myself once the government moved to philadelphia upon a whim i presented myself to hamilton he has since found work for me serving the country though this is the first time i have served him directly why hamilton i asked why did you seek him out of all men is it the west indian connection everyone knew that hamilton had been born a bastard on the island of nevis his mother had been a french strumpet his father a penniless younger son of a scots family of more puffedup pretension than means it was more than our geographical connection hamilton s mothers first husband lavien said was my uncle johan lavien this was a greater surprise than his past connection with the maroons what hamilton has jew kinsmen lavien shook his head they had no children my uncle was a monster and the lady was right to run from him hamilton has every reason to dislike me for my nameand my face i suppose im told i look a bit like my uncle yet hamilton has been nothing but kind i found this hard to believe but did not say so as hamilton admires you so much i suggested perhaps you might come with me when i speak to him you might try to persuade him to let me in on your secrets he shook his head i do not like to visit hamilton at treasury i prefer other venues i smiled of course hamilton was always uneasy about his lowly origins it would not do to so remind the world let alone to parade his hebrew nearkinsman before subordinates he does not like to be reminded of his origins it is true but there are more complicated matters at work here i sipped my wine what could these more complicated matters be my thoughts were clouded by drink but even so i found the truth in the thicket of obscurity jefferson doesnt know about you does he you do not visit hamilton at treasury because you do not want it known that you work for hamilton or what sort of work you do if the jeffersonians were to put it about that the jewish nephew of hamilton s mothers first husband was slinking about the city looking into the business of wealthy families they would piss their pants with glee you see right to the heart of things he said it is no inconsiderable skill one you could use i said if that is colonel hamiltons will then i think so you understand that hamilton hates me dont you it was he who exposed my supposed treachery to the world he promised he would hold the accusations against me secret but he could not spread the word fast enough why do you say so have you evidence to prove it it is what i heard and i believe it did colonel hamilton tell you that he would protect your reputation lavien asked me yes and he lied if he said he would protect your reputation then he did colonel hamilton was not the one who maligned you sir and unless you have proof otherwise i will not believe it it is not something he would do i knew jefferson had his worshipers but i did not know hamilton was also blessed i am not a worshiper but i know the man and i have too much respect for the truth to believe an obvious falsehood when i see one if you like i could use the resources my position offers to launch a full inquiry into what happened those years ago something uncomfortable twisted inside me i should very much prefer to keep the past where it belongs i said what is done cannot be undone he nodded then let us turn to the present i wonder if i ought to send someone to look for leonidas you may fear to seek him out but i see no reason why i may not do so i sat up straight in my chair why i would be most grateful very decent of you lavien excused himself and when he returned perhaps half an hour later he said that he had sent a boy from a nearby coffeehouse with instructions to ask about southwark for a man of leonidass description and that should he be found he would meet me the next morning at a nearby tavern after id had my fill of wine i told him i wished to retire and lavien bade me good night saying he had work yet to do that evening i assured him i could find my own way to my room and so taking a candle i ascended the stairs steep and narrow as in a dutchmans house when i reached the secondfloor landing mrs lavien emerged from her childrens room i heard jonathan fussing she told me as though some explanation were necessary i hope you find your room comfortable oh very i told her i never mind a garret and it is made up quite elegantly for a room of that species yet mrs lavien there is something of solitude i do not like and i cannot but think how much brighter the room would be with your company she glanced back and forth and then to my delight ascended the stairs to my room i followed her my single candle providing scant illumination but enough to watch the delicious movement of her form under her pretty yellow gown she had a commanding presence a recklessness that reminded me of cynthia pearson as she had been all those years ago when she was cynthia fleet here too was a woman who craved excitement who delighted in the pleasures of the illicit why should i not accommodate her yes her husband had done me a kindness but had she not done me a kindness too and would it not be mean of me to demur from returning the favor she had acted the proper wife all evening devoted to children and husband managing her home both with earnestness and good cheer but what lavien did not understandit was quite apparent nowwas that she was also a woman with complex desires we reached the top of the stairs and though my sensations were fuzzy from all i had drunk that night still i felt the excitement rising inside me my heart pounded and my pulse beat in my neck i closed the door behind me and set the light upon a small writing desk in the corner indeed i was right i said for in being here you do make the room so much more how very broken you are she said her voice was soft confused and even a little sad i beg your pardon i felt the prickling of something illnot danger but yet unpleasant you heard me mr saunders her voice had an icy edge i did not like at all you must be broken in your soul my husband and i invite you to our home taking you in when you are in need of shelter and in response to this kindness you choose to offer me insult i wish to know what portion of your heart of your soul is so damaged that you would do such a thing i must point out that it is captain saunders the time when i might be impressed by your rank has passed us she said and i do not reject it for any accusation of treason i reject it for how you act here tonight you think your honor your chance to be an honorable man is in the past and so you befoul the present and the future i added brightly i understand that your wit keeps you sane sir but you must set it aside now and again or you shall ever remain a wretch i suddenly felt very sober and ambushed i might add it was cruel to lead me into a position of vulnerability only to take advantage of my open nature that was what i told myself if there has been some misunderstanding between us i began there is no misunderstanding do not try to pretend that either of us can believe it have you no decency i was prepared to answer sharply but i suddenly saw things with a starkness i would have preferred to avoid no i told her at times i havent she must have heard something in my voice for even in the frail wash of candlelight i saw the pity in her eyes and pity was a thing i could not endure you are a very sad man are you not captain saunders do not speak to me so if you like you may cast me out but do not speak to me so i shant cast you out she said it is what you wish i believe you wish it far more than you wish me to yield to you who was she captain saunders that so hurt you was it long ago or recent long ago i think dont act as though you know my heart how could i not when you wear it on your sleeve i am sorry to have offended you i said i looked about the room to collect my things though i had no things to collect i shall go you will stay the night and in the morning you will go see hamilton your husband speaks to you of his business she laughed should he not you who love women so well do not think to speak to them of your work i stared at this woman lavien with his beard and slender shoulders and unimpressive stature had wed a mighty creature i would be grateful i said if you would not mention this incident to your husband it was he who advised me on how best to conduct myself when you approached me in the dim light her gaze was dark and magnetic you have fallen very low have you not perhaps there is nothing to do but rise tomorrow is something entirely new entirely unwritten and full of possibility wont you use it she turned away and the power of her gaze snapped like the thinnest of glass rods she opened the door and descended the stairs i closed the door and sat upon my bed my head in my hands who were these people what manner of being were these laviens and with what had i become involved joan maycott spring in the morning our hosts gave us a breakfast of whiskey and corn cakes served on mismatched pewter plates a luxury we would not fully appreciate until we were as we would be soon without any plates at all while we ate our meager portions reynolds arrived to inform us that prior to visiting our land we were to speak with duers local agent colonel holt tindall though much abused by duer and his people we thought it best to present ourselves to advantage so andrew wore clothes he had not touched for the journey looking dignified in plain artisans breeches a white shirt and a handsome woolen coat i wore a simple dress far more wrinkled than i would have liked but it was clean at least though he had eyed me with open lasciviousness through our journey when i was dirty and tired and blunted by exhaustion reynolds hardly looked at me now there was something quite different in the odious mans manner even as he spoke of this colonel tindall something like respect or perhaps wariness spread over his features duers man in pittsburgh or no i expected another makeshift shack but holt tindall was of an entirely different order of being reynolds pointed out to us tindalls handsome twostory structure on water street recently whitewashed and looking within this primitive city much like a diamond in a barrel of coal this however was not where we were to meet him instead reynolds led us once more across the river and some miles out of town to colonel tindalls country estate a vast southernstyle plantation called empire hall here was a large woodframe house very like the one in town only larger and more stately for being surrounded not by shacks and mud but by fields of crops and barns of livestock all of which were tended to by a dozen or more negro slaves indeed i saw no one but negroes reynolds seemed to read my thoughts for he said he aint got a wife he lives only with the niggers but he takes to company if the outer countenance of the mansion was surprising the interior made us gasp i dont know when it happened when we decided that we had passed from one world to another but i now recognized that i expected never to see again such signs of civilization from the inside of the house one would hardly know that this was not some elegant new york mansion the walls were lined with fine paintings and tapestries the floors with excellent coverings that produced the most faithful imitation of tile while pittsburgh smelled like a necessary pot this home gave off the fragrance of baking bread and cut flowers a pretty young negro girl light in color met us at the door she would not look directly at us and so i did not notice at once the severe bruise upon her eye perhaps she wished to hide this from us or perhaps she feared reynolds who studied her with naked desire while fingering his scar with a torpid gait as though unwilling herself to approach the girl took us to a massive sitting room this chamber boasted not only a fine rugfor here only guests without mud on their feet would be admittedbut beyond all the handsome chairs and two sofas a large pianoforte was propped against the far wall where it was bathed in the light of the morning sun it was now nine for the tall case clock rang cheerily echoed by chimes throughout the house and the church bell from the distant town at the far end of the room before the fireplace sitting upon an isolated highbacked armchairlooking much from its form and placement like a thronewas a stout and rugged man in his sixties his white hair was long and tangled in the back though he balded considerably and he had wild gray eyes and a rough stubble upon his cheekfeatures that clashed with his tailored breeches ruffled shirt and embroidered waistcoat all of these things contributed to give him the look of a deranged surveyor who has spent too much time alone in the wilderness if his countenance had not given that impression i suspect it would have been provided by the fowling piece he clutched in one hand its butt resting against the floor like a brutal frontier scepter above him hung a string of hairy things attached to bits of leather it took me a moment to recognize them as indian scalps the servant had not admitted reynolds with us and we were alone with this old man who bore himself with the silent dignity of a savage chief he opened his mouth to show us two rows of dark teeth which he clamped together in something like a grin i am colonel holt tindall of empire hall and i am duers partner on this side of the alleghenies as he spoke i felt the heat of his gaze as it settled upon my body he looked at me as no man should look at a woman not his wife reynolds said id want to meet you and he knows my business ill say as much as that he spoke with the heavy accent of a virginian but it had an additional drawl a kind of laziness i had already begun to associate with westerners care to sit he asked thank you said andrew tindall banged the butt of his fowling piece upon the wooden floor not you a man stands in the presence of his betters i address the lady i could not endure that andrew should be again debased for the sake of something so trivial as my appearance i gazed upon this colonel tindall with hatred and contempt lest he think i mistook his rudeness for authority and remained standing you must suit yourself he said in response to my silence stand sit dont matter he might have been a virginian once but evidently he had forgotten the culture of extreme politeness cultivated in those climes all at once i knew precisely what he wasa hybrid creature composed of a southerners sense of privilege and a westerners brutality there is a name for a creature that is part one thing and part another monster my pulse quickened and my breathing deepened i was afraid i had been living for weeks in perpetual fearfear for what would become of us fear for our safetybut this was something much more urgent something sharper i looked at andrew and his lips curled in a reassuring smile if he too was afraid he would not show it andrew stepped forward inclining just enough toward a bow to be polite without actually offering obeisance i am andrew maycott and this is my wife joan we are anxious to see our land so please state your business the colonels old face darkened at andrews words he sneered again revealing his tobaccostained teeth as if to demonstrate the origins of this discoloration he pulled from inside his coat a twist of tobacco and bit off a considerable piece just then the doors to the chamber opened and a negro woman of great girth and indeterminate agebut surely neither young nor very oldentered the chamber i see you got company colonel you want tea or maybe that cake i done baked this morning the colonel banged his fowling piece upon the floor did i call for you he demanded do not come unless i call now get you gone lactilla i was later to learn as a point of gossip that this negress had been the colonels property for near twenty years when first making her way into tindalls household her breasts had been large with milk for she had been separated from a child not yet two years old owing to the death of her previous owner the colonel found this condition amusing and had taken to calling her lactilla now the woman stared brazenly at this beast of a man dont you use that tone with me when i aint done nothing wrong but only my duty which is to serve tea and cake tindall raised his fowling piece youll go back to your damned kitchen nigger the only question is if you do it whole or filled with shot she waved a hand and let out a guffaw look at him old man with a gun she turned to me you come by the kitchen when you done honey i give you some cake you and that handsome husband of yours she shrugged her massive shoulders and heaved herself from the room tindall set the gun back down with a thud but he kept his hand upon it still damn that old bitch he looked at andrew as for you dont hope ive forgotten your impertinence you dont much care to mind your place but youll come to understand your error you ask around maycott and youll hear the same thing from everyone i am generous to the town and its poor i am free with my money and i believe those with means ought to help those who have none i do not however suffer insolence gladly and how is it not insolence on your part when you ask us to stand while you remain seated andrew asked because this is my house and my town and the land you are to settle upon is my own i believe said andrew it is mine i bought it therell be time for you to examine that belief for now it would be well for you to listen to what i say and to think no more of the sort of leveling foolishness that comes from misunderstanding the late war i am familiar with the principles of the revolution for i fought in it as did i said andrew what of it one cannot empty a workhouse a jail or a brothel without uncovering a passel of veterans you would do better to attend to more immediate concerns such as your land for example he held up two scrolls of foolscap both clutched in his left hand clearly unwilling to let go of the fowling piece one of these is the deed to your land the contract that you signed cleverly written by our friend duer who is quite adept at these things it is i am afraid not a favorable piece of property i took a step forward mr duer assured us that it was very fertile duer lied pretty thing the land might be fertile to corn for all i know but you will have to clear it of trees and rocks and then see what it yields if you had a team of mules and a pack of niggers you might do it in as little as two years you wait a moment andrew said tindall showed us his teeth again i aint got to wait duer deceived you you know that by now he spoke to you of the glories of libertytown but youve seen pittsburgh and you wonder how the settlement can be a paradise if pittsburgh is so wretched your allotment is not farmland but wild forest and taming it will likely be your death neither of us spoke because terrible though these revelations might be they were not shocking as tindall had suggested we had long since understood duers deception though we were not yet aware of its extent we did not speak because of our of pure sharp numbing surprise it was one thing to trick a person but quite another to glory in being a cheat now he continued the other deed i hold in my hand is more like the sort of thing duer suggested not quite you understand it wont be what you were told but this one is very much nearer tis cleared land already a cabin on it such as it is and the lands been farmed somewhat in the haphazard ways of western rabble it is a better piece of landmuch more workable perhaps you would like to consider trading what you have now for something more agreeable tis equal acreage so you need not concern yourself on that score andrew said nothing what was there to say we were hundreds of miles from our home abused and deceived in the hands now of a deranged border despot whose greatest pleasure seemed to be abusing those in his power tindall had every advantage over us and the only power we had came from withholding our acknowledgment of that power i have come to these terms with other settlers who have always found them advantageous tindall said would you care to come to terms with me mr maycott that would depend upon the terms would it not his voice remained steady i knew he was frightened for me and for our future but he would not show it it is not what i asked you tindalls voice shifted from syrupy to hard i did not ask about the terms i only asked if you would like advantageous terms answer me yes or no i shall listen to your offer andrew said and if i think it sound i shall consider it i am not going to agree to any theoretical proposal to do so would be foolish tindall pounded the butt of his fowling piece against the floor several times like a judge banging his gavel enough of your insolence i aint got the time for it here is what i offer you though youre fortunate i still give you the chance to take it i wish that mrs maycott may attend me here once a week and maybe stay the night tis no great thing its an insubstantial thing if you know that word in exchange a substantial thing may be yours andrew remained silent a moment longer i could not imagine that anyone faced with this blunt and diabolical demand would surrender to it that there were men and women so low in the world and in their sense of their own worth that they would agree to these terms as though they had agreed to the price of a pound of flour images of the blunted and weathered inhabitants of pittsburgh came to my mind and i wondered if these people were capable of agreeing to anything at all it seemed to me that once so defeated by life they would do nothing more than submit the way a lamb submits to be shorn andrew stepped toward the colonel and so bold was his determination that the old man set down both deeds and tightened his grip upon his fowling piece the proposal you make concerns my wife why then do you present it to me tindall at first did not stir and then he cleared his throat with his free hand the one not clutching the gun he stroked the stubble on his chin he let out a little bark of air something like a laugh i suppose in the same way that a drab brown moth is something like a resplendent butterfly how modern of your husband what say you mrs maycott andrew looked at me but i did not meet his gaze instead i smiled at tindall as though he were a peddler who had not yet shown us his best wares i am sure the plot of land for which we have contracted will prove sufficient you and duer may have cheated us andrew said and you may relish that fact but that does not make us your slaves nor you our master we shall turn dross into gold and never depend upon the favors of men like you andrew walked back to me took my arm and led me toward the door you may not later change your mind tindall said i wont have my tenants switching their plots it would causehe waved his hand about in the airdiscontent i am not your tenant andrew said turning to him i have purchased this land inferior though it may be outright you and i are both landholders and so equals and perhaps we would be if you owned the land i do find it sad so very sad when low people who know not their way around a contract sign one without first inquiring of a lawyer you are i am told a carpenter by trade yes you would despise someone i think who attempted to construct an armoire out of his own imaginings of how it must be made without seeking experienced advice you have not purchased the land you have purchased the right to occupy the land and pay me ground rent i looked at andrew could it be true ground rents were generally inexpensive and held for very long periods of time ours i would later discover as was typical of the sort was for ninetynine years each quarter for that period we were to pay our landlord ten dollars rather expensive for a ground lease let alone one in so remote a location so long as we paid we retained possession and could sublease or even sell the right to occupy though at the end of the ninetynine years ownership would revert to the landlord i now saw the extent to which we had been deceived we had given up all we had not to own land but to occupy and pay rent upon a worthless plot of forest to make it yield value and so be able to raise the money needed to pay our rent and not lose our property we would have to clear the land and increase its worth tindall and duer had discovered a way to profit while turning worthless holdings into a valuable estate and surely we were not the first others had been cheated thus for there was a whole community of victims under tindalls command none who had been cheated had found redress for tindall and duer continued their scheme and that could only mean one thing that the law the principles of the republic for which andrew had fought had already been abandoned the men back east could not or would not protect us youll be taken to your plot tindall said you may have occasion to wish you had accepted my offer as i said it will not come again there is however the matter of quarterly rent and if you find that you cannot pay and you risk losing your land we may then talk again it was as though he were a candle that had been blown out he remained in his chair his weapon in his hand but his eyes went cold and empty and i had the strange feeling that andrew and i were now alone we opened the door and departed without escort ethan saunders wearing tolerably clean clothes washed in my basin and then dried by the fire i slipped quietly down the stairs early the next morning the sun had just come up and if i could avoid the serving woman i had no doubt i could escape the house without enduring awkward conversation with its inmates the memory of my encounter with mrs lavien still felt as raw and vulnerable as a new wound it was not simply the shame of having been exposed of having treated so shabbily my hosts kindness it was the notion that these antics were somehow alien to me now something had changed my new proximity to cynthia pearsons life made my behavior unseemly even to myself and mrs laviens cruel words still rang in my ears my plan was a simple one i would obtain a few coins from a careless gentleman on the street take my breakfast in a tavern and meet leonidas as planned when at drink i can be clumsy but that morning i moved as quietly as a cat on the hunt no floorboards creaked under my weight no stairs groaned at my descent even so when i reached the ground floor mr lavien leaned forward in his chair in the sitting room he saw my positionhands out for better balance feet at sharp angles to test the stairs for weaknesses that would betray meand met it with one of his thin vaguely predatory smiles i had accepted his hospitality allowed him to feed me serve me drink introduce me to his family i sent him out into the cold night to hunt down my slave in return i had attempted to seduce his wife and now he sat grinning at me looking like a serpent before it lashes out at a cornered and frozen mouse shall we go take some breakfast he asked in a nearby tavern crowded with laboring men in early morning silence i sat next to lavien at a poor tabletoo close to the door too far from the fire he ate buttered bread and pickled eggs i made an attempt at some bread as well but concentrated more upon the beer i took a deep drink i suppose you want to speak about the incident last night what the one with my wife what have you to say i let out a sigh look i apologize for attempting to take liberties he shrugged it is no more than i expected your reputation in such matters precedes you and there was never any danger of your doing anything but becoming embarrassed which i see has occurred you dont care that i might have seduced your wife oh i would have cared about that it is not what happened you thought you might seduce my wife and that is another matter for in reality you could have achieved nothing you know that do you i know my wife he said and i think i begin to know you well enough too the sting of your disgrace years ago still hangs over you so you look for new disgraces but we can put a stop to that when i prove to the world that your reputation was so unjustly injured you will have a chance to begin your life anew i told you i do not want you looking into my past you did not say not to only that you prefer the past to be left alone then now i shall tell you not to he studied me then at last he spoke ah i see what could he see what could he know perhaps he had heard fragments of the story or perhaps hamilton had told him all he knew though hamilton s version of events would be slanted and illinformed the short of it was that in the weeks before yorktown fleet and i had been stationed with hamiltons company and had just returned from making a series of runs between the main army and philadelphia visiting our royalist contacts along the way we had been sitting outside our tents playing at cards when an officer i had never before met a major from philadelphia rode into our camp and demanded from hamilton permission to search our tents i had been outraged upon general principle but fleet had outright refused fleet was a tall man slender more serious in bearing than he was in character with a full head of cottony white hair he was a man born to be a spy one moment he could be either serious or a doting father to his cynthia or as good a drinking companion as any man might wish he could also be studious and sober and precise that afternoon as we stood outside our tents the air still and lifeless i would have expected fleet to tell me to endure the outrage with good cheer that there was little that could be done so it must be suffered without resentment but not that day he swore that this man this major brookings would lose his hand before he would touch any item in fleets tent at last colonel hamilton was called upon and in his stiff magisterial manner ruled that as major brookings acted upon good intelligence he must be allowed to search but that he hamilton would oversee the matter to make certain all was done properly indeed he even demanded that we be allowed to remain present though he asked us not to speak fleets tent was searched first and when suspicious documents were discovered tucked into the lining of his travel pack i could hardly believe what i saw it had to be planted falsely i thought for beyond any unthinkable doubts about his loyalty fleet would have known far better than to hide something in so obvious a place yet the look in his eye that of distant terror left me unable to speak the knife was to twist once more however for when my own pack was searched documents of a similar nature were found in a similar position appearances may have been sufficiently against fleet to make me doubt him my best friend and yet now they were also against me and i had no doubt of my own innocence it was hard to focus my rage on this major brookings for he hardly looked pleased at his discovery indeed his face was cast in an expression of distant sadness neither fleet nor i knew him and that made it unlikely he came upon some errand of personal vengeance fleet and i were placed under guard while hamilton reviewed the materials and in a few hours time he came to see us the documents he said letters between an unnamed american and a british agent suggested we had been selling lowlevel inconsequential secrets to an outsider it would appear that we had been in the business of making money while not precisely compromising the american positions though certainly coming close to doing so given he said that the army was in motion it could ill afford the distraction of the discovery of treason among two wellplaced officers it was his decision therefore that we resign we both resisted vehemently but in the end it became clear that we had no better option and we surrendered to our fate hamilton would not permit me to examine the documents myself so i could not see the hand in which they were written it hardly mattered fleet and i both knew how to disguise our penmanship i could not imagine that fleet would do something so base as to sell the british secrets even useless ones he hardly needed the money and even if he had done such a thing why would he have hidden some letters among my things and yet how else could they have gotten there was it possible that the letters were from an earlier time in the war perhaps they were from months or even years before i did not place items in the lining of my travel bag but neither did i make a habit of checking to see if anyone else had inserted something i was troubled because fleet hardly spoke to me on the subject i proposed all the most obvious questions i asked how he thought the letters came into our possession if we were being made to look like traitors by some other person he would not answer he never struck me as guilty only as too thoughtful to speak he would fall into such moods at timesas he pieced together a puzzle or connected disparate facts or decoded a messagewhen he would allow no conversation sometimes for days at a time he needed time to think then he left camp without speaking to me while i awaited his return hamilton came to see me and put a hand on my shoulder theres something i think you should know he said the war has been hard for fleet hard on his finances i believe he is quite ruined i removed his hand from me what of it weve all suffered he shook his head you and i came into this fight with little of real value but fleet was a rich man in philadelphia now he is near penniless he would not allow his daughter to slip into penury i said before the war he settled separate property on her in anticipation on this but his business is gone i am only saying that he might have thought it not wholly wrong to make some money selling worthless secrets to the british he might have thought it his due i came close to striking him nothing could have convinced me of such a thing and i turned away without another word i suspected fleet had gone to philadelphia to be with his daughter and i rode out the next morning intending to follow him instead i decided that it would be best to have some time away from him first so i went to visit my sister in connecticut for two weeks when at last i arrived in philadelphia i received the shocking news that fleet was dead cynthia was in mourning the house shut against almost all visitors her father she told me had returned from the war a different nearly unrecognizable man he had spoken to her infrequently and then only a word or two at a time he had turned aggressively uncharacteristically to drink and had become very belligerent when drunk only slightly less so when sober after a week of such behavior he was killed in a barroom brawl by an assailant never found and there was more she said people whispered they said he had been cast out of the army in disgrace i told her all i knew disguising as best i could the degree to which appearances implicated her fatherimplicated both of us really i vowed i would find for her the man who had killed her father but it proved impossible i could go nowhere without fingers pointed at me in suspicion and hatred no one would speak to me or answer my questions not only was it said that fleet and i were traitors but that the accusation came from an unimpeachable source hamilton himself it was for that reason i left cynthia behind i could not ask her to be with someone labeled so blackly as i was fleet was dead and people soon forgot that he had ever been involved in the scandal i could go nowhere however without the rumors following me these accusations had killed fleet and they destroyed my life they were never forgotten but time at least had softened the bitterness felt toward me and now lavien wished to unearth it all i kept my gaze hard and cold you cannot know what it is like to be labeled a traitor and so you cannot understand why i want it left alone i think i understand said lavien you have proclaimed your innocence and i believe you that means there can be only one reason you do not wish the past unearthed and why is that i asked though i wished i hadnt because you believe your friend captain fleet was indeed a traitor he your best friend father of the lady who is now cynthia pearson whom you intended to marryit was he who sold secrets to the british that is what you knowor what you believe it is a great and noble secret that allows you to revel in your own suffering for each time someone marks you as a traitor you know that you bear this burden for lovenot once but twice it is not an easy thing to be laid bare in this way by a man who is little better than a stranger a stranger to whom you are indebted and whom you have wronged he had seen things as they really were and had done it at once you must let it alone i told him when fleet died the world chose to forget his part in these crimes his name was allowed to be spoken without taint you allow your name to remained blackened for her sake he asked i nodded for her and for fleet i do not say he was guilty but if he was it was trivial empty secrets were soldlies and worthless information only whatever the truth fleet was a good man a hero who did a thousand courageous things for his country ill not have it said about him now that he was a traitor it is said about you i am here to defend myself he is not i stood up i have asked you to leave this alone i will say no more of it sit down captain i am sorry if you feel imposed upon and i shall heed your words i sat i wanted to press him into more vigorously worded promises but at this point i observed leonidas enter the tavern i waved him over and he called for bread butter and small beer i finished my ale and called for another after a moment lavien excused himself saying he had things to do and wished me good luck with hamilton he and leonidas shook hands and i watched the little man leave once he was gone i informed leonidas of all that had happened since i last saw himbeing cast out by mrs deisher the note from cynthia and the encounter with the irishman leonidas listened nodded but said little finally he commented upon the most practical of matters what shall you do about lodgings i have not yet made a determination on that do not think you will come live with me ill not have it it would only be for a few days no it is really unkind i said i would not have thought you so unkind i must have a place that is mine and i must have a place i said that is your business and none of mine however if you would be so good as to free me from bondage as you promised to do i would happily lend you the money to get your things out of surety and to rent a new set of rooms why that is the most villainous blackmail i have ever heard said i ethan do you mean to hold me forever you are not a man to keep a slave and i am not a man to be one i know not what you mean by it you agreed to free me when i turned twentyone which was six months ago i agreed to free you when you were twentyone i didnt mention anything about the specific moment of that year i wish you would attempt to be a little patient leonidas all this casting about for favors does not become you i could not free him that was what he did not know and could not understand though the reason would have surprised him i could not free him because he was already a free man id simply neglected to inform him i t was really no more than a curious series of events once dorland began stalking me i grew concerned for leonidass future i owed him his freedom and thought it best to secure it at once accordingly id gone to a lawyer and paid ten dollars to have the appropriate papers drawn up freeing him not simply upon my death but immediately and irrevocably as i sat across from him leonidas had been a free man for nearly a week if dorland had killed me he would have found out then he was to be freed in my will but i arranged with the lawyer to contact leonidas and make sure he knew i had freed him before i died i did not die and i surely would have mentioned all of this to him but then id heard from cynthia and suddenly there were more complicated issues requiring my attention were i to tell leonidas that he was free he would likely continue to help me but perhaps he would not there was so much about his life i did not know i should have liked to have taken the chance and if it were merely my life my happiness in the balance i would have done so i would not take that chance when cynthia pearson told me she was in danger leonidas would have to believe himself a slave for a few more daysor weeks do not think this decision was an easy one i could imagine the joy of leaping up there in that tavern and informing him that i had already freed him and required no more of his pestering to do what was right but as much as i yearned to be open with him on this matter i dared not i therefore sacrificed not only the immediate relation of the news of his liberty but my own chances for obtaining a place to live w e walked to the offices of the treasury upon third street at the corner of walnut leonidas was clearly still harboring resentment over our conversation but my thoughts were already elsewhere all around us hurried clusters of men who appeared too big for their suits walnut street was the center of finance in philadelphia and of late it had been a place where clever and ruthless men could easily fatten themselves a little further hamilton had launched his bank the previous summer using an ingenious system of scripcertificates that stood not for bank shares but for the opportunity to purchase those shares scrip holders could later on a series of four predetermined quarterly dates buy actual bank shares using cash for half the payments and alreadycirculating government issues for the other half these issuessix percent government loanshad been performing poorly in the markets attracting little interest so hamiltons method promoted trade in the six percents since scrip holders needed to acquire them in order to exchange their scrip for full ownership of the bank shares in addition to strengthening a market for already existing government issues hamiltons scheme created a frenzy for the new bank of the united states shares the act of delaying gratification fueled the mania and in a matter of weeks speculators were earning two or three times on their investment then just as manically as the price soared it crashed to earth producing a panic hamilton had saved his bank only by sending his agents to the major trading cities new york boston baltimore and charleston as well as here in philadelphia to buy up scrip and settle the market many unwary investors lost everything they had but clever men made themselves richer no harm done one might say but there were those who thought otherwise thomas jefferson secretary of state and hamilton s great enemy argued that this mania proved the bank was a destructive force jefferson and his republican followers believed that the true center of american power must be agriculture a national bank would empower merchants and traders and turn the nation into a copy of britain that is a sink of corruption id been inclined to side with the jeffersonians on this point though in truth id not given things too much thought i merely chose to be opposed to anything that hamilton desired the center of this new american trickery and greed was the treasury department now located in a complex of conjoined private homes roughly converted for the purpose of housing the largest of the federal governments departments we stepped through the front door and were met not by an austere and magisterial lobby but by a frenzy of excitement hardly less riotous than the jostling of traders outside men scribbled away furiously at desks or rushed to bring one meaningless stack of papers to a place where an equally meaningless stack would be taken instead everywhere were clerks busily writing and tallying and many believed plotting the downfall of liberty i gave a clerk near the door my name he looked at me most unkindly but soon enough we were directed to hamilton s office not until that moment had i considered what was about to happen hamilton had cast me out of the army and made free with my name letting the world hear the lies that i was a traitor his actions had led directly to the death of my great friend now ten years later i was about to present myself to him redeyed and haggard in a wrinkled and stained suit and beg that he make me privy to what he seemed to regard as state secrets i felt anger and humiliation and i wished to run away but instead i marched forward as a man marches forward to the noose that is to hang him i took deep breaths and attempted to anticipate the scene that lay before me since returning to philadelphia id seen hamilton a few times upon the street but i had kept my distance wanting no discourse with him id not had an opportunity to see him close since the end of the war and i was now pleased to observe that he was not looking his best he was a year or two older than i was but looked as though the span were closer to ten years he had grown plump in office jowly in the face saggy under the eyes his nose was as long as ever but it seemed to be growing as the noses of old faces do and he had begun to lose his hair which must have displeased his vain and libertine nature clearly the duties and difficulties of being one of the most hated men in the nation had begun to affect him they had affected his clothes too for his suit looked faded and shiny in spots perhaps the treasury secretary ought to present himself to better advantage but then even i knew the rumors of his enriching himself off government funds were false the less popular truth was that hamilton had so dedicated his time to promoting his policies that he had allowed his own finances to suffer if however he looked less than his best he was certainly formal he rose when we entered his sparelooking officeshort upon decorative flourishes but long upon filing cabinets imposinglooking financial volumes and writing desks filled with ledgers and charts as for his own desk it was as neat as though no one used it hamilton i recalled from his days as washington s chief of staff loathed a cluttered workplace once upon his feet and thus revealing his short stature he approached us he took my hand and shook it warmly and such was my surprise that i could not but allow this to happen captain saunders it has been many years he appearedand i found this shockingpleased to see me it is usual that a man hates no one so much as a person he has wronged but here was hamilton smiling his eyes crinkling with pleasure his cheeks rosy perhaps my presence recalled to him fond memories of life as a young officer in a momentous war perhaps he merely rejoiced to see me looking so poorly i let go of his hand for i did not love his touch it has in fact been many years many years he repeated not knowing what else to say he looked at leonidas and then brightened no doubt with the hope of easing the tension please introduce me to your colleague he said it with no inflection but i knew his motive was only mischief he did not approve of the mistreatment of negroes and opposed all slavery this is my man leonidas hamilton now shook his hand and applied his charm justly legendary i trust you will sit he said with a gesture to a cluster of chairs before his desk i am astonishingly busy you cannot imagine the demands upon my time but i can take a few minutes for an old comrade i should like to say i hope you are well but i presume if you will excuse me for observing what is obvious that you are in some distress if you have come for assistance we shall see how we can help you i credited his presumption making polite observations on my appearance and suggesting that he was available to assist me did he forget that it was he who had ruined my life expelled me from the army and made certain the world heard the tales of my supposed treachery was it of so little import to him that it slipped his mind had he done harm to so many over the years that he no longer even recalled the particular instances of his perfidy or did he merely enjoy playing the munificent despot leonidas and i sat in two chairs before his desk hamilton returned to his own seat he took a detour to a sideboard and i thought he meant to offer us drink but then he glanced at me and changed his mind instead he sat and placed upon his face a look of important expectation i waited a moment the better to make him slightly uncomfortable to feel slightly less in control i have had a difficult few days i said at last as my appearance will testify and i believe it has some small relation to an inquiry you are running out of your department you look into the affairs of mr jacob pearson he hesitated a moment and then nodded it is not commonly known nor would i have it so but as you seem already familiar with some general facts i will admit it but ask for your silence ironic i thought coming from him you need not concern yourself with that but as it happens my path has crossed with your kinsman mr lavien he is not my kinsman said hamilton with some force it was hard enough for him to have the world know he was born a west indian bastard but if the world were to think him a jew he would die from shame he is however a remarkable man i should like to assist him in his case in short i should like the government to employ me to use the skills i honed during the war to serve you in this and other matters hamilton kept his face remarkably devoid of expression i see captain saunders is already materially involved said leonidas he has suffered physical attack and the loss of his home he is personally caught up in the matter and he is also possessed of certain skills relatively rare as i understand it and you are certainly a strong advocate leonidas said hamilton who apparently delighted in having someone to speak to who was not me but it cannot be why can it not be i asked i am not ignorant of the past said hamilton you had a connection to mrs pearson once did you not she is fleets daughter i said you recollect fleet whom you hounded to death i did not say it though i am not so foolish as that i am well aware of that which alone would make it a difficult matter but it was commonly said that you and she were once engaged to marry it was never so formal as that though who can say how things might have gone had you not cashiered us out of the army and then ruined my reputation of course had you not done so fleet might yet be alive captain he said gently you do your case poor service with these accusations is there anything i could say that would do my case good service no my mind is quite made up on this matter then i feel quite at my liberty to call you the rascal you are i said leonidas put a hand upon my arm he turned to hamilton captain saunders does not intend to be so harsh but his need is great oh i think he intends it i have become a convenient object of hatred and blame for him over the yearsdont think i havent heard that you say so doing no small injury to my own reputation i might addbut i must clarify a point or two you know well captain that dismissing you from the army was the only way to save your life you were under my command when the charges were leveled against you and captain fleet had i not agreed to a discharge you would have been courtmartialed and likely executed i ought not to have let you talk me into destroying my own reputation the evidence against you was strong he said it might have been a british sham they may have had enough of your tricks and decided to let us deal with you by allowing us to find false evidence but remember the mood of the army in those days the exhaustion and setbacks wed suffered men were still raw from arnold s betrayal and at that crucial hour another pair of officers in league with the british would not have been treated well it was perhaps unfair to blame him for fleets deathby all accounts fleet had initiated a fight and come out the loserbut i blamed him anyhow and of course there was more what of my reputation you promised me then that no one would hear of it yet by the time i returned to philadelphia it was common knowledge i know said hamilton softly but i was not the one who made it so i swore to keep it a secret but in an army nothing can be a secret for long i spent the better part of a week trying to find out who had spoken out of turni need not tell you how serious a thing that is before a major battlebut i could learn nothing if you like captain i can parade before you a dozen officers who will recall ten years later the fear i put into them over this matter then you are not the one who ruined captain saunderss reputation leonidas asked of course not he said why would i you have wasted your time hating the wrong man my god saunders why did you not simply ask me you were always a man who could sniff out a lie you would have known if i had tried to deceive you i could sniff out a lie he was right in that it was why i sat in astonishment for i believed him now his voice was so free so easy so empty of guile i could not help but believe him for the past ten years id cursed the name of hamilton considered him a villain and an enemy and now it seems he was not i felt sick and foolish and drunk and much as i had the night before with mrs lavien i felt ashamed i remained silent trying to think of everything and blot out all memory and to do both these things at once while i considered this revelation too astonished and angry to speak leonidas made polite conversation i looked over at hamilton hardly knowing what to make of the long patrician face before me for ten years i had hated this man as the author of my ruin and when the country at least the jeffersonian part of it began to hate him as well to make him the central agent of corruption in our government i could not help but feel that at last the universe had aligned itself with my perceptions of it now it seemed i hardly knew anything of the man when i turned my attention to his conversation with my slave it seemed they were talking of my troubles with my landlady and this happened the same night mrs pearson contacted him hamilton was saying that does sound suspicious captain i cannot pay your way in the world but i can send a representative to speak to your landlady and ask her on behalf of the government to give you three months to set your affairs in order will that be sufficient it is kind i admitted grudgingly though i attempted not to sound sullen one never likes to see a man he is used to hating prove himself magnanimous i am grateful but i must ask you again to put me to work to make use of my skills your skills are formidable and i could use a man like you he said but i cannot have you inquiring into something involving these people to whom you are so nearly connected not only will i not engage your services i must ask you to have nothing to do with the matter stay out of laviens way you cannot expect me to ignore mrs pearsons distress i said you will stay away from her he answered his voice becoming harsh i understand there is a gathering in a few days at the bingham house i said airily im sure the lady will be in attendance for she and mrs bingham are good friends perhaps i shall tend to her there damn it saunders you will stay away from mrs pearson in this inquiry this is not a game there are spies everywhere and there is more at risk here than you can imagine spies what the british the spanish who he let out a long breath the jeffersonians i barked out a laugh you are afraid of a member of your own administration laugh if you like but jeffersons ambition knows no bounds and he would do anythingdestroy me the american economy even washingtons reputationif it meant advancing his own ends have you never looked at his vile newspaper the national gazette written by that scoundrel philip freneau it is full of the most hateful lies have you so forgotten the past that you think no ill of maligning washington of course i have no patience for insults against washington i said i revere him as a patriot ought but that is beside the point as near as i can tell you wish me not to help fleets daughter because you fear jefferson perhaps i should speak with him stay away from him said hamilton his voice was now nearly a hiss stay away from jefferson from mrs pearson and from this inquiry i will not allow your curiosity to risk everything ive attempted to accomplish everything he had attempted to accomplish there was clearly much more happening here than he would admit and i knew i could not convince him to tell me instead i tried to show myself reasonable then put me to use on another matter i said if he did so he would pay me which would be of great benefit and then i could inquire into whatever i liked he shook his head my willingness to change the subject appeared to ease him considerably the redness in his face lessened and his posture became less rigid captain i wish i could do so but look at you it is not ten in the morning and you are already besotted with drink you are terribly disordered give me a few hours to clear up the business with your landlady and then go home rest and consider your future in a few months come see me if you are in better order we can talk about a position at that time i am hardly the only man in philadelphia to take a drink in the morning i said he leaned forward i am not a fool captain i know the difference between a drinker and a drunkard i thought to rise and announce my indignation but i did not feel it i could be besotted with drink and still best lavien or anyone else he thought to employ over me i had no doubt that events would soon prove it joan maycott spring our meeting with colonel tindall left me feeling as though the earth itself had been taken apart and set back together though not precisely the way it had been before we came out of his house stunned and stiff as though from a funeral the sky was shockingly blue the way it so often seems in its brightness to stand in counterpoint to our own inner turmoil but over pittsburgh a cloud of smoke and coal fire hung like a vision of perdition to add to this effect we found reynolds waiting by a pair of mules which had our possessions already loaded he looked us over perhaps attempting to evaluate how we had chosen with tindall then he laughed hendry and phineasll be here soon theyll take you out to your plot i cant go with you he looked out to the expanse of wilderness i aint made to feel welcome andrew said nothing allowing the silence to cast its own withering retort i got to get back east to my wife said reynolds as though we were all old friends shes pretty like yours it dont suit for a man to be too long away from his wife andrew remained silent look here maycott let me give you some advice i know we aint got along on the way out here but i had to keep order and thats what i done dont mean i got anything against you and the way things are with tindall dont think i dont know i say so what if he wants your wife what does it signify hes an old man probably cant do much anyhow why not give him what he asks you get something for it and it dont really cost you anything would you prostitute your wife andrew asked he shrugged depends on what was in it for me if i was in your shoes its what id do i aint been put up to this by tindall im just telling you what i think he put out his hand for shaking and when andrew did not take it he shrugged and walked across the grounds disappearing into the stables we waited there an hour until hendry and phineas appeared on horseback they provided ragged horses for us to ride and soon we were upon a dirt track through the wilderness well beaten and pocked with hoof marks and old manure we rode through barren landscape for more than half a day the land was thick with oak and sugar maple and chestnut and birch trees surrounded by brambles and boulders and rotten logs as large and ornate as monuments animals too we saw deer scatter and bears off in the distance and the occasional wolf loped along our path mouth open in lazy defiance there were other wild things too along the barely discernible path from time to time we passed clusters of cabins and dirty ragged people who stopped their toil to watch us oneeyed men looked up from their fieldwork or tree felling or tanning the women stared like feral things their faces sunblasted and soulless their bodies twisted and bent far more terrible in appearance than the most wretched creature id seen in pittsburgh i understood without being told that though life in the west might be hard for men it was doubly so for women once the hunting and farming and clearing were done a man might settle down with his whiskey and his twist of tobacco but a woman would still be cooking and mending and spinning i feared in my heart that i should become one of those broken horrid things i did not tremble to lose what men called beauty but i feared the loss of my spirit and humor and love of living the things i believed made my soul human and vibrant finally and seemingly without cause hendry called for us to stop we were upon a spot of the forest no different as far as i could tell from any other while he picked at a scab on his face hendry gazed about taking stock of tree and rock and sky looky there he said pointing to a large boulder up ahead maybe a quarter of a mile thats the north border of your land he said them thick trees we passed back there the ones with white paint on em thats the southern border lotta rattlesnakes near there if you care to mind em dont matter to me the rest of it runs from here to the creek on the east and west to the other creek unload the mules and good luck to ye what i cried out i wanted to be as stoic as sturdy as andrew but i could not help it youre going to leave us in the wilderness with no roof over our heads shelter aint my worry he said my worry is getting the animals back this is your land what you bargained for so here it is do with it what you want you dont like living on it go find a room in town its nothing to do with me though id advise you to be on your guard for painters too many of them about this spring what is a painter asked andrew hendry looked at phineas and they both laughed they dont know about painters phineas said with an unmistakable tone of cruelty guess theyll find out hendrys nose had begun to run as a consequence of his mirthful snorting he wiped it with his forearm you talk smart but youll get a good schooling wont you maybe in its jaws a painter is like a cat if you know what one of them is but about ten times bigger and it likes to eat fresh and tender eastern folk id had quite enough of mr hendry i believe you mean a panther if you wish to mock people for their ignorance you ought at least to say what you mean call the critter any name you like itll tear the bubbies right off you all the same enough you are going so get gone andrew said he put a hand on my shoulder thats a good thankee for one whats brung you home hendry snorted phineas eyed me unkindly dont signify theyll be dead fore end of winter you cant leave us here how i hated the tears that welled up in my eyes but i could endure it no longer are we to sleep on the ground like animals andrew shook his head i know how to make a shelter and endure far worse than this well make do never you mind i caint say what you brung in your packs hendry said but from the looks of you i reckon you come with nothing and expect the spirits of the woods to raise you up a wigwam well good luck i say for yer on yer own now i dont doubt theyll do fine said a voice from behind us but if you please my good turd they wont do it alone i turned and saw two dozen men and nearly that many women some of whom had children clinging to their skirts or babes in their arms there were beastsa quartet of sturdy horses a pair of mules and half a dozen frolicking dogs nearly all the men wore western attire and they carried guns and knives and had tomahawks looped to their belts they looked like white savages clad in beast skins and furs and yet for all that a humanity shone through the one whod spoken stepped forward he was a tall man almost a giant i thought and looking every bit the frontiersman in western garb and reddish whiskers which were if not long then at least ornate his mustaches in particular drooped down from his face with a curious flourish this man removed his raccoon cap to bow revealing an entirely bald head lorcan dalton at your service he said his voice redolent with the tones of an irishman returning the hat to his head he said well get to more introductions soon enough but first lets get these villains back to their master haint no call for unkindness said phineas you want kindness you quit tindall mr dalton said hendry turned his horse to face mr dalton you act like we ought to fear you irisher mr dalton grinned showing a mouth of regular brown teeth reynolds used to bring out the new ones he doesnt do it now does he guess maybe that pretty wife back east dont like the scar hendry said nothing he and phineas tied together the horses and mules and rode off without a backward glance i never lament seeing the back of hendry said mr dalton and id only relish the front if there were a bullet in it hes worse than any two indians and only makes amends for it with his lack of cunning now then lets let the women start making us some repast while we men get to working lot of folks come out here mr maycott who never got their hands too dirty before but you dont look like that sort you look like youre equal to some hard work i reckon i am andrew said but what work is that they bring you out here dalton said and they leave you here and why not tindall and duerthey dont care if we live and would rather we die for they can then turn about and pass the land along to another victim its why they dont trouble themselves to do aught about the redskins but we look after one another here many folks on the border have turned savage hardly better than indians but we dont let that happen new folks get the help they need and all we ask in return is that you do your share when the next new man arrives of course said andrew i saw he was moved by the kindness perhaps back home he would have made free with his emotions but the western frontier was no place to be a man of feeling now youll need a place to sleep dalton said so weve come to build you a shelter and we had better get to work if were to make any progress before the sun goes down so it was that our first day upon our new land showed us both the lowest depths of human greed and evil and the great generosity of the human heart t hey were wondrous in their skills felling trees cutting them to size and with ropes slung across their shoulders and feet dug in like horses dragging them to where they might be of use my innocence coupled with their singleminded labor in which they were more like buzzing bees than men led me to believe that they might build a cabin entire upon the spot but such luxury was not to be ours their design was instead what is commonly called a halffaced campa shelter made of logs composed of but three walls with a fire built on the fourth side to keep the inhabitants warm and the beasts at a distance the roof was made of a combination of crossbeams and thatching and would be of limited value in any great rain but it was far superior to the wild nothingness to which i had believed we had been consigned andrew had brought with him the tools of his trade and the hardened frontiersmen were pleased and impressed by his carpentry it seemed he possessed some special new way of bracing the logs together and they were glad of his addition to the community if that term could be used for such isolation while the men worked the women provided me with instructions on how best to build a fire and fetch water and regaled me with more information than i could hope to absorb on the spinning of flax the preparation of bear meat the uses of bear fat and a thousand other things i could not recall the next day our rude shelter was completed shortly before dark and i thought we should be left alone to our first night in the woods but it seemed that the assistance they provided was in part an excuse to gather the fire that burned outside our shelter was joined by a series of others and soon the women were roasting meats boiling porridge and teaching me to make a kind of western bread called johnnycake made of nothing but corn flour and water and grilled into flat pieces useful for taking in a travel bag these women were helpful but reservedsuspicious i believed of what they saw as eastern refinement my education my manner of speech my obvious fear of the west and its environs yet they did their best with me and explained about the settlement a rough and loose confederation of cabins bound together by little more than vague proximity and a few points of social contact the church which lacked any sort of clergyman unless an itinerant wandered through a rough imitation of a tavern called the indian path a mill and mr daltons house he owned the whiskey still which made him something of a grandee i struggled to feel at ease but andrew seemed to have no difficulties these westerners valued competence above nearly all else and he impressed our neighbors with his skills that day of these men two in particular interested me one was a man my own age not yet thirty by my estimate one of the few to keep his face free of whiskers though it was possible that he could not grow them he was handsome in a rugged sort of way with wide eyes that seemed forever lost in thought he had assisted in the hard labor of building the halffaced camp and in so doing he had exhibited extraordinary strength more than once he had been called over by some great bull of a man who wanted this smaller mans assistance in rolling a log or pulling an unmovable lever yet though he exhibited in a thousand ways signs of great strength and no aversion to using it his interactions lacked the open ease that most men exhibit with one another at times he and mr dalton exchanged a quiet word but mostly he kept to himself now that the time of merriment had come he neither ate nor drank as much as the other men but only sat by mr daltons side sipping his whiskey while others gulped smiling politely at jokes while others guffawed and brayed laughter the second man piqued my interest also because he was so different he was no older than mr dalton but while the great irishmans power rendered him ageless this man had something of a scholarly look about him and seemed to me almost old he wore not the rough clothes of a border man but the practical breeches and shirt and coat of a successful tradesman of the middle rank he kept his gray hair long and his beard short and perched upon his nose was a pair of little round spectacles he sat upon the ground with the other men and he drank his whiskey with them but i observed that on several occasions he turned to look at me when our eyes met he turned away and reddened slightly i have been gazed upon by men before sometimes in the predatory manner of a colonel tindall but here was something else i did not know what it was precisely but it neither frightened nor offended me the other women noted his interest as well and while they talked and gossiped one creature a rugged and meaty woman they called rosalie with hair somewhere between straw and white let out a snort she told me she was not yet forty she had once been perhaps pretty but now her face had been leathered by the elements her hands calloused and sunspotted that scotsman should learn to keep his eyes to himself or i reckon your husband will relieve him of one of them who is he i asked he was a schoolteacher said another woman older and thicker than the first and with but three or four teeth in her head in connecticut they say but there was a scandal with a married woman and now here he is gawking at you like you aint got a husband right before him he dont belong here said rosalie and would never have no companionship neither if it werent for dalton he and the scot make their whiskey together and are friends like but then dalton has his own way with friends all the women tittered at this and i suppose if i had felt more at ease with their company i should have asked about this secret but as they did not volunteer i did not inquire i think they did not like my reserve and one of these women whispered something in the ear of another and she in turn looked at me with face frozen for a long moment before she burst out in laughter i loathed this feeling of being unwanted and longed to join the gathering of men i would have even consented to drink their whiskey if necessary as i lamented my state the scottish gentleman whom they called skye rose from his seat and approached our fire the women began a fresh round of whispering and laughter but fell into an awkward silence as the man came toward us and took a seat in the dirt next to me i beg your pardon mrs maycott he said in a scots brogue that reminded me of my father but we havent met i am john skye youve met her husband ill wager said rosalie igniting a general laughter maybe shell take it kindly if you give her your shake spear said one of the others lord knows annie janson werent impressed cried a third to much amusement might i have a private word with you he asked of me i looked at the faces about me and knew they disapproved but i could not live my life for their favor i pushed myself to my feet and he followed and we walked away from the womens fire listening to their cackles and their hooting we did not step far remaining close to the mens fire andrew looked at me and smiled and then returned to a conversation with mr dalton never had there been any mistrust between us on this score and certainly he could not have mistaken my interest in mr skye and found it inappropriate andrew would have seen the thing for precisely what it was and found amusement in it here among the rough and unlettered folk of the west i had found perhaps the only person of a literary turn your husband tells me you are a great reader of books mrs maycott he said i wished to let you know that i am lucky enough to possess no small number of volumes and i should be happy to lend you what you wish you are kind i said though i am not sure a roofed patch of forest floor is the best place to bring so precious a thing as a book youll have your own home soon enough your husband will fell some seventy or eighty good trees in his spare time and when these are assembled we will have a cabinraising party if he is industrious about it you should be inside doors within a month or two i laughed a month or two sounds to me like a long time to be outsideofdoors he coughed into his fist i am fortunate enough to be in possession of a large home in which i live alone i have two stories and several rooms you may if you wish pass the time there i have already made the offer to your husband the two of you may stay with me i sensed that he wished to add that if i chose to stay while andrew worked about the property i should be most welcome but he did not yield to the temptation instead he offered me a crooked smile in which his teeth very white for a man his age glistened in the light of the fires it is a funny thing is it not people such as ourselves cast adrift in a place such as this how can you be certain that you and i are people of the same sort i asked him though not unkindly he addressed me with an attention that was not entirely appropriate but the great difference in our ages and the proximity of my husband not many feet away made me feel there could be no danger in it i looked over at the beardless young man who continued to sit with the others and yet somehow hold himself aloof pray who is that gentleman i asked mr skye he let out a guffaw mrs maycott there are no gentlemen in the west that man however is jericho richmond he is mr daltons friend does he have but one i thought i had observed that you are mr daltons friend indeed i am my life should be far more difficult without his friendship jericho however is dalton s very good friend they live in the same home he is a handsome man does he not have a wife i was led to believe that people married quite young in the west mr skye cleared his throat he and dalton are very good friends i then understood the nature of the connection and that it was to be spoken of only obliquely in some strange way these ruffians of the west were more tolerant out of necessity than men of the east jericho richmond from what i had observed worked with every bit the vigor as any other man and that was no doubt all that was required of him it was hell we had come to there could be no doubt of it but it was turning out to be a curiously complex sort of hell t he scene was almost merry one fellow named isaac who worked for dalton he called his men whiskey boys and they ran his spirits throughout the four countiesplayed a tolerable fiddle another whiskey boy a oneeyed fellow entertained the children with the story of how he had fifteen years earlier been transported to america for the crime of catching a twopound trout in a squires pond andrew stood with his arm around my shoulder staring at our little hut made by his labor and the communitys and i knew he was in some small measure happy or at the very least satisfied the frolic as such parties were termed had been under way many hours and the men had swallowed a river of whiskey before trouble showed itself one of the men who had done much of the work had struck me as the most unsavory of this western lot he was like andrew a carpenter as with many western men it was hard to guess his age concealed as his face was beneath hair and grime but i imagined him to be near forty and hardened by his years in the wilderness he wore an old hunting shirt much in need of mending and had a wild prophets beard near as black as midnight soiled with food and wood shavings and i suspected his own vomit the other men made no secret of their dislike for him but they tolerated him for his expertise indeed i suspected that one reason andrew had been so instantly embraced was because his carpentry skills meant the settlement would be less dependent upon this vile man andrew had taken his measure early on there had been a dark anger in his eyes when andrew had mentioned his trade the bearded man mueller by name had spat and shaken his head lot of eastern men call themselves what they like out here they aint nothing no one calls himself carpenter till i give leave rather than take offense or give challenge to this bumptious boasting andrew had instead given the man the respect he craved if mueller was nearby whenever andrew performed some operation he would ask the ruffian his opinion he watched mueller work and asked questions or made observations upon his skillwhich he informed me was really quite impressive i hate it when men are full of bluster but without merit he said but i hate it more when they actually know of what they speak this show of respect did its business and soon enough mueller was putting his arm about andrew drunkenly shouting that this city dweller would be a man yet dalton had informed us that mueller lived some distance away and had little to do with their community except at those events where his skills could not be done without andrew understood that the best course was to pretend friendship and then send him on his way at the frolic however mueller would not leave andrews side and his companyalong with his stench his belligerence and his propensity for physical contactbegan to grow wearisome even oppressive westerners drink whiskey as though it were beer but even by those standards mueller drank great quantities when hed had enough to kill two ordinary men he began to stagger on his feet and speak so he could hardly be understood his beard became a great greasy tangle of gristle and tobacco and once though i did not know its origin blood all night id feared hed been racing toward confrontation and at last i was proved right he approached andrew and gave him a shove in his chest you got a nice woman there maycott he shouted though they stood but inches from one another andrew offered a faint smile and then shrugged gesturing toward the crowd of people who gathered around while the fiddle player scratched at his instrument a dozen or more westerners sang along to lily in the garden and andrew wished to communicate that these conditions made conversation difficult i wouldnta thought you could land such a pretty thing to look at you mueller shouted maybe she wants to sit on my lap one carpenters as good as another eh andrew forced a weak smile i do love your good cheer friend he cast me a glance which i understood to mean he wished me to disappear from the drunkards sights i had been delivering a dish of roasted turkey to the gathering so i set it down and turned to make my way back to the cooking fire mueller however reached out and grabbed my wrist sit on my lap i said andrew stepped between us it was one thing to placate such men when they were merely boorish but here was something else and he would not let it pass unchallenged you grow too warm he said in a voice firm though not yet challenging mueller let go of me and rose to his feet and you forget your place andrew appeared to all the world placid but i knew a fire raged inside him my place he said in the softest of tones hardly audible over the music is looking to my wifes honor you know that if you must challenge me for doing my duty i stand ready it is no more than i did in the war isaac still fiddled and the singers still sang but this conflict had attracted no small attention mr skye who from his expression indicated he had expected it all along was standing now at my side mr dalton and jericho richmond were there too and i saw from the formers face that he wished to save andrew this fight he opened his mouth ready to speak but mr richmond whispered something in his ear and so mr dalton held his tongue mueller gazed upon the onlookers and then at andrew there was a pause and then mueller lurched forward and wrapped his arms around andrewbut not in attack there was a gasp among the onlookers and several took steps back mr dalton and i both stepped forward but there was nothing to do mueller had embraced andrew in a hug you are in the right friend maycott i beg your pardon i thought at first he sobbed but no he let go at once and smiled through the foliage of his filthy beard and he clapped a hand upon andrews shoulder once more he said friend maycott as though they had been through many adventures together and no more needed to be expressed i did not care for it however a man like mueller might a quarter hour from now decide he had been humiliated and come upon andrew without warning i had not been dwelling on this thought for more than a moment before mr dalton appeared at my side youre not easy are you missus he said no i agreed that man is barbaric i think he is hardly sane he could be about murder before andrew had a chance to defend himself can he not be cast out mr dalton shook his head thats not what you want mrs maycott its best he be got rid of but you dont want him making you and yours the object of his anger then who i asked though i believed i already knew the answer ill tend it weve got a new carpenter now and a better one ill ease your husbands way he said nothing else for a moment only shifted away from me and toward mr richmond with whom he began a private conversation keeping one eye the entire time upon his target after a moment mueller looked over and dalton pointed to him and said something to mr richmond who responded with a hearty laugh that was the bait and it was quickly taken mueller was at once upon his feet he strode four or five steps over to the two men and kicked dirt upon the younger one you have something to say to me richmond both men met his gaze but it was dalton who spoke sit back down mueller maybe this time you can leave the frolic without a fight what if i dont i aint lost one yet you havent fought me yet have you dalton said his irish inflection exaggerated not yet and maybe not tonight tis your good wife i heard laughing at me he flicked his hand contemptuously at mr richmond dalton took a step forward what say you mueller laughed he raised his mug to drink but it missed his mouth entirely and sloshed down his thick neck soaking his hunting shirt i guess miss richmonds afraid to fight the irisher i dont doubt is the man of the house i reckon every morning this was as far as the speech progressed for dalton whod had in his mouth a thick wad of tobacco spat it into muellers face remarkably he missed the beard near entire and the shot landed true in the ruffians eye i watched in stunned silence clutching andrews hand these men were about to engage in brutal bloody maybe deadly combat but i could not regret it better mueller should fight mr dalton upon these terms than fight andrew even so i had the uncomfortable feeling i had done something if not precisely wrong then at least improper dalton made the choice to put himself at risk but i could not shake the feeling that he did so for me not for andrew and that i had somehow without meaning to convinced him to act mueller stood still his face red in the light of the fire the wet of dalton s tobacco shimmering on his forehead the crowd stepped forward one mass of hands pulled at mueller the other mr dalton in my innocence i believed that the people wished to stay the hand of violence but that was not the western way it soon became clear that there were rules to be obeyed in an instant the fiddler was done playing and the singing and dancing had come to an end here was the real entertainment of the evening andrew was soon at my right side mr skye remaining at the other one of mr daltons men the unnaturally tall fellow isaac stepped into the ring of onlookers circling some fifteen feet across whats it to be boys he called dalton did not hesitate eyes something dark very much like fear crossed muellers face still slick from the tobacco he might have resented the insult but apparently did not mind the substance enough to wipe it away now he squinted narrowly and gritted his teeth aye he said eyes this all sounded confusing to me which mr skye observed surely youve wondered why so many men here are missing an eye he said tis a common challenge they fight until one man takes the others but thats monstrous i had been pleased that dalton had been so willing to fight mueller but i had not wanted this if mr dalton were to lose an eye i would be responsible tis the west but fear not dalton s never yet lost as you can see from his face and hes been yearning for an excuse to shut muellers mouth for two years now it appears that mr mueller has clearly never lost this challenge either said andrew he dont often take it he cant afford to lose an eye in his trade which youll no doubt understand and at the risk of revealing a partiality hes never fought dalton before and dalton you might have observed is angry he dont take too kind to remarks about richmond i looked over at jericho richmond who stood on the sidelines arms folded watching without agitation indeed there was a little smirk upon his lips satisfied and a bit impatient as though the outcome of the contest was already decided the two men were released dalton at once leaped into the air like a panther and landed hard upon mueller the two crashed upon the ground and i heard something crack though i could not say if it was twig or bone the crowd of westerners grunted their approval a few men cheered and one little boy laughed like a shrill madman but none moved closer the circle remained still and solid as if this were some sacred place of druid worship dalton now lay upon mueller his knee pressed across the carpenters chest his thick left arm keeping muellers own arms pinned it was a matter of balance the result of the momentum of dalton s leap and it could not have been more than a second or two before mueller forced dalton off and changed the balance of momentum the irishmans face grimaced with determination and understanding he bit his lip like a concentrating child as he examined the field of battle and quickly in an instant too fleeting to be called thought saw his opportunities and formulated his strategy he raised up his right hand his thumb stuck out like a man beginning an ostentatious count it hung still no more than an instant but i saw that hand like an icon like a standard glowing orange in the light of half a dozen fires and then it plummeted downward with the fury of a hawk seeking its prey mueller let out a piercing cry of surprise which changed in an instant to a howl of pain i felt myself tremble with fear and pity and disgust mr dalton then stood his face and shirt were covered with blood which also dripped copiously from his hand as though he had cut open his own flesh mueller lay upon the dirt curled up so i could not see his face but he emitted a horrible chilling noise a lamentation for his life as it had been as dark blood pooled about his head mr skye tsked like an irritated upper servant you cant call the man inefficient he looked at andrew dalton s a good friend to have andrew nodded too numb from horror and surprise to say much its well he seems to like me he managed though he spoke hardly louder than a whisper he likes you both said mr skye and he dont take to strangers that often he glanced back at muellers pathetic form i guess thats the lesson though you cant be friends with everyone not out here you make your friends but you make your enemies as well ethan saunders having given hamilton enough time to work whatever magic he intended to work i returned to my rooms at mrs deishers house that afternoon where i found that stout german lady ready and willing to receive me once her girl opened the door the landlady herself forced her massive bosoms past the servant and thrust them toward me mr saunders she said i your pardon beg i mean to say captain saunders i trouble myself for the misunderstanding but the man from the government has everything made clear are you hungry may i make for you something to eat be easy on the matter of food i said i am however much in need of a wash and a change of clothes not having had access to fresh linens in well over a day she colored i must beg again your pardon captain now i shall send my charlotte to bring for you the waters i smiled benevolently at her for now we were good friends all was easy between us and we had nothing but love in our hearts oh and one more thing mrs deisher before i send you away please be so good as to mention why precisely you chose that night to cast me out she cringed a bit at this it was just a notion a terrible foolish notion you must forgive i continued to smile but my voice was icy i shall forgive you when you tell me the truth oh i would never lie she said to her shoes madam you have seen how friendly i am with the government if you do not tell me what i ask i shall have you arrested for a foreign spylets say french since the notion of a german spy is absurdand you will be cast out of the country forever perhaps as reward i shall be given your property for my own leonidas take a letter for me dear secretary hamilton it is with grave concern that i must report to you the presence enough she called i will tell you only you must not say i did he promised to hurt me if i did not remain quiet i shall protect you with my life i said if you but tell me it was a very uncivilizedlooking man she said with a gray beard and long hair he gave his name as reynolds he paid me twentyfive dollars and said he would burn down my house if i did not do as he says did he say who he was or why he wished me gone she shook her head no but i believed him he seemed to me like the sort of man who might a house burn i nodded be so kind as to give me the twentyfive dollars i think ive earned it i have already spent it she said then give me a different twentyfive dollars i have not got it perhaps she could apply it to what you owe suggested leonidas it was not as good as having twentyfive dollars in my pocket but it would have to do i turned to mrs deisher i accept those terms now lets not forget about my bath she stood and shook her head it dont make sense what is that he say this reynolds that he throw you out behalf of secretary hamilton but he must lie for it is secretary hamilton that make me take you in i felt something like a dog catching a familiar scent in the air leonidas turned quickly but i caught his eye and gave him a most subtle shake of the head long ago i learned that when someone inadvertently stumbles upon something important you do not draw attention to it how interesting i said in order to say something now to the bath there could be no further progress without washing off the accumulated filth of my trials at last i was able to remove the grime and humiliation of the past two nights the warm water was a balm the clean clothes as good as a full nights sleep once i had cleaned myself and had leonidas shave me i felt free to examine my reflection in the mirror that hung over my fireplace in truth i was not entirely displeased my face was a bit contused there were bruises and a few wounds which were healing far more slowly than they had in my youth but in my newly scrubbed state these now bespoke manly combat and not impoverished desperation able to enjoy the calm of my room i sat in a wellpadded chair near the window in the fading afternoon light across from me leonidas put away the shaving things once finished he took one of the chairs and gave me a meaningful look perhaps he said it is time to consider your next move do you truly wish to squander your time attempting to find mr pearson of course i intend to find him he leaned forward in his serious way ethan you should think about this you have little money right now and i understand that you care for mrs pearson but caring does not mean you must sacrifice yourself to her memory if mr lavien does not wish your help perhaps the matter is in hand to begin with i would never turn my back on an old commitment i am not convinced of that he said with much bitterness ive seen it happen i was not about to get dragged into another conversation about his emancipation on top of that i have been personally injured men have sought to intimidate and harm me to have me cast from my home i cannot simply turn my back and what is most amazing to me is hamilton all these years i believed it was he who chose to ruin my reputation by putting it about that i had committed treason and i hated him for it now it seems i was mistaken hamilton turns out to be a fairly decent fellow and he went so far as to say that he values my skills what of it dont you see if i can find pearson first if i can beat lavien at his own game hamilton will bring me back into government service i will be of use again leonidas i cannot let something like that slip between my fingers how are you going to best a man like mr lavien who has his own impressive skills is younger than you and enjoys the protection and power of the government i believe we shall do so not by pursuing the obvious but by pursuing lines of inquiry that are ours exclusively what do we know that lavien does not we dont know what lavien knows since he wont share anything but we can operate on certain assumptions let us assume first of all that lavien and hamilton dont know about the irishman they certainly dont know about the note from mrs pearson and it seems to me likely that they dont know about this reynolds man pretending to be one of their own lavien has been looking for pearson for nearly a week now but he does not seem close to finding him otherwise he would not have followed mrs pearson to my rooms im sure he is going about it the usual wayspeaking to his family his friends his business associatesbut this method has yielded him nothing we shall try it my way leonidas the old fleet and saunders method and we shall see who finds the man first and what does that mean he asked i took out my stolen timepiece and checked what oclock it was lets return to see hamilton i have an important question for him leonidas shook his head he wont like it i know i said its why we need to find a newspaper first i will require something to persuade the secretary to be amiable a newspaper he repeated i was on my feet reaching for my hat you were not so privileged as to be in my company when i served the nation during the war leonidas no but i have heard the stories he said his tone implying that they were somehow tedious i must have misunderstood him this is your lucky day then now you will at last see how business is done it had surprised me how quickly hamilton had seen me that morning it did not surprise me that he made us wait well over an hour that afternoon we sat in a vestibule outside the front office which was in turn outside hamilton s sanctum anxiouslooking clerks hurried in and out avoiding eye contact with us it was daylight albeit of a gray and cloudy sort when we entered the treasury buildings and darkness fell while we awaited hamilton s pleasure a pair of young negroes came around lighting candles and lamps and as they passed through our room they nodded at leonidas who nodded back did they know one another or was this merely the recognition of race at last a clerk ushered us into the treasury secretarys office which in the darkness had a far more dour and constricted feel hamilton sat at his desk and hovered over his oillit work like an angry bear in its cave i had not expected to see you so soon he said and you do not sound happy to do so no matter we wont waste your time just a quick question and well be on our way i believe i was clear he said i do not want you inquiring into pearsons disappearance and what makes you think i am doing that look at you you are like a dog on a hunt only one question i said no saunders ill not play games with you you may wait there as long as you like but ill not start answering your questions he turned to his paper and began writing i anticipated this i said leonidas please hand me that newspaper i asked you to bring along i expected we would have to wait and so i brought reading material it is the national gazette which you mentioned to me earlier hamilton looked up clearly unhappy that i would read a paper whose single purpose was to attack him i do love this paper i said and its editor mr philip freneau clever fellow now that i think on it i have an excellent idea for an article take a letter leonidas dear mr freneau you may not be aware of this stunning fact but apparently alexander hamilton is currently employing his own jewish half brother to inquire into the mysterious dealings of a noted philadelphia gentleman to hamilton i said i know the halfbrother business is false but it will get his attention and ill let him sort the rest out himself you know how scrupulous these journalistic fellows are about their facts enough hamilton slammed his hand against the desk you would not dare just a simple question colonel much easier that way damn it saunders what is this about it is about fleet and about his daughter i would think you of all people would understand it was always said that you were a man for the ladies his eyes narrowed in anger if you think he began to bark i dont mean you are a scoundrel as your enemies like to cast about i mean you understood the old ways that a man must do what is right to protect a woman a woman who however incidentally has crossed under his protection so long as i think there is any chance of cynthia pearson being in danger i will try to protect her you may as well settle in for a long siege he shook his head sadly and slumped slightly in his chair very well if it will make you go away see nothing simpler my question is fairly simple does the name reynolds mean anything to you i had anticipated denial or obfuscation or genuine confusion i did not anticipate what actually happened hamilton leaped to his feet his heavy chair toppled behind him even in the poorly lit chamber i could see his face had turned red what do you mean by this he shouted do you think to push my endurance to its limits i exchanged a look with leonidas who was as confused as i to hamilton i affected calm always the best way with a man in a rage i mean nothing colonel the man who paid my landlady to cast me out said his name was reynolds i merely wished to see if you knew him apparently you do hamilton blinked at me several times and then at leonidas he turned around righted his chair and sat down again he dusted off a spot on his desk i dont know the name it means nothing to me just so i said i thought as much for your ignorance of the name effectively explains your outburst well ill just post a letter to mr freneau perhaps he can do a bit of digging into the matter for me oh sit down hamilton suddenly sounded tired ill tell you but you must promise not to pursue this and i dont want you coming to my office and threatening me every time you have a question absolutely i said knowing full well i meant to take the information on any terms now and worry about the meaning of those terms later since you are such a close reader of mr freneaus paper hamilton said you are undoubtedly familiar with the name william duer from the war as well he supplied the army didnt he thats right said hamilton he also served as my assistant for the first few months of my term at treasury but duer despite his patriotic impulses was always looking for a better opportunity he and i were once close friends but things have been strained between us i did not like the way in which he executed his duties while he served as my assistant and he has also shown a coarse side at other times as you know the bank of the united states launched last summer and the price of shares soared astronomically duer invested heavily but his investment became not only a sign but a symptom he is so wealthy he invests so much money and his choices are of so much interest that duers actions not only reflect or even moderately affect the market they directly shape it when he buys everyone buys when he sells everyone sells try to understand what i am telling you ours is a unique economy unlike any in the history of the world for two reasons in most nations trading is centralizedin london paris amsterdam in our country a man is used to thinking of his state as an autonomous entity and the first reason is that trading is decentralizedin new york philadelphia boston and so on the other reason is that the nation is new and in terms of the number of major participants very small one man a single actor can alter the shape of the market if he is careful or careless observed leonidas hamilton nodded precisely duer i fear may be both he uses his undue influenceunderstand me that he has an influence unlike any other single man in any single market in the history of finance as we know ithe uses this power to manipulate prices to his advantage sending up the price of shares he planned to raise them to their limit and then sell at an enormous profit crashing the value of bank shares as he did so before things could get so far out of hand i let it be known that i thought the trading price of bank shares was inflatedand in doing so depressed the market costing duer a great deal of money he was very angry with me go on i said this reynolds works for duer i believe he may have been exacting some revenge on you in order to get to me colonel you and i have not spoken in ten years why would he use me to harm you he may have made assumptions he knows of you from the war perhaps he thought i would use you to conduct my inquiries such as the one involving mr pearson he wished to thwart me for the sake of vengeance i took a moment to let the silence do some work so duer is angry with you over an incident last summer and chooses to inconvenience me now as a way of extracting revenge revenge said hamilton or merely to push back at me and show me he still has power yes that is my theory in any case now you need but let the matter alone and i will see to it that you are not troubled any longer very kind but you know i think id like to speak to duer myself i presume i can find him with the other speculators at the city tavern hamilton sighed duer lives in new york he comes here on business but has not been in town for some weeks i believe he has some business in new york that absorbs his attention you see there is nothing for you to do and this matter has nothing to do with pearson i am asking you to let it alone i stood up of course it is hardly worth a trip to new york over something like this and i have other things to do besides hunting down duers man i am sorry to have troubled you good night colonel we strolled out of the office and past the clerks stationed outside surely you did not believe any of that said leonidas of course not i said but it was hardly to our advantage to push him further he did not want to tell us more and he would not have done so pressing him would have only made him angry for now we take what he has given us and see where it leads us leonidas was about to speak when a thunderous roar erupted from inside hamilton s office damn it cried the secretary of the treasury this cry was followed by the sound of glass breaking several of the clerks looked up from their work hesitated nervously and then returned to their business for our part we hurried outside and toward our next destination t he crooked knight was a decidedly jeffersonian tavern on the cusp of the northern liberties a wretched place on coats street near the public landing frequented by workingmen full of private rage masquerading as political anger these were the sorts who read freneaus national gazette aloud jeered at each mention of hamilton and cheered at every reference to jefferson indeed off in one corner a spot had been roped off for a cockfight between one bird stout and muscular and resplendent with shiny black feathersthis one called jeffersonand another scrawny and weak and palecalled hamilton each time the larger bird attacked the lesser the crowd cheered and cried out in praise of liberty and freedom this was in other words a tavern wholly dedicated to men of a democratic republican turn of mind these men believed the american project to have been already tainted by venality and corruption these were men who worshiped george washington as a god but were willing to damn him to hell for admitting hamilton into his inner circle these men had rioted against the ratification of the constitution without having troubled themselves to read itif they could read at all they would only have known that some petty john wilkes in their number had cried out that their liberties were in danger if there was beer enough they were always ready to answer the call it was not the sort of public house i frequented with any regularity i prefer taverns where i may game or drink in quiet or talk in peace with those to whom i wish to speak not cheer while a man i hardly know gives voice to a resentment i never knew i had the owner however was an old acquaintance if not precisely a friend and i had a reasonable expectation of obtaining some little help in that quarter the irishman outside the statehouse had identified himself as a man of the jeffersonian faction and if he drank in philadelphia it would likely be in the crooked knight or someplace like it it was my hope that there i could find some means of learning his name or location it was far less wet and cold than recent nights and as the tavern was the sort of place not likely to make a negro feel at his ease i asked leonidas to wait outside pushing open the wooden door i walked into a long lowceilinged room filled with tobacco stench wood smoke and the scent of sausages roasting in fires the men sat in small groups huddled around low tables their feet pressed into the dirt of the floor conversation which had been boisterous but a moment before at once tapered down as all inside stared at me the crooked knight was the sort of place outsiders sought to avoid i went at once to the bar where a man of exceptional shortness stood upon a box polishing mugs i knew him as leonard hilltop a humorless sort with deeply lined skin that looked like carved stone and hollow eyes dark in color and bright with thick swaths of red visible even in the poor light of that room in his youth he had been part of a network in occupied philadelphia that had passed intelligence often to me it did not make us friends but it made us familiar and there was undeniably trust and respect between us go back to your drink you sods called the little man hes all right this one the men did as they were told and at once the space was filled with the hum of conversation well now said hilltop that was my first lie of the evening let us hope it is the last i said he snorted what is this you run too big a debt in every other tavern in town and now you must drink here a bit of a risk isnt it the men here might not know your face but they know your name and what youre said to have done if i were to tell them who you are youd be torn to bits like that there federalist chicken he waved a hand toward the cockfight its well i can trust you to keep quiet then i said in any case you know the truth my reputation was fouled by federalists indeed you told me so yourself those many years ago you said it was hamilton that exposed me how precisely did you hear that hilltop christ i cant recall he said it was a long time ago it was just what i heard everyone said so i was not hopeful he would remember but it did no harm to ask in any case im sure you can spare a drink for an illused patriot perhaps that most american of elixirs which we call monongahela rye that drink of border men hideously taxed by the nefarious hamilton just a single glass of whiskey shall serve my purpose as you put it so said hilltop with a grimace like a man who had been outplayed at cards and now must accept defeat he poured a hearty quantity into a mug and handed it to me undiluted i tasted it and found it remarkably like that which the irishman had given me i set the glass down its good this whiskey aye the best there is where do you get it he grinned ive my sources i took another sip is your source a rugged irishman with a hairless and leathery skull had i knocked hilltop off his stool i could not have astonished him more and that was certainly my goal i might have worked the matter over slowly like a tongue in search of the precise location of a vaguely aching tooth but i saw no point in it hilltop was a suspicious sort and a direct approach seemed best hilltop had aided spies in the war but he was not a spy himself and had no training other than to hope what he did went unnoticed and this was often enough crudely practiced i noticed his eyes shift to a table where a man sat alone he was of about forty years with dark receding hair and a flat longmouthed froggish sort of face he sat hunched over a piece of paper quill in hand and did not so much as look up hilltop next glanced near the fire where two men sat in close conversation working hard to pretend they did not see me i took in this scene without giving hint to the men or to hilltop that i did so indeed i was able over the course of the next several minutes to reposition myself so i could keep a perpetual eye on these men without letting them know i did so what do you know of him hilltop asked me i know you know him i said as youve not troubled to inquire of whom i speak id like a word with him and i should very much prefer if he did not know i was coming what do you work for hamilton again hilltop asked me after all he done to you it was uncomfortably close to the truth and i could not afford the luxury of believing i was the only clever man in this conversation i have my own business with him i aint seen that man in here in some time hilltop said few months back he sold me a dozen barrels of this whiskey and i was happy to get my hands on it he aint been in since though i did hear tell of him not two weeks ago hilltop certainly had my attention though it was not so full as he believed but thinking me riveted by his intelligence he gave the slightest of nods to the two men by the fire one of them the taller and younger of the two handed something to the shorter and older then the first of these men rose and left the tavern i hated to let him go but i could only attempt to apprehend one man and i thought it might as well be the one who had whatever item had been passed off havent seen him hilltop was saying not personally but a week ago a patron of the knight says he saw him coming out of a boardinghouse on evont street near the corner of mary down in southwark i dont know if the irishman lived there or was visiting but this man said it was him all right i hoped to find him myself on account of wanting to buy more of his whiskey you know who he is i asked his name his business hilltop shook his head didnt say much but hed been hurt by hamilton s whiskey tax that much is certain the whiskey tax had been approved by congress as a simple means of helping fund the bank of the united states what better way to raise revenues it had been argued than to tax a luxury and a harmful one at that that many enjoyed let the men who would waste their time with strong drink pay for the economic growth of the new nation this had become a major cause of resentment among the democratic republican types who liked to pass their time as fate would have it by drinking whiskey the shorter and older man the one who had been given something of import now pushed himself away from his table and began to head for the door hilltop must have noticed my interest because he said let me pour you another one saunders even better than the first ill warrant it was tempting but i thanked hilltop and told him i would be back to collect it soon enough i moved to the door the man had his eye upon me and there could have been no way to move without attracting his notice he opened the front door and broke into a run i began to run as well a large man immediately stepped forward into my path but i dodged past him more lucky than skillful and was out of the tavern and into the cold leonidas was already on alert and i needed only to point to the running man to send him off in a mighty sprint i checked behind us and while the drinkers at the crooked knight had been willing to block my passage they were not willing to venture out into the night in an adventure that did not concern them seeing that no one pursued us i redoubled my efforts i felt a stitch in my side but i pushed onward not because i thought i could overtake leonidas but i wished not to be too terribly far behind when the man was brought down they turned north on st john toward brown street where the man headed west as he reached the corner of charlotte leonidas gave a great leap and tackled the man he landed flat with his arms outstretched and i arrived upon the scene just in time to observe the stranger attempt to slip something into his mouth i could not see it well in the lamplight but it was small and shiny leonidas did not notice for he was too occupied in keeping the man down so though i was still twenty feet away my side ached and i feared i might vomit up the whiskey id been drinking i found strength to dash forward and stomp my foot down upon the mans wrist it did the business for his hand opened and out rolled a silver ball about the size of a large grape i had not seen one since the war but i knew what it was immediately and i felt a chill of terror run through me whatever i was now involved in whatever cynthia pearson had become trapped in was far more dangerous than i had imagined i had only just secured the ball when things happened in an astonishing succession leonidas slumped forward letting out a loud grunt the man under him scrambled backward and ran off down charlotte street and i was once more surrounded by nathan dorland and his several friends i t was dorland and the same three men who had assaulted me outside the tavern in helltown i could not imagine how they had found me but they must have followed us to the crooked knight and then out again without taking more than a cursory glance toward dorland and his men most of whom had pistols i slipped the silver ball into my pocket and leaned down to see if leonidas was hurt he had been struck in the head with a pistol and he bled but not egregiously he stirred now and rubbed the back of his head and then rose slowly and deliberately like a great monster rising from its lair who struck me his voice was calm but full of quiet coiled menace what shall you return violence to a white man asked dorland consider yourself fortunate i did not shoot you on sight hold i said the time for holding is done said dorland youll not have anyone to rescue you this time saunders you are finished i did not want to be finished i had cynthia pearson to protect and i had not quite at my fingertips the prospect of redemption of returning to the service of my country i had the silver ball in my pocket and i could not guess what mysteries it contained i had important work before me and i could no longer afford this game with dorland once his rage and inept thirst for revenge had amused me because i could pull upon his strings and he would dance now it stood in my way cropping up when i would have quiet and calm leonidas had been hurt and might next time were i to escape to find a next time be killed it was all this and there was another thing it was what mrs lavien had said to me the night before that i had become something shameful but that each new day brought the promise of a new path her words reverberated now like a cold blade against my skin making me awake alert terrified it was for all these reasons and perhaps others that i turned to dorland and said what i said i have wronged you and then ridiculed you for that wrong i apologize though i know an apology will offer you little satisfaction instead i offer you what you have long wished for i shall meet you in accordance with the code duello at the time and place of your choosing dorland i accept your challenge well now said one of his friends i never would have thought it said another at almost the same time dorland however held up his hand in silence do you mock me not anymore i am done with that and i wont place my friends in danger any longer he shook his head i dont believe you saunders and if i did it would still be too late you had your chance for honor now it is time for an ignominious end that is not your choice said leonidas you must honor the code ill not take lessons in honor from a nigger said dorland then take the lesson from me said one of his friends he has accepted your challenge you cannot refuse to meet him on the field of honor he has no honor said dorland that doesnt matter said another of his friends he has accepted your challenge you must do it said the third one moment said dorland you are supposed to be with me on this macalister you swore you would aid me because he would not duel said the first man who had spoken i recalled him kicking my side in the helltown alley you asked me to be your second and i agreed now he says he will duel and you must agree dorlands plump face quivered but he is a veteran of the war i would have no chance against him you mean you will not duel asked macalister let us deal with him here and now said dorland and then the most astonishing thing happened the one called macalister walked away and the others followed dorland called after them but they did not look back there had been four of them and suddenly it was a dark alley and dorland stood alone with me and leonidas well i said this is what i believe is called a reversal leonidas took a step closer to him and dorland ran fast and hard i cannot even begin to guess when he noticed that no one ran after him i n the war it often happened that messages of vital import would need to be carried through dangerous lines various methods could be employed to preserve the secrecy of the message it could be written in code it might be carried by an unassuming courier it could be well hidden away but what happens when the courier is captured as must sometimes transpire one method was to carry the message written in a tiny hand upon a tiny piece of paper housed within a little silver ball if the courier was captured he could swallow the ball and then once free of the british for he would have nothing else upon his person to incriminate him could retrieve the ball at his own unpleasant leisure that the people involved in this scheme whatever it might be used such methods frightened me whom did they fear what must they communicate that required such secrecy i dared not open the ball in public but once leonidas and i returned to my rooms i pried it open and looked at the tiny parchment inside it read w qcas tfca r ozz cb eqvsrizs vsfs ies qcbhoqhe hc qcbtwfa voa eiegsqhe bchvwbu kwhvcih vwe wbhsftsfsbqs pie kwzz tozz pm aofqv its nonsense leonidas said its a cipher i told him and a fairly simple one this is quite clearly what is called a caesar code so named because it was allegedly invented by julius caesar himself each letter stands in place of another if you can break one letter you can usually break them all how can you do it he asked it can always be done merely by finding patterns common in writing i said given time a simple caesar code can always be broken which makes them of limited value this one can be broken more easily than most however the people writing this code are not nearly so clever as they wish to think themselves and they made a number of mistakes there are for example a limited number of words in our language that consist of two letters that can be reversed to make another word i am guessing on and no and look at this a word of a single letter it must be a or i and all these words end with two identical letters it is likely that z is an s or an l bring me a pen and paper there you go also they are foolish enough to use i as a discrete word which gives me everything i need to break the code with pen ink and paper at my disposal i began to set up my key matching the words i believed i could crack with those i could not substituting letters as i went it was tedious work and the whiskey made my vision waver but i drank it all the same soon the puzzle pieces fit together and i looked at the message i could scarce believe what i saw yet there it was i come from d all on schedule here use contacts to confirm ham suspects nothing without his interference bus will fall by march i stared at the note hardly daring to comprehend it leonidas looked over my shoulder what is bus he asked who is d i had my suspicions about dduerthough i was still too early in the game to say for certain bus however was another matter it was the institution that was upon everyones minds upon everyones lips it was the thing that had elevated hamilton to unimaginable power and made him to some an unspeakable demon it was the thing that it now seemed to me for good or ill defined our moment in time much as the revolution itself had defined the world half a generation ago the bank of the united states what i held in my hands changed everything for this was not a matter of a missing gentleman and a pushy irishman cynthia was right whatever had happened to her husband had something to do with the bank but it was a far more sinister something than i could have suspected there was a plot at work a genuine plot to destroy hamilton s bank it was a plot to alter for good or ill the future of the american government joan maycott summer and autumn the halfface camp built that day proved but a poor shelter yet shelter it was and though we endured a few rain showers that rendered it near useless it was at most times not so terrible to be sure our difficulties were eased by the help of our new neighbors mr dalton developed a particular attachment to my husband that first night and he proved to be a good friend we learned that his companion mr jericho richmond was generally praised as one of the great marksmen in the region and in that period of adjustment we would have starved had it not been for their regular gifts of game two or three times a week as sunset approached we would see the two of them enter our clearing some great beast stretched over mr richmonds shoulders or if too large dragged in a cart they brought us deer and bear and once a small panther quite sleek in form and beautiful in its tan color can panther be eaten i inquired skeptically eyeing the felled beast panthers good answered jericho richmond in his terse and softspoken manner what does it taste like i asked mr dalton considered this question tastes a lot like rattlesnake i laughed aloud you cannot expect me to know what rattlesnake tastes like dalton answered by strolling toward the thick growth of forest richmond stared at his back and then when dalton was gone from view richmond stared at me he seemed to have nothing to say and yet his look held an accusation i did not understand i attempted conversationnothing of great complexity for most of what i said involved speculation upon what mr dalton might be doingbut richmond would not speak to me and so we stood there richmond as quiet and inscrutable as an indian i confused and not knowing how to excuse myself so we remained until dalton returned ten minutes later the limp body of a rattlesnake dangling from one hand its lifeless head peeking out from above his fist he held it out to me roast it on the fire dont boil it boilings too tough he winked at me as i with some effort reached out and took the thing from him later when i examined it i found it had not a scratch upon it and that for all i could tell mr dalton had reached out grabbed it by the neck and strangled it not precisely hercules in his crib but near enough to astonish me richmond said nothing during this exchange but he shook his head once in a way that made me feel as though i had walked into a disagreement between the two of them dalton was equally useful in selling us supplies that we required including seed for our first crops and ropes for land clearing giving us a pup to be raised as a hunting dog and most useful an old work horse whom he called bemis i later learned that the beast had been named after the skirmish at bemis heights the pivotal encounter of the battle at saratoga in which both mr dalton and mr richmond had served under colonel daniel morgan mr dalton told us that mr richmond was the marksman who dispatched the british general simon fraser a shot that changed the course of the battle and thus of the war itself given the victorys influence on frances entry into the conflict it was something i loved about my country in a war with countless turning points one never needed to look far to find the men who had worked the levers upon which all depended with the occasional assistance of our new friends andrew managed to fell eighty trees within three weeks and so the call went out that there was to be a cabin raising i had thought our camp building had been a significant gathering but a cabin raising turned out to be an event of an entirely different order mr dalton had it put about that he wished everyone to help and as a prominent distiller of whiskey for the region and an employer of more than ten menhis whiskey boys who traded his wareshis wishes were always obeyed from as far away as twentyfive miles dozens of men arrived for what was to be a fourday frenzy of work and merriment when it was completed we had a home and we had friends the house was rough and so were the people but life seemed much easier than it had at first through andrews skill and industry and with the aid of our new friends we managed to improve upon our uncouth cabin week by week though there was much to do outside the house andrew found time to construct for us a bed a dinner table with chairs and a tolerably comfortable rocker and to set to work on a wood floor though this would be a long and ongoing project he could make simple household furnishings quickly so he was soon trading for other necessities blankets plates and cups and even a tablecloth and some rough flaxen napkins these were difficult times but sweet ones never had andrew and i spent so much time together alone without visitor or distraction and we delighted in taking refuge in each other a soft relief to our hard surroundings the world was only unfamiliar challenge but in our cabin we could find familiar delight those early weeks now seem a blur to me as with the warmth of spring turning to the heat of summer we spent our days engaged in little more than the business of survivingor perhaps more accurately attempting to understand how we were to survive andrew cleared landbackbreaking labor which i feared might be the death of him and his horse even with all his strength poured into the work it yet confounded him as he pulled saplings from the ground and chopped to the stump a near forest of oaks and birches and sycamores they gave up their earth grudgingly and andrew would return from a days work covered in dirt his hands caked with blood i would gaze out upon the land and be unable to see what his efforts had yielded yield it did though and at last enough land was cleared for a small planting i would spend my mornings tending to corn and vegetables in the hopes that enough would grow for us to have some food in the fall many in the west planted indian style sowing the seeds upon the earth in a formless scatter and hoping a sufficient number took but andrew and i were more methodical tilling the earth planting in rows giving each stalk room to breathe and grow the purchase of an old spinning wheelit required significant repair at andrews clever handsallowed me to spin flax and my needle was often busy in repairing our clothing and making new from the cured skins of andrews hunts only a few months in the west and with his beard hardened muscles sunreddened skin and buckskin clothes my husband had become a true border man he would come home at night exhausted and hungry but content to eat the meager repast i could providecorn pone from our stock of meal and meat from what animals he had hunted given what flavor we could by an always diminishing supply of precious salt venison was a rare treat for he had little time to hunt deer but almost without effort he might kill a turkey or bear or even a rattlesnake which were ever lurking no trip to our own gardens could be conducted without vigilance in some strange compensation the woods afforded a species of pigeon so insensible to danger that to kill it one need only walk up to one and hit it with a stick this was our life after his dinner andrew lay down upon our rough bed while i lit candles which i learned to make with my own hands from bear fat perhaps i might spin awhile or if i could steal an hour pore over my copy of postlethwayts universal dictionary of trade and commerce or james steuarts inquiry into the principles of political economy even in the wilderness i still sought inspiration for my novel now little more than scraps of dead characters walking though their fictional lives like ghostsempty and evacuated present but incorporeal despite my bone weariness i knew that this book resided somewhere inside me wanting only its time of quickening awaiting the right alchemy of idea and story and setting the west or perhaps the scheme by which we had come west held something for me but i could not say precisely what i could not name it but it was there we were often enough called upon by what was there styled neighbors though the nearest lived more than half a mile away these visits were often a strange mixture of backwoods civility and the hostile curiosity with which outsiders are often regarded mr dalton and mr richmond sometimes ate the evening meal with us and i sensed that they imposed upon us not only because they had taken to andrew but also because our hospitality allowed us in a small way to compensate them for the pains they had taken on our behalf dalton and andrew talked at great length about land clearance mr richmond said little but he did not seem uneasy or resentful of mr daltons interest in us i surmised that mr richmond was simply a quiet man who rarely found in the routine of ordinary life circumstances that required speech while andrew and mr dalton talkedof how we were neglected by the east of how the government in new york and then philadelphia would not send soldiers to fight the indians and of how hamiltons schemes in the treasury department would destroy the poor man for the sake of the richmr richmond would sometimes aid me in washing and replacing the dishes he might sit with me while i spun or sewed content to sip his whiskey and look as though he thought about significant things once however he turned to me and offered me a rare smile of crooked teeth andrew is a great friend to him there was something more than his words to what he said but i did not understand it i only replied simply i am glad of it you have both been good to us richmond said nothing and then after a moment dalton is a good friend to have but not to take advantage of i can assure you mr richmond that andrew would never i know andrew would not he said i could not have been more surprised had he struck me did he accuse me of in some way abusing mr daltons kindness i turned to him but he only shook his head as if to say that the subject had been exhausted and with that he left the room o ne night we sat with mr richmond and mr dalton this time joined by mr skye the five of us enjoying some precious tea and sweet corn bread following a meal skye happened to glance over to a little round table next to our rocker upon which sat my copy of postlethwayt this interested him at once and after rising to inspect its edition and condition he inquired of andrew what he did with such a book tis not mine he said in truth its too dull for me you madam asked skye you have an interest in finance and economical matters i do i said feeling myself redden i was not quite ready to reveal myself to be a budding authoress it was fortunate that he spared me a request for further explication then perhaps you have some thoughts upon the latest news just arrived in a mule train from the east this very day his gray eyebrows raised in amusement or perhaps anticipation i spent the afternoon reading through the newspapers and i cannot credit what i have discovered then tell us said andrew he smiled clearly pleased to be the one to relate it yet i could see it troubled him too the new treasury minister alexander hamilton has appointed an immediate assistant the second most powerful man at the treasury with the influence that department is gaining over george washington and the federal government as a whole it makes him well near one of the most powerful men in the entire country can you guess of whom i speak for he is known to us all dalton snorted we have no idea so out with it man andrew smiled i have no idea but look at joan i think she knows i had opened my mouth but i had not yet spoken it seemed to me impossible but i could think of but one man who met the criteria mr skye had outlined and i could not at first bring myself to say his name out loud no i managed at last not william duer skye nodded how ever did you guess it she didnt guess it said andrew she merely drew the only logical conclusion i did not myself but now i see how she did so he is after all the only man known to us all and he did speak of his close ties to hamilton when we met him dalton actually snarled in disgust it makes me ill to think that a man like duer who has made his living by cozening patriots should be rewarded with such power and influence he shall do well for himself said skye it seems that his good friend hamilton has convinced congress to pay in full the states debts from the war all our promissory notes that duer got in exchange for land are now to be paid at full value he knew i cried he and hamilton must have plotted it out all along they would trick patriots into surrendering their debt and when they had enough they would get the american people through their taxes to pay off that debt enriching themselves it is the most monstrous abuse of power imaginable that is how things are done in england said dalton but it is not how they are supposed to happen here no but it is the way of things said skye it hardly matters what principles are foremost in mens minds those men are still men and they will either be too idealistic to maintain power or too corruptible not to seize it you judge human nature too harshly said andrew for what did we fight if this country is doomed to be no better than the one from which we won our independence dalton regarded him with the greatest seriousness it seemed his orange whiskers stiffened like the ears of a cat going back you do not submit to a harsh master because the next master may for all you know be no better you fight and that is what we did we fought for the chance lad and do we not fight now i asked looking up from my needlework is the fighting all done we fight against england for oppressing us but when we do it to ourselves when our own government places men like hamilton and duer in a position to destroy the soul of the nation do we take our ease and do nothing theres nothing to do said skye i was not so certain i could not think what we might to do push back against the interests of greed and cruelty that had so clearly gained ground but that did not mean i could do nothing i thought of my book once more and considered that perhaps this novel this first american novelcould i but write itmight be an instrument of change or at least part of a movement for change a movement of sincere citizens hoping to keep their government free of corruption if this news about duer so troubled me it would trouble others all over the country honest men and women must be looking on with horror as corruption wound its way into the hearts of the political men in philadelphia alexander hamilton once washington s trusted aide had turned the nation in the direction of britishstyle corruption i knew i must find my voice and soon these thoughts were upon my mind as i stepped outside to clean dishes in the stream the men or so i believed were still within drinking whiskey and speculating upon the evil plans laid back east to my surprise mr skye stepped out with me he appeared slightly only slightly uneasy with his hands in his pockets stepping with a gait too casual i observed to your husband that it might be best to have an escort with you as you went about your chores he said with a slight simper were i unmarried i might think from his tone that he wished to declare himself i do it often enough i said but not unkindly it was a cool evening for summer and a light breeze made the air pleasant the night sky was cloudless and the thin crescent of a newly waxing moon underscored the brightness of the stars without overshadowing them together mr skye and i strode the short distance to the creek where setting down my sack of dirty dishes i squatted by the cool water and plunged in the first vessel he took another dish we worked in silence for some minutes until mr skye said to me i did not mean to make you uncomfortable before you blushed when i first spoke of your interest in economical books i am sorry if i stepped upon something he was not sorry he was curious if he were sorry he would not have pursued the subject but i could not fault him for it even so i hesitated for an instant for i did not like to speak of my ambitions to just anyone but i sensed in mr skye a man who would embrace and not scorn my project i took a deep breath i plan to write a novel perhaps the first american novel it was dark and i did not look upon his face but even so i sensed a look of interest and respect the first you say i believe it may be too late for that our own mr brackenridge in pittsburgh has set his cap at the same thing i felt a twinge of disappointment but it would not last i had long been determined to write my book and had not done so surely someone with more resolve would succeed where i had only delayed instead of dwelling upon this point i determined that i would have to meet this worthy well it is not vital to me that i be the first but that it be particularly american i know not what mr brackenridges novel might be but i doubt we intend to write the same thing i have seen part of it said skye it is a picaresquea sort of american don quixote or perhaps an american smollett then we have very different projects i said and saw no reason to say more should you ever require a pair of eyes to look at it i hope you will call upon me you are very kind i said and turned to my dishes a moment later because i sensed my words had so pleased him i repeated myself very kind a ndrew began to spend a great deal of time with these men they helped him with the land clearingat least dalton and jericho would for john skye avoided such work where he could pleading age and back pain instead he would aid me with the farming or join me in the cabin and ease my isolation while i prepared the evening meal the five of us would eat together and then pass the evening with whiskey and conversation or perhaps andrew would join them riding out to one of their cabins then so slowly i did not notice the land clearing diminished until it ceased entirely andrew would leave in the morning and come home in the evening he would more often than not smell of whiskey but he did not seem inebriated and i had no concern that he had found another woman even so there was something furtive in his looks as though he had been about something not entirely wrong but certainly something he chose not to reveal i did not love it but i would not ask him to speak before he was ready indeed andrew appeared happy selfsatisfied though he would approach the cabin with a secretive lightness in his step i had not seen him appear to be so pleased with himself in a long while i was lonely yes and missed the company of the men mr skye in particular but i could not protest i was a woman and my presence was expendable so long as i did my duty i would have to endure the solitude even while andrew enjoyed company it was not only the company of mr dalton and mr skye that drew him in however he would sometimes spend his evenings at the indian path tavern where women were not welcome there the men would talk of the things that plagued westernershow the politicians of the east wanted us to tame the land but cared not to help us fight indians they spoke of the fear of foreign agents combing pittsburgh the british the spanish the frenchlooking to stir up trouble they talked of the new government back east their hatred of duer and how all must be set squarely at hamilton s doorstep so it was that with andrew gone so much from the cabin my novel began to take shape in my mindslowly at first but the characters gathered around me moths drawn to the flame of my mind in the quiet i spent the day making notes examining the contours of my story and soon enough beginning the writing process itself i would write i decided a novel about our own experiences about the evil men who defrauded patriots to line their pockets i would write about the duers and hamiltons and tindalls of the world and about a group of westerners who decide to exact their revenge upon them perhaps it was the thrill of confronting these men if only on paper but the words came to me as they had never done before this is how our time passed for two months and then as summer began to turn to autumn and a coolness settled over the land andrew spoke to me have you never wondered he said where i go each day where i spend my time i have wondered i said but i thought you would tell me when you were ready it is not like you to restrain your curiosity tis not like you i countered feeling somewhat chastised to be secretive you have your novel he said you do not have to tell me it goes well for i can see it upon your face can you not see from my face that something goes well for me i could not help but smile i have seen it and shall i tell you what it is do not tease me andrew you know i wish it tell me if you are ready it is better that i show you and so we set out across the rugged path to dalton s large cabin some two miles away it was a pleasant afternoon the air filled with the buzz of insects and we strolled in easy silence my hand upon his arm somehow we were happy somehow in the midst of our ruin we had each found something some part of ourselves we had been missing i in my writing and andrew in his secret at dalton s cabin which i had never before visited the large man greeted me mr skye beside him at the door and they both had the foolish look of boys who have done something both wicked and childishly charming behind the house jericho richmond worked in the field he raised his hand at us as we approached but at once wiped his brow with his sleeve and returned to his work mr dalton invited me in sat me near the fire and set before me a small glass of whiskey which i began to lift to my lips youve come to enjoy your whiskey skye said before i could drink i dont think enjoy is the right word i said but it is part of life here i took a sip of the drink but i immediately took the cup away in astonishment id had whiskey before in quantities i would not have credited in my former life but here was something entirely different it was darker i saw by the light of the fire amber in color and more viscous and its flavorit was not merely the sickly sweet heat of whiskey for there was a honey taste to it perhaps vanilla and maple syrup and even yes the lingering tang of dates what is this i asked to answer that said skye to fully answer your question we must first make sure you understand what whiskey is do you know why we make whiskey are we merely harddrinking men reprobates who cannot live without their strong drink would you catechize me i asked he smiled oh yes you see ive been planning this conversation in my mind and i mean that it should go as i wish now tell me do you know why we make whiskey it is the only way to profit from your harvest a woman who reads the universal dictionary of trade and commerce misses very little my husband observed i took another sip attempting to dissect its intricacies you grow your grain but beyond what you need for your own use there is nothing to be done with the surplus there are no good roads so the voyage east is too long and too difficult and ultimately too expensive to transport large quantities of grain you cannot use the mississippi to travel west since the spanish will not permit it so what is to be done the most logical answer is to turn your surplus grain to whiskey quite right said skye there is always a market for whiskey i continued it becomes popular back east and the army is increasingly replacing rum with whiskey and though it is cumbersome to transport grain it is far less to transport whiskey by the barrel that is why whiskey stands as a substitute for money at some point it may be exchanged for specie and thus is useful for barter and that said mr skye is where your husband has become so useful he pointed at andrew he almost at once recognized that there was more flavor to be got into the drink tis a barter economy but right now all whiskey is held equal no ones drink is lauded above anothers but what if we could produce something that was better than what anyone else had of course i interrupted you introduce something more scarce it generates more desire you get more for your trade exactly so once again lass skye said now dalton and i have been in the whiskey trade for some time and we thought that andrew here with his skill as a carpenter could be of use to us weve long known you get more flavor out of whiskey by storing it in barrels rather than jugs but the difference is not significant more flavor but the flavor is not always good and an abundance of bad flavor does not add much value beyond that the barrels are harder to transport and the wood absorbs some of the whiskey leaving you with less product for the market but sometimes barrel storage is desirable said dalton jugs can be hard to come by in large quantity and wood is plentiful if you have enough surplus it is better to lose some to barrel storage than have no place to store it at all when we explained all this to your andrewwell he had other ideas than mere coopering i looked at him is that right he smiled somewhat sheepish lets show her the still dalton said we exited the cabin and went to what dalton called the outhouse though it was a cabin twice in size to the one he lived in a kind of rusticated warehouse or factory in it was a profusion of pots jars and tubes that jutted out from one another and crisscrossed the room in a fowlingpiece blast of confusion wooden barrels lined the walls small fires burned in contained furnaces steam boiled out of pots in tight little puffs it smelled rich and rank in there a kind of sweet and decaying smell combined maybe with something less pleasantlike wet waste and fleshy decomposition it was enticing and revolting the principle is fairly simple dalton said you start with a kettle full of fermented corn what we call the wash then we boil it there over that fire the lid goes on the kettle you see that tube coming out of it that catches what burns off since tis the strong stuff that burns off firstthe spirit if you will which is why we call strong drink spirits so the drink that comes out of that tube is whiskey i asked no skye said thats what we call low wine which is run through the still once again now it comes out in different strengths the first of it the foreshotwell that aint for drinking lets say that tis nasty and foul and strong you can add a little bit of that to the final produce to give it some strength but no more after the foreshot comes the head which you can drink but it still aint good then comes the clear run it looks like this he handed us a glass bottle and inside was a nearcolorless liquid that is more the whiskey im used to aye it is said skye the flavor and color of ours come from the barrel the longer it sits in the barrel the more flavor and color it gets but there was more to it than that it seemed to me said andrew that more of the barrels flavor could be brought out by charring its insides and so it is the whiskeys weve been experimenting with the past few months are more flavorful than any wed ever tasted before hes done more than that said mr dalton hes been meddling with the recipe too adjusting the proportions of the grains adding more rye than corn to the mash weve made your husband a partner in our still and unless im mistaken hes made the lot of us very rich dalton took out a bottle of the new tawny whiskey and poured us all a glass with which we toasted our future we had come west as victims but now it seemed we would be victors it was what we believed at the time and what we ought to have believed because this was the america we had fought for where hard work and ingenuity must triumph we did not know that at that moment back east alexander hamilton and his treasury department schemed to take it all away from us ethan saunders the previous night i had not been so abstemious with drink as might be desired of a man in pursuit of reform but i nevertheless awoke early and with an eagerness i had not known in years i had before me a remarkable day because i had things to do i had not had things to do in years id had things that needed doing that ought to get done that had better be taken care of but they were usually of the if not today then fairly soon variety i had safely hidden away the stolen message inside an orphaned second volume of tristram shandy the silver ball itself sat upon my desk like a monument to all that had changed in my life i was alive and vibrant and i had things to do monumental things and i intended to do them of the greatest importance was a visit to the city tavern to begin my quest for william duer it seemed to me he was at the heart of everything it was his man this mysterious reynolds who had arranged to expel me from my home hamilton had identified him as a mischief maker and the note i had recovered the night before seemed to allude to him granted the d might well have been another man but i did not think so hamilton had assured me duer was not to be found in town but i was not confident hamilton had been honest on that score not when the mere mention of the name reynolds sent him into spasms of rage trading would not begin at the city tavern for several hours yet however so before going there i thought it best to visit the address hilltop had given me thus at ten leonidas met me at my rooms and together we made our way south to the boardinghouse on evont street the voyage from the heart of philadelphia to southwark was like witnessing all at once a youthful face wither into age the redbrick houses first stately and wellmaintained were a block later turned ramshackle and illkept a block or two after that they became wood frame and soon after that little more than shacks the prim men of business and frenetic speculators and wealthy quakers gave way to the laboring poor to papists and presbyterians to curious foreigners from poland or russia or other alien lands to free negro cart men crying out oysters and pepper pot some of these were dressed in the same plain garb one might find on a white man but some of the women wore brightly colored and curiously patterned scarves upon their heads the vestigial remain of savage origins leonidas kept his head straight ahead but i had the distinct impression that he knew some of these people and the odd feeling he did not like being seen with me indeed we were not three blocks from our destination when a negro boy of fourteen or fifteen wearing heavy green woolen breeches and a ragged outer coat came running up to him ho there leon this the man that own you he asked in a sort of singsong voice run along leonidas said very quietly hey white man why you not let him go when you promised the boy asked me leonidas made a shooing motion and the child mercifully ran off evont street was wide and well traveled but unpaved and thus full of filthy snow and mud and animal leavings pigs roamed freely and grunted their courage at passing carriages the boardinghousepoorly kept with peeling paint and splintering woodwas on the corner facing the far more quiet mary street but that offered it no air of repose or peace it was a wretched place for wretched people with boarded windows and a visible hole in the roof the woman of the house answered our knock here was a haggard creature of some thirty years quite oldlooking with gray hair and heavily bagged eyes that bespoke her boneweariness her three small children stood behind their mother and gazed at us with the empty expression of cattle we seek an irishman who may live here i said tall hairless redwhiskered aint no one like that lived here she said then youve never seen him i asked she said nothing and had the distinct look of a woman attempting to make up her mind leonidas pushed ahead of me have you seen him mrs birch her face did not exactly brighten but it became a degree less sour didnt see it was you back there leon is this him then she asked pointing at me yes its him she eyed me critically have you seen him leonidas asked again it is important she nodded i seen him he come by here looking for my landlord but he aint been by for a while and so i told him and who is your landlord i asked who was my landlord more like a wretch named pearson almost cost me my livelihood too with him losing the property but the new fellow is letting me stay on at the same rent i nearly took a step back in surprise let me clarify if you please pearson owned the house but owns it no longer he sold it and right quick too like he was in some sort of hurry she said when did this happen leonidas asked two weeks ago the new landlord arrives telling me he now owns the house and that pearson has been selling off his properties this was the sort of matter i could better investigate back in the heart of town perhaps even at the city tavern i thought it unlikely that this woman would know the specifics of pearsons finances but it seemed to me interesting that he was selling off property what of the irishman i asked i dont know if i should tell you anything she said pearson aint my landlord no more but even so hes not a man to cross a moment if you please mrs birch leonidas said he stepped forward into the house with her and i heard them speak in hushed tones for a moment once i heard her say missing in a loud and gleeful voice but i could make no more of it when they emerged leonidas turned to me and announced in a businesslike manner that mrs birch would be happy to tell all in exchange for one british shilling i have no money so you pay her leonidas be so good he reached into his coat but the woman stopped him is he going to pay you back very likely not dont forget ive reformed i said very likely not leonidas said again then dont pay me nothing she said i dont want to take no money from you i looked at leonidas why are people so nice to you because i am kind to them he said fascinating i muttered and it was to the woman i said now that weve worked out these pesky money matters can you tell me what i wish to know she nodded pearson would use one of the rooms in the house he discounted my rent on account of me not being able to rent it out myself he kept it for a delicate kind of business and though i didnt much care for it happening under my own roof i was in no position to object if you take my meaning he brought a woman here i asked he strayed from his marriage vows she laughed he invented whole new ways to stray from his marriage vows he only came here with one girl emily fiddlers her name i told the irishman too cause he come looking for pearson i tell him that pearson dont live here dont even stay here he just uses the room for his special girl and what is so special about this emily fiddler a distressed sort of grin crossed her face youd have to meet her to understand s he directed us to a house not far away on german street it was a better sort of place than that from which wed come in superior repair not so reeking of desperation and decay seeing me look upon it leonidas said i suppose pearson never owned this one we knocked upon the door and the serving woman upon hearing our request sent me without leonidas who was sent to the kitchen to a sitting room where i was met by a not unattractive woman in her early thirties she had dark hair large emerald eyes and lips of unusual redness against pale skin she was a bit plump perhaps and her nose a bit too thin but she must have been spectacular ten years earlier i am looking for miss fiddler i am she the woman said with the charming tone of a lady who knows her business have you been referred to me as it happens we have i said then by all means let us talk business let me call for tea there was something in her tone something jaded and eager like the crier at a traveling show that put me on my caution the room which had seemed perfectly charming to me now took on a less agreeable cast the furnishings which were neat were also quite old and not in the best repair chipped wood tattered upholstery fringed pillows the windows were covered with gaudy red curtains laced with gold chintz i had the strangest feeling that we were children playing at being adults miss fiddler i began i have just come from a mrs birch who formerly rented her home from a mr jacob pearson i am told you know him she smiled quite lasciviously i thought of course i know him well he is always a good man with whom to do business is that so i asked and would you care to do business as well she asked were i less used to female charms i would most certainly have blushed so saucy was her tone i will certainly discuss business with you i speak for her when it comes to matters of money but in the end i cannot influence her when it comes to preference you understand me you are a handsome man mr saunders but you are also bruised in your face and that may frighten her in the end the arrangement must please her or there can be no business at all i must also tell you that in order to indemnify all parties money may be exchanged in my house but the business shall we say must be transacted elsewhere you must have somewhere to take her a lesser man would have inquired what precisely the deuce she was talking about but i had ever thought it best to let these things unfold upon their own terms may i meet her of course she rang a bell i had already surmised that while this lady might have been a miss fiddler she was not the miss fiddler with whom pearson had a relationship my guess was that this lady was a relativean older sister or cousin or auntwho functioned as the younger womans bawd in a moment a pretty young girl entered the room looking like a younger version of our hostess the girl had the same dark hair the same eyes the color of brilliant summer grass the same red lips and snowy skin the same toonarrow nose she like the older lady was a bit inclined to plumpness but she wore it well for her weight was well located in precisely the places a man likes a woman to accumulate herself she wore a simple white gown low cut to expose her large breasts she curtsied saying nothing gazing upon nothing with a kind of amusement as though nothing were a perpetual show staged for her entertainment i rose and bowed you must be emily may i ask you some questions she smiled but said nothing there was nothing rude or defiant in her silence rather a kind of uncomplicated absence the serving girl now wheeled in the tea things and the cart was rickety and squeaked and rattled producing an atmosphere at once comic and ominous may i ask you some questions about mr jacob pearson i asked the girl she curtsied again but the older woman shifted in her seat as though she too was uncomfortable she sent her serving girl away with a flick of her hand to me she said did mr pearson tell you much about emily he only spoke of her great beauty i said quickly and he did not exaggerate you are a man of taste sir you may direct your questions to me the girl now said something that sounded very much like peahsoh her voice was deeper than i would have anticipated and the sound was low and nasal as sad and dull as a cows mournful lowing i turned to her i beg your pardon her face opened into a wide grin peahsoh she keened all at once it was clear to me and i cursed myself for a fool for not seeing it sooner my god is the girl a simpleton miss fiddler did not respond to this vehemence i thought you knew yes she was born that way and when her parents died last year and left her in my care i knew not what to do with her but as you can see she is very pretty and she does not object to her duties she leaned forward and said in a conspiratorial whisper she rather relishes it you are not going to be one of those men to lecture me are you there was a depth of inhumanity here that even i found too diabolical to contemplate but this was not the time for useless lectures i was getting close to learning something and along the way i was both elated and horrified to discover that cynthias husband was more of a beast than i could have imagined to the elder lady i said i am not one to judge one mans monstrosity is another mans diversion for my part miss fiddler i would delight in bedding an idiotvastly amusing and all thatbut that is not why ive come it is on government business and i do hope that when i come to report my findings to the president and his advisors i have only information to tell him not the nature of the people who could not help us you understand me i think she nodded now of a more sober deportment i see all too clearly what you are after she waved emily out of the room ask me your questions did a tall hairless irishman come here looking for pearson he came she said but there was nothing to tell him we never do business here as i told you so pearson other than our first meeting was never a guest in my home i explained that to the irishman and he left almost at once almost i said he asked if i would hold a letter for a friend she said he gave me five dollars to take the note and said i would receive another five when its rightful owner came to collect it i am the rightful owner i said she laughed i doubt that as you did not know of the letter before now miss fiddler i said i presume you will have no objection to giving that letter to representatives of the united states government of course i would not were i still in possession of it she said but i gave the letter away three days ago to the last gentleman who came in search of it the last gentleman i repeated a slender young man with a beard who also claimed to work for the government lavien i believe he called himself is he a colleague of yours joan maycott winter and spring they let the whiskey age in the barrels all winter and then much of the next spring in summer while andrew tinkered with the stills experimenting with new ways to bring yet more flavor to his drink mr dalton and mr skye traveled the county letting men sample their new whiskey mr daltons whiskey boys went even farther to spread the news of this new distillation they rode from settlement to church to trading post uncorking their bottles for eager settlers to taste when autumn came and the rye and corn were harvested mules and horses laden with grain began to make their way to mr daltons operation stills were expensive things most men could not afford one not even a small one and so the custom was for farmers to bring their grain to a third party who would distill it in exchange for a portion of the proceeds virtually everyone who tasted the new whiskey understood that they must have this drink and no other or their grain was wasted it would trade for more or for those who wished to make the venture east sell for more in turn dalton skye and andrew amassed increasing stores of grain to turn to whiskey which they could sell or use for trade whiskey was the coin of the realm like a creature from a childs tale they had learned to manufacture precious metals from baser materials dalton and skye soon found their stills used beyond capacity more machines had to be purchased men said they would wait as long as it took if only they could have their grain distilled to be so full of flavor it was not only that the new whiskey was desirable but that the old was now depreciated why turn your straw into silver when you could turn it into gold for my part i was busy too once i decided that i would place a fictional version of william duer at the center of my novel i filled up page after page the story centered around the evil speculator william maker and his scheme to defraud war veterans of their pay and in it i mocked the greed of the wealthy celebrated the ardor of the patriotic and bemoaned the conditions of the frontier yet the frontier of my novel was peopled not only with ruffians and miscreants but noble souls patriots swindled by a government tending only to the cares of the wealthy these fictional men found a way to strike back and set the country to rights i felt certain utterly certain i was doing what i had longed to do inventing the american novel writing a new kind of tale whose concerns and ambitions mirrored the american landscape a utumn turned to winter and we spent our second cold season in the west it was hard for our fireplace and stove could sometimes do little to stave off the brutal western chill but it proved easier than our first winter for now the whiskey bought us food and blankets enough to increase our ease sometimes andrew would join mr dalton and mr richmond in a search for desperate winter deer or in a far more ambitious bear hunt this was a dangerous businesswaking a beast from its winter sleepbut at least it yielded us fresh meat during these excursions mr skye would often invite me to pass the time at his own home visiting skyes house was always a delight for he had the finest cabin in the settlement it rose two stories and having no one to spend upon but himself he had troubled to furnish it if not elegantly then at least comfortably through a set of circumstances that were never entirely clear to me he had purchased the lease for this land from a man whod been desirous of leaving the area quickly having incurred the anger of both colonel tindall and a band of shawnee braves mr skye had come west with more ready cash in his pocket than most men and he had been one of the few settlers in the region capable of buying the lease for any amount of real specie now each season he hired four or five workersusually slaves lent out by their ownersto help him grow wheat and rye and indian corn for whiskey and vegetables for his own use he had in addition several cows and chickens and half a dozen pigs and he worked hard each winter to keep them all alive while the others hunteda sport for which mr skye said hed had no enthusiasm even as a young mani would sit with the whitehaired gentleman the only person with whom i could discuss my novel in any detail i would not let him read any of itnot yetbut i would tell him of the story and its actors and he would offer useful suggestions he also presented me with roasted meats and fruit preserves and even eggs all served with samplings from his precious store of wine i will not pretend it was not good to taste such things again i am not foolish and i also cannot pretend particularly when we took wine that i did not feel mr skyes eyes upon me in a way not entirely appropriate but i saw no harm in it i knew to my soul he would never act upon whatever impulses he might feel and i enjoyed his hospitality and his conversation it would have been wrong to deny one another the pleasure of our meetings because he harbored feelings about which he would remain forever mute one afternoon perhaps a bit too warm with his excellent wine i turned to mr skye who sat next to me explaining to me his understanding of the evils schemed by hamilton and duer back east his argument was a convoluted business not skye at his best and while i wished to comprehend his meaning my thoughts were too jumbled my disposition too relaxed to take in his words instead and rather rudely i said do i remind you of someone mr skye i had my answer at once for he turned red and looked away rubbing his leathery hands at the fire until he could regain himself why do you ask it i had been too free i drank deep of my goblet of wine to hide my discomfort and took some pleasure in the feeling of numbness that spread through me i finished what i had and mr skye refilled and i could not say i was sorry it is only that you look at me with a certain recognition you have from our first meeting perhaps i recognize in you a kindred soul he offered i have no doubt you do but i think i recall to you someone from your past you are perceptive which im sure you know he smiled at me a sad sort of smile and though i had always seen him as an old man in an instant i had a glimpse of him youthful and beardless charming if not precisely handsome when i was a young man at st andrews i had a connection to a young lady in fife her father was a wealthy laird extremely well placed in society and my fatherwell he was not it was not a usual thing for someone in my family to attend university i was very much in love mrs maycott but the situation ended in scandal there was a duel you see and the young ladys brother died it was for that reason that i fled my native land and came to this country i blame the wine for i said what anyone would think but few would speak they say it was scandal that sent you west once more to our settlement his face revealed nothing i am perhaps prone to scandal it is a poor trait i know i rather think it depends on the scandal i told him he blushed which i own i found rather charming you and i are friends i said to him and so i hope i may ask you something as a man i fear i cannot ask my husband for it might be too uncomfortable for him to be honest of course mrs maycott it concerns the attraction men feel for women something i must understand for my novel he took a sip of wine you have raised a subject about which i know a great deal i know about courtship and love i understand these things your feelings for your lady in fife for example what i cannot comprehend is the attraction felt by men like tindall or hendry they look at a woman with desire yet they do not love her or like her or even regard her as near as i can discern as a person if it is mere physical release they want would not one woman do as well as another he sipped more wine i wonder if perhaps this is a conversation best not had we have come so far we must finish do you not think so i do not know that i thought so i knew the impropriety of the subject but that was what i loved about it why should i not speak of what i like with a trusted friend i knew i could depend upon his goodness and i saw no reason why i should not take some small thrill in something as harmless as it was illicit even so i knew there was a more selfish reason i pursued this subject the people i wrote of in my novel held no propriety as sacred and though their transgressions were far greater than anything i contemplated there in mr skyes home i believed i needed to know some small measure of it i wanted to know the thrill of doing what the world must condemn mr skye nodded at me and i took that as agreement so i pushed forward do all men desire women they neither know nor like i understand attraction being drawn to a face or a shape but for women i believe we must always engage in fancy with such an attraction if we see a man we like we imagine that he must be good and kind and brave or whatever thing it is we most treasure in a man it seems to me men like tindall and hendry dont trouble themselves with such fancies they merely desire and wish to take are all men thus mr skye cleared his throat a man will always be drawn to a pretty woman there can be no stopping that but each man alone chooses how to shape that interest in accordance with his heart if you will forgive a crude analogy every hunter must have his dog but when the dog is not hunting some men will allow it to lie by the fire and feed it scraps from the table others will curse it and beat it if it so much as wanders where its master does not want it can you conclude from these two examples how men taken as a whole treat dogs no for though the desire to hunt with a dog may be near universal the method of keeping the animal is different from one individual to another do you mean that some men long for affection whereas other men yearn for conquest and these are unrelated desires i think all men desire conquest of some sort but the ideal differs from man to man one might wish his affection returned he has thus conquered the indifference a woman might feel toward him another prefers conquest in its basest form in this i think women are different which is only right men will yearn for any willing heart so women must be the gatekeepers of desire in order to prevent a general anarchy by now i had pushed the subject as far as i dared and as far as i wished to i had made him uneasy and i had made myself uneasy but we had both persevered and if i was not mistaken we had both enjoyed the challenge and perhaps not coincidentally he opened for me another bottle of wine and sent me home with half a dozen eggs w inter at last relented and in the spring of it seemed that despite the despair we had known only a year before life was a delight our cabin had become a home with wooden floors and warm carpets the walls papered with birch bark covered with prints andrew had himself framed we had such material things as any westerner might desire and if we wanted somethingfood tools linenswe need only trade whiskey to get it we had gone from being outsiders to occupying a pivotal place in the community and there was hardly a man west of the ohio forks who did not know andrews name my pile of completed manuscript pages grew and i believed that in a years time i should have the book that had been my lifes ambition once the snows had melted and the paths were cleared andrew planned a trip to pittsburgh we had not been since the fall but such visits were not particularly pleasant the cooler weather offered a lessening in the scent of rot and decay but the city grew even more filthy with soot and coal dust and though we might ride into town well appointed we should ride out looking like chimney sweeps the city was populated by the worst of western rabblerough trappers and traders drunken indians lazy soldiers for whom a gun and a uniform gave them leave to confuse liberty and license even more i loathed the wealthy of the town they walked about in outdated eastern finery pretending the streets were paved the buildings made of stone and that they were in philadelphia or even london rather than the last outpost of civilization all was dirt and muck and filth coal dust that descended like black snow rooting pigs fluttering chickens defecating cows it seemed to me less an attempt at a city than a preview for so many of its inhabitants of hell andrew nevertheless needed supplies to experiment with new whiskey recipes so i went with him as we often had different tasks in town we made a habit of tending to our separate business and so we parted planning to meet again outside a grocers andrew went in search of what his whiskey trade demanded of him i went in search of a lawyer the man i wanted was hugh henry brackenridge a prominent figure in town famous or infamous depending upon who described him and upon his most recent case i was interested to meet him for a number of reasons not the least of which was that skye had told me that he wrote a novel of his own but there was more to it i was fascinated by what id heard of himprincipally his willingness to accept the causes of the penniless from murderous indians to squatters upon tindalls lands brackenridge kept his office in a street not far from the crumbling remains of fort pitt outside his doorway two shirtless men wrestled with a kind of drunken desperation that bordered on the amorous they hardly noticed me as i slunk past to knock upon the lawyers door i was shown immediately into his office furnished in the rustic western style and found him to be a strangelooking fellow in his forties graying and pointy in respectable if somewhat rumpled clothing he was perhaps the most birdlike man id ever seen mrs maycott he cried as though we had long known each other my dear dear mrs maycott how is it i may serve you here have some biscuits he shoved a plate before me then took one and popped it into his mouth you must tell me how i might be of use the food was not entirely chewed when he spoke and bits flew out but it seemed to me more charmingin the way of an exotic animalthan boorish he was not only birdlike in his appearance but in his manner he spoke in a high voice and was in his manner as nervous and twitchy as the creatures he resembled flitting from here to there jumping up at a moments notice hardly able to speak of one topic before hopping to another i am always eager to meet those who settle the lands hereabout i dont often meet the wives you know the husbands oh yes often the husbands but the wives no not so often for all his queerness he did not make me uneasy the world is full of unusual people and though some may scorn them i had ever believed that a bit of kindness would earn an enduring loyalty how is it you know me i asked you gave your name when you called he said and your husband is quite famous for his whiskey i have sampled it and it is indeed something special but please sit sit sit i did so and thanked him for the compliment he offered my husband then wishing to move things forward i explained to him my business for true business i hadthat of examining our lease for i had concerns about our responsibilities and obligations there are not so many legal men in town i said and it is well reported that you alone will stand against tindall he and i are not friends he said but neither are we enemies i take upon myself causes that have merit that is all and it need not be the merit of the particular person at the center of the case that is what people do not understand ive been much criticized for taking the part of that delaware indian mamachtagagot himself drunk and killed a white man and that was all there was to it with every ounce of will i defended him though it earned me many enemies among those who could not understand why i would stand with a murderous indian over a white man he grinned at me and then perhaps needing something in the way of punctuation bit into another biscuit but why did you defend him why anger your neighbors to defend a man you knew to be guilty of so terrible a crime for an instant his featuresthe darting eyes the flaring nostrils the quavering lipsall settled he was like a monument cast in stone as he met my gaze i did it because someone must because even the guilty must be defended or the system of law has no meaning i did it mrs maycott because i am a patriot and if a man loves his country he must uphold the principles of that country even if doing so may make him uncomfortable in his own heart and odious to his neighbors a patriot does not make the principles of his country conform to his own ideas you are a clever man mr brackenridge too clever for my own good if you must know the truth of it perhaps dismayed by his own gravity he offered me a curious smile and then ran a hand through his hair now let us look at your contract with colonel tindall and never fear i shall not tell him you came to see me he would not like it though i presume you know that he took the document and sat at his desk a glass of wine in one hand his glasses slowly sliding down his nose like the slow melt of mountain snow in the encroaching spring he traced each line with his finger and mumbled like a clerk in a stage comedy and i believe he did so consciously mr brackenridge was not only a quirky man i decided but a man who enjoyed his own quirkiness he would nod sip his wine find his place nod again mumble shake his head point wave his hand in a circle and find his place again in the end he looked up and discussed the parameters with me it was much as i had expected and the explanation was clear when he was finished i felt my color reddening and i turned away from him there is another matter i would like to discuss i told him i hope it is not too personal come mrs maycott we are friends now are we not not such great friends i suppose i would not for example lend you any great sum of money not that i expect you to ask a small sum perhaps yes a small sum is not out of the question a few dollars will that do i laughed sir i have not asked you for money and i do not intend to you have done me a service and it is i who owe you oh yes of course it is something else you see i have heard that you are writing a novel his face brightened like that of a child upon the mention of sweets most people consider the endeavor very silly but then this is pittsburgh and hardly a center of letters yet i do write a novel are you a lover of novels mrs maycott i am i looked away i am also i hope a writer of novels oh my dear how exciting he said he did not hesitate but took from his desk a large manuscript and began reading to me from his book modern chivalry it concerned the adventures of farrago a kind of american don quixote with his faithful and hapless servant teague it was very very funny and i laughed several times both at his quips and at his wonderful enlivened performance for he spoke in the voices of his characters and even as best he could with papers in his hand acted out scenes as he read it was also i was relieved to see nothing at all like what i was about i wished to write something new mr brackenridge wished to write something old my mind was put at ease perhaps you would care to share some of your book with me i would not have asked him to look at it but he offered and i had come prepared with a fair copy of the first few chapters some sixty pages written in my best hand this was no whim for paper was expensive and it cost me much to spare these pages and yet i knew i must have someones opinion and someone who had no interest in pleasing me i have not the time to wait while you read it so i shall leave this with you sir trusting that you will show these pages to no one but as you are a man of letters i would value your impressions should i continue with my work or abandon it i beg you will promise to tell me your true opinion and not stand upon politeness when i come to town again in a month or two i shall call upon you to hear your verdict and you may return the pages he agreed to my terms and so i left it was out of my hands and i should have thought about it no more except the next day back in my own cabin i heard the sound of approaching hooves as i prepared the evening meal i went outside to see who came and there riding toward me was the owlish mr brackenridge he came down from his horse reached into a saddlebag and returned to me my pages it could not wait a month or two he said what you do is remarkable new and important i beg you to finish and finish quickly the world needs novels such as this p erhaps a week after my meeting with mr brackenridge while i served an afternoon meal to andrew mr dalton and mr skye our dog began to bark wildly this was followed by a violent knock at the door and all three men took hold of their guns at once it was the way men behaved in the west though i thought it silly a raiding party of savages would not knock before entering andrew nevertheless motioned me to the back of the cabin and stepped forward toward the door which he opened slightly then he opened it the rest of the way standing there in the thin light of the late afternoon the sun blindingly behind him were tindalls men hendry and phineas hendry grinned at andrew and scratched at his scabby face while he dug at the dirt with his boot in that light his face looked not red but blazing scarlet you done good for yourself he licked his lips as he studied the inside of the cabin good afternoon mr hendry phineas said andrew hendry pushed his way inside and phineas followed close behind id not seen him in more than a year and hed grown since then broader about the chest and shoulders more stubble upon his face phineas had made the transition from being a brutal boy to a brutal man andrew stood aside ever mindful of the push and pull of violence men such as hendry were wont to set traps daring others to step into them andrew would not be so prompted i presumed i could count on the same restraint from mr skye but i did not know about mr dalton both men eyed the intruders and clutched their muskets but did not raise them no ones invited you in mr skye said mind your manners here these were not men made to mind their manners and they did not like that they should be asked to do so phineas spat on the floor that his contempt might be better visible hendry watched skyes face darken and he responded with a grin i guess we cant all be schoolteachers like you we cant all know about our ps and qs but then some of us are still men and dont hide behind the skirts of an irisher so there it is you have something to say to me stand up set down your piece and say it like a man one moment i said this is my husbands house not your camp you mr hendry must be the one to restrain yourself shut up it came from phineas and we all stared even hendry he eyed me with such hatred i feared he might leap upon me like a savage and slit my throat more than that i feared andrew might confront him and such a confrontation would lead to disaster perhaps not today for these men were outnumbered and outgunned but soon enough phineas what have i done that you would speak to me so i spoke quickly my words rushing together but i needed to get them out before andrew could speak i would make this a woman chastising a boy so that it would not become a conflict between men muzzle your woman maycott hendry said shes brung you enough troubles already haint she talking to lawyers and such thats right you thought no one saw you going to speak to that troublemaker brackenridge i felt a jolt of fear run through me had i done this had i brought this trouble upon us i only wished to discuss with him the writing of novels i said pleading my case to dalton and skye not hendry you may speak with whom you like said andrew it is no concern of tindall or his bootlicks youve been tolerated long enough and now you are warned leave my cabin the colonel dont like to see a man so used by a woman said hendry who would not do andrew the honor of hearing his words i come from the colonel and i speak for the colonel and i hear for the colonel and the colonel dont like to hear women speaking out of turn makes him angry is what it does i dont much care for it neither i beat my own wife and i dont see no reason not to beat yours dalton rose to his feet you must be mad to speak so youll not leave here with your tongue in your mouth im from colonel tindall and if i dont return and return whole the lot of you will be fitted for a noose yes you come from tindall andrew said we all understand you believe it protects you you speak foully to my wife to show your power and i do not kill you for your words to show you that they are meaningless now say your masters bidding and spare us more bluster mr dalton scowled at what he perceived as conciliation on andrews part but mr skye smirked with approval andrew had granted hendry permission to state his business but humiliated him at the same time it was perhaps as good an arrangement as could be hoped for phineas appeared lost in a different exchange one that took place in an overlapping ghostly realm he spat on the floor again and looked up at me his eyes dark and frightening perhaps sensing things could yet go badly hendry sucked in a breath and pushed forward ill say my bit then as ye beg me he stepped over to the table and examined the bottle and the mugs he picked up one of the pewter vessels and sniffed at it is this it then he asked looking directly at andrew is this the new whiskey thats got folks talking tis the whiskey we have been making answered andrew hendry drank back the mug he looked inside it tastes like the same pig shit to me looks a little different but it dont taste like nothing new maybe all you done was piss in some of the old sort is that it maycott you been pissing in the whiskey thats what it tastes like piss drink pisskey maybe youll call it be more honest that way mr skye let out a guffaw spoken like a man too familiar with drinking piss is it your own or tindalls that you suck down so often something hot and dangerous began to form on hendrys wreck of a face i think andrew must have understood that we found ourselves in a powder keg and he wished to douse all fires thank you for your critique he said i shall certainly keep it in mind as we make the next batch which perhaps you will care to sample i would he said i would like to thank you so very much but i dont think ill be able to on account that there aint going to be a next batch youre done with it said phineas think ye so dalton took a step forward and he was a fearsome sight as he did it come from colonel tindall said hendry he picked at a scab on his flaking chin he dont like it hes heard that maycott here aint clearing the land none it wont serve so you he said jabbing a finger in mr daltons direction youll make your pissy whiskey the way you used to i dont want to see nothing like what you done with maycott again i want to hear people complaining they cant get it no more we will do as we please said andrew youve had your say and weve tolerated far more than we ought for the sake of keeping peace but i wont keep it forever get gone ill hear no more of you well thats where youre wrong see colonel tindall is your landlord and he wants you clearing land if you dont therell be trouble tindalls got his own distillery said mr skye and he doesnt much care for us eating into his business thats all there is to it you think so is it hendry asked as though he knew something we did not i shall tell you what i think i said stepping forward should you care to hear a womans opinion i did visit mr brackenridge as you say for i wondered if a man who cheated once might not wish to try to cheat again i wanted my contract examined very closely to make certain we did nothing the law did not allow there is nothing in it that grants tindall the right to tell us what we must or must not do with our land or with our time shut your mouth phineas barked at me dalton lifted his weapon though he did not yet aim it that boys lost his mind hendry get him out of here before something untoward happens i put a hand to my mouth i did not want bloodshed and i certainly did not want it in my home and yet i did not fear i believed mr dalton had the control not to lose sight of himself hendry did not flinch he put a hand on phineass shoulder and spoke gently lets keep our heads boy he spoke as though everything were easy and that made it possible for phineas to believe it it seemed that even vile hendry had things to teach me he looked at andrew and grinned you can see my point now i think all this business with women and lawyers it wont come to any good it aint wise to go against the colonel i think its time for you to run mr dalton raised his gun hendry shook his head as though saddened by the depravity of those whom he tried to help i guess youre gonna make it hard pon yourselves haint you i cant say im surprised told colonel tindall it would be that way harder on you for all that but it was never going to be otherwise lets take our leave phineas the two left and closed the door behind them the men began at once to speak to one another in excited tones but i paid no attention of course i was interested but i was distracted by the scene out the window directly before our cabin hendry was taking a leather strap to phineas hed made the boy lift up his hunting shirt and he whipped at the exposed buttocks phineas faced the window but his eyes were tightly clenched then at once he opened them and saw me watching i ought to have turned away but i did not phineas met my gaze bold and unflinching and despite hendrys lashings his manhood began to stiffen and his eyes bored into me with pure malice i should have looked away spared him his humiliation and myself the raw nakedness of his fury but i kept looking all the same i found it terrifying and terrible and yet it was the darkest truest thing i had ever seen ethan saunders as we walked to city tavern i explained to leonidas what had happened with miss fiddlerthat pearson kept a simpleton as a whore that the irishman had been searching for pearson there and had left him a note and that the note had been picked up by lavien who seemed not only to know what i knew but to be well ahead of me i should not have been surprised given that he had been looking into this matter for weeks but i was nevertheless disheartened by losing what i had imagined to be an advantage on the other hand if lavien knew all i knew perhaps he knew of this alleged threat against the bank which meant i would no longer be burdened with keeping the secret we walked the distance back to the heart of the city and to walnut street where we stepped under the enormous awning of the threestory city tavern the principal location in the city for business no city in the united states had a genuine stock exchange and perhaps taking its cue from the british modelwhere there was indeed a proper stock exchange but all real business was transacted in nearby taverns and innsthe trade in government issues securities and bank shares transpired in public houses the city tavern was but the most principal of trading taverns where the most powerful and reputable speculators plied their trade but one building was not enough these days to house the mania that had infected the city of late at virtually any tavern within two or three blocks of the treasury buildings men might be found buying and selling securities stocks loans and bank issues the success of hamilton s bank had created a frenzy for bank stocks of all sorts and the trade in bank of new york and bank of pennsylvania issues was brisk much of this new business sprang from a general sense of possibility and euphoria but much was merely because the bank of the united states had millions of dollars to lend and did so at easy rates to help promote the economy hamilton believed in making credit widely available and making it cheap the end result was trade frenetic trade men bought and sold with wild enthusiasm but also created new businesses new ventures and yes new banks these sprang up almost monthly and though most were mere opportunistic adventures occasions for selling worthless shares to men who hoped to sell again before the bubble burst the trade appeared unaffected by the common knowledge of worthlessness hamilton had hoped to invigorate the economy with his bank and he had done so but his enemies argued that he had not merely given the markets energy he had rendered them mad i asked leonidas to wait outside and stepped through the front door in doing so i thought i had stepped into the middle of a brawl for in the front room some two dozen men were upon their feet shouting most vociferously and waving papers at one another each man appeared to have with him a clerk who sat by his side frantically scribbling down the devil knew what upon pieces of parchment or in ledger books their pens moved with such rapidity that ink sprayed in the air like a black rain i stared at the chaos hardly knowing how to respond i must have remained there a few moments transfixed by the lunacy around me at last i heard a whisper in my ear curious is it not it was lavien and he wore a look of extreme satisfaction i wondered how long it would take you to find your way here come sit for a moment he led me to a table and called for tea i called for porter our drinks arrived with relative dispatch and lavien leaned back to watch the confusion of the room around me in which men in fine suits acted as though they had been possessed by devils i could make nothing of it but my companion watched the proceedings as though it were a race conducted with horses whose skills and particulars he knew well what brings you here he asked me once again you hope to get information from me yet offer nothing in return i answered but i will be more generous than you i look for a william duer do you know if he is in philadelphia or has been recently he pointed the one waving papers in both handsthat is duer hamilton who evidently had not troubled to inform lavien of his lies was now exposed and i looked over at the man the secretary of the treasury was so anxious i not meet the madman in question was not very tall he had narrow shoulders and delicate nearly feminine features though he had a high and balding forehead and hair cut short with a dandyish curl to it he wore a crushed velvet suit dark in its blueness almost purple and he would have appeared comical had he not conducted himself with the most astonishing seriousness i found nothing compelling in him myself but the men in the room appeared to attend to his every sound his every gesture a mere shift in the direction of his small eyes was enough to change the course of whatever lunacy took place before me why are you looking for duer lavien asked me his expression betrayed nothing oh this and that i said any thoughts on why hamilton would tell me that duer was not in philadelphia and had not been for some time lavien paused but only for a blink of an eye i doubt hamilton remains informed of duers comings and goings tell me how the two of you happened to discuss him how odd i dont recollect but what can you tell me about him he is the king of the speculators lavien said he is both daring and reckless caring for nothing but his own profits in my opinion he is plotting something this very minute what i dont know precisely but i have seen him consistently shorting six percent government issuesthat is gambling that they will lose value he is important enough that when he predicts stocks will decline others presume the same and follow suit is that illegal no said lavien merely interesting a fter another hour of commotion the frenzy died down men settled at their tables clerks ceased their writing most of the speculators now turned to the business of drinking tea or left the tavern altogether duer sat at a table speaking with a pair of speculators lavien did not know all appeared easy and jovial you very obviously want a word with him lavien said let me introduce you why are you helping me i thought you and hamilton wanted me to keep my distance merely showing some respect for a brother of the trade he answered his face typically troublingly blank i did not believe i think he knew duer would prove uncooperative and i would learn there was nothing i could accomplish on my own and that attempting to meddle with a government inquiry would prove a waste of time it is what i would do were i in his place duer was in the midst of some tale about how he had extricated himself from the decline of value that the bank of the united states scrip had suffered the previous summer according to the little i heard the value reached a low point and would have caused financial disaster throughout the country had duer not convinced hamilton to take action once hamilton did so the value of scrip rebounded it was in other words the precise opposite of the version hamilton had told me namely that he the secretary of the treasury had refused to be swayed by friendship and had defied duer for the benefit of the nation the story came to a rather abrupt end when duer noticed us standing within earshot he coughed rather ostentatiously into his fist and sipped at his coffee mr levine is it have i not told you i have no more to say to you it is lavien sir and i am not here to speak to you myself but to introduce this gentleman mr william duer may i present captain ethan saunders captain saunders where have i heard that name nothing good i think he waved his hand as though i were a fly to be shooed wasnt there some business about betraying your country ive no time for traitors and yet here i am making time for traders ironic dont you think he did not answer and what of jacob pearson i asked have you time for him is he here what of it he has more to fear from his creditors than i have from him his creditors i said duer clucked like a schoolmaster reviewing some unsatisfactory work have you not heard pearson is in dangerous straits hes been selling off his properties all over the city though it shant be enough ill warrant a reckless man and reckless men always stumble and what is your connection to him i asked i know him from about town of course he has proposed business with me on more than one occasion but i cannot work with one such as he and his current crisis merely proves my earlier suppositions now ive given you more time than you deserve i must go one moment mr duer are you familiar with a large irishman i asked baldpated redmustached muscular you must have mistaken me for a juggler he said or perhaps a bearded circus performer i know no one of that description good day he began to walk away from us and i immediately pushed after him hold i called he quickened his pace reynolds your assistance if you please i started at the name for it was that of the man who had paid my landlady to cast me out and it was the name that had so upset hamilton from the corner of the tavern came a rugged fellow rather toughlooking in his stature and homespun clothes a large widebrimmed hat draping over deepset eyes the hat shaded his face but did not entirely obscure a massive scar that reached from his forehead over his eye and descended to his china wide pink swath of old injury he stepped between us and duer and grinned in a most feral manner showing us rather pointed teeth reynolds was large in need of a shave and possessed of an evil breath mr duer requests the two of you would be so kind as to fuck off while we were so charmingly engaged duer and his friends hurried away leaving us alone with his ruffian i might have pushed the issuewith lavien present it would have been safe to do sobut there seemed to me no point i wanted to speak to william duer one of the wealthiest men in the country he could not simply disappear if i did not get him today i would soon enough in any case i had business enough here tell me fellow i said why would you have me cast from my home it was the name of reynolds that the villain gave when he paid my landlady to put me out fuck your landlady reynolds offered by way of helpful explanation while i appreciate your advice i answered it does not answer my question then you must live with confusion he said sensing he meant to give me no more and that he was the sort to delight in crude resistance i turned my back on this reynolds and retrieved my porter i raised it in salute to the ruffian content that his master had made his escape he glowered at us meeting my gaze and then laviens making certain to communicate his fierceness before stepping out the front door certainly reynolds was possessed of no uncommon name there might be a dozen such or more in town and yet i was not satisfied this was coincidence the man who had run me from my rooms called himself reynolds but this man looked nothing like what my landlady had described that man had worn spectacles and possessed gray hair and a gray beard this man had brown hair no beard and no spectacles something curious had happened here and given hamilton s violent reaction when i mentioned the name to him i thought it best to find out at once i set down my drink hold here i said to lavien and left the tavern when i reached the street i saw the back of reynolds who was already half a block distant leonidas sat on a bench out front i tapped him on the shoulder that man there hes important follow him find out where he lives and anything else about him he nodded and hurried off i turned to reenter the city tavern as i did so i pushed past a man who appeared in some distant recess of my mind familiar when i turned i saw he was the frogfaced gentleman id observed the previous evening in the crooked knight he had been sitting alone the night before watching me with his froggish eyes now he looked at me smiled in a knowing way i did not like and touched the brim of his hat i had not a moment to think of how to respond and before i could stop or ask him who he was he was gone i had not the luxury of time to dwell upon this man who might be of no importance at all only a familiar face so i headed inside the tavern many of the financial men having concluded the mornings trades were gone or leaving drifting off to their various homes and offices or retiring to different taverns to conduct more particular business i rejoined lavien who sat sipping his tea looking pleased with himself duer he said does not like to make himself available to men who are not of immediate use to him he is a speculator and hamilton is secretary of the treasury good lord he even used to work at treasury cannot he be made to cooperate with you well ideally but at least with you he seems to treat you rather contemptuously hamilton s powers here are limited lavien said if duer does not wish to speak hamilton cannot compel him of course duer takes certain risks in rebuffing hamilton but duer may believe himself too powerful to care then they are no longer friends oh i think they are friendly and duer will always seek favors and information from hamilton but there is a lack of trust they are like old friends who find themselves on different sides not precisely during war but certainly during a time of increasing hostility between two nations duer wants the united states to emulate britain where men of influence have always had their way before the public good and what does hamilton want the united states to be like he wants it to be like itself lavien said and that is an ever more challenging goal lavien was being surprisingly forthcoming and i could see no reason to withhold any longer the secret i had uncovered i suppose so particularly in light of the threat to his bank he nodded his approval you learned of that quickly how long have you known weve been aware that there may be a plot against the bank for a week now what sort of plot he shook his head we dont know the bank itself is located in carpenters hall and it could be a threat against the physical space though i find that unlikely a move to take over the bank through acquisition of the shares perhaps a move to devalue the shares and cause a run it could be anything and duers involvement he shrugged likely none that he is aware of duer has borrowed a great deal of money from the bank and he no doubt intends to return to that well again and again he would not do anything to stop its flow but you said he owes the bank a great deal of money might he not want to see it fail to avoid repayment that would be like a man setting himself on fire to avoid paying his surgeons bill if the bank were to face some major crisis all financial instruments would suffer and that would destroy the market and so destroy duer but the fact that he is not involved in a plot does not mean he does not know something he may know more than he is aware again i must point out that you are being remarkably cooperative i hope for a trade he said of what sort well i depend upon your honor for i have already given you what i have to offerinformation about duer and the bankand now i want something from you though in giving it to me you will also be helping yourself he took from his pocket a piece of paper and showed it to me it was written in code one that looked on first glance identical to the simple one id cracked the night before lavien whisked it away before i could even begin to effect a decoding retrieved from the enterprising miss fiddler i said he nodded i could take it to someone at treasury but the fewer people who know about it the more comfortable i will be it is probable that jefferson has spies at treasury duer may have men loyal to himself as well i may not want you involved but i do trust you i nodded and he handed me the paper again without my asking while i continued to look it over he brought me a fresh piece of writing paper a quill and ink but i did not need them i had worked through the code just the night before and it was fresh in my mind it took me but a moment to read the following wd jp suspects efforts with million b i took action as discussed d was wd william duer jp jacob pearson who then was d if not duer and perhaps most important since it appeared to be the heart of the message what was million b i posed that question to lavien the million bank he said looking thoughtful i have not paid it much mind but it is an effort to capitalize on the current enthusiasm for banks it will be launched in new york city within the next week or two but it is regarded by almost everyone as a foolish venture i cannot think that either pearson or duer would have anything to do with it and yet here is this note i said this note written by we know not who and intended if we are to be honest for the same it is easy to imagine it is for duer but we have no real evidence it was true enough then duer will have to answer my question i said he has made a point of avoiding me you think he will be less elusive for you no i said but i mean to catch him all the same l ater that evening i quenched my thirst at the man full of trouble ate a dinner of cold meats and potatoes and most likely would have passed the night there had not the barman come to me with a piece of paper just delivered it is a message for you i grabbed the paper from his hand very kind i murmured i opened up the note and saw by the dim light of the tavern that it was from leonidas he wished to meet me at the corner of lombard and seventh he said it was urgent i finished my drink and set out l eonidas was leaning against redbrick puffing upon a pipe sending up thick clouds of smoke against the light of the streetlamp you took your time he said i was upon important business so i smell you cant expect a man to reform instantly now what are you doing upon this corner expanding the boundaries of our inquiry he said keep your eye upon that building he pointed to a house three doors in from the corner on the other side of the street what shall i see something interesting i hope i was afraid you might miss it but this is the house belonging to the rough man reynolds he lives there with a womanhis wife according to the neighbors ive not looked upon her but everyone says the same thingthat she is the most extraordinarily beautiful woman they have ever seen do go on i followed reynolds here he left after an hour and i continued to follow him but though he did not see me he seemed to sense there was someone watching him and i was forced to let him go he returned later and now he has another visitor which is what i wanted you to see who is it there are some things said leonidas that a man must see for himself we waited in the darkness i wished i had taken the time for another drink before leaving for it would have been pleasing to pass the time in a kind of numbness though i suppose i achieved something like that anyway watching the orange glow of leonidass pipe flare and fade at last i saw silhouettes pass before the curtains of the front room then the door opened and two men appeared against the dim interior light reynolds seemed to be almost a different person for he bowed before the second man whom he evidently considered his superior i could not at first identify him though he seemed familiar in his shape and stature the stranger came out of the house walking with his shoulders stooped his gait quick but not sprightly like a man rushing to get indoors during a storm he cast his gaze back and forth as though wishing to make certain no one would see him and then stepped out into the street he kept his head down and walked with sharp lashing strides like the jerky thrusts of oars into water only briefly did he pass into a splash of lamplight but in that instant i saw his face hard and set in anger or possibly despair it was hamilton i let out my breath in a long steady stream and waited for him to pass then i spoke in a whisper hamilton tells me he is on the outs with duer so why would he personally visit the home of duers lackey it is about money leonidas said hamilton handed reynolds a heavy purse hamilton giving this man money i had no idea what it meant but for the first time since id taken on the search for pearson i began to feel unequal to the task before me i t is only natural to feel anxiety when circumstances are larger than a mans ability to manage them i learned this during the war just as i learned that the only cure for such feelings is action a man might not always be able to do all he must but he can do something there was no action for me to take not right now but at least there was always movement and so dismissing leonidas i walked through the streets of philadelphia keeping to the better neighborhoods avoiding the taverns where i knew i might find drink to help me forget i did not want to forget i wanted to understand i had stumbled onto a dangerous situation one i had no business involving myself in except that it concerned cynthia pearson and that meant i had no choice so what was it that i knew i knew that hamilton feared a plot against his brainchild the bank of the united states an institution designed to invigorate the american economy and which had set off a frenzy of reckless trading the man in charge of inquiring into that threat kyler lavien was the same man who inquired into the disappearance of cynthias husband it would be foolish to imagine that these two things were unconnected my inquiries into the matter had so far led me to an unknown irishman and to william duer hamilton s former assistant and to duers own underling reynolds who bore the name of the man who had urged my landlady to cast me out of my rooms and now it seems reynolds was involved in some kind of secretive dealings with hamilton himself all these things were bound together but that did not mean they originated from the same point another thing i had learned during the war was that unrelated threads become entangled because important men can be important in more than one sphere at a time hamilton s secretive dealings with duers man might have nothing to do with the threat against the bank or cynthias husbands disappearance on the other hand just because these things might begin as unrelated didnt mean they stayed that way and it would be best to assume connections even when there could be no logical reason for them to exist mysterious actions and unknown plots are uncovered not by understanding motives but by understanding men so i told myself as i returned to my boardinghouse i walked with my head down murmuring to myself like a drunkard though i was perfectly sober i felt it useful to speak aloud everything that troubled me to give each difficulty some dimension in speech that i might comprehend it better i hardly looked where i walked for all that interested me was inside my mind i was on the stairs to mrs deishers house lost in thought and strategies when the fist struck me in the stomach my attacker must have been crouched hiding in the shadows of the stoop for i had already begun to climb to the door when i saw movement in the darkness a shifting of dark clothes a glimmer of reflected light upon a button a pair of eyes teeth behind lips pulled back in a grin or perhaps a grimace i had no time to react only to see it coming this human form uncoil and when the blow struck it struck hard i felt my feet actually lift from the stairs and i fell backward landing hard upon my arse i fought not to fall over entirely but the force of the blow drove my head down my skull struck with a jarring forcean angry thud that sent pain halfway down my backbut i hit not brick but dirt the little circle of earth surrounding a tree the pain ran down in a spiked wave followed by a sprinkling of silver lights but i knew at once i had not taken a deadly blow even in that moment i felt a foolish relief that the damage was all to a place that would be invisible to others it would not do to have further wounds upon my face now all at once i saw what i should have seen before the lamp outside mrs deishers house was out the lamps by the neighbors houses were out were i not so out of practice i would have sensed the ambush but i could not undo what had been done i could only move forward the dark figurea big man stocky probably muscular wearing a widebrimmed hat i could see no morestood over me on the stairs perhaps savoring his moment of advantage he reached into his belt for something and held it up in the dim light of cloudcovered moon and dim stars and distant lamplight i could see the faint twinkle of polished steel it was a blade and rather a long one from where i lay even with the wind blowing between us i could smell him the rank sourness of unwashed clothes old sweat and the peculiar acrid scent of wet moldy tobacco i knew several things now this man whoever he was had not come to kill me had his first blow to my stomach been made with that knife i would now be dead or dying the blade was to frighten me or to hurt me without killing me even so i knew if i was not careful i might yet end up dead my head ached and i felt a dull painful heaviness in my gut but i ignored it the man loomed closer only three or four steps away i was on my back propped up on my hands he would think me helpless and at his mercy but it wasnt quite so any encounter such as this one is like a game of chess he had his moves to make and i had mine we could go only certain ways each move creates a new series of possible countermoves most important perhaps victory goes not to the player who is stronger or more ready to attack but to the player who can see and anticipate the farthest into the future who can map out the multiplying strands of possibility this is what i told myself he had made his first move and now it was time for mine under the circumstances i needed to buy time and distract him asking him who he was or what he wanted begging for mercy telling him i could pay him well to leave me benone of these things would do not because they had no chance of working but because they were all too predictable i chose to speak nonsense but nonsense that would make him stop to think i began to think you would never make your attempt i said in the dark i saw the outline of his head shift in birdlike curiosity as though he took a moment to consider he took a step toward me and i believe i as much as saw his mouth open though i know not that he would have spoken he never had the chance because at that moment mrs deisher slammed open her front door and stood there a dark and billowing figure in her dressing gown a candle burning behind her holding something long with a comically flaring end it took me a moment to identify it as an ancient blunderbuss the weapon must have been a hundred years old at least and from the look of it would best serve as nothing more than a decorative wall hanging for a hunting lodge but the stout german lady wielded it like it was excalibur my assailant was prepared to take no chances and he immediately leaped from the stoop and began to run down the street to my surprise mrs deisher jumped after him she launched herself into the air and her gown ballooned out her feet spread wide she landed upon the cobbled walkway with a crack as wooden shoes struck brick taking not even a moment to think of her own safetyor i might add to aimshe raised her antique weapon and fired it exploded like a cannon and belched out a great foul cloud of black smoke she had fired high for i heard only the cracking of brittle winter tree branches the echo of the report and finally the distant slap of feet as my assailant vanished into the night mrs deisher tossed her smoking weapon to the ground put a hand on my forearm and pulled me to my feet i wrong you once she said to me but not twice you friend of government and so friend of me i save you for america and america thanks you i said pushing myself to my feet i pressed a hand to the back of my head and it came away dry which was a rare bit of good news i gave mrs deisher a little pat upon her hand and then looked down the street at the empty darkness expecting to see nothing and finding all my expectations for once fulfilled i could not criticize her for having saved me though i thought that if the encounter had lasted even a few moments longer i might have learned something of my attacker as things stood i had not seen his face or heard his voice and yet there was something familiar about the man i had no idea who he was but i believed this was not the first time i had been close to him joan maycott spring we had wanted to believe that tindall had sent his men to our cabin as an empty threat and at first it did appear that way the fame of their whiskey and andrews skill as a whiskey maker continued to spread throughout the four counties and as our profits increased we congratulated ourselves on our success andrew and his friends had bested tindall who far from attempting to duplicate the new method of making whiskey continued to produce cheap spirits from his stills perhaps he believed that quantity must win out over quality but it showed no sign of doing so i continued to work on my novel which i wrote and revised and perfected as andrew did with the whiskey until it was closer to what i wished for i was not done not near done but i began to sense that it might someday be finishedthat completion was no longer an elusive goal but an inevitability with winter over there was more cause for happiness i was not yet ready to say anything to andrew but i had missed my monthly courses now two times and though i felt on occasion sick and the scent of foods i had once loved now sent me to retching i knew this time would be different we were healthy and strong and rugged and this baby would live and thrive if our lives in the west were far happier than once we would have dared to hope events back east turned ominous with the melting of the snows we had received our first dispatch of news and we learned that hamilton and duer had only increased their power having enriched themselves with the assumption billa slap in the face to every patriot who had traded his debt for western pennsylvania landthe money men in the government had convinced the congress to charter a national bank this project all in the west agreed was but a scheme to tax the poor so that monies could be provided for the rich the bank was upon everyones lips it was the harbinger of doom the sign that the american project had failed in breaking away from england we had become but an imitation a model of its injustices hamilton in our estimate was the architect of american corruption and duer his principal agent what had been done to us as individuals would be visited upon an entire nation we of the west it now seemed to me who had long been america s unwanted stepchildren might be forced at some future time to pick up arms against philadelphia much as we had done against england for now such a cataclysm seemed a distant prospect perhaps a battle to be fought by our children or grandchildren but tyranny crept upon us sooner than i could have imagined perhaps a week after learning of hamilton and duers attempt to sow corruption andrew and i were interrupted in our cabin it was after dark and we had only just sat down for supper when the door to our cabin opened my first thought was that it must be mr dalton and mr skye though they were not in the habit of entering without knocking it was neither of them three indian braves faced us with the blank and unreadable expression so typical of their racefaces hard and stony as though they had never known emotion and at the same time as though that lack of feeling was the very apex of some human experience in recent weeks the air had remained rather cold so they wore deerskin breeches and jerkins their hair was long and unrestrained their faces unmarked by war paint and they had the slovenly look of redskins too long living among white men too accustomed to strong drink and unsavory habits they set their guns by the side of the door and then sat down at the table without a word i had heard of such things happening before the guns by the door were a sign that they meant no harm but i remained uneasy we dared not attempt to force them away or make them feel unwelcome but i cannot fully describe the great fear i felt upon seeing them it seemed to me the confined space of our cabin could not contain the mounting energy of their silent anger violence and yes carnal urges andrew cleared his throat well friends it seems youll be joining us for our meal then im afraid the offerings are meager as we did not know to expect company if they understood him or had even heard him they made no sign of it they stared into nothingness and waited to be served blank eyes straight ahead soulless and soulful all at once the centuries of hatred for our race written into their very skin serve them i did giving each a plate of venison stew a salad of field greens and a piece of corn bread their eyes did not move as i set the food before them it seemed i could have tossed stones on their plates sending their food splattering and they would not have responded i dipped my spoon in my stew but only because i feared not doing so would upset the braves make them believe that there was something untoward in the meal my cooking since coming to the west was none the most sophisticated but now it tasted like sand in my mouth and it took every effort to swallow i hoped the braves would be satisfied however eat their filland go one dipped his fingers into the stew and put them in his mouth he made a sour face the first semblance of human expression id witnessed and spat toward the fire another brave bit into the corn bread and let the food tumble from his mouth the way a baby does when first learning to eat the third unwilling even to sample what his friends found so distasteful lifted his dish and allowed its contents to slide to the floor i expected andrew to offer some kind of rebuke in my mind i could see him gently scolding the braves explaining that if they were to visit a white mans house they must behave in accordance with the white mans customs he merely sat with his hands in his lap he blinked but otherwise remained motionless i stared at him andrew was no coward but even so he was only one man and here were three braves what could he do what could i expect him to do i did not know but oh how i wanted him to do something the braves rose now all three standing across the table from us one took from his belt a knife we take your wife we let you live he said you are not taking my wife anywhere andrew remained in his seat looking like a clerk before a supplicant he blinked again and again as though trying to get something out of his eye but he did not lift a hand to rub it not take away the brave corrected take you watch we take a second brave clarified his meaning taking the index finger of his left hand and moving in and out of the circle of finger and thumb on his right the gesture was so foolish so much like that of a puerile apprentice that i repressed the mad desire to laugh we take your wife and you both live said the brave with the knife you fight us you both die this the deal i see said my husband still the calm of a man who considered whether or not to buy a mule it is a rather unusual deal is it not it the deal the indian insisted does this deal come from colonel tindall the braves exchanged looks and then the one with the knife nodded from tindall very well said my husband there was then the loud reportlouder for being so unexpectedof a pistol shot from nearby followed almost immediately by a thud upon the table and then by another pistol shot the air at once was singed with the bitter scent of powder and our little cabin was full of stinging smoke i looked around in terror not knowing whence the shots had come but the brave with the knife sank to his knees his stomach darkening with blood he clutched the knife so tightly the skin of his hand turned white but as he did so he fell forward onto his face the second shot had struck another brave in the knee he collapsed upon the floor and clutched his wound with his hand but he made not a noise the third brave bolted for the doorto get his gun i presumed andrew let go of the pistols and i now realized why he had been sitting with his hands under the table i remembered dalton s warning and i could only think that andrew had taken it to heart but had said nothing lest he upset me he sprang to his feet and i could see that his hands were stained with powder his pants had been blackened by the shot and it looked as though the fabric had caught fire and been put out andrew however remained utterly calmfocused and determined but not hurried taking the hunting rifle mounted upon the wall above the fireplace he turned aimed and fired once more the scent of powder burst into the cabin and smoke choked the air only after the ball struck the braves back did we see that the man had not been running for his gun he had been running for the door he had been trying to escape i looked at andrew to see how this would affect him the knowledge that he had shot an unarmed man in the back while he fled i did not see the man i knew there musket in hand eyes hard he looked as remorseless as had the braves andrew reloaded the gun grinding down the ball with a kind of mad calmness and then handed it to me keep it trained on him shoot him if he makes any move toward you he then fetched a piece of hemp rope and began to bind the braves arms behind his back what are we going to do with him tie him up while we fetch help we need to speak to dalton and the others you know they will kill him i said i was not protesting or suggesting a course of action i merely made a statement of fact probably and then we go deal with tindall i should prefer to believe that it was the indians who were the savages while the white men bore the standard for civilization it was not true when we reached dalton and told him our tale he immediately sent word to others in the community it was not long before a group of two score men women and children arrived at our cabin they took possession of the brave the bleeding had abated somewhat but his leg remained atop a bloody patch of floor i would later have to cover with ashes and sawdust i was at least spared witnessing what came next the indian was taken out to the woods to be beaten tortured and in the end scalped his body was left to rot the indians however were not the main source of consternation indians had ever been a problem ever would be though i dreaded their violence i felt sympathy for people who wanted only to protect their ancient rights and lands these dead braves however had struck a bad bargain with a man who could not be their friend they had agreed to do a terrible thing for what i did not know maybe they thought it would gain them freedom or privacy or peace but violence could never yield such things t he next day the bulk of the community met in the large cabin that served as the church and sat upon roughhewn log benches that wobbled upon an earth floor there were sixty or more packed inside men women and children faces dark with filth and anger the air smelled of bearfat candle and smoke and spat tobacco juice and the faces around us were hard and set and angry in truth i thought they would be angry with us as though we had visited this upon ourselves and in doing so visited it upon them it wasnt the case we had not been living in the settlement two years and yet these people took this assault upon us as an outrage some wanted to take up arms and attack tindalls house at empire hill to set the whole city on fire some wanted to send envoys to treat with him that we might find some sort of peace there had been much shouting but it was mr dalton who brought the meeting to order he rose and his mere presence great and wide and baldheaded quieted the agitated gathering this attack upon the maycotts is an attack on all of us make no mistake he said and tis a mighty low thing to get redskins to do what you wont do yourself the crowd which hated indians above almost every other thing heartily agreed but while we each have reason to take it to heart said dalton i have more than most and so does skye here for this is about our whiskey you all know tindall has his own stills and he sees he stands to lose money if we keep on with what were doing for his loss is your profit you have more to trade than anyone else in these parts you all get richer tindall dont like that thats right shouted mortimer lyle who worked a plot of land down by the creek he was short but squat and muscular and was missing his left eye thats it all right and thats why weve got to go burn him out burn him out is what i say this got a general cheer of approbation and though dalton tried to quiet the crowd he could do no good then andrew stood and waved the men down and slowly they calmed my gentle andrew soothed this group of border rioters it was something to behold of course he was known by now as a reasonable man generous with his carpentry tools and eager to lend a hand to aid a neighbor that he was the creator of the best whiskey in the four counties only added to his reputation yet that was nothing compared to what had just happened he was new a soft man from the east but he had dispatched three murderous braves on his own and that meant the floor was his if he wished it i have fought in one war he said to the group once it had been quieted and i have no wish to fight in another even less so if it is unnecessary yes we might kill tindall and burn down his home but what should that get us the men back east wont send soldiers to fight the indians that terrorize us but i can promise you they will send soldiers to fight rebels who visit violence upon the wealthy you men read the newspapers they say hamilton wants to consolidate the power of the federalist governmentnot to mention his own power within that governmentand an insurrection in the west would give him what he most wants an excuse to exercise his power we could never win it would be a victory for our enemies if we even showed up to fight this produced a murmur of agreement then what do you suggest asked walter gall the miller i suggest said andrew looking rakishly handsome as he grinned his devious grin i suggest that we go have a talk with him a talk gall answered with indignation there was general uproar andrew it seemed was soft after all he would respond to violence with palaver yet he calmed them once more i looked upon him with admiration and i saw mr dalton and mr richmond did so also they knew his worth and it made me proud he thinks to provoke us into a fight its what hes counting on i think he needs to see that we are resolute steady and firm but not quick to violence hell not back us into giving him what he wants it was a simple argument but it was met with general approbation they would talk to tindall and they would let it be known they would not be so used so it was they began to put together a delegation of men to go into town and confront the man who had yet again attempted to ruin all our lives ethan saunders i could not long delay speaking with william duer i had already learned this would be no easy thing he did not wish to speak to me and he employed a vicious tough who could see that he did not have to do what he did not wish to do my only option then was to get to duer where he dared not refuse me and where he could not call upon reynolds as it happened i believed i knew just the place all philadelphia had been discussing the upcoming gathering at the bingham house william bingham was one of the wealthiest and most influential men in the nation friends with anyone of any significance his wife anne was considered to be one of the most charming and beautiful women in the world and it was said that much sympathy in europe for the american cause originated with that ladys tour of foreign courts needless to say it was inconceivable that i would be welcome in let alone invited to their home it was as well then that i did not limit myself only to those places where people might wish me to be it was impossible for me as i passed the day not to dwell upon the fantasy that mrs pearson would attend the gathering that night for many years she and anne bingham had been particular friends had cynthias husband not vanished she would certainly be in attendance under the circumstances it would be impossible but even so i imagined what it would be like to meet with her in such a setting in polite company where we could stand near each other make polite conversation and imagine that all was as it should be i had met the lady at such a gathering when i had traveled to philadelphia during the british occupation to infiltrate a british spy ring fleet had asked me to keep an eye upon his daughter and make certain she wanted for nothing i never after discussed with him my attachment to her for fear he would think i had taken advantage of the girl though she and i intended to reveal all to him after the conclusion of the war later after fleets death i could not help but wonder if i had been silly if fleet had thrown us together in the hopes that we would develop those feelings we found so irrepressible young cynthia fleet was active in philadelphia social circles and it was at the home of thomas willing anne binghams father and now the president of the bank of the united states that i met both cynthia and her future husband the latter i found utterly unremarkable and could easily have never thought of him again had fate not continually thrown him in my way of my friends daughter i could not cease to think cynthia was a fairhaired beauty with eyes of the palest most transcendent blue her figure was arresting her skin unblemished her face a model of symmetrical loveliness in her manner there was all that a man could find delightful and refined and even before i heard her lively and clever conversation i believe i was a little in love with her yes it was something as shallow as beauty that made me love her before i knew that our minds were perfectly formed for one another before i even knew she was fleets daughter i allowed an acquaintance of mine a man of decidedly british sympathies for such were the sort of men with whom i was forced to traffic to introduce us and i detected nothing significant in her reaction when she heard my name obviously cynthia did not know i worked with her father or that i was in the service of the patriot cause nevertheless she took a particular interest in me allowing me to continue to address her for some length of time what i found was that this lady was not only beautiful but clever accomplished and exceptionally well informed in matters political she did not hesitate to offer me opinions on the most important men of the day what they had done and written of battles won and lost of strategies failed and successful she spoke quietly for my ears aloneand i could not regret that she did so for it was an invitation to lean in closelybut i feared for her safety in an occupied city she ought not to have been so free as to praise americans and condemn the british not to a total stranger at last i put a hand upon her arm and leaned toward her close miss fleet i said in a low voice do you think it wise in such company to speak so highly of the rebel cause do you not know you are surrounded by royalists do you not know that the man who introduced us is a royalist you must assume me to be one as well no i mustnt she said with a mischievous smile not when you are my fathers associate i could not keep from barking out a laugh if you knew that why did you not tell me i wished to know if you would tell me yourself she said i suppose only an hours conversation is not enough to know what you might say in future but i believe it shows a certain amount of restraint on your part it will have to do do for what i asked for us to continue to be friends she said not a week later i met her at a ball hosted by a british colonel and though she was promised to an unpleasant officer for the first two dances she and i managedmuch to this officers displeasureto find many opportunities to dance together and even more to speak it was soon after the dance that i received an invitation to dine at the house of her late mothers sister and husbandpeople of royalist sentiments with whom she livedand i did not hesitate to use all my charms upon these people that i might become a regular fixture within their circle cynthia and i soon found other occasions to be together we strolled the streets took tea or visited the sights she had an almost insatiable appetite for tales of my adventures and though i often had to withhold particulars i told her enough to thrill her i was no stranger to female companionship yet i could not believe i had been so fortunate as to secure the interest and affection of cynthia fleet a woman who seemed molded by nature for the sole purpose of being my companion we lived in such happiness for two months but then the man whom i followed left the city and i was forced to do the same cynthia and i exchanged vows of love and determined to marry upon the wars conclusion i could not say when i would return to philadelphia but we would write indeed we did and on many occasions after the british gave up the city i managed to find my way back to visit her the last of these was but three months before fleet and i were accused of treason a decisive battle was coming and as i kissed her goodbye i believed in my heart that the time would soon come when we could declare ourselves and commit to law what was already in our hearts the next time i saw her however all had been altered her father was dead a malicious fate had made it impossible we could ever be together i would live with the false accusation of treason if i must but i could not endure casting such a stigma upon her t wo hours before the bingham gathering was scheduled to begin leonidas informed me that mr lavien was below and wished to see me i was already dressed and had no objection to passing time in his company particularly if he might impart to me some useful information he came into my rooms and shook my hand with his usual reserve i offered him a drink which he declined and i was glad of it for if he took one i would have been forced to join him and i wished to remain clearheaded as long as i might once we were seated lavien said you are rather well dressed this evening a man cannot dress poorly at all times i answered he knew my evasion for what it was but he did not pursue it instead he leaned forward and there was something rather lively in his eyes i believe this was what passed for excitement in a man of such rigid control i have learned something interesting he said and i wished to share it with you at once about duer no he said about fleet a chill came over me as though id heard a whisper of a dead mans voice i now wished heartily i had taken a drink with or without him i told you to leave the matter be my voice not nearly so steady as i would have liked betrayed my agitation when i wanted cold anger i know you did and i meant to do what you asked but then one thing led to another and i ended up doing what i wished to do instead i dont know how it could have happened in any event you will want to hear what i have to say no i wont i rose to my feet my disposition had no effect upon him he remained seated and still as though we were still engaged in a friendly exchange information once learned cannot be unlearned and i believe you will not be easy until you hear what i now know i sat for there was no denying what he said i troubled myself to call upon general knox who i thought as the secretary of war might be able to assist me indeed he directed me to some archives that proved useful you recall i am sure major brookings i nodded of course i remembered him he was the man who had uncovered the damning evidence in the linings of our travel packs it seems that even after the wars close major brookings remained interested in your case he became increasingly convinced that you and fleet were done a terrible wrong his notes show that he had found some evidence to at least suggest that the case against you had been fabricated by an enemylikely britishwho wished to see the most effective american spies removed from the field i swallowed hard and did my best to master myself before speaking if he thought so why did he never tell anyone based upon what his notes tell me he wished to form a definitive conclusion and uncover the names of the perpetrators before announcing his suspicions but he died before he could complete his task murdered lavien shook his head nothing so mysterious this was two years ago and as you will recall he was not young when you met him his heart apparently failed him while he was riding with his children there can be no thought of murder only ill luck for him and for you it is not enough to clear your name absolutely but it is enough for us to begin making further inquiries i want you to let it be i said my voice was quiet and at first i feared he had not heard me i attempted to speak more forcefully you must not pursue this is it because you fear fleet will not in the end be proved innocent he asked or because you cannot endure the knowledge that you have suffered all these years for nothing i did not answer him i would not and waited for him to excuse himself and leave me be joan maycott spring three days after the meeting at the church we set out on the ride to colonel tindalls home at empire hill it took several hours by horse so we left early in the morning that we might be there well before midday mr dalton thought it dangerous to stay overnight in town he wished to see tindall say what needed saying and return to our homes before dark the journey was tense and dalton never once eased up his grip upon his pistol for my part i vowed i would not be entirely at their mercy since the encounter with the braves i had made it a point to hide a primed pistol in my skirt or apron i had learned from andrew and i would imitate him if called upon to do so we arrived at the estate in a timely fashion and were admitted to a sitting room on the first floor much more primitive than the room to which wed been invited on our previous visit there the floor had been covered with a painted tarp to mimic black and white tiles but this room had much more rugged furnishingsall woodenand i quickly surmised that tindall used this space when dealing with men of the rougher sort society friends were invited upstairs we took seats in the various chairs and awaited tindalls arrival which happened soon enough good morning men mrs maycott he said as he came in the room fair weather we are having do you not think so you may keep the pleasantries to yourself said mr skye that dont interest us he smirked as though skyes response was precisely what he had hoped for as though we were already falling into his trap then what does interest you you know why were here said mr dalton now lets have your end of it andrew during all of this remained quiet it had been agreed that it would be wisest to let the others do the talking for once andrew or i spoke tindall could easily accuse us of letting our emotions lead us to rash conclusions listen to you putting on airs said tindall you may strut around all you like but i cant say i have any inkling of what you want i am a busy man but as you wish to speak with me ive made myself available now it seems you answer my kindness with insult it is you who insult us said mr dalton we know perfectly well that you sent those three braves had maycott not shot them i dont know how far the incident would have progressed and i do not care to know the killing of indians is a serious business said tindall you dont want to provoke the local savages to violence i cant agree answered mr skye that refusing to be killed is a provocation the indians may see it differently said tindall you may end the nonsense said mr dalton you got no right to tell us what we can and cannot do on that land not so long as the rent is paid this kind of insult cant go unanswered tindall slammed the butt of his gun upon the floor then answer it he roared his voice was sudden loud a challenge so blatant and naked it seemed to me obscene in the face of it the three menandrew dalton skyestood silent and humbled i saw quite clearly that with me in the room there would be no violence and tindall might continue to taunt us as much as he liked no one spoke the silence was thick and full of menace going on longer than i could have imagined at last the stalemate was broken when the door opened and the plump negress whom wed encountered on our previous visit entered the room i see you got yourself some guests colonel she said how come you dont ask old lactilla for refreshment i got biscuits i got cake i can make some tea right quick good god gal cried the colonel if i wish for refreshment ill call for it well said the woman you got that lady here again and looks like youre being none too kind to her husband and their friends seems to me if youre going to be unkind to folks you might as well give them some tea to make it go down the smoother tindall clutched his fowling piece if i wish for advice from a nigger i will certainly call for it until then id advise you to shut up and get gone she put her hands upon her massive hips dont you talk to lactilla that way gal tindall said half rising from his seat get gone before you regret it i aint going to regret nothing but letting you talk that way it aint right my eyes were upon this woman so i did not see what tindall did next from the corner of my eye however came the red flash of flame and the smoke and the crack of the discharged fowling piece all at once lactillas face was covered with blood there were small holes in her plain white dress across which erupted rosettes of blood like crimson fireworks against a night sky tindall had fired the weapon from a distance of fifteen feet and i presumed it contained birdshot it was plain the poor woman would not die of her injuries though she was lucky to have escaped blindness i knew tindall had missed her eyes because they were wide with surprise her mouth open and slack then understanding what had happened she let out a shriek and ran from the room tindall set down the smoking gun returned to his seat and smiled at us i beg your pardon for the interruption you were saying it was mr skye who spoke first youre mad tindall shrugged i will not be challenged in my own home there is no serious harm done but i believe that nigger should be well behaved for a little while at least when she forgets herself i shall know best how to remind her andrew shook his head you have convinced us that you are a villain but you have done nothing more than that you may own our land but you do not own us we did not fight in the war to be slaves here at home i am sick to my death of the war as an excuse for every beggar who wishes to prop himself up you tell me that you did not fight to be a slave well i fought that i might keep my slaves so that puts us rather at odds doesnt it he pointed at andrew you allege i sent red men after you but now stand there silent did you fight in the war so you might enjoy the luxury of being a coward later andrew began to move forward but i put a hand upon his arm tindall grinned at me i see you are governed by your wife i cannot blame a man for wishing to please so pretty a lady but he must also know when to be his own master my heart quickened and i feared that in the end he would goad andrew into doing something foolish you may try to provoke us i said but it is your deeds and not your words i hate dont be so eager to dismiss my words he said ive not yet finished speaking there was something in the air and we felt at once that tindall had been playing games with us you think that because i am against your brewing whiskey i am somehow threatening you that i have no better things to do with my time than to toy with my poor insignificant tenants you fools i am only looking after your interests you in your little hovels away from the world have no knowledge of what is happening back east you dont know what the government says of you or that indeed it says anything at all mr skye took a step forward if you have something to say then say it tindall smirked i dont know if you are familiar with the plans being orchestrated by alexander hamilton the secretary of the treasury his most recent project is to establish a national bank separate from the government but closely allied to it the revenue for launching the bank will have to come from somewhere so hamilton has decided to place an excise tax upon unnecessary luxury items those people desire but can do without there is no better way to raise revenue he has argued than by putting an excise tax on something no one actually needs and only hurts the fabric of american life and what is this luxury mr dalton asked why said tindall with a grin tis whiskey boys it has been planned for some time but i have just received confirmation by fast rider that hamilton has convinced congress to pass the whiskey tax and what you owe will be based not upon how much you sell or how much you earn but on how much you produce mr dalton rose from his seat and took a step forward they cannot do it he cried we make no true money from whiskey but use it for trade we have no money to give you need not shout at me said tindall i did not devise the law no one consulted me it has been passed and nothing can be done about it and that is why you were so eager to see us asked andrew so you might gloat over imparting the knowledge that the government has passed a tax designed to ruin us no he answered not at all i wished to speak to you to inform you that my old associate general john neville has been appointed local tax assessor and he has secured my services to make certain the money owed the government is collected in the weeks to come i will determine how much each of you owes and i mean to collect your debts if you refuse to pay i shall take what you owe in land or equipment it is the law of the land and i mean to enforce it that will be all gentlemen he looked at me and lady of course ethan saunders all the world wished to be at the bingham gathering and i was not invited this was of no moment for i had no doubt getting in would be the easiest thing in the world as i approached on market street i observed the lanterns lit all along binghams mansion here was one of the jewels of the city a private residence of remarkable splendor and taste hardly less massive and grand than the library company building for those europeans who believed america to be a country of furclad manbeasts possessing nothing of arts or subtlety i should defy them to see our finest architecture of which this house was certainly an examplea monument to american sturdiness modesty and opulence a queue of coaches made its slow important way through the circular path along the front of the house but i would not join with them instead leonidas and i went around back to the servants entrance much to our surprise this was locked i had anticipated a busy stream of servants moving in and out among whom we could be lost but apparently the binghams had prepared long in advance leonidas asked not my plans nor made snide remarks upon my lack of preparation he knew me too well to think i would regard this locked door as any sort of impediment i reached into my right boot in which i kept a hidden pouch containing several useful lock picks i found the one best suited for the device before me and within a minute the lock sprang and i turned the knob replacing the picks in my boot i pushed open the door here we found a dozen or more cooks chefs and servers hurrying about not in chaos but with a kind of mechanized determination upon the stoves steam billowed forth from the ovens came fiery blasts of heat one woman set pastries upon a white porcelain tray another used a massive pair of tongs to pull small fowl from a pot of boiling water into this fray we ventured and i commenced a lecture to leonidas on the proper placement of cheeses a lecture that lasted the breadth of our stroll through the kitchen if anyone considered it remarkable that a man should walk through this room lecturing a negro on the art of serving food no one mentioned it to me thus emerging from the kitchen we found ourselves in the massive house where we had only to follow our ears and ascend a set of stairs to reach the main body of the festivities thus settled i sent leonidas to find where the other servants were gathered there were several dozen guests in attendance and in addition to the room that had been cleared to create a space for the dancers the revelers were spread throughout three large rooms that appeared to have been furnished with such gatherings as this in mind each room contained pockets of chairs and sofas so guests might sit and converse and every chandelier sconce and candleholder was stuffed with a fat taper lighting the room so that it seemed almost daytime in one room several tables had been set out with cards for gaming wine and food was served freely a trio of musicians played in one corner and our beautiful hostess the incomparable mrs bingham beautiful and elegant enfolded in her massive nimbus of golden hair flitted from guest to guest in the ballroom the great and important and pompous of the city and so the nation turned about with elegance or clumsiness i minded neither the candles nor the food nor the fiddlers nor even the dancing i was less comfortable with the company for here was nearly every man of substance in the city there was mr willing president of hamilton s bank there the great windbag john adams the vice president with his agreeable wife abigail by his side missing much to my simultaneous disappointment and relief was the great man himself washington it was said he avoided such gatherings for he alone had to forge the public role of the president and knew not if it would be too frivolous for the leader of a republican nation to attend a gathering of this sort it was for the best i decided in my fallen state how could i face a man revered by all and by me more than any other however there was hamilton standing next to his wife eliza i had flirted with her many years before but if she recognized me she made no sign of it she was still vaguely pretty but shed grown a bit plump and dowdy having given birth to so many children i believed even the parents had lost track the two of them bred federalists like rabbits it was an easy enough thing to mock him but when i observed the happiness with which she looked upon her husband and the comfort he took when he held her hand i felt keenly why i was in that room i was there for cynthia and for all i had lost all that had been denied me i took a goblet of wine from a passing servant and acted as though there were nowhere else in the universe i belonged so well i wished above all things not to be noticed for there were many men in that room whom i did not know well but who might yet recognize me might yet recall my name my face and the crime of which i had been accused i wanted to do what i must before being generally seen i was not to be so lucky however i had only begun to scan the room when i felt a hand on my shoulder and turned to face colonel hamilton himself with eliza still by his side diverting her gaze for a moment she smiled at me captain saunders it has been many years i bowed to her far too many and yet while i have aged you look no different than when last i saw you i trust you are well so went our exchange of nothings she politely made no mention of my having been disgraced since i last saw her very polite woman after a moment of this hamilton excused himself from his wife and pulled me a few feet away what are you doing here i did not mention i was invited its strange you know sometimes i think we are not so close as we used to be saunders i dont want you muddling things you have no business here i dont want you making enemies what do you care if i make enemies or no i dont want you making enemies for me he clarified oh i said noting that his eyes moved past me to nearly the other end of the room where stood a man of about the same stature of hamilton he had red hair and a handsome face that beamed with pleasure in no small part i thought because he was surrounded by a small group of men who appeared to hover over his every word why thats mr jefferson i said more loudly than hamilton would have wished for please leave hamilton said you know i said if you did not wish jefferson and his minions to associate the two of us together all you had to do was ignore me now here we are in close conversation looks quite bad for you that is the least of my worries he told me i want you to go across the room jefferson appeared to note hamilton s attention and the secretary of state offered the secretary of the treasury a stiff bow as hamilton returned it the hatred between the two seemed to me an almost physical force as solid as steel as hot as the sun if a man had stepped between their searing gazes he would surely have been incinerated jefferson looked away and i turned to say something to hamilton but he too had walked away having wasted perhaps enough energy on me already i could not help but think there was something of a kindness in his words as though he had asked me to leave for my own good rather than his own and i wondered if i ought to take it to heart i continued to wonder as i crossed the room and i might have kept on wondering to the point of departure if i had not observed the man i had come to molest huddled with a small group of men was mr duer and his rugged associate was nowhere to be seen i took a glass of wine from a passing servant finished it found another and began to approach the speculator i had not gone more than a step or two before i was joined by mr lavien who moved along as though we had been by each others side all night shall we he asked i did not think you were invited i said i know for certain you were not he answered we strode toward duer who was engaged in conversation with a trio of men two of whom were unfamiliar to me though i recognized the third as bob morris perhaps the wealthiest man in america in whose philadelphia mansion george washington lived and worked an unapologetic speculator morris had grown rich off the revolution and even richer in its aftermath even this capacious cormorant hung upon duers every word now that i had a chance to study him duer appeared even smaller and more fragile he was as delicate as a statue made of glass and his little body suggested smallness the way the night suggests darkness i had the distinct impression of towering over him though he was only slightly shorter than lavien finely dressed in a trim suit of navy blue velvet with bright gold buttons he was a dandyishlooking fellow whose hair was cut into one of those unnatural short bobs then fashionable it looked for all the world as though someone had dropped a pyramid of hair from a great height to land upon his head upon seeing us duer turned to his companions gentlemen if you will excuse me even at such a pleasant gathering as this there are unpleasant duties to which i must attend his courtiers disappeared and we had the great speculator to ourselves he prepared himself to say something dismissive something intended to introduce and conclude our conversation in a single stroke i understood the look of determination upon his face and i jumped in just as the corners of his mouth twitched i would not let him take a position from which he would find it hard to retrench i am sorry i said before he could utter a sound if i approached you too abruptly the other day sir allow me to say i have long admired you if only from afar i am also sorry if you have been troubled in the past by this fellow lavien he is troublesome i daresay in the capacity of serving his master yes even though his master is an old friend of mine even so even so i interruptedalways a risky move but i aimed to show duer i was more his man than he was himselfthere is a time and a place for everything and this is not the time for pushy hebrews to be troubling men at so glorious a gathering do you know mr duer that he has not even an invitation to be here i know it is scandalous oh dont look that way mr lavien if we were to insert ourselves into a secret gathering of the high pharisees i am sure we would be made to feel as unwelcome as we must alas make you under these circumstances so be so kind as run along theres a good fellow find yourself some unleavened bread and perhaps something porkless to put upon it lavien who never betrayed a feeling without first calculating its efficacy now wore upon his face a mask of anger and humiliation we had discussed nothing in advance but he allowed me to pursue my course without hesitation and i could not help but think how well it would be if our partnership could be formalized what great work we could do for our nation i watched as he wandered off demonstrating his fictional chagrin with countenance and body language i for my part set aside my glass of wine what is your connection to that man duer asked me oh it is a silly thing really i said i have through a series of obligations with which i shant trouble you decided to look into the disappearance of mr pearsona favor for a friend of a friend of the gentlemanand that man lavien has set himself as my rival i believe he attempts to curry favor with colonel hamilton and it is a most irritating thing to look upon now i admire hamilton as much as the next man but he has been curious in his choice of whom to employ and if i may be so bold whom not to those first few months when you were taking charge of things at treasury were the most productive i think he bowed you are kind to say so i was quite astonished to discover how prone he was to flattery but i knew it was a hand that must not be overplayed not at all not at all now if you dont mind a question or two i promise to make it quite painless and you may always decline to answer an easy thing between gentlemenchristian gentlemen i should say that we together could have the joy of drawing a circle on the ground in which lavien could not step was enough to satisfy duer i shall do my best to help you he said so good of you but no more than i expected now to the matter of pearson can you tell me more about your dealings with him oh it is no great secret said duer he and i did some little business together and though pearson was desirous of doing more he was never to my taste our paths crossed most significantly over a matter of property he had some investments in a project of mine to buy and sell and hold leases on the western border of this state you two dealt with war debt did you not i affected an easy attitude concealing the disgust i felt for a man who would cheat veterans out of their promise of payment when they had held on to their promissory notes for a decade or more among other things he said the profit in war debt has of course diminished since the assumption bill passed but it was a way to make a little money a few years back now the money is to be had in government issues bank scrip and other ventures like the million bank in new york i proposed he studied me closely i have heard of that bank and i suppose it may be as good as any but i have no specific knowledge of it how came you to know of it a cousin in new york is an investor and urged me to invest there as well he said it was a significant opportunity any bank if it prospers is a good investment and now that hamilton has launched the bank of the united states and plans the opening of more branches i presume we shall see many more such institutions in this country but while they can be an excellent investment they can also be quite treacherous like anything else witness your friend jack pearson nothing can be sounder than government six percent issues but he has ruined himself in them i thought about what that woman mrs birch had said that the house she rented from pearson had been sold precipitously i could not affect surprise however lest i alert him to my ignorance instead i chose a kind of easy familiarity is not ruined a bit strong i understand there have been some reversals but surely nothing so bad as ruin duer smiled showing his canine teeth like a victorious predator oh hes quite ruined the world doesnt know it yet and if you count yourself a friend you shall not put it about but it is the truth of the matter what could it mean what could it mean for his disappearance for the efforts directed against me for the unknown agenda perhaps most important what could it mean for cynthia that her wretched husband whose only worthwhile quality was his money was ruined to duer i said is that why he has vanished duer made a strange noise in the back of his throat its not a good vanishing hes effected is that not pearson over there speaking to that very fat gentleman he turned slightly and it seemed to me he did so in order to avoid being seen i glanced across the room to where duer had been gazing and saw that it was indeed jacob pearson drinking a glass of wine and nodding solemnly but in no way gravely he looked nothing at all like a man under a cloud of financial ruin standing only a little way removed attached to the conversation but in no way a participant was cynthia i looked at pearson then duer then pearson again duer must have sensed my dilemma for he tittered almost girlishly you want pearson i know but you are not done with me i see ive misjudged you saunders but this is not the place to discuss business come see me tomorrow at the city tavern you may upon the conclusion of trading ask me what you like he bowed and withdrew i hardly heard what he said there before me was pearson cynthia had been threatened to protect whatever secrets he held hamilton had unleashed the monstrous power of his man lavien to find him now here he was in the most elegant private home in the city and i could not think what to do about it even so i must do something i had not even found a way to take a step forward when lavien appeared by my side i saw him first he said and began walking i roused myself and began to walk as well unable to catch up it felt to me like a metaphor joan maycott spring the response to the whiskey tax was universal we would not pay the tax was foolish and illconceived and sooner or later the politicians in philadelphia must recognize that fact when tindall sent hendry to our cabin to tell us that we owed a hundred and fifteen dollars andrew shook with rage and mr dalton who owed an equal amount was tempted to take his gun to empire hall that day but mr skye talked sense into both of them or what we thought was sense at the time another meeting was held at the church and little was agreed upon but that this was more eastern indifference to the plight of men upon the border they let indians murder us and refused to send their soldiers they allowed speculators to toy with our lives and now we must pay them to do it anyone with a stillanyone who brought his grain to a stillwould suffer from this tax what was immediately clear was that the tax would drive smaller distillers out of business and the only benefits would go to wealthy men back east and largescale distillers like tindall who had cash and could shoulder the tax the excise had been promoted in philadelphia as hurting none and benefiting all but it benefited only the wealthy and it did so upon the backs of the poor amid all this life went on i continued to withhold from andrew the news of my pregnancy preferring to wait until my fourth montha milestone i had never before reached i worked on my book kept the house and prayed that the whiskey tax would somehow disappear two or three times i slipped onto tindall property to help nurse lactilla who returned to health remarkably well i felt not precisely guilt but i believed that tindall might not have been so quick to anger had i not been in the room in a strange way i believed he had shot her for my benefit i said none of this to lactilla i brought her fresh cheeses and milk eggs though she needed none and cloth to change her bandages she lay upon her bunk her face a collection of red welts she would smile at me and say missus maycott you just nothing but goodness but i knew it was not true i was not goodness at all i was something else i tended to lactilla not because i thought myself responsible but because i could not endure the thought of a world in which this poor creature must undergo such suffering without a commensurate response in kindness it wasnt goodness it was a kind of rage a burning need to do something before things slipped into a darkness from which none of us could ever emerge i was by myself preparing a stew for our evening meal when the dog began to bark excitedly we kept it tied up near the entrance to the cabin lest it run off but the disadvantage to this system was that it could not prevent a stranger from entering i heard the alarm however and prepared myself just as the door to the cabin swung hard inward and there stood tindall flanked on either side by hendry and phineas hendry observed my expression of surprise and disorder and laughed cruelly looks like we caught her making us some dinner dont it tindall came in after him clutching his fowling piece and grinning as well and never had the two of them looked so much alike phineas closed the door and sat in the rocker by the window his rifle stretched across his lap he had not met my eye since entering tindall strolled about the cabin with an arrogance only to be found in a man taking what is not his he looked into the pot he looked at the pantry he peered at our bed and smirked where is your husband joan he ought not to leave you alone like this it is mrs maycott and he is about the property he will be home shortly i shall inform him you called if he is to be home shortly my dear ill just make myself comfortable right here and wait awhile you want to get comfortable hendry i believe i do i take my comfort where i can get it something was different now they were not here to bluster or to frighten but for something else i dared not to consider what i must ask you to leave now i managed well thats a funny thing tindall said to me lowering himself into a chair your husband owes more than a hundred dollars dont you know every man with a still in the four counties owes you now i said i have not heard anything yet of you trying to collect your husband is a special case making trouble with his new methods now ive been so good as to apply some of his rent money to that debt but then you know what happens it means he hasnt paid his rent and if a man hasnt paid his rent then do you know what happens to the land hes renting get out i said again no thats not right joan thats not it at all the land goes back to the landlord and that landlord has a right some might even say a responsibility to toss that man off his property so he might learn to be industrious do you know what happens to the land hes renting get out i said again phineas continued to look out the window bitch he said without turning his head an industrious man might have been clearing this land doing something useful with his time rather than making whiskey which cant make him money and can only bring him debt i took several steps closer to him you think your money and your toadeaters are going to keep you safe if you stir the ire of the settlers here these are rough men with nothing but their strength and pride and resentment principally for you phineas did not move did not turn though he continued to mutter hendry took several steps toward me i do not know what i thought he was going to do but he appeared to me a monstrous face the red skin under his scraggly beard glowing in the light of our fire his eyes moist with excitement thiss been coming he said i could not react quickly enough to prevent it he balled his fist and struck me directly in my belly the pain hit me like a wall of water from a broken damit was vast and overpowering and for a time i was lost in it i fell to my hands and knees gagged vomited upon the floor my bonnet fell off and hair fell about my face careful tindall said weve spoken about your temper the smell of my own vomit overwhelmed me i gagged again but nothing came forth i had been expecting something terrible yes but not brutal unadorned violence if they would do this they would stop at nothing ugly lights danced before my eyes please i gasped what is it tindall asked me you talk like a man but you dont know what pain and fear are i reckon youre finding out though please i said again i am with child this i thought could not but excite their mercy or at least their pity tindall was a monster but he could not be such a monster as to assault a woman with child aint that something tindall asked well a woman with child wont want another blow to her belly i suppose that would be what i imagine do you imagine that hendry i dont know if i do he said his foxlike face seeming to grow sharper but maybe git her dress off phineas said git it unbuttoned like you said i pushed myself to my feet i felt the heat of tears in my eyes the sourness of my purging in my mouth what kind of devil are you im a devil from virginia my good lady and i take what i want if i can that is the true vision of america the one i fought for the principles of the revolution have made me a king in pittsburgh you go too far i said i go where i like now should i ask hendry to strike you once more maybe we can do something about that troubling thing that grows within you involuntarily i put my hands across my belly or said tindall we can make a different arrangement ill allow you and your husband to remain here and i will make certain hendry strikes you no more but in return i must ask you show me some consideration you know what i speak of dont you joan let us go from here the two of us we shall leave your husband in peace let him tinker with his whiskey i shall overlook his rent in arrears i shall even wink at his whiskey tax for him this year why i gasped my voice low i struggled to keep myself calm why do you do this to me why me above others i cannot believe that i alone have caught your eye why me and not another because the others have already given me what i like he said his voice cold you defy me your husband defies me your friends defy me i cannot have it and i wont have it all of you must taste what it means to defy me and you shall be the first i would rather die i said and i may have meant it oh i dont think so in a moment or two you will be imploring me to have you on the terms i mentioned but if you vex me if you are impertinent i may have to alter the terms i forced myself to stand erect to thrust out my chin to show him my pride and my anger not on any terms i do like how she thrusts out her bosoms at me but it shall not be enough hendry would you please show this woman that i am not a man to be taken lightly i put my hands inside my apron please i said ill have my turn too hendry said when the colonels done ill have my turn and phineas hes been waiting i been waiting he said staring out the window hendry had only taken three steps toward me when i pulled the trigger i was not so foolish as to take out my gun i was outnumbered and could not compete with their strength even with the firearm my chances were not good if i wished to live i needed to depend upon trickery i fired through my apron and the ball struck hendry in his neck i could not imagine how andrew had so calmly fired his pistol under the table at the braves the weapon bucked wildly in my hand jerking back and striking my hip almost hard enough that i feared id broken bone heat burst around my hand my apron caught fire but i patted it out quickly i staggered two steps back and looked up and saw hendry put his hand to his neck slapping it as though a mosquito had landed upon him blood flowed heavily through his fingers thick and almost black that aint right he said then he fell tindall stared at me for a second his expression was one of monstrous impossible disbelief as though the sun had sprouted legs and walked from the sky his face went red and he lifted his fowling piece and i knew all too well he would not hesitate to use it i leaped into the air to take shelter behind our evening table i hit the floor as the gun roared and a rain of birdshot hit the wood a sudden and nearly simultaneous series of wet hard smacking noises above me glass shattered and whiskey trickled down he had struck our only piece of porcelain a flour jar and the room was covered with shards and white powder i was unharmed but i knew i had not much time we had both spent our weapons and neither could take the time to reload in a contest of strength though he was an old man tindall would certainly best me only then did i recall phineas more than half a minute had now passed since id struck hendry if phineas were to fire upon me surely he would have done so by now i dared to peer out from behind my table but i saw no one in the cabin but tindall and the door was open phineas had run off it was hard to believe that a boy who would kill indians in cold blood would flee from this but perhaps the scene was too close to his own past perhaps despite the hatred he felt toward me for knowing his heart i still reminded him too much of the life he had lost and he could neither go against tindall nor strike out at me i could afford no time to sound the depths of the boys soul however i had to get away from tindall before he reloaded or came after me with a knife or simply used his strength of body to overtake me i lay but a few feet from our fireplace and having no other recourse i reached into the fire and pulled out a burning branch it was hot but i grabbed an end as yet untouched by the fire gripping it tight i pushed myself to my feet using my free hand for leverage and charged at tindall i suppose i must have been an unnatural figure disheveled blackened with powder whitened by flour red with anger eyes wide with determined rage he maneuvered around me and made his way to the hearth with two or three quick kicks he dislodged the logs which spilled out and tumbled near our dining table the flame from the logs began to lick at it and i would have to act quickly to prevent the spread of fire it was what tindall depended upon because he used my moment of confusion to rush out the door i should have let him go the cabin needed tending to but i did not think of it i had no reason to charge after him and yet i did i was so full of hatred for what he had done what he had threatened to do what he had made me do the part of myself i knew as me where my soul resided retreated and shriveled all that was left was a whitehot demon who yearned to do some unnamed unknown violence at that moment the thought of life the thought of continuing to breathe upon an earth where tindall still lived was unsupportable he ran to his horse and i chased him hard and fast waving my burning branch and screaming i can hardly say what coming down the path now was andrew with dalton and skye approaching from the path on the other side of the tree where tindall had tied his horse i saw them though i did not think about what i saw or i would have left tindall to them little can i suppose what they must have made of this scene tindall running frantically me chasing him with a club of fire andrew came running to me he did not care about tindall and he would have known that if there was violence to be done mr dalton should have been happy to do it he only wanted to come to me and if i had only wanted him to be safe and in his arms then all would have been different i should have turned and dropped my weapon and gone to andrew instead i ignored him and continued toward tindall i had killed one man and i wanted nothing more than to kill another phineas had said that the west would change me and now i knew it had i was so changed i did not even know myself tindall reached his horse but did not mount he looked and saw me then looked past me i was a crazed woman with a stick he an officer beside his mount he saw andrew running and that was another matter he did not know that andrew would not harm him that he only wanted me to make certain i was unharmed tindall might simply ride away instead he took a pistol from his saddlebag and turned to andrew i saw it happening and i opened my mouth to call out but i could make no noise my voice betrayed me though i know not what i should have shouted to make a difference tindall fired the pistol at andrew discharging it at a distance of no more than ten feet andrew was thrown back and fell at once to the ground striking hard and flat and with sudden force he landed not like a living man but a lifeless weight i found my voice and let out a scream as i dropped my torch and rushed to andrew ignoring now the murderous tindall that andrew was struck need not mean his end he was young and strong and resilient it is what i told myself but it was all deceit even from a distance i saw the ball had struck his heart and i believe he was dead before he fell he lay there eyes wide and lifeless i reached him and knelt i cradled his head in my arms i stroked his hair i called out to heaven though heaven would not answer i felt a heat upon my skin and though i did not look up i knew it was the cabin awash in flames i had not troubled myself to extinguish tindall knew he was in danger now and he acted quickly he climbed onto his horse and rode off dalton fired his rifle after him but he had no clear shot i hardly heard the crack of the weapon the cries of anguish around me what did i lose that day it pains me now to speak of it for i lost everything i lost my darling andrew who wanted only that i should live the life of my innermost desires i lost his child which died inside me though i know not if it was from hendrys violence or from my shock at the events that unfolded i lost my freedom for tindall put it about at once that i had murdered hendry in cold blood and sought to murder the colonel too and though it sounded trivial in my own ears i lost my novel taken by the flames that scorched my cabin this too i lostmy innocence for i had killed a man and i could not regret doing so surely that made me into someone i was not before everything i had desired and dreamed of and wanted in life was taken from me can it be wondered that i set myself against my enemies and if my enemies were the first men in the nation itself can i be blamed for seeking justice the shape of that justice was not formed until later and not formed alone but even as i sat with my beloved husbands body in my arms the ghost of it was there haunting me from the spectral realm of notions not yet conceived ethan saunders i had considered it a possibility that i might see hernot a realistic possibility but within the realm of the conceivable yet upon seeing her i could not imagine a response other than to stand frozen staring then to look away then to stare her gown sky blue with swirling yellow designs revealed her stillmarvelous figure to advantage having a low neckline and sleeves to just above her elbows exposing her fine white skin her pale blond hair was piled high in the fashion and atop it rested a prim little cap with yellow feathers stretching upward a blue ribbon which matched the gown itself billowing down i had seen her in fine dresses before of course though when she had been younger they had been less stiff less formal they had been the simple if elegant dresses of a lovely girl not complex fabric cages of european origin then shed been a soft and charming young lady a foot still planted in girlhood but now she had turned into a woman stony and commanding in her beauty lavien walked toward them came within ten feet and then turned back to me ill not speak to him here he said why not it cannot be done here for now it is enough that he is returned if he were in hiding he would not have come to this house pearson is back and that is all that matters if you will excuse me lavien hurried off careful it seemed to me to avoid being seen by the pearsons across the room he approached hamilton and whispered in his ear this could not long hold my attention not while cynthia was in the room she did not see me jacob pearson however did he looked up and met my gaze and turned most desirous of speaking to his wife it had been many years since id seen him but i had no difficulty in recognizing him he was perhaps six or seven years older than myself though the years had been more unkind to him than i flatter myself they had been to me his hair had turned white and lines had exploded around his eyes deep crevices had formed in his cheeks and his teeth were yellowthose he still had for all that he retained some of the rugged handsomeness he had possessed a decade earlier and though he was clearly cynthias senior the two of them together did not have the comical aspect of some couples in which the husband is significantly older than the wife pearson looked at me and there was something cloudy in his brown eyes bloodshot and tiredlooking i watched while he pretended not to have noticed me and reached out with his handthick with veins and unusually largeto grasp cynthias arm digging into her flesh with his yellow fingernails i saw her white flesh turn whiter and then red she blanched closed her eyes for a moment and then nodded very briefly i was too far away to hear what he said but i could see from the cruel shape of his lips that he said terrible things i knew too that his soul was tainted with a blackness that frightened me it is easy to look at the man who has married the woman you love and see only evil but this was not simple prejudice i knew what i looked at and i hated it i was stepping up before i knew it and i understood at once that had i not caught myself had i not reestablished communication with my own mind i would have strode forward and pushed him down for an instant i imagined the room full of politicians and dignitaries would delight in seeing this man fall to humiliating injury yet i realized at once that to find pleasure in this scene a man would have to know that pearson was a fiend to the uninformed it might appear as though i simply delighted in knocking men over and in such circumstances the world would no doubt turn against me before either of them saw me approaching i turned away i grabbed a glass of wine from a passing servant and drank it down angrily then i went to do what i did best i would set things in motion think you it is easy to get a wellknown and beautiful woman alone away from her husband at so public a gathering think you that in the company of dozens of guests and nearly as many gossipy servants a man can just pull such a woman aside into a private closet it would not be easy for any ordinary manat least i suspect it would not i cannot say how ordinary men go about their business here is how i went about mine i had leonidas request one of mrs binghams servants to inform mrs pearson that the lady was needed most urgently in the library it would work i thought all would be protected by a buffer of supposed negro ignorance each servant claiming to believe that he or she had only passed along what was believed to be true i sent the message and went to the library to await the arrival of the lady i stood by the fire leafing through a volume on the late war until the doors opened and a troubledlooking cynthia pearson rushed inside upon seeing me she was struck still and silent then she opened her mouth and would no doubt have called out her surprise but recalled the doors were open instead of saying something she closed the doors i believe it was good that she did so it gave her time to think or perhaps it gave her time to cease thinking and allow her heart and the memory of past emotions to if not eclipse then at least take the stage along with other more reptilian designs my dear god she said with the door closed she took three or four purposeful steps toward me but stopped well short of the usual conversational distance she folded her hands before me as though she were about to sing an italian aria i was told i was required for an urgent matter you have been told the truth i said cynthias blue eyes flashed something meaningful though i knew not what and she turned away from me she strode purposefully toward the doors before pulling them open she turned back to me i asked you not to contact me i begged you not to you cannot have been invited to this house anne would never have asked you without informing me you must go what does it matter all centered upon your husbands unexplained absence but he is absent no more he returned last night and would say nothing of where hed beenonly that he had traveled on business i tried to tell him that the government man lavien was looking for him and that others had come told me terrible things the men who warned you not to speak with me she nodded i dont know what transpires with my husband i dont know who it is that threatens me but i know my duty even when it is to those who do not deserve it why have you called me here like this in so improper a manner what is it you want of me cynthia you asked for my help that you have been threatened into retracting your request does not relieve me of my duty have you been asked to speak to me in these familiar terms no i admitted that was entirely my idea she shook her head what is it you hope to accomplish captain saunders what indeed i hardly even knew did i want an apology or an explanation or a return to those days when i was young and had so much before me i said i want to know why you married him she turned quite pink and her mouth formed a delicate o i cannot say what she was expecting but it had not been this i watched as she took a deep breath to collect herself she glanced about the library and her eyes fell upon a decanter of wine she poured herself a glass and then to my surprise poured one for me it was more than ten years ago you are not a child can you not put it behind you is it the mark of maturity that one sets love aside i took the glass with much gratitude yes she said it is she said it with such venom that i felt foolish and ashamed to have put her in so difficult a position and i was prepared to tell her so i knew not why i was therein that house in that city i knew not why i had not been able to live my life since the close of the war but i would not be so base as to drag this lady this stranger into my sadness when i looked at her prepared to offer some tepid apology i saw that something had changed with hersoftened perhaps broken her chin was lowered toward her chest a hand raised to her face she was crying tears ran down her face in slow thick globes she wiped at one eye with a delicate hand you were gone ethan you left and i knew why you left you could not bear for your shame to taint me i dont know if that was noble or selfish or if those things can even be distinguished but i was alone you were gone and my father was dead jacob was kind to me he wanted nothing from me and he washe was like a father to me he was so much older that i did not even notice when his interest became something other than fatherly and i was already so used to depending upon him that marriage when he proposed it seemed inevitable i ought not to have said it but i was full of drink and had no will to control myself he does not seem to me paternal but cruel she turned away you embarrass me i am sorry i said no dont be sorry you must never be sorry after what youve endured my god ethan what have you done to yourself you did not have to let the blame attach itself to you you know the reason i could not bear the cost of extricating myself i could have you tell yourself it was the right thing the glorious thing to do to sacrifice yourself for a great cause but did you stop to think of those it would hurt did you think of what your nobility would cost me i took a step closer to her you must leave him cynthia before it is too late leave him how am i to leave him am i to take my children and flee penniless into the street and to what shall i come live with you ethan in your boardinghouse and be a fallen woman cynthia i said she stopped i am sorry i have no business venting my rage on you but i am trapped and i rage like a trapped creature i cannot go so i must stay i had no heart to tell her that her husband whose money alone now offered her solace was likely ruined you cannot think i am content to abandon you to that devil i said at last i have been with that devil since i was a girl you are too late to rescue me you are impulsive but there is nothing for you to do i am not prepared to leave you cynthia you must leave only she looked away only what only you must see me again she set down her empty glass and left the library b ack at the gathering i tried to make sense of our conversation what did cynthia want from me perhaps even she did not know i hardly knew what i wanted from her a dalliance i could not ask her to compromise her position so she was not some pretty housewife of an obscure gentleman farmer or merchant she was a prominent lady close friends with the most known and beloved woman in the city because of her friendship with anne bingham if not on her own account eyes were upon her and the risk to her would be too great not so far from where i stood cynthias radiant face showed no sign that she had wept indeed she now laughed most heartily in a small circle of people including her brute of a husband he hung upon cynthias armno signs of cruelty nowand smiled at this comment or that occasionally dared a rasping laugh that sounded like dry leaves rubbing against one another i saw no sign of lavienor hamilton for that matterwhich was just as well i strode about the room trying hard not to take another glass of wine i think i would have surrendered to temptation but i looked up and saw a familiarlooking man plump and redfaced and knew him at once though i could not say how i continued to study him his little eyes and blunt noseall so porcineand perhaps would still not have known him if it had not been for the girl next to him she was equally porcine though younger and less plump and with a mass of yellow hair she was the girl in my stolen timepiece and he the owner i walked over to him bowed and held out the watch sir i said i believe i saw you drop this in the street several days ago i attempted to run after you to return it but my way was blocked i have carried it upon my person ever since in the hope of finding its owner he took the watch from me his fat fingers moving with surprising gentleness why i never thought to see it again i must ask your name sir that i may know who to thank i bowed again ethan saunders at your service what the traitor he must have regretted his words for his red complexion now purpled i bowed again i am not he that man and i merely share the same name he wished to make more conversation but i demurred and excused myself to wander more there standing by himself looking morosely at a portrait upon the wall was jacob pearson with little to lose i approached him probably with more boldness than clarity why tis jacob pearson i cried good heavens man it has been years he turned to me and smiled reflexively in an instant his smile faded and then returned this time quite false sir i am afraid you have me at a disadvantage you look to me familiar but i cannot place your name it was a wellexecuted lie i will grant him that it is ethan saunders we knew each other during the war pearson glanced across the room until he found cynthia locked in conversation with her friend mrs bingham and another woman also quite striking whom i did not know they did a passable job i thought of pretending not to observe me and pearson together yes of course he let go of my hand i heard you were dead or was it disgraced disgraced i said but enough of my ignominy tell me mr pearson where have you been this last week why does everyone wish to know not ten minutes ago hamilton himself was troubling me with his questions i see not why it is the worlds concern you do not like my saying so it is rather bad for you then for it is my custom to speak as i like for what does a man rise to consequence if he must guard his own tongue i can think of no reason and why are you here at all can it be a man like you has been invited here i must ask mr bingham what he means i saw no need to answer this implied threat if he wished to issue a challenge i could certainly answer it theres been considerable speculation about your absence i said some have talked about your properties in southwark and others of your interest in the million bank surely you can shed some light upon the subject i suppose my wife has been talking let me tell you something he put one of his enormous hands upon my shoulder i did not like the feel of it theres more to wish for in a wife than beauty that is my advice to you my stomach clenched at this mention of his wife i could not let it go unanswered you have strangely large hands i said its as though theyve been flattened by a great stone youll forgive me for talking freely but i also like to say what i feel what is the advantage of being disgraced if a man cannot speak his mind he studied me looking me up and down his sharp nose bobbing like a blade i think this conversation has taxed me long enough now i must away to look for mr duer pearson wandered off and it occurred to me that i had not seen duer since our conversation could it be i wondered that he did not want to see pearson duer appeared to have no interest in or respect for pearson yet pearson spoke of seeking out the speculator the way one speaks of seeking out a friend those answers would have to wait for here and now i could pass the time in gazing openly upon cynthia i watched her now speaking with mrs adams the vice presidents wife my brief conversation had only confirmed to me how hateful was pearson and how unhappy cynthia must be in her life with him she was right of course that i could not simply take her away but neither could i leave her i would have to conceive of some alternative and i would have to do so soon because each day she spent with him would be a torment to me you appear lost in thought sir i looked up and there was the woman i had seen with cynthia and anne bingham she wore a much simpler gown than did cynthia looser longer arms higher neck the material was of a plain pale red but it looked marvelous well upon her she was a brownhaired beauty with large eyes penetrating in their gray intensity like clouds threatening snow she stood next to a man of my own age who though not very tall or very distinguished with his receding hair yet held himself in an admirable manner here was a man the ladies enjoyed and who enjoyed the ladies he had something of a swagger i could not help but approve captain ethan saunders at your service i said to them both a pleasure to meet you captain said the man colonel aaron burr though now i suppose i am to be addressed as senator ah yes i said senator burr i have read much of you in the papers you have made quite an enemy of our secretary hamilton in new york he laughed hamilton and i are friends from many years back but he is every inch the federalist and new york is increasingly republican and antifederalist in its outlook nevertheless i like to think that men might be opposed politically and friends socially i do love an optimist i said and is this lady mrs burr mrs burr is not here at present i am afraid i only just met this delightful lady yet i will take the liberty of introducing you to mrs joan maycott i bowed now that you are in good hands the senator said to the lady i must beg your leave to speak to some of my brothers of the senate i hope i shall see you more mrs maycott he took his leave and left me with the woman and i could not say i was displeased she had that vivacious look that suggested she should be good company there was more to her too she had a command in her physical presence a kind of authority that in her own feminine way reminded me of the most accomplished and successful of military men strange though it might be to say i had never met anyone man or woman who so immediately put me in mind of washington himself you did look lost in thought you know she said to me i am a thoughtful man i said was it something to do with mr pearson you will forgive me for asking but i saw you in conversation with him is he a particular friend of yours i know him from many years ago i said is he a friend of yours i am friends with his wife she answered then you know hes been missing oh he told me he was in new york she said but perhaps i ought not to have said as much i was under the impression he did not wish people to know it then he has been thwarted how sad for him she laughed i enjoy my pettiness with a dose of wit you do not like him i love wit and may endure pettiness but he strikes me as cruel which i cannot abide i answered i think perhaps you know his wife from many years ago too from another person this might have seemed impertinent beyond endurance but there was something so clever and endearing in how she spoke these words that it doused all impropriety she and i are old friends i turned to look at this beauty full on and she met my gaze most boldly here i thought might be an agreeable consolation to my confusion with cynthia do you live in philadelphia mrs maycott i live here though i travel much you enjoy travelwith mr maycott perhaps she looked directly into my eyes once more as though leveling an accusation sir mr maycott is dead i am sorry for that madam that is merely something one says mrs maycott i said to my strange interlocutor i cannot help but feel you believe we have met before or that you expect me to have some knowledge of your circumstances i dont believe you do sir mr duer tells me however that you inquire into jacob pearsons business and that you do it for hamilton is that so i did not pause i did not wait so much as an instant for i would not show surprise that she had previously spoken of me or knew anything of my business i would act as though it were the most natural thing in the world you know mr duer there are so many here she answered one may meet everyone but i must ask you as there is much consternation about hamilton s policies are you an enthusiast of his i do not work for or with hamilton though my interests may be intersecting with his tell me captain have you any thoughts on the whiskey excise i am no friend to excise taxes i said keeping all inflection from my voice nevertheless i set down my glass on a nearby table and scanned the room for lavien pearsons disappearance and the whiskey tax were bound togetherthere could be no doubt of it not when my inquiry into the matter had faced opposition from the hairless western giant the man with superior whiskey as his calling card i did not know if therein lay the link to the threat against the bank but i hardly cared about the threat against the bank i only cared that this woman appeared to be telling me that she had some knowledge of pearsons disappearance and thus a connection to cynthias safety i believe we have much in common sir she said we are both caught up in events larger than ourselves and we must make choices that we sometimes find unsavory if we are to do what is right i attempted a smile what events are you involved in madam she leaned closer i cannot speak of them now not here it is too soon and too public she gazed across the room and indeed william duer was looking at us most pointedly would you be willing to meet with me again sir have i given you sufficient reason to do so a man need never look too hard to find a reason to meet with a pretty lady i do not know that i am vulnerable to flattery she said not unkindly shall we make an effort to find out i asked that sounds most delightful when shall we talk again have you an engagement for two nights hence i bowed i am yours to command i am so pleased coming toward us once more was jacob pearson now alone cynthia being across the room speaking with the beautiful mrs bingham mrs maycott reached out and grabbed pearsons wrist mr pearson would it be an imposition if i bring a dear friend to dinner the night after next he looked at me and was unable to contain his surprise but then seemed to recollect himself or perhaps mrs maycott you may of course bring anyone you like unless it is this man here i cannot like him such wit she said certainly it is captain saunders we both look forward to the evening mrs maycott paused not a moment but took my arm and led me away you see nothing is more easily effected i am not certain i will be made to feel welcome i said and i am not sure either of us cares i however will have the pleasure of offering consternation to a man i do not like and you will have the opportunity to pry further into his business we shall both in the end be made happy joan maycott spring there were days lost i do not apologize for that weakness though when some remnant of clarity returned to me when i escaped the deepest fog of grief i vowed i would never again give in to such madness not on any account they were days when my enemies ate and slept and prospered and advanced their goals while i did nothing and in doing nothing i aided them for that is how it is when faced with evil men one must either resist or in varying degrees collaborate the day after he was murdered we interred andrew in the churchyard several men from the settlement unceremoniously hauled hendrys body to town and dumped it in the mud of pittsburgh as it deserved i took no pleasure in the contrast after andrews funeral my friends guided me to the isolated hunting cabin shared by the men of the settlement they told me it was important not to remain in my own home that it had been damaged though not destroyed in the fire i was too lost in my own confusion to inquire of the details at first my grief was so great i was like a woman sleeping with her eyes open seeing all about me understanding none of it then at last after some days i began to emerge from this first numb stage of grief though what came next was worse by far for i understood the enormity of what had been wrenched from me i had lost my andrew i had lost our child i had lost my work my home my purpose in this whole universe nothing was left that meant anything to me it was as though some great hand had come and wiped away all that had ever given me cause to take a breath i could do little more than weep and clutch my knees to my chest and lament mr dalton and mr skye for reasons i did not yet understand spent long periods of time in the hunting cabin when not out in search of game the irishman stomped about the cabin in a rage swearing vengeance clenching his fists ripping off bites of his tobacco twist as though he could rip off tindalls flesh by doing so mr skye in his far more subdued manner sat by my side he made perpetual efforts to feed me venison broth and bits of buttered corn bread and it was by his efforts that i did not starve when mr skye grew too tired or restless to tend to me jericho richmond sat in his place i took comfort in his silent company yet there was a darkness in his gaze too his brooding woodcolored eyes hung on mein pity yes but something else once i turned to him and said i am dead now i have lost everything you are not dead he said but you are different i looked away for i did not wish to hear more be mindful of it he said you have sway over these men i had no wish to be careful or thoughtful or anything else and after he spoke these words i found i did not love mr richmonds company it was mr skye who proved my most attendant nurse i welcomed his presence but refused at first his ministrations i would shake my head and push away his spoon when he tried to feed me oh i was cruel to him i called him names a withered old man who knew nothing of what i had lost unlike him i could not simply sail to distant shores when my life lay in ruins i felt nothing but regret and selfhatred even as i spoke the words yet i could not stop them and so i only wept more mr skye that good man nodded in understanding and offered me another spoonful of soup in the end i ate on what i believe was the third or fourth day i began to shake off the greatest torpidity of grief that is not to say i no longer felt grief keenly or was no longer weighed down by it on the contrary i knew it would kill me and i would welcome death if i did not find some means of converting my sorrow to something of purpose i sat up straight and looked at mr skye who had been sitting and gazing out the little cabins window something must be done about tindall i said it is not for you to do he answered and why not did he not take everything from me am i to be content to lie quiet i will travel to pittsburgh and swear out an arrest on him mr skyes lips were colorless though hed been biting them incessantly you cannot go to pittsburgh there is a warrant out for you for the murder of hendry he paused to take in a deep breath of air and andrew i threw off the blanket that covered me and leaped to my feet i had been abed for days in the same dress i had worn to andrews funeral and had i been driven by anything other than the most vivid of rages i might have fallen over from dizziness do not say it he cannot dare to accuse me of his own crime of killing my beloved andrew misunderstanding my outrage for unendurable sadness mr skye moved to embrace me but i pushed him awaymore cruelly than i would have wished but i suppose i already understood i might be as cruel to him as i liked without risk of his resentment dont try to comfort me how can you sit here feeding me soup while the man who murdered my husband blames his crimes on me what sort of man are you he looked into my face full on something he rarely did and i saw precisely what sort of man he was i saw it in his unwavering eyes of cold gray how he showed neither surprise nor anger i did not know what i would do with him but i already knew i would do something what kind of man am i a wanted man i am here because the warrant has been sworn for me as well and for dalton aye tindall means to use his crimes to end our distilling and thats the truth of it now have you anything else you wish to say to me i sat back down upon the rugged bed with its rough straw mattress and said nothing i did not weep my mood was too dark for that instead i searched my mind for some answer some response to this horror that would not end how can he do it i asked finally tis but greed joan said mr skye in his quiet and gentle voice thats all we fought the british so we would not be slaves to their greed but weve greedy men enough of our own to take their place might i trouble you to fetch me a bucket of hot water i asked him and a cloth to wash myself and a bit of privacy aye joan with all my heart im glad youre of a mind to see to yourself i dont even know precisely where i am i said to him will i need a horse to get to pittsburgh is there a horse if i need it he narrowed his eyes as he studied me you havent heard me you cant go to pittsburgh theyll arrest you i am certain they will try the water if you please john he squared his shoulders really quite broad for a scholar of his age but then frontier living left no man scrawny i cant let you do that i somehow managed a smile you cant stop me your task is to help me now go fetch mr dalton i will need both of your consents in writing for what i must do already my plan had begun to take shape it was bold and large and audacious and to accomplish what i wished i would need the loyalty of these men to have that i would need to show them i was not to be underestimated when dalton returned we sat at the cabins rude table sipping whiskey while i told them the first part of my scheme it would not do to tell them more skye was willing skye was always willing but dalton looked to his friend before making any decision richmond shrugged do it if ye want but not without thinking dont do it because she says its to be done be your own man dont make trouble dalton answered weve trouble enough jericho shook his head but said no more really i could not blame him though i asked them to trust me to trust me beyond all reason and wisdom they gave me what i asked for it was but my first inkling of what was to come i had always been bold and audacious with men and i had in the end never been denied anything from a man well disposed toward me only now did i begin to understand how such a power might be used to save a nation worth saving or perhaps destroy one too corrupt to save i t was a rough road and though i left while it was still morning i was not in pittsburgh until well after noon i had no notion that i was so well known but once i stabled my horse and began to walk along market street passersby stopped to stare at me men streamed out of watsons tavern as i passed i was infamous i was an outlaw i suppose the notion would once have filled me with horror but a strange sensation of mastery came over me now i was the subject of scrutiny and yes fear it was good i thought they should be afraid i knocked upon the door to mr brackenridges house and was greeted by a woman significantly younger than he yet far too finely dressed in a handsome gown of printed cotton to be a servant i could only presume this to be the lawyers wife she was pretty with a mass of blond hair bundled under a saucily propped bonnet the lady looked at me smiled and prepared to inquire of my business until she saw a group of two dozen or more onlookers creeping forward to watch the proceedings she ushered me inside and closed the door after pausing for a moment she slid shut the bolt better to be safe yes her voice betrayed a slight german accent now youve business with my husband ill wager yes under the judgmental scrutiny id suffered on the street id felt a kind of jagged strength now subjected to this strangers kindness i had to fight hard to swallow my tears my name is joan maycott the ladys eyes widened in surprise and she moved to put a hand to her mouth but stopped herself ill show you to the office and then ill fetch hugh i followed her in silence mrs brackenridge had known my name at once just as the people on the street had recognized me instantly i could only imagine what lies tindall had cast about to turn me into so wellknown a personage at mrs brackenridges direction i took a seat in her husbands disordered office and waited only a moment or two before the lawyer came flitting in taking a step toward me then one toward closing the door then changing his mind and performing the whole dance once more at last he settled upon closing the door and then taking my hand mrs maycott he said his voice solemn for one who was used to speaking in such high and sharp tones he then bowed and let go my hand and moved toward his desk chair as though he would sit but instead walked over to the window parted the curtains and examined the crowd of people gathering outside you seem to have gained a great deal of notoriety since last we met have you come to me for assistance in surrendering yourself he asked the question with a great deal of uneasiness perhaps he thought i might kill him too how absurd it was here i was a woman brought as low as any in history deprived of all how could i be a greater victim yet the world feared me mr brackenridge id heard rumors that charges had been set against me but until i came to town i could not believe they were anything more than stories do you mean to say that i am truly called to account forhere i paused for i did not believe i could speak andrews name and refrain from weepingfor what has happened something in my tone must have soothed him he removed himself from the window and took his seat from under his writing desk he brought forth an old wine bottle filled with whiskey and poured himself a drink into a pewter cup then he poured me one as well and slid it across the desk the sheriff has issued warrants for your arrest along with dalton and skye he looked at his shoes i drew in my breath i must say what needed saying and do what needed doing the weakness must end or there was no reason in living they dare to accuse us of andrews death it was somehow easier to speak in the collective but still i clutched my cup of whiskey and drank deep i knew it from its darkness and rich flavor to be one of andrews batches and its warmth gave me strength speaking without weeping gave me strength holding brackenridges gazeyes that too gave me strength there was so much out there all for me to take if only i would grasp it weakness was easy and comforting and action tore out my very heart but i would do it why else live if not to do it brackenridge studied me as though he could see something changing inside yes they accuse you of that and of killing hendry colonel tindall claims to have witnessed it himself you must know i would never have harmed my husband and neither would his friends it has been cast about that there was an argument fueled by whiskey there was some talkwell i am loath to say it mrs maycott but as your lawyer i must there was talk of a matter of impropriety between you and mr dalton i believe i shocked mr brackenridge by laughing that accusation could only be made by someone wholly unfamiliar with the man in question sir i know we have not been long acquainted but do you believe that i was a party to these things as colonel tindall has alleged he dared to gaze at me no i do not i have seen many horrible things in the west but i have never once seen any person man or woman so coldly dissimulate about murder there is little wealth here and most crimes are those of passion and those passions are ever on display afterward so i do not believe things transpired as we have been led to believe i dont know how much time we have before the sheriff arrives so i suggest you tell me what really happened as quickly as you can and then i will need you to do something for me sir it will require me to place a great deal of trust in you but you will see i have no choice w e had more time than either of us imagined the better part of an hour before the knock came the time proved sufficient for me to tell a much abbreviated version of what had happened at our cabin i could not have told him a more detailed one for to do so would be to reduce me to the weeping woman id been in the hunting cabin and i would not permit that mr brackenridge suggested that the boy phineas might yet be found to serve as witness i did not think it likely even if he saw everything i did not know i could depend on him to speak truthfully so great was his irrational hatred of me we had no time for anything but my original plan thus i told him as much as he needed to know and convinced him to transact my business a hasty contract was drawn up and signed with mrs brackenridge and a literate serving girl as witnesses we were not done five minutes before they arrived when mr brackenridge opened the door the stout and hateful colonel tindall stood there clutching his beloved fowling piece the very one he had fired at me minutes before killing my husband next to him stood a man i had seen but never met who i knew to be the sheriff he was nearing sixty i supposed but looked as fit and rugged as any frontiersman tall of form wide of shoulder he wore a plain hunting shirt from which rose a thick and corded neck his face sported a short and reasonably well trimmed beard its orderliness perhaps a nod to his office his dark and hooded eyes rested on me from under a tattered beaver cap there were now a hundred or more townspeople crowding the street in an effort to witness the apprehension of the horrid criminal maycott they blocked the muddy roadway pressing in close for a glimpse of the evil woman the sheriff stepped forward though he did not cross the threshold he looked past mr brackenridge and addressed me directly tis mrs maycott i presume im talking to i am she i met his gaze but i would not look at tindall i did not trust myself to do so for i feared i must spring upon him and prove myself the creature they believed me to be thats the shameless whore who killed my man tindall cried a gasp arose from the crowd and i first believed it was owing to the cruelty of his words but i soon realized it was in response to the fierceness of my expression perhaps they believed i might strike again and any of them could prove victim im afraid youll needs come with me madam said the sheriff attempting a civil tone i dont believe that either necessary or advisable said brackenridge he stepped forward and now he was in his most lawyerly mode he still appeared birdlike to me and his eyes flitted here and there but he had a kind of regal quality to him that i had not previously witnessed and i imagined he must be a formidable presence in the courtroom advisable be damned tindall shouted and you be damned too brackenridge are you so desperate for money that you will take to your bosom a woman who would slaughter her own husband murderous indians are no longer enough for you it is not advisable repeated mr brackenridge in a stately tone and i say that for your sake i can conduct our business in the full light of day before all these witnesses if that is what you wish sir i think if we do so it will be much harder for you to choose a favorable outcome now i beg you both come into my office where all may be set out in private tindall must have understood the note of triumph in brackenridges voice for he assented in a few minutes the two of them sat in mr brackenridges office across from the desk the lawyer sat facing them and i stood behind him too agitated to do otherwise i dont much see the meaning of this said the sheriff his cap was off and resting in his lap mrs brackenridge had offered to take it but he assured her it was too crawling with lice to be welcome upon her hat rack theres a warrant sworn witnessed by the colonel himself i have a great deal to say answered mr brackenridge to begin with there are witnesses who will contradict the details that colonel tindall has provided witnesses barked tindall no doubt the womans coconspirators no one will credit anything such men say mr brackenridge smiled they are among the witnesses but not the only ones we spoke with a group of indians who say that you hired them to harass this lady and her husband brackenridge i must point out did not lie but repeated a lie i had told him tindall snorted thats nonsense sure enough those indians are dead the sheriff now turned to observe tindall i am sorry colonel but precisely which indians do you believe to be dead you do not deny hiring the dead ones tindall now blanched and cast me a gaze of unrestrained hostility perhaps it was meant to frighten me but with what could i be threatened i know nothing about them this womans lies will come out in court i shall see her and her fellows prosecuted and when they are convicted i will confiscate their property you may wish to take your chances in court said mr brackenridge it may strike you as a reasonable gamble but there is no chance of confiscating anything i have personally overseen the sale of these properties and the goods upon them they cannot be sold said tindall they belong to me as you well know title to the ground rents can be sold and given the improvements made to the land can be sold at considerable profit im afraid there is nothing left for you to confiscate you will receive your rents from the purchaser but the stills and equipmentand indeed the secret to making the new whiskeybelong to the new owner he now turned to the sheriff if you must take the lady into custody then do so i insist upon a speedy trial however for i believe that information to be revealed will lead not only to my clients acquittal but to an arrest warrant sworn for colonel tindall the sheriff studied tindall and then mr brackenridge my thought apparently hardly mattered in this exchange who holds the lease asked tindall mr brackenridge shook his head i do beg your pardon but i cannot tell you that it is confidential as my client wishes tindall pushed himself to his feet you dare cross me brackenridge the day will come when you will wish you never had but today having crossed you yields such a delightful feeling he answered rather warm inside like a good glass of exceptional whiskey i believe i shall savor it am i correct in assuming that you are withdrawing your complaint against mrs maycott damn you yes he shouted he abruptly stormed from the room and then from the house the sheriff sat in silence for a moment occupied in no more complicated an operation than the removal of lice from his hat which he nervously cracked between his teeth finally he turned to me we still got two dead men missus i swallowed hard hendry shot andrew before andrew died he shot hendry mr brackenridge suggests colonel tindall mightve had a hand in it that is not what i saw i answered this wasnt the time to pursue tindall we could not prove his complicity in a court of law for it would be our word against hisand his word had the power of wealth behind it i would have to take him on in another way the sheriff nodded he replaced his hat and nodded to us both then he went outside to disperse the crowd ethan saunders the new day brought much to think about and reflect on but the first order of business was to finish my conversation with duer he had promised to meet me at the city tavern so that was where i traveled in the morning there i found the trading room in an uproar of chaos that made my previous visit seem a scene from easter prayer men were on their feet shouting at one another red in the face two rather bloated gentlemen stood close enough that in the heat of their exchange they made each others faces slick with spittle clerks scrambled to keep track of trades but the quick trades and angry progression made their task impossible and most were filthy with hastily applied ink i watched not knowing what to think like a street gaper watching the aftermath of a terrible accident i stood that way some minutes until i noticed someone now next to me a bespectacled older fellow with gray hair and a gray beard he looked at me with some amusement not certain what to make of it he asked in accents that betrayed scottish origins if this is your first time at trade and it might be from the looks of you youve chosen a bad day not my first time and im not at trade im merely curious what has happened the scotsman gestured with the back of his hand toward the room in general and at nothing in particular bank shares are down for the first time in some months they were trading at just a few days ago but today theyve dropped they were trading at under for a while but there are some bargain hunters that have raised the price to last i saw are you a trader in bank issues i asked no he shook his head i am merely an observer like you lad i looked at the fellow again there was something familiar about him i could not place as if he was a man id never met but heard spoken of more than once he like lavien was bearded and that was unusual enough but otherwise he seemed unremarkable a serious scholarlylooking fellow in a gray suitnone the best but not terribly bad do you know duer i asked him oh i know him where does he sit i dont see him the man laughed hes not here the rumor is hes gone back to new york on the early express coach he has fled as they say the scene of his crimes i felt myself tense as disappointment and anger coursed through me i ought to have made him speak to me last night when hed been in my grasp it seemed to me that duer was a most effective liar he had after all fooled me he owes you doesnt he the scotsman said i can see the disappointment not money only his time i said affecting calm you mentioned he fled his crimes what crimes do you mean he gestured at the room once more this chaos before leaving he let it be known that there are some who have borrowed from the bank of the united states who wont be able to pay what they owe he cast a bomb of chaos and then fled the explosion why the man shrugged perhaps he is shorting bank stock perhaps he wishes to buy cheap perhaps he merely likes to keep the markets unpredictable since a man of duers sort thrives upon chaotic markets but hes not here some of these men act secretly as his agents it is not necessarily a good thing to be but when the most powerful trader on two exchanges asks a man to be his agent he cannot say no if he refuses he turns his back upon opportunities but to duer these men are no more than firewoodto be used burned and then swept away i looked around the room once more and saw no one i knew no one who could help explain these matters more clearly the man with the beard was now engaged in watching some trades and i troubled him no more indeed every man was now trading or watching with rapt attention as men sold their shares of bank issues or bought in the desperate hope that the price would recover all were standing and talking and trading all but one it was the frogfaced man in his brown suit and sour countenance he traded nothing but sat hunched over a small piece of paper writing somethingi could not see whatin a small hand as pinched as his expression i did not like this fellow showing himself again and again and it was then that something occurred to mewhy the graybearded man had seemed to me familiar i stepped outside where leonidas sat with a group of other servants and called him aside telling him what i needed of him she wont like it he said it is of no moment bring her he nodded and departed at once i had no watch any longer but it was yet early trading would continue for the next hour and a half so i returned inside all the while keeping my eyes upon the man with the gray beard and the man with the frog facetwo figures who seemed to be of increasing importance in my life though in both cases i could not say why half an hour later leonidas returned telling me he had brought whom i had asked i went to the door and my landlady mrs deisher stepped inside the threshold but no further i did not want her to be seen and i received a bit of good luck here for the bearded man was absorbed in watching a trade sorry to trouble you mrs deisher but this is important i am ready to give help but i never like to have your negro to have him drag me from my home as though abducting me leonidas shrugged insisting is not abducting leonidas apologizes i assured her i gestured to the graybearded man have you ever seen him before she opened her mouth raised her arm in a point and was no doubt about to scream in a single movement i lowered her arm and clamped her mouth shut let us be subtle my good woman do you know him yes she said that is mr reynolds the one who came to my house and paid me to admit you no more i sent them both away and waited drinking my porter watching the man with the frog face glanced over toward me now and again but the bearded man did not at noon when the trading came to a conclusion the bearded man took a fresh piece of paper from the leather envelope in which he stored his things and proceeded to write out a lengthy note he then folded it into a small square and placed it inside something though i could not see what he rose and left the building in a moment i stood and left as well out upon the street leonidas remained where he had been before sitting with the servants but he pointed right and so i proceeded to follow just in time to see my quarry make another right upon walnut street i remained distant and the streets were sufficiently crowded and chaotic with their usual press of people and beasts and wayward carriages that to survive a man must look ahead of him and could not afford to look back thus i tracked him easily and observed again that he made another right upon fifth this street was far less crowded than walnut and i hesitated as he approached the entrance to the library company building i thought he might go insideand if so i dont know what i might have done for there could be no way to follow without revealing myself but he passed the entrance and then stopped for a moment by a large tree on the far side of the library he leaned against it for a minute and then hurried on i knew enough of human nature and instantly ducked behind a watch house for no sooner had he taken his first few steps than he turned around and looked behind him he had i knew deposited something he might have stifled the urge to look around while walking toward his goal but once having completed it he could no longer resist the temptation fortunately i had anticipated this move i saw his body stiffen i saw him begin to pivot and so i hid myself effectively i waited a moment as he went on and then i did nothing more than take a seat upon a nearby wall i let a full half hour pass and then approached the tree i had observed the graybearded man molesting it had a hole in it and when i gently reached inside i found something that seemed to be the size and shape of a rock but was infinitely lighter when i pulled it out i saw it was a cunning container meant to look like a rock but made of painted wood with a sliding device upon the bottom when i opened it i found a piece of paper no doubt the one i had seen him write on before leaving it was another message in the eminently breakable code but far longer than the others id seen and i had no choice but to retire to the nearest tavern where i called for pen ink and paper the code had changed and i could not simply apply the letters i previously recollected but it was still a caesar cipher and quite breakable in the end it was well worth the effort much had been mysterious to me but now vast amounts were laid open and at last i had some inkling of what was transpiring almost certainly i knew far more than lavien i read and reread the message its contents meant i had to do something i would almost certainly have preferred to avoid for now i would have to go see hamilton once more but before that i would have to deal with the note itself i met with leonidas at the man full of trouble and showed him the message which i had transcribed for him being unable to communicate with you directly is becoming increasingly difficult as there is much to report fortunately i am growing adept with the codes as you must know by the time you read this p has returned to philadelphia he pretends that nothing has transpired but duer used him monstrous ill and it cannot be undone the bus will feel it soon enough and hamilton has no notion of it as for l he is a dangerous physical presence but he is not nearly as clever as he believes he thinks the business is isolated and he will not learn otherwise until too late you were overly concerned about s who is a blunderer and a drunkard he knows nothing about p and shall learn nothing as for mrs p she knows nothing of the impending ruin and once faced with penury i am certain you may have her to use as you like he stared at my transcript for a long time and then at me what does it all mean there is some plot here but i cannot even begin to fathom it neither can i i said as near as i can tell there is a scheme to hurt pearson and consequently the bank somehow duer is involved but it is hard for me to determine if he is a primary actor or some sort of unwilling victim yes yes yes but that is nothing the bank and pearson and the rest be damned ethan this is about you somehow whoever these people are they mock you call you names and plan to make mrs pearson a whore are you saying you think i ought to go to lavien with this by no means said leonidas this is yours ethan this is your burden to bear and you must see it through as you see fit if there is a conflict between your needs and the treasurys needs you may be sure lavien will not give a fig for yoursor about mrs pearsons for that matter i say that with respect for him for i do think him honorable but his honor his sense of duty must put his service to hamilton above service to youor to mrs pearson you know it whatever is to be done you must do it alone entirely alone it is not as though i have a choice but you know you may depend upon me and if you did have a choice i asked if i were to free you right now would you continue to stand by me in this until the end you wont he said but if i did i dont know why i chose to press the point at that moment but his concern for me placed me upon the precipice of informing him that he was free already i dont know he answered earnestly he met my eye and did not waver i appreciated his candor how could i not yet he put me in a difficult position for he was the only man i could trust entirely and i could not do without him so long as this crisis continued i would have to keep the truth from him he could not yet know he was a free man leonidas sensed i was lost in thought and leaned forward to distract me what shall you do about the note do you plan to watch the tree i shook my head its not practical someone would have to watch it at all times and there are only two of us then youll put it back before they discover youve taken it no i said i want them to know ive found it i took a fresh piece of paper and wrote out a short note to replace the one i took my note said only i am coming to find you let them ponder that i said what if they come to find you first then they shall save me a great deal of trouble i did not know if hamilton would see me again once was charity twice a nuisance a third time might prove an outrage i had no illusions about my reception but then he could have no illusions about me if i wanted to see him i would see him perhaps i would wait for him on the street or visit him in his home he knew me he knew if i wished to speak with him i would make it happen for that reason he admitted me right away he sat at his desk which was covered with four or five high piles of neatly stacked papers he had a quill in one hand and a nearempty inkpot by his side i am very busy captain saunders he said so am i its terrible isnt it he set down the pen what can this be about mr pearson has returned so i know you dont visit me upon that score you know i do and that mr pearsons return is not an answer but another question i seem to recall asking you not to involve yourself in this matter i recall that too but you and i both know you did not mean it you would much rather i ran an inquiry parallel to that of lavien you will yield far better results if you have two men competing for the same ends i will not say you engineered this competition but you cannot regret it now let us end this dissimulation you wish me to proceed dont you he looked at me directly no of course you do there is too much in the balance perhaps it is time for you to tell me why you wished lavien to find pearson in the first place why is he of interest to you it is a private matter so he said but i began to think it must be a public matter there was no personal connection i could divine so there was but one obvious reason hamilton might take an interest in pearson given what the bearded scotsman had told me this morning about defaulted bank loans i could but conclude one thing he has borrowed money from the bank hasnt he hamilton blinked and looked away i suppose he may have how much the bank was in its conception my idea and i take an interest in its operation but i do not run the bank and i do not take an interest in its daytoday operations i doubt that even mr willing the bank president could tell you about individual loans without resorting to files you cannot expect that i who am far more removed can summon such information instantaneously on any possible borrower no i dont expect you to know any possible borrower i do however expect you know about this one how much he sighed he has borrowed fifty thousand dollars good god you give that much to a single individual it was for investment and development you have seen how the city thrives under bank money pearson is a respected dealer in real estate and he presented us with a specific plan for developing land to the west of the city but he hasnt done it has he you received word that not only was pearson not buying and developing land he was losing the properties he already had you dont keep an eye on the daytoday minutiae of investment nor does the bank president ill wager no one was going out to helltown to see if pearson was developing it he was a respected man of business and it was safe to assume he was doing what he said but then you receive word that his properties are being foreclosed and you learn that no one knows where he is suddenly fifty thousand in bank funds may have vanished can the bank withstand such a loss of course it can it is a serious loss but there are systems built into the banks charter to enable it to weather defaulted loans easily it is never easy it is never easy i said because what you fear most is jefferson and his faction getting word of this that is the issue isnt it your bank has just launched and endured a rocky first half year with wildly fluctuating share prices now it will be said it is granting loans to the personal friends of the bank president loans that will notcannotbe repaid you know what they will say that the bank is an engine of the northern money men to feed their own greed hamilton nodded that is indeed what they will say that is part of it there is more you will keep this quiet of course there is also the method of the banks funding the whiskey excise jefferson s faction will waste no time in saying that we tax the poor men of the frontier to pay for the irresponsible spending of the rich that is what they will say and the truth the truth is that the bank of the united states is a large bank that makes large loans so of course it is of direct benefit to the rich there are smaller land banks that benefit small landholders and that is what they should do but projects that benefit the rich also benefit others had pearson done with the money what he was supposed to do he would have built properties which would have employed men and caused goods to change hands those buildings would have provided housing space for shops and services for the growth of the economy that benefits all rich and poor clearly that is not what happened with pearson now he has returned what has lavien learned about the fate of the money very little pearson wont answer any questions and i suppose you havent given lavien permission to break his elbows or cut off his feet not with someone so prominent pearson is clever said hamilton he has openly refused to appear at the bank to explain the status of his loan and he knows we dare not press the matter lest it become public knowledge that a loan of this magnitude is in danger im sure pearson knows that that scoundrel philip freneau who writes jefferson s newspaper has been sniffing about asking questions if freneau learns the truth he will use it to ruin us all jefferson and his men would gladly sacrifice the national economy if only to prove i am wrong and they are right which is why the bank has not seized pearsons assets to keep this from becoming a scandal yes while there is the chance of a quiet repayment of all or even some of the loan we prefer to avoid a public fiasco that will only feed jefferson s public animosity toward the bank until we know more we will have to find other means of discovering what pearson is up to it seemed to me that whether it was what he intended or not i was those other means there was no reason not to press it what of duer what of him what is the link between duer and pearson none that i am aware of he said i thought about the note i had found in the tree stump duer has used him monstrous ill and it cannot be undone that was in itself of no consequence let these men ruin one another to their hearts content it was nothing to me and yet there was obviously more to it the bus will feel it soon enough and hamilton has no notion of it all this was a scheme to harm the bank pearson was but a tool cynthia but a casualty who would like to destroy the bank i asked hamilton sighed destroy it jefferson i suppose no not malign it or see it fail or rejoice in its adequacies jefferson wishes to find political advantage who wishes to destroy it by his own hands no one he said no one who could and if anyone could who would it be the rabble he said the rabble prompted by jefferson would see it destroyed the western rustics filled with democratical ideas by jefferson would rather go to war than hand over a penny in excise taxes things are not so complex as you imagine and you cannot see that only because you have been out of the game too long it seemed to me they were far more complex than i could imagine that was the difficulty i f i was going to attempt to chip away at this complexity the first thing i had to discover was the nature of the secret and financial relationship between hamilton and duers man reynolds i might well have told hamilton more if i could have better trusted him but so long as he was secreting purses of gold to men of this sort i would have to hold fast to my secrets more to the point i needed to know why the men who acted against me and acted against cynthia wished to point me toward this man reynolds worked for duerthat much was certainbut it now seemed to me that the bearded scotsman who was so clearly involved with the threat against the bankwanted to make certain i noticed reynolds and perhaps was set against him it was time to approach directly thus that night i walked to reynoldss house and knocked on the door it was later than good manners generally allow for a stranger to call but this was an unsavory neighborhood and lights were on i would take my chances when no one answered i knocked again and then a third time at last i heard footsteps upon stairs and a womans voice cried out from inside asking who called captain ethan saunders on behalf of the united states department of the treasury i responded with only slight exaggeration this was no time to be shy i must gain entrance the door opened standing there in a state of very appealing dishevel was possibly the most beautiful woman id ever seen yes i know this narrative is crowded with beautiful womenmrs pearson mrs maycott mrs lavien mrs bingham we might form a cricket team of beautiful women i cannot help it if they are the ones who excite my notice and so trouble myself to describe yet how beautiful are they mrs pearson is undeniably lovely but it is my feeling for her that elevates her to so exalted a level mrs maycott is a bit weak in the chin to tell the truth but she is mysterious and poised mrs lavien has that hebrew look about her which some may find unappealing this lady was beautiful and not because her demeanor or exotic race or a longing heart provided an added advantage to elevate her no here was a creature of perfection like milton s eve the ideal of female loveliness her fair hair was wavy and in a state of wild disorder her eyes were large and so blue it was almost shocking her cheeks were red and round and molded to perfection her teeth as white as new snow her lips the color of roses shall i go on it is tedious i know but it is important that i make it clear that in part and in sum this was a woman i believe utterly without equal in the united states possibly in the world those who would in years to come judge the frailty of a man enchanted with her knew nothing of her astonishing charms the man did not live who given the opportunity to love her would have turned aside madam will you marry me i asked she laughed she wore a loose gown quite recently thrown on it was rather generous in its presentation of décolletage and her bosoms large and full moved very agreeably i am afraid i am already married sir then i shall take my own life i said before i do so i would speak to a mr reynolds does he live here her face darkened just a little that is the name of my husband sir he is not at home that slovenly brute with his scarred face and lupine demeanor was the husband of this creature how did she endure it how could the world endure it under normal circumstances i would almost certainly have inserted myself in this ladys life to better her state but i had other things that demanded my attention foremost being cynthia i would focus on the beast and not the beauty i must find him he is not in town at all she said may i ask what this involves did you mention the treasury department sir i work for colonel hamilton at treasury reform does not extend to lies of this sort and what will you with my husband there was now something rather unkind in her tone and i did not like it i wanted her to be charmed again i merely wish to talk with him about mr duer i said grinning amicably it is about that gentleman and not your husband i see when will he return i cannot say and where has he gone he doesnt tell me perhaps i said you would care to invite me inside and we can discuss this further another time she said as though she did not mean it and closed the door joan maycott spring mrs brackenridge insisted that i spend the night in her house and in the morning i made my way back not to the hunting cabin but to my own id not told anyone of my plans to do this because i knew they would attempt to convince me of its imprudence there was first the practical matter of my cabins condition much of it had been destroyed in the fire skye had told me as much i found the walls scorched and such furnishings as had been saved were blackened the curtains table linens our clothes and papersincluding my novel but skye had prepared me for this toowere all gone the place stank of fire and dampness but it was where andrew and i had lived and i would not leave it until i must the other principal objection to my returning was that i no longer had any right to the cabin though i did have permission from its owner mr brackenridge to stay there as long as i liked it would not be long i did not wish to remain and doing so would be unwise i understood almost as soon as id understood anything that tindall had pursued us because he wished to deprive andrew skye and dalton of the means of making whiskey i also knew that there were more than a few wealthy farmers in the region who would be willing to buy our leases with our equipment and instruction on the new method of distilling for now hugh henry brackenridge held the ground rents to our lands he assured me he would do his best to sell them to the highest bidder and to do so for no more than a percent commission though if he wished to cheat us we could do nothing to prevent it it was a gamble but i never doubted that he was worthy and circumstances would prove me correct thus it was that things settled into relative calm tindall for the time being would not risk harming us his efforts to have me jailed and his cowardly retreat would make any attempt on the wellbeing of me or my friends far too suspicious he might hope to evade the law but he would not risk an allout uprising from the populace when mr brackenridge sold our groundrent lease and i received my share of the whiskey revenues i might hope to return east perhaps to my childhood home it seemed a respectable way to engage my widowhood yet i could not do those things jericho had said it changes you when you kill a man and that was part of it i had killed i had faced tindall both in physical combat and in a legal duel and i had bested him both times what else then could i do if i set myself to it i was an unassuming woman and men often said a pretty one my appearance led men civilized men to trust me defer to me and often enough overlook me if i embraced these truths if i used them i could accomplish a great deal what i wished to accomplish was revenge not pointless hollow bloody revenge but revenge that would destroy those who had made a tragedy of my life and would at the same time redeem me and my friends the outlines of my plan were clear to me but to proceed i would need the assistance of men like skye and dalton and at least some of dalton s whiskey boys if i were to have them they must trust me even be in awe of me the way his soldiers and officers were in awe of general washington if i were to effect that i would have to do something bold when she came into the dairy barn to milk the halfdozen cows i was waiting for her dawn had only just struck bright and cloudless filling the grounds with sweet possibility id had to trek through the forest at night to meet her but id carried my rifle and walked noiselessly in soft moccasins my legs never tired and though i made certain to watch every footfall my mind wandered over what i would now do the door opened to the east and when she came in she was nothing but a large silhouette the skirts of her plain dress undulating in the breeze but she did not see me and so closed the door and reached for the milking stool shed healed well since i last saw her but there were still red welts on her face and hardened scabs and in some places the flesh had settled into a vaguely pale scarring she had just set down the stool and begun to talk to the first cow when she saw me lord mrs maycott what you doing in the dairy barn it all came out in a single breath i had not precisely been hiding but standing in the shadows in the corner i now walked forward and it seemed to me that i was stepping through a door i was about to become someone else here now under these circumstances i must be a woman others follow i must take command and make events unfold to my liking i looked at the woman what is your name oh lord grief done disordered your mind you dont remember old lactilla of course i remember you i took her hand i want to know your name it seemed to me that all at once this woman who had been rendered property the plaything of a cruel master understood everything not only what i was asking but what i was doing and why an understanding passed between us two women shaped and blasted by a world who cared nothing for us but as playthings for its amusement im ruth she said in a quiet voice do you know what i hate most about slavery ruth i asked you gots to choose just one thing what i hate most is how we allow it to not signify we tell ourselves we have produced this great experiment in republican government we have launched a new era of human liberty the culmination of two thousand years of the republican dream and centuries of philosophical ponderings it has all led up to this glorious moment this glorious nation an exemplar of the greatest potential of the human soul but never you mind about those africans held in bondage they dont signify that is what i hate most its worth despising but id place it something down on the list for me id rather reckon my baby which was took away and with it id number getting shot in the face with fowling piece she smiled and i could see a scar where a piece of bird shot had grazed her lip at some point i said those thingsthe philosophical and practicalmust come together she studied my face with a mixture of horror and understanding is that point now tonight it is i told her she sighed and brushed off her skirts as though my words rained down dust of disobedience and she wished not to be tainted what you mean to do im not certain but i must do something mustnt i everything begins with someone who either does something or does nothing and i wont be the person who does nothing she shook her head you aint gonna kill him are you the depth of her concern surprised me would it trouble you she rose to her feet and walked to the barn door then she walked back it simple for you tindalls a devil that true you want to kill him because he deserve to die that true too but you kill him most likely the slaves get sold off i understood the fear of change but here i thought it madness ruth are things so good here that you fear to find yourself elsewhere things here are bad she said but they always worse somewhere else i nodded i have no intention of committing murder it was not entirely true i could not say precisely what i intended to do to tindall murder was certainly one possibility all right what you need i need everyone out of the house tonight i want it free of servants and slaves all right i get that done for you i waited in the dairy barn the rest of the day ruth who had been mocked with the name lactilla for decades brought me an afternoon dinner and an evening supper thereafter i fell asleep for some hours but when i awoke it was the full of night and there were no lights in the main house of empire hill id made arrangements with ruth and the front door was left unlocked it was no great matter to make my way across the grounds enter the house and proceed to tindalls bedroom the location of which ruth had also explained to me i told her i only wished to frighten him and rob him make him feel as helpless as i had been made to feel but i had not told her the truth i pitied her for she feared being sold if tindall died but tindall was not a young man and he must die sometime it was not that i wished him dead so much as i wished to kill him or more precisely i wished to see that i could kill him i had killed hendry but that had been in the heat of violence and it had been the instantaneous decision of a moment for what would happen in the months and years ahead i wished to know that i could kill and that if i were called upon to do so i would be ready i hoped all could be effected without more bloodshed but i knew that if i pursued my plan the time might well come when i would have to make that decision and i believed it would be easier if i had made it already i could think of no better subject for the experiment than a man who deserved to dieand deserved death at my hand i climbed the stairs delicately pressing my moccasins to the wood so it did not squeak at the top of the stairs i turned right and went to the second door as id been instructed inside it was light but i heard no noise not breathing or the turning of pages or rustling of sheets i pushed open the door a little farther to gain a better view the room was roughly furnished as though the delicacy of tindalls receiving rooms was but posturing and here was the true man a large oaken wardrobe an inelegant side table a plain bed a bearskin rug upon the floor across the ceilings rafters were exposed built at an arc almost as though we were in the hold of a ship the walls were adorned with a few paintings of hunters upon landscapes at the far wall a dying fire burned in the fireplace from the rafters near the center of the room hung the body of colonel tindall motionless not even swinging upon a monstrous thickness of rope his dead face was near black his tongue protruded his eyes were strangely both bulging and closed tight he was dead and had been dead for a few hours at least i stared feeling astonishment disappointment and relief all at once how had it happened that the very night i was to confront him possibly kill him he had taken his own life i did not believe he was the sort of man to be so racked by conscience that he must choose oblivion over guilt yet here was the evidence before me i had been robbed of the chance to test my mettle but i had nothing to gain by standing and staring so i decided to search the house for anything of value i might take i took two steps into the room when i heard the boyish voice i followed you it was phineas he sat in a highbacked chair that faced the fire and so had been invisible to me at the door now he rose and turned to face me rifle in his hand he did not raise it but it was only a matter of time until he did i had a pair of primed pistols in the pockets of my skirts but i thought it too soon to reach for them why i asked not knowing what else to say i seen you coming through the woods and i knew you was coming here and i guessed why when i saw you hiding out with the niggers i knowed it for sure so i come here first and i hit tindall in the head with the back of my gun and then strung him up like the pig he is why i asked again so you wouldnt he said you come to kill him i knowed it and i didnt think you should he laughed i had the strangest feeling of not being there as though i watched these events unfolding from some distant place relief and disgust and terror swirled through me what is so funny i remember you when you first joined up with the party heading west you was just a green gal from the east now look at you killer of men housebreaker thief who knows what else i told you the truth missus the west changes you i said and by god it changed you good but i aint gonna let it change you that much he wasnt going to kill me i began to feel it and my muscles loosened i took a deep breath what do you mean you killed hendry cause you had no choice so now you think you can kill when you choose you think its not so different i did too once id killed some indians when i was with a scouting party cause they ambushed us and it felt good i thought of my family when i fired my rifle right into those redskins chests i didnt mind at all then a year later i was coming through the woods at night and i come across a single indian whod made camp asleep by his dying fire i figure i killed one indian why not another i didnt know if there was more nearby so i didnt use my gun instead i snuck up on him real quiet and tomahawked him right in the face i done his mouth first so he couldnt scream none and then his whole face until he was dead and then i took his scalp i was covered with blood at the end but that didnt matter what mattered was that when i was done i knew killing cause you could was a different thing from killing cause you was made to you didnt like it i said nah i loved it i love to kill indians killing tindall was pretty good too but i dont love myself no more missus thats the thing why would you do this to save me i thought you hated me i hate me missus not you i just get it confused sometimes i looked at tindall and i could now see the back of his head the hair was matted with blood theyll figure out he didnt hang himself of his own choosing dont matter he said i already wrote up a note which i aim to bring to that lawyer brackenridge in town then ill go but theyll hunt you theyll hunt me but they wont find me ill be an outlaw which i reckon id like he gestured with the rifle to the side table near the door theres some notes there a pretty good amount three or four thousand dollars i dont know what to do with paper so you can have it ill take the coins probably six or seven dollars worth theyll think i took it all but you best get gone thank you phineas he shrugged im sorry i said those things to you missus i never had no choice in it i had to say them you understand but im sorry all the same i understand i said though i did not perhaps i did not want to none of it meant nothing and thats the truth now you get gone then itll be my turn i need to get to pittsburgh deliver my message and then get to killing indians he waved his gun at me you best go i caint always help what i do i gathered up the notes hed assembled and hurried down the stairs considering how best to frame these events to dalton and skye i had not been quite the woman of action id wanted to be but i did not see why they had to know that ethan saunders the next morning i awoke to the emotional toll of knowing i must that night dine with the woman i had always loved and do so alongside her husband a man whose improprieties had embroiled not only his own family but perhaps the nation itself by the time i awoke a servant of the pearson house had already delivered a note to the effect that i was expected at seven of the clock i had come in my mind to see this evening as an opportunity to answer many outstanding questions so there was little for me to do that afternoon i may have fallen therefore into some old habits and i spent much of the day in a few comfortable taverns and yet i did not arrive to the pearson house more than half an hour late it had warmed a little and snow had begun to melt so i should not be ashamed to own i slipped on my journey and was damp when i arrived but as most of the damage was upon my greatcoat i presumed my hosts would not know of it this houseor mansion i might style itwas on fourth street just north of spruce on a fashionable block the exterior was of typical philadelphia redbrick remarkable only for its wellappointed bushes shrubs and trees the true beauty of the gardens not being visible in the winter or after dark inside however i was treated to the finest of floor coverings in imitation of exquisite white tile a handsome silverblue wallpapercunningly textured to evoke the impression of the water of a nearly still lakeand numerous portraits many of the illustrious house of pearson a lower servant of some sort a kitchen boy perhaps offered to clean my shoes for unknown to me i had traversed through horse leavings after my grooming was so tended and i was dusted off like a freshly sculpted block of stone i was at last permitted to ascend the stairs to the inner sanctum of excellent company i was shown into a large sitting room where mr and mrs pearson sat next to one another on a settee the gentleman of the house held himself stiffly and formally and waved his oversized hand about as he held forth on some matter of trade his thinning white hair was wild and unkempt and though his tone was voluble his eyes appeared dim and hollow next to him his wife wore a dress of sea green with a flattering cut she looked at me as i entered turned away then looked up once more and rose why do you rise asked her good husband i am speaking and you rise as though no words come out of my mouth our guest has arrived she answered her voice flat our guest oh saunders hide the state secretshaha he has kept us long enough hasnt he pearson at last rose to greet me and i shook one of his big hands his grip was loose and absent as though he could not remember why he took my hand or what he was meant to do with it also rising was the widow maycott who had been sitting in a highbacked chair she wore a much plainer dress than mrs pearson ivory in color highnecked and remarkably charming upon another settee was a couple of some fifty years apiece handsomely if uninterestingly appointed the man was a bit on the short side and plagued with that curious sort of fat which accumulates only in the belly the rest of his body remaining gaunt so that he appeared great with child his grayhaired lady attired in a modest black gown had pleasing features and must have been acceptably comely some thirty years earlier probably not so ten years later captain saunders i am happy to see you once more said mrs pearson her face the very mask of control i suppose she had a great deal of practice see him at last you mean said pearson it is a dreadful thing to make a man wait for his own supper i bowed i do apologize sir i was detained upon government business i told this lie not only to excuse myself but to excite a general curiosity you must tell us of it said mrs maycott what government business could you be about asked pearson the kind with beer and rum by the smell of it in any case i would think the government is by now done with you mrs pearson blushing charmingly made some sort of conversationchanging spousescolding noise in the back of her throat mrs maycott tells me you already know each other and was the one who invited you here tonight so i need not introduce you i have indeed already had that pleasure i said bowing to the lady did i detect a flash of jealousy upon cynthias pretty face she turned to the older couple may i present mr anders vanderveer and mrs vanderveer mr pearsons sister after making the necessary introductory remarks to the good man and wife in whom i had no interest i took a chair matching mrs maycotts separated from hers only by a small table of dark wood and oriental design a servant arrived to present me with a glass of wine and i accepted most gratefully and there i sat mrs maycott smiling upon me her red lips turned up with delightful impishness and mrs pearson looking away you work for our government then asked mr vanderveer in a deep and booming voice do you know the president i knew him during the war i said currently i am engaged in a project for hamilton at treasury however and have no contact with general washington i am led to believe mr pearson that you have had some contact of late with hamilton or perhaps his men not at all he said why should i im sure i cannot speculate i hoped you would enlighten me mrs vanderveer was still in her mind upon the topic of washington and had no interest in my sparring with her brother do you not long to see him again she asked her voice full of the worship only washington could inspire among those who had never met himand probably half who had i bowed from my seat those of us who serve are not permitted to choose the terms upon which we serve how they fuss said mr pearson i dine with washington two times a month and i may ask him to pass the salt as well as any man he is like me no better and i pray no worse how is it that you are on such good terms with the president asked mrs maycott her lips were upturned and her eyes sparkled how should i not know the president pearson returned i do not know exactly how to respond she said i only meant that from my understanding his inner circle is composed of government men men he served with and gentlemen from virginia it is my understanding you are none of those i am from this city madam said mr pearson in a loud voice a man need not be from virginia to associate in the best company and i might say that of washington as well as he might say it of me as for serving in the government it is meaningless anyone may do so as i am certain this fellow will inform you he gestured toward me i dine with washington because we are both men of consequence so we must dine together or with inferiors pearson spun his head so quickly i thought it might fly off entirely and pointed one of the stubby fingers on his oversized hand toward his brotherinlaw jabbing back and forth like the blade of an assassin what is it you say i said nothing jack the gentleman answered his voice a study of calm and reason i heard you you said bingham you rascal i said no such thing answered vanderveer may not a man say bingham now and again i inquired pearson was too far gone in some sort of fit to even hear me you suggest i dine with washington because of my wifes friendship with mrs bingham really jack said the mans sister it hardly matters to us we think it very grand that you know such people as the binghams we would never belittle such a connection mr pearson now turned to mrs maycott and attempted something like a smile perhaps at some earlier time in his life before he allowed a pretty wife and fine house to convince him he was the emperor of the universe he might have charmed a woman or two with that smile if the day had been foggy or the candles dim anything was possible now he appeared grotesque a mask of human skin atop something diabolical and unsavory yet he clearly believed himself to be the embodiment of charm and sought to shore up his position by bringing to his side the only unattached woman in the room always the jewel of greatest value in any gathering do you hear mrs maycott he said his voice now a calm unctuous vibrato such people as the binghams says my sister as though she the wife of a lawyer of but indifferent reputation can sit in judgment of the first families of the nation i think answered the good lady that in this republic there is no one family that may be elevated above another as all are equal before the law from another less charming set of lips i supposed this comment might have launched an entirely new course of outraged oratory but not so now he merely smiled his deathshead smile a good joke mrs maycott a very good joke i should like to hear more of captain saunderss connection with colonel hamilton said the widow in a neutral tone oh yes said mrs vanderveer a drowning woman wrapping her arms about a piece of conversational flotsam such exciting times there i should think with the bank and such mr pearson would not be soothed yes yes you must always flatter he said to his sister you flatter me you flatter my guests what shall it get you i believe i was merely making an inquiry said the lady youve never merely done anything in your life flora so let us not pretend otherwise he turned to me shall i tell you what it means to serve hamilton at treasury you may attempt to do so i answered but as im the one who is so engaged and as you are not i cannot imagine you have much to say that will enlighten me mrs pearson laughed and then covered her mouth her husband grimaced as though this mirth had caused him physical pain he then turned back to me hamilton is a worm did you know that once i cut him in twain i said and then leaned forward to whisper theatrically and now there are two of him he is a worm but he is a worm who does the businessmens bidding his bank is a ruse to trick the nation into funding a scheme to make hamilton and his friends richer but you may be sure ive taken advantage of it because of the bank there is an excess of credit and that means a man of significant commerce such as myself can find the money to invest in government issues when before it might have been difficult i do not like hamilton but i will use him what do you say to that i sipped my wine its all very interesting but it does not precisely tell me what it means to serve hamilton at treasury my partner in business once worked for treasury and he informed me in no uncertain terms that hamilton is a prig with no imagination and no spirit i sat up straight who is your partner william duer i thought all men knew thator all men of substance i suppose once you are drummed out of the army you no longer hear the same things as the rest of us jack said cynthia i say no more than the truth pearson said if he does not like the truth let him stop up his ears we have no shortage of candles where is the footman nate bring us some soft wax for this gentlemans ears he wants them stopped at once i closed my eyes and turned away trying to shut out the noise though i would not resort to candle wax to effect this aim pearsons words did not trouble me not in the way he intended if he wished to rub salt in the old wound i could endure it i turned not in pain but because i needed to think he believed duer was his partner and yet the communication i had intercepted informed me in no uncertain terms that duer was his enemy and duer had most clearly attempted to avoid being seen by pearson at the bingham house i understood then that there would be no answers to these questions without speaking to duer and duer had returned to new york i would have to follow him there cynthia was here and cynthia needed me but i could no longer avoid the simple truth that i must go to new york to protect her i had turned away from pearson and his harsh words and then i had set my face in determination it must have looked like pain for i felt a hand upon mine and when i looked up mrs maycott was smiling at me with warm sympathy who was this good woman i wondered to feel so strongly for a stranger in what she thought was distress i cast her a glance and i smiled hoping to show she had misunderstood my mood then i turned to pearson what is the nature of your business with duer what concern is that of yours i believe he is inquiring to be polite mr vanderveer said i believe you are a fool pearson answered well saunders why do you wish to know did hamilton send you to ask me the jew gets nothing so he sends a drunken traitor is that it i was invited here i answered hamilton did not send me and this gentleman is correct i merely make conversation make it about something else pearson said my business with duer is private we are engaged in a new venture and we play it quietly that is all you need to know it was not all i needed to know but it was something the entire world speculated on pearsons declining capacity what were the chances that william duer would trust him with a secret venture any further questions were forestalled by the arrival of a plump buxom and not unattractive serving girl she informed us we might remove ourselves to the dining room i was pleased to find myself next to mrs maycott and not next to mrs pearson for i should have found that awkward that lady did her best to avoid looking in my direction the entire evening and though mrs maycott made much polite conversation with me we said nothing of further importno matters of government or washington or even accusations of malicious flattery mr pearson was the sole arbiter of conversational topics and he chose to speak only of the excellence of his own food the comfort of his dining chairs and then toward the end of the evening the gripping narrative of his rise from son of the owner of an importation business to the exalted heights of being himself the owner of an importation business mrs maycott and mrs vanderveer both gamely attempted to join the conversation but mr pearson would not have it as for the lady of the house she had i could only presume long ago abandoned all efforts at civil discourse i therefore endured pea soup boiled potatoes with bacon roasted pig chicken in wine sauce roasted apples in sugar and a whipped syllabuball of it without a single pleasant exchange the wine however flowed mr pearson seemed unduly interested in his wifes consumption commenting rather loudly when she finished her first glass and accepted a second which went sadly unfinished more than once our eyes met over the embrace of this communion she looked away i did not mr pearson made the occasional unkind observation but it altered neither conversation nor behavior when mrs pearson accepted a glass of port with her baked apples her husband began such a paroxysm of tuts and clucks he sounded like a henhouse at feeding time have you not had enough to drink already he asked she now met her husbands eye and her expression was dark and foreboding perhaps she had indeed had too much wine i believe i am the best judge i think of all possible judges you may not be the best the wife of one of the first men of the city ought to conduct herself with more sobriety for all the world it appears as though you and that rascal are engaged in a tavern drinking contest the reader may be surprised to learn that he gestured toward me when he spoke really jack began mr vanderveer id advise you not to interfere said pearson it is a foolish thing for a man to wedge himself between another and his wife in addition that great belly of yours tells us you know nothing of when a person has had enough another baked apple anders there is no reason to be cruel said mrs vanderveer quietly what is this an entire sentence empty of flattery all the toadeating in the world shant help you in the matter of my will so be easy on it mr vanderveer slapped the table i do object that has never been our intention pearson waved a hand in the air yes yes dont be tedious he pushed himself to his feet well it has been very good company now i am tired and i must to bed good night to the lot of you with that he left the room leaving the rest of us in stunned silence and the unfortunate mrs pearson with the responsibility of determining what must come next i however was not yet ready for the festivities to end and i rose from my chair excused myself to the company and hurried after my host he had stepped only a few paces out of the room and was on the landing at the stairwell where only a single candle illuminated the gloom when i caught him he contemplated the darkness and had turned to call for a servant when he saw me instead what saunders what is this i wanted to speak with you in private for a moment if you will ive nothing to say to you i ought never to have had you in my home i shall speak to mrs maycott about what manner of person she claims as a friend i stared at him his faceaging and on the very cusp of becoming elderlyin the dim light the yellow flame reflecting off the yellow teeth he was frightened to be alone with me all id had to drink rushed about in my head and i forced myself to focus i want to know about you and duer i wont speak of it i am to say nothing and i shall say nothing what of your properties in southwark youve lost them or sold them and then there is the matter of your loan from the bank of the united states i understand your payments are past due and you wont even appear when summoned are you unprepared to talk about that pearsons face twisted into a grotesquerie of hatred all signs of the rugged man the handsome man he had once been were blasted away by an explosion of fury that altered in a single flash the landscape of his countenance do you mean to have your revenge saunders all those years ago you fled philadelphia and i happened to marry the girl you once set your cap at so now you must hound me i could not show how bitter his words made me and i would not dismiss my feelings for cynthianot for his satisfaction or my advantage i said nothing pearson seemed to grow calmer he said mrs maycott seems fond enough of you and shes an excellent widow to catch put your mind to that if you dare and leave me and my family alone you are not welcome inside this house againor any longer for that matter i go to bed but i shall tell my servants that if you are not gone in a quarter hour you are to be removed forcibly pearson now turned from me and ascended the dark staircase he did not pause to say good night which was rude w hen i returned to the sitting room mr and mrs vanderveer were rising and thanking their hostess for an enjoyable evening perhaps it was a different earlier evening they mentioned they spoke as though the meal had come to a natural and pleasant conclusion they spoke of the lateness of the hour the goodness of the food they thanked the hostess and departed then it was mrs maycotts turn you are a lovely hostess cynthia thank you so much for having me joan she cast her eyes downward mrs maycott raised a finger to her lips it need not be said we are friends i shall show myself out i hope you have no objection if i first speak to your cook that chicken was marvelous and i would learn how she does it of course the two ladies embraced and mrs maycott allowed me to take her hand which was very smooth for the time of year then she was gone leaving me alone with mrs pearson we were both standing looking to where mrs maycott had gone not quite sure what to say she is charming said mrs pearson and they say her husband left her wealthy it is good to know that husbands may be good for something i said such as leaving money to their wives i feared i may have exceeded my limits but mrs pearson burst out into a shrill girlish laugh such as i never thought to hear again captain ethan saunders let us take a drink in the library mrs cynthia pearson your husband has informed me that if i am not gone in a quarter hour i shall be tossed out by the servants she smiled at me ive learned a thing or two after a decade of marriage the servants are loyal to me and the library is well removed far from mr pearsons room there is no better place to go in the house to avoid his notice then mrs pearson let us go by all means i do love a good library her pretty plump girl led us to the library where a fire already burned the girl lit a number of candles and provided us with an excellent bottle of port she was good enough to pour a glass for each of us and equally good enough to disappear afterward cynthia let out a sigh and sat in a highbacked chair across from me and just like that something changed that one small gesture did it it was as though a master carpenter presented two pieces of wood and they fit together with such preordained snugness that they clicked upon joining so it was that cynthia in her goodnatured and indulgent sigh in her uncomplicated slide into a highbacked chair put me at my ease i was not an unwelcome intrusion from her past but something far more pleasing it was wrong of joan to invite you here tonight cynthia said studying her port i think she is mischievous such old friends as we are might be in the same room without mischief it was not what i meant i wish you had not seen mr pearson in one of his moods i understand and yet i have seen it mrs pearson you asked for my help before you asked me to find your husband because you believed yourself and your children in danger i cannot believe you wished me to find him for his own sake you mustnt say that she said we cannot be together if you speak to me so then i wont speak to you so it will be all business i never mind a deception or two if it is to cover ones own tracks but you must own up if discovered did you ask mrs maycott to invite me here and to do it publicly at the party so all could see it was not of your doing she blushed deeply how did you know only a feeling it was a clever maneuver thank you i did learn a thing or two from you during the war i always loved to hear of your tricks and schemes and at last i had a chance to put into place a little scheme of my own to what end i asked i would like to flatter myself that you wished no more than my company but i cannot think it so can you not tell me more of what you know it began some six weeks ago she said mr pearson has never been the most eventempered of men but he grew much more irritable than usual and he began to have around the house a very uncouth sort of man very westernlooking with a scar upon his face i know who he is he works for william duer have you met duer of course several times philadelphia society you know when he worked for hamilton and lived in philadelphia our families came into contact often when did your husband start doing business with duer she shook her head i dont know and the reason you contacted me when mr pearson disappeared last week i hardly thought anything of it that man lavien came around wishing to ask questions hed been around before and mr pearson had refused to speak to him now he wished to know where my husband was and what i knew of his business it was uncomfortable but nothing more then a man calling himself reynoldsa tall bald man with an irish accentcame to see me he said i must tell lavien nothing and if i wished to preserve the safety of my husband my children and myself i would not trouble myself with things that did not concern me the tall irishman yet another man pretending to be reynolds and making himself conspicuously my enemy i had no notion of what it could mean but it made me uneasy and that was when you sought me out i asked she nodded i would hardly have concerned myself about mr pearsons absence it was not his first after all but once the matter involved my children i did not know what to do and yours was the only name i could think of i am sorry to have troubled you with all this you must not say so it is my duty to help you and she said it is good to see you after so many years it was at this point that the door opened and mr pearson entered the room red in the face red in the eyes his vest was unbuttoned and his shirt disheveled and his mouth was twisted into a sneer in one hand he held a silverhandled horsewhip in the other he dragged along a boyperhaps eight or nine years of ageby the collar of a dull cotton sleeping gown the boys hair was mussed from sleep but he was wide awake and terrified the boy looked very much like cynthia with his fair hair and even features and a nose the image of hers he looked like pearson too particularly in the eyes though his were red with fear and confusion not his fathers diabolical mania mrs pearson stood jeremy she said mama he said very softly seeming both tired and terrified i told you to leave pearson hissed at me i rose to my feet slowly careful to observe everything with crisp clarity i saw the whip in pearsons hand i saw the fear in the boys eyes i saw the faded burn mark on the boys wrist and the matching scar on his mothers someone was clearly fond of burning wrists i shall leave the moment i know all is in order here the ordering of my house is not your concern my whore of a wife has bewitched the servants they cannot confront you for all are injured or frightened or unable to be found i have therefore taken the trouble to awaken the boy i shant threaten to hurt you saunders since i hear you are too pathetic to mind a sound beating but the child is another matter if you are not gone from this house in one minute i shall whip the boy bloody he is your son i whispered and so i may do as i like cynthia was pale and trembling and she held out her hands ever so slightly from stiff vertical arms tears fell down her cheek she bit her lip i thought she must be a madwoman by now gone into some lunatic maternal world of fear for her child but she looked at me and when she spoke her voice was steady and strong and rational you must go the last word came out smooth and easy not a command as in telling me i must leave at once but as a qualifier i must leave in this particular instance the future was another matter well i said to pearson dont mutilate your heir on my account ive things to do you know taverns to visit the life of a drunkard traitor very busy see that you do busy yourself with your wasted life said pearson you were far better off vomiting in alleys than troubling yourself in the affairs of gentlemen you are too unrefined to travel in the circles you covet it is interesting you should say that i answered for when i spoke of that very topic to miss emily fiddleri mean the aunt of course not the niece for there is no talking to that one as i need not tell you in any event do you know what your good friend miss fiddler mentioned to me about the refined circles in which you yourself i made it no further for pearson grabbed his sons tousled hair and yanked hard and mercilessly the boy let out a horrible cry of pain and silent tears to match his mothers poured down his face his face then turned dark and angry a juvenile reflection of his fathers but there was more there too a silent resolve to endure his suffering in silence you will leave my house pearson did not cry or shout or bellow he screamed it was the voice of lunacy of a man who has no sense of proportion or propriety and it terrified me for i had no alternative but to abandon these innocents to his insanity then came another voice i am so sorry i did not mean to intrude we all stood suspended in time for a moment as though this mad tableau were something deeply private and personal that had been exposed the voice had come from the doorway but it was no servants voice i turned to look at the figure pretty and perfectly composed her red lips pursed in the most wicked of smiles as though she knew exactly what she saw exactly what she did no argument no violence no reason could have diffused pearsons rage but shame was another matter she understood the power of shame and wielded it like the whip in pearsons hand it was the widow joan maycott i am so sorry to trouble you said mrs maycott now acting as though she had ventured into nothing more troubling than a casual acting out of a scene from a jacobean revenge play i spent rather more time with the cook than i had intended and upon hearing voices i thought i would take my leave once more pearson muttered something that might have been yes yes very good or something to that effect then he let go of his sons hair well then i go captain saunders i have a coach outside if you require transport it is considerably colder than it was earlier i looked over at cynthia who offered me the slightest of nods she knew her husband better than ever i could and i would have to trust her as to whether my absence or presence would offer her greater security for the moment she seemed to believe herself best served by my departure i stepped forward passed pearson and his poor terrified child and stood by mrs maycott then i turned around once more one of these uncooperative servants you mentioned will give me my coat and hat i trust at the door pearson hissed a voice like air escaping a bladder i hardly cared about my coat and hatbut i had turned to take one last measure of mrs pearson her husband was facing me and could not see her face could not see her red lips as she silently mouthed her parting words help me o nce outside i saw that it had indeed grown brutally cold during my time in the pearson house i was used to the cold and it was not such a long walk to my rooms but i could hardly refuse the offer from mrs maycott i thanked her once more and helped her into the coach and we began to ride through the empty night streets populated only by the watch and drunks and whores and mysteriously a man driving a small group of goats possibly not his own i was not entirely certain what to say but mrs maycott saved me from awkwardness i do not envy you she said being caught in the storm of mr pearsons fury i have heard more than once from mrs pearson of his temper but i never before witnessed it nor i i wish i never had for i know not what i can do i have no doubt you will do what you must and what is that you cannot leave that lady and her children at the hands of that beast there is nothing i can do for her i can offer her no refuge and she would not take it were i capable imagine the damage to her reputation no one will care what pearson has done only that his wife has left him to this she said nothing as though i were too foolish to engage seriously i thought it a good idea to raise another subject you mentioned the other night that you know duer do you understand the nature of his business connections to pearson no but i do not know him well it is however possible that it may have something to do with the million bank that is one of duers new ventures and it takes up much of his time at present the million bank do you mean pearson is going to invest in it very likely said mrs maycott so he will take the money he borrowed from the bank of the united states to help launch a rival bank it is possible she said why do you care you said before that you work for hamilton but i know thats not true you were merely attempting to rouse mr pearson and yet i cannot help but wonder if you are a supporter of hamilton and his bank you sound so astonished would it trouble you if i were we live in astonishing times she said and her tone suggested she was not answering my question at all but one she wished i had asked we have witnessed the most remarkable revolution the world has ever known and the establishment of a republican government that has the chance to be the glory of mankind how can i not be troubled by something that threatens to undermine our national good you will forgive me if i suspect your interest runs deeper than mere admiration for the cause of the nation then you are mistaken i care about nothing so deeply as the nation it is for that reason i am suspicious of hamilton who i believe does not love republican government i believe he favors a british system one of monarchy and corruption i have heard such things before and while i do not doubt that hamilton is overly fond of the british system i have seen no evidence that this fondness represents a threat to ours this government was formed as a means of confederating the several states she said but hamilton uses his influence to strengthen the federal seat at every turn states must now bow before their masters in philadelphia here was a much different conversation than that which i would have chosen i could not yet guess what mrs maycott was nor how to measure her interest in these things i believed she knew something but i did not see the value of rehashing the debate from several years past on the validity of the new constitution yes this is the old antifederalist argument and i know well its merits but only time can tell which side is correct and i am disinclined to rail against the federal government until it has tried the experiment the antifederalists like to rage against the danger of centralized power but ive seen no evidence of any harm coming from it what say you then to hamilton s whiskey excise which has unduly oppressed poor farmers forcing them into debt and ruin that he might fund his speculative projects the whiskey excise again i wish you would speak plainly what is this to you i am a patriot that is all you need to know i love my country and i know you do i do not think hamilton does i only ask that you be open to that possibility i though of mr reynolds as she said this and hamilton s secretive dealings with him hamilton was not all he seemed that much was certain but i did not believe him to be the enemy of the nation that the jeffersoniansand apparently mrs maycottpainted him i am open to all possibilities i said at last that is why i trust you oh here we are at your house how convenientparticularly as i had not told her where i lived i opened the door on my side of the coach i thank you for the ride but i must say something i cant guess the nature of your involvement in these matters and i do not expect you to tell me i can only say that if you know anything of import i hope you will let me know she smiled at me the glowing glory of her lips illuminated by the streetlight you must not suspect me of all people captain saunders i believe that as of this moment i am the best friend you have joan maycott spring the following afternoon mr dalton and jericho richmond gathered in the sitting room of mr skyes house our host had prepared a meal of pigeon and dumplings and though i ate but little i took more than my share of whiskey even so i could not feel its effect only a few days before i had been a grieving widow a victim who had lost everything i had since then done so much why could i not achieve things seemingly impossible i had done so already i was tired having had so little sleep and my hand was cramped from writing past the dawn after leaving the main house id gone to find ruth who would never again be called lactilla she at my request gathered together the other slaves with quill and ink and tindalls heavy paper id written out individual false traveling papers identifying them by names and description as free negroes to each id given fifty dollars it was no small portion of the wealth id taken from tindall but i could hardly have sent them off into the world penniless id taken away their master and unwilling to bear the burden of sending them off into a horrifying unknown i had instead taken on the burden of helping to make for each a better life at least a freer one now though i had not slept the previous night i was fully awake with the friends who had helped to shape my life here in the west the three men could talk about but one thing word had spread throughout the settlement probably throughout the four counties that colonel holt tindall had hanged himself no one had yet heard of phineass confession and perhaps no one had troubled themselves to observe the blow upon tindalls skull i believed there would be discoveries yet to come but not yet and i hoped i might use them to advantage its hard to believe skye said that a man like that would suddenly take upon himself a conscience he was bent forward in his chair holding his glass of whiskey between the palms of both hands and he struck me as a man hunkered down upon the fringes of a battlefield great and cataclysmic things were coming and some part of him knew it i dont believe him a man apt to take his own life dalton said there must have been something elsea painful illness perhaps that would kill him in the end this mightve been his way of beating the thing it would be more like the old bastard something will come out said jericho you may depend upon it and now he looked at me hard and cold he knew something or suspected it which i did not like i wished the information to be mine alone to control it was time to speak tindall did not hang himself i said he was executed for what he did to andrew i could not depend upon the law and so i depended upon myself all three men stared at me come now said dalton you dont expect me to believe a woman was capable of forcing tindall to put a noose around his neck let alone hoisting him up over the rafters ill wager you dont know how to tie a noose i did not know how to tie a noose but as for the other i did not know why it was so unthinkable phineas was not so much larger than i and he had done it all if i were a man the question would not have been raised yet i saw no reason to pursue this now there might be much to be gained if i could make them see how others liked to aid me the boy phineas helped me phineas skye said i thought he hated you phineas is confused not yet a man no longer a child hes been through more than anyone should be asked to endure but in the end he knew who his true enemy was why is that asked jericho because you told him you said lets kill tindall and he did it or did you have to cast your witchs spell first dalton began to say something to silence him but jericho held out a hand in defiance and now what we wait for him to be caught so he can link you to the murder and then us perhaps i ought to have hated being so challenged but i did not i liked it all three of them would have their doubts better they should be voiced and better if the questions were asked harshly by jericho so the others would feel inclined to aid me perhaps neither would challenge him dalton might prefer to keep an open mind and skye might not wish to confront jericho directly but it was of no matter they would counter his arguments in their own minds they would silently resist him resent his harshness to a grieving lady and that it seemed to me would make them all the more agreeable phineas has gone off to the wilderness to kill indians i explained but first he left a letter with mr brackenridge confessing to the crime and making himself the sole actor in it he seems enamored of the idea of being an outlaw this is fantastical jericho said i am sorry mrs maycott i know youve suffered but youve also sold my home out from under me and i must speak the truth how do we even know you were there i set forth on the table what remained of the banknotes phineas had given me skye picked them up and looked through them it looks like she was there he said colonel tindall thought he was above the law i said now he is not and what about you jericho asked are you above the law i am in the right which is much the same thing mr richmond you act as though i somehow put you in this situation i am not the one who passed an excise law or enforced it here with blood and murder i have been made a sacrifice to the greed of men back eastmen like alexander hamilton and william duer who have turned their backs on the revolution in order to fill their purses listen to you he said you are putting yourself in the middle of affairs that are not your concern i slapped my hand hard against the table rattling the dishes i believe sir i have been thrust into the middle of these affairs and that makes them my concern did not william duer himself lie to my husband to convince him to trade his war debt for landland he knew to be useless and debt he knew to be valuable and yet he told us just the opposite someone might object that we ought to have known better that we should not have been so easily cozened but he claimed proximity to hamilton himself he claimed to speak nearly on behalf of the government no one doubts his villainy richmond said i would not let him continue we come here to this wasteland and find that duers man tindall rules over us with a tyrannical fist and then hamilton s whiskey tax enforced by tindall drives us all to ruin it is a network of greed and evil and oppressionall we stood against in the war all the evil we have suffered can be set before those three tindall duer and hamilton most of all he is the master whom the others serve it is he who would turn our republic into an oligarchy duer and tindall are but the hands hamilton is the mind and so i hate him above all others its a pretty speech skye said and what you say is nothing but truth but i dont believe you say these things only for truths sake you obviously have something on your mind best you let us hear it now i steeled myself for what i was about to propose was certainly madness yet i believed it could be done mr brackenridge believes he can make a sale within the next month perhaps even sooner but thanks to tindalls generosity we need not wait before deciding what to do we will find somewhere else to set up said mr dalton buy a new still and begin production once more mr skye spooned a portion of the stew into his mouth and then wiped his lips with a napkin i dont see how no matter where we go we will still face the excise even if we flee the four counties for kentucky or virginia we will face the whiskey tax and there will be established distillers to resent our intrusion into their business this money from tindall is to be split among us i cannot tell you what to do with your portion i said i can only tell you that for my part i will use this and what i get for my groundrent lease to right these wrongs you mean revenge dont you revenge against whom asked mr skye do you mean to serve hamilton and duer as you did tindall here was my moment to be careful in how i spokecareful but commanding i would need to convince them to follow me but i would also need to convince them of my boldness to show them i was determined and capable but not mad it is precisely what i mean i spoke with cool determination the end result of careful deliberation it is they who conspired against us and continue to conspire against us what is more they conspire against the nation by trying to unmake the principles of the revolution mr dalton looked upon mr skye with astonishment only jericho richmond acted as though what i proposed was of no moment he set down his bowl poured himself a whiskey and watched his companions closely youve lost your mind lass said mr skye the harshness of the words belied by his gentle tone no one here blames your wanting it mind but you cant take revenge against alexander hamilton how will you do it i know precisely how i said it was the subject of my novel i wrote of how a man sought revenge against speculators and i believe the principles i worked upon in my novel can apply in actuality but it is pointless said mr dalton even if it were possible to hurt these men in any significant way what should we gain by doing it let me explain to you i said listen carefully for you will need to convince at least some of your whiskey boys to sign on and why should they not we are all hurt by this tax if we can take just three or four more men with us we shall be able to avenge ourselves and maybe even preserve the ideals of the revolution we can save our country from its own government mr skye the only one present who was familiar with the machinations of my lost novel slowly nodded his head when you told me of your fictive story i thought it remarkable in how very plausible it was the scheme was audacious yet it might actually have worked but when you speak of saving the country i am far more skeptical if this thing were to be done you might destroy the country in saving it what of it i asked if this is our countryif it has become nothing but a haven for callous rich men and the lapdogs who would enforce their policies of greedwhy should we not risk its destruction because were all of us patriots said richmond does that answer your question what does it mean to be a patriot i asked you love the america in your head and your heart but is that the same america that takes from poor men money they dont have so rich men can have a corrupt bank is that why you fought in the war is that why andrew fought is that why your friends died they died for liberty not so that oppression might spring from nearer tyrants hamilton s bank is not just the newest incarnation of their greed it is a beast that threatens to destroy everything we believe in but would you really wish to see the nation brought to its knees reeling in chaos asked skye we all of us here believe in liberty and freedom and republican government i said but does that mean we must obey any government that claims to uphold those principles while at the same time openly and brazenly pursuing a course of subjugation less than ten years after the revolution and look at what we have wrought greed oligarchy corruption and slavery it is better this nation be crushed better we destroy this false beginning and begin anew in the hopes of doing things properly is that not preferable to permitting something rotten and insidious to dress itself up as glorious and just if we do nothing if we take our little share of wealth and turn our backs now in future generations when rank corruption masquerades as liberty it will be upon our shoulders true patriots will then ask why we who were there to witness our nation at the crossroads did nothing i had not planned to make so impassioned a speech but now that the words had come out i knew they were true and from the looks upon their faces i knew my friends believed them too dalton said nothing for a long time then at last he looked at skye you think it possible we can do this thing she speaks of not that it ought to be done but that it can bethat the four of us and a few more so small a number can do it i do said skye it wont be easy but why can we not do whatever we wish why can we not do whatever our minds conceive of these men had changed the world once before they had fought in the most important revolution in human history and redrawn the boundaries of government power for all time who was to say they could not do as much again jericho richmond set down his glass the two of you are under her spell if this woman tells you to ride your horse off a cliff will you do it mr richmond what have i done that you would speak to me so i demanded i thought we were friends we are he answered but i will not throw myself into the maw of your madness for no better reason than revenge i poured myself a fresh mug of whiskey no i suppose not but will you throw yourself into the maw of my madness if doing so would make you very wealthy i now had his attention perhaps if you convince me your plan might work i began to speak explaining to them the plan i had constructed its dangers and nuances and how it should leave us avenged the country righted and our efforts rewarded with great wealth i spoke at length at first fearing id said too much and not parsed out the information slowly or gently enough but questions soon began to arise from both dalton and skye and then even from jericho i made certain the whiskey continued to pour by the end of the evening my scheme had turned from an idea to a rebellion ethan saunders i was now torn between my two goals for if i was to discover the truth behind these threats against mrs pearson i would have to go to new york and learn more about duers scheme and how the upcoming launch of the million bank related to these threats against hamilton s bank yet how could i leave philadelphia when cynthia was under siege from her own husband it was lavien who helped to resolve this dilemma a few days after the dinner at the pearson house he summoned me a little after noon to clarks inn on chestnut across from the statehouse at the sign of the coach and horses i was pleased with the invitation for i was hungry and clark s is always an inviting place to dine for the entertaining way in which they prepare their meat it turns on a great spit over a hot fire and the turning is done by a pair of yellow dogs who run steadily in a large wheel like overgrown squirrels leonidas and i arrived before lavien for i saw no sign of him but we were in time for the dogs final exertions so soon there was hot beef boiled potatoes and freshly baked rolls to enjoy clark s had no whiskey so i settled for rum and leonidas led us to a table that offered us a good view of the door lavien arrived in a quarter hour accompanied by an aging man perhaps near sixty wearing a oncefine brown suit that was now in places faded and spotted he had a very erect posture and strode in slow deliberate steps affecting i thought a kind of gentility that perhaps did not come naturally leonidas and i were near done with our fine repast well roasted by the labradors and we rose to meet the men ah said lavien im sorry to keep you but im glad you are here i want you to meet this man albert turner may i present captain saunders and his associate leonidas turner bowed very deeply yes very good he said captain saunders yes of course sir your name is well known to me rarely could that be desirable i bowed and we all sat lavien called for drinks i am always pleased to make a new acquaintance i said though it was a wretched lie i could not have desired less to meet this man yet i suspect there is some particular reason i have been summoned something out of the way of ordinary sociability mr turner lived in philadelphia during much of the war said lavien indeed he was not always the greatest friend of the united states for he served the british cause turner smiled sheepishly once more this time opening his mouth and showing me that the better portion of his teeth were but a memory many people did you know and had things gone otherwise wed have been heroes merely the chance of history you cannot blame a man for taking up the cause of his native land all in the past said lavien careful to affect an air of easy civility the war is over and we have no interest in punishing one set of men because their consciences dictated a course of action different from another set exactly so said turner the tankards of beer had now arrived and he drank quickly and deeply as if afraid he might soon be asked to leave and wished to take as much drink as he could first the end result was a rather large spill on his coat which he brushed at with evident embarrassment these questions of loyalty and allegiance during the war are but matters of curiosity now though they were of the greatest import then i believed i now understood what this was about it concerned fleet i stood up i told you lavien that i didnt want you looking into this yes said lavien but i didnt listen i see in you an asset to this government and to hamilton but as long as your name lies in shadow the government cannot make use of you it is my duty to ignore your wishes i would not dignify his flattery with a response come leonidas lavien stood sit down captain saunders you do wish to hear this i did not like to be ordered around but i knew from how he spoke that regret would eat away at me if i did not listen i had no choice really i sat down mr turner said lavien is the british agent to whom you and fleet were alleged to sell messages it was his correspondence that was found in your things he of course fled once he received word that you had been apprehended and only returned to philadelphia after the war i stared at him and then turned to lavien he can say nothing i want to hear you believe that said lavien because you believe he will condemn fleet but it is not the case i felt myself biting the inside of my cheek but i said nothing very right said turner i never had anything to do with you or major fleet yours were the names i was directed to use by my contact i did not know why nor did i care it sounds rather unkind i know but it was war and we did not trouble ourselves with such things you were no better than i i am sure for it is easy to overlook the harm to innocents when you cannot see or know them it was true enough go on i was authorized to buy secrets from various contacts and one of them insisted that i contact him using your names instead of my own it was these letters that mr lavien informs me were found in your things though i cannot say how they made their way there when i heard of your capture i did not think of it for i presumed that my contact was but the middleman though i was surprised to learn that you and major fleet were real men i always presumed they were noms de guerre you are saying that our betrayal was planned i asked for how long did you use these names before we were accused oh six months at least maybe nine then we were betrayed each in our own way lavien leaned forward and then back this was as much enthusiasm as he ever demonstrated for the betrayal to have happened in such a manner it would have had to have been done by your contact who else could have known enough to ruin all involved i did not like it that lavien had proceeded without my permission but i could not deny my excitement this conspiracy had been the great mystery of my life its principal turning point it seemed that now i was to learn the truth behind it and the truth would not condemn fleet did you know his name i asked keeping my voice steady i was not meant to answered turner but i was cleverer than he thought he believed me nothing but a blunderer and i suppose i was but even so i was no fool and he was always too impressed with himself still is i suppose but vicious too i have no doubt he would kill me if he were to see me for though it would be but my word against his and the war is long over he would not like it if i were to tell the world what i know i tried to speak but my breath caught i tried again what is his name i did not need to ask i already knew his name is pearson jacob pearson i was on my feet and halfway out the door when i felt laviens hand around my arm pulling me back to my table he must have weighed a third less than i did yet his strength was great his weight perfectly proportioned i do not know that i could have broken free of his grip wait his voice was quiet but undeniably commanding do not tell me to wait i answered though i had stopped without meaning to you cannot preach caution to me he destroyed my life and now he destroys hers he destroys his own children for the love of god how can you bid me wait you misunderstand me said lavien i do not ask you for restraint do you forget to whom you speak i only ask you to wait for what am i to wait i asked my teeth nearly clenched you are not thinking clearly he said you have allowed your reason to be clouded by rage you do not see what i see and what do you see i demanded he looked over at turner hes not telling us everything i glanced over at the old man nervously twisting a ring around his finger i had not visited any anger upon him no not so much as a single harsh word had i offered him for i heard his original plea and though i could not love a traitor i could not condemn a man who loves his own country even when it is in the wrong i had said as much and he had believed me he had seen it in me and yet he nervously twisted that ring about his finger i looked at him and he looked away i now turned to lavien hes not telling us everything i said i sat down lavien sat down leonidas had never arisen yet he seemed to understand our mood at once theres more he said i nodded to turner i said theres more turner continued to twist his ring his skin turned red i have told you allall you can care about of course there are more secrets i was a spy and it was war but i have nothing else to say that would concern you theres more i said where shall we take him your house lavien i cannot bring violence under the roof where my wife and children live he said i am a different man at home it must be that way i live in a boardinghouse i said we cannot question a man there rent a room here said leonidas it is a loud tavern nothing will be heard clever man i answered one moment said turner whose expression had changed from terror to confusion and back again mr lavien you told me there would be a reward for my information and no consequences so long as i told you the truth i have told you nothing but the truth i told you that you must tell us the entire truth lavien answered captain saunders believes you are lying i believe you are lying leonidas believes you are lying you may tell us everything now or you may tell us everything in private i have nothing more to say answered turner lavien tossed a coin to leonidas be so good as to get us a room as far away as possible from the main room leonidas left to tend to his task turner continued to glance about the room nervously you cannot force me to go against my will i shall simply cry out if you do that i said we shall be forced to tell the crowd that you were a british spy during the war and that you participated in a conspiracy against patriots we would not be able to save you from the mob even if we wanted to if you want to live you will try your luck with us i choose not to he stood but then sat down at once i saw that lavien had placed his sharp knife to turners back at his kidney in a moment leonidas signaled to us that he had secured the room lavien said to turner if you do not come with us quietly and easily you will die do you believe it he nodded good if you come with us if you cooperate you will live it cannot be any simpler the three of us rose and walked toward leonidas me first then turner then lavien we went up a set of stairs and then another and leonidas led us to a room in the back the doors to three of the other five rooms were closed and we could hear the creaking of floors the shuffling of furniture the low moans of passion the rooms here were used by whores which was good customers would be used to the occasional strange noise the room itself was just fifteen feet by ten but it would do once we were inside lavien locked the door i gazed around at a small dirty mattress a pair of chairs a small table for drinks or food lavien pushed turner into one of the chairs he shut the window and the room grew dark i have not known mr lavien long i said to turner but my impression from my limited experience is that you ought to be very afraid if i tell you all said turner you will kill me it is a possibility said lavien but not a certainty it depends of course on what you have to say and how hard you make us work for it but if you dont tell us we will try everything to make you speak and if you still remain quiet we will certainly kill you you have all but admitted that there is more so we have no reason not to pursue it lavien used his knife to cut a strip of cloth from the stained cotton mattress cover well not have the deposit on the room returned said leonidas what are you doing turner asked a little trick i learned in surinam lavien answered you cut off part of a mans own body place it in his mouth and then gag him let him sit with his own bloody flesh in his mouth for a timeit works best in the hot sun but here will doand he usually becomes cooperative the men i learned from loved to use the penis it is symbolic but i find it too devastating a man without a penis will often drift into despair i like to use an ear turner started to rise no you wont sit down lavien cried his voice was so hard so commanding it would have taken a man with a godlike will to resist turner sat down leonidas hold his arms behind his back keep them still i dont want him to move while i do this it was at this point that i began to consider precisely what was happening here if turner had information about events from all those years ago i would need to have it of course i would not walk out of that room without it on the other hand i had seen with my own eyes not only laviens resolve but his ruthlessness the night we met he would have mutilated dorland had i not intervened i could not object now to his frightening turner or even striking him a bit slicing off the mans ear and placing it in his mouth however was of an entirely different order hold leonidas i said i turned to lavien a word no he answered i do this my way it is my past i said and it is my sense of justice am i to spare this man because you do not like what it takes to find the truth yes i said he shook his head leonidas will you help me do not i said leonidas however ignored me he stood behind turner held him tight and drew a thin stream of blood last chance lavien said you are madmen said turner ill tell you dont cut off my ear lavien backed up leonidas keep his arms where they are if i think hes holding back ill ask you to dislocate his shoulders it might require a few attempts said leonidas do your best now mr turner tell us your secret he remained quiet for fifteen seconds thirty lavien shook his head you are wasting my time he stepped forward knife out we killed him turner said were i to imagine such a scene i would have thought turner would shout these words but he spoke them softly as though he added a vaguely relevant bit of information to an ongoing conversation i stared at him he did not make me ask him to elaborate fleet he came back to philadelphia looking for me looking to clear his name he was going to taverns asking questions getting close the particulars dont matter to you i suppose you need only know that pearson knew that fleet was looking for himfor usand he asked me to help he didnt say what for and i dont know that i would have done it had i understood i approached fleet he was in a tavern drunk and angry and i asked him to step outside with me for i knew a man who could answer some of his questions we stepped into the dark and pearson struck him on the back of his head with a hammer then he stabbed him fleet was not killed in a drunken brawl he was murdered by jack pearson ethan saunders later i would be unable to say what i meant to do nor did i know why i was allowed to do it alone i left clark s in a blur of movement and it seemed to me i did not walk but was transported by some unknown magic to fourth and spruce outside pearsons house neither lavien nor leonidas had come with me i never asked either of them but i believe they concluded it was something i needed to confront on my own in my own way without words of caution or prudence later i would chastise myself not because of what happened but because of what might have happened i am no lavien no master of martial prowess but i did not fear pearson perhaps i ought to have he had killed in cold blood i never had i ought to have taken timea day or two perhapsto consider what i wanted and then determine how to accomplish it that would have been the correct approach but i had no patience for it had i taken more time to considereven five minutesi would have reached one single inescapable conclusion i could not allow cynthia to live with him another day no not another hour the time for caution was done as i approached the house looked quiet still it was late afternoontoo early to see lights in the windowsso i do not know what would have given the house a lively look but something seemed to me absent or missing i took an instant to consider came to no conclusion and went forward i did not trouble myself to knock or ring i tried the front door found it open and entered i had made it only five feet into the hallway when i was approached by the surprised footman in my mind i saw myself grabbing him throwing him down striking him but i restrained myself he was called nate i remembered that i also remembered that he like the rest of the servants was loyal to cynthia captain saunders he began but said no more i had not cut him off with words but he saw my face i felt the rage burning on my skin i cannot imagine what i must have looked like where is he i felt as though my teeth bit the words from the air i am sorry he said his voice unsteady that is to say he is abroad if it is mr pearson you mean he is not here at present i am sure if you return some other damn you where is he i took another step forward he took a step back the poor fellow actually cringed he worked for pearson lived with him day after day and yet he cringed before me i did not like it i did not feel powerful or dominating i felt like an avatar of rage something not myself and i did not care i believe i might actually have hurt the poor fellow had things not suddenly changed hes not here ethan it was cynthia who spoke she was at the end of the hall standing in the gloom the space where the darkness of the hallway did not yet meet the light of the parlor were it half an hour later the sconces would be lit but now all was twilight and she was little more than a silhouette partially turned away from me he is gone again i balled my fists and unclenched them and stepped forward but nate stood in my way which i thought courageous under the circumstances on any other day at any other time i would not have wagered an egg for my chances against a strapping footman such as he but not that moment and he knew it he feared me and he stepped in my way please keep your distance sir you are not yourself it was true enough i looked past the tall fellow to cynthia where has he gone i dont know he did not say only that he was going and he did not plan to soon return what has happened ethan i could not answer i knew not how to new york again i did not know it was where he went before i thought to say that was what mrs maycott told me but i thought better of it i must find him i cannot tell you why not yet but i must find him she took a step forward i dont know where hes gone but he seemedhe suggested he would be away again for a length of time he did not expect to be home soon he had his valet pack several suits and he left hours before dawn the new york express coach no doubt i would have to go to new york there could be no more delaying it i would find pearson and thenthen i knew not what kill him it was not my way bring him to trial with what a single british spy as witnessone who had only told us what he had under threat of torture and mutilation cynthia i began i moved toward her but she stepped back no ethan you must stay away can she imagine that would have deterred me did she imagine she sounded as though there were some issue of propriety i did not believe it i pushed past the footman and came to her she retreated but did not run away and so she stepped into the light of the parlor and i saw what she meant to hide she had been holding the left side of her face toward me and only now did i see the right mottled with red and purple and blues he had struck her in the eye her husband had hit her in the eye as though she were a drunk in a tavern i cannot say i was filled with rage anew for i had no more room for anger if anything my fury became purer sharper more easily directed and controlled i would find him and i would stop him i knew not how but i would do it cynthia you must leave him i said my voice calm and quiet and nothing but reason i was mad with rage but i would not let her see it why did he hurt you because he was angry she said he has been angry since the night you dined with us he had good cause to be angry i suppose but then so do i i know i must leave him ethan but how can i he is a devil but you have seen what happens to a woman who lives upon the street without money to her name you have seen what happens to her children is living with one madman not better than subjecting my children to the scorn and abuse of a thousand strangers i stepped closer now the secret of her bruise was exposed and there could be no reason to insist upon my distance i took her hand though i knew and i believe she knew i would attempt no further liberty even so the warmth of her touch astonished me as though i really understood for the first time since seeing her again that she was a living breathing woman not merely an animated memory she was cynthia whose hair i might feel tumble into my hand whose face i might caress whose lips i might kiss not that i believed i would but the sheer physical truth of her staggered me cynthia what would you have me do i cannot leave you be i must do something to protect you and your children tell me and i will do it she turned from me but did not attempt to pull her hand away after a moment she squeezed it tighter there is nothing to be done she said yes there is i said she turned back to me and pulled her hand away no she whispered no ethan i cannot let you speak so i dont know if you mean a duel or something more nefarious but i do not ask it and cannot countenance it i hate him but he is the father of my children and i could not live thinking i had some part in such a thing i took her hand back i do not suggest it but there must be a way to be rid of him without resorting to the unthinkable and i shall find it i shall go to new york and confront him there and i shall resolve this how she asked her voice was quiet restrained she did not believe i could do such a thing and yet there was something akin to hope in her eyes i have no idea i said with a slight smile but i will surely think of something please wait a moment cynthia left the room and came back a moment later with an envelope i hope i do not insult you or take liberties but i know your means are limited you must have some money for your expenses i cannot take it from you i said it is his money oh thats another matter i took the envelope and put it in my coat its not greed you know but the pleasure of using his own money to defeat him s omewhere between the time id taken her hand and she left to bring me the envelope cynthias footman had disappeared giving us such privacy as we would like i cannot report we much exploited it i understood she felt far too vulnerable for me to declare my love and i dont believe she required any such declaration to feel it instead she wished me well and holding both her hands i wished her the same i dared not tell her of her father not now first i would rid her of her husband and then i would tell her i could not endure the thought of her having to live with pearson even to speak to him knowing who he was and what he had done i could not think however how i would rid her of her husband i had spoken the truth to her i was not a murderer and despite what he had done to fleet i could not kill him in cold blood were i to ask him to duel i have no doubt he would reject me even as i had rejected dorland it would be the rare husband who accepted a challenge from his wifes admirer i would go to new york on the express coach leaving in the small hours of the morning i would find out everything i could about pearson what manner of business he was involved in how it connected to duer and how it connected to the plot against the bank of the united states and once i knew everything i would determine how to convince him to trouble his wife no more perhaps it would even be enough to destroy him while still preserving his money for his wife i was walking i knew not where when a thought came to me i considered how much easier it would be simply to duel how i had avoided doing so with dorland and how even dorland who had challenged me seemed disinclined to duel and then at once a question of no small significance occurred to me if he was so disinclined to duel why had dorland challenged me of course there could be a thousand reasons he may have believed his honor demanded it and he may have been convinced i would not accept the challenge but he did not know me very well he only knew that i had served in the war and what man cowardly and so disinclined to duel would risk to challenge a man he knew to be a soldier suspicions gathered in my mind and though i ought to have left him and his poor wife alone i did not hesitate to approach his house and ring the bell when his man answered i said that i must speak to mr dorland and for the sake of decorum i would do so outside his house rather than inside it my intention here was of sparing his wife the discomfort of seeing me particularly in her husbands presence i hardly believed the man would answer my summons but indeed he came to the door and if rather reluctant to step out of it he remained slightly behind his footman who was a good head taller he peered out at me his fleshy face pale what is it saunders why do you trouble me at my own house for gods sake step outside dorland i have no intention of harming you and what i have to say is for your ears alone our business cannot be the business of those belowstairs it is not a trick he asked you have my word as a gentleman you are not a gentleman he said then you have my word as a scoundrel which i know opens up a rather confusing paradox that i have neither the time nor inclination to disentangle now step outside and give me five minutes of your time and ill not trouble you again i believe it was my impatience that carried the day had i been more unctuous and less urgent he might well have been too cautious to leave his lair my unwillingness to use any art must have bespoke my sincerity i would have to recollect that trick for the future i decided he stepped cautiously down his stoop and stood facing me a good three feet away close enough to admit conversation too far for me to make as he supposed any sudden moves he must have confused me with lavien for whom three feet would be as nothing for me it only made conversation more trying dorland why did you challenge me to a duel i demanded how can you ask me that much of the rage he had demonstrated in our previous encounters and which i had mocked was gone now he seemed only saddened i do not ask why you believed you had cause i ask you why you chose to challenge me was it your own notion he swallowed and looked away then back of course who put you up to it i asked my voice gentle who suggested that you challenge me must someone have suggested it he asked but he had with several signs and gestures already answered that question you are wasting my time dorland and trying my patience who suggested it jack pearson he admitted it was he who told me about you and my wife and it was he who told me to challenge you he said you would never accept and then i would be free to take revenge as i saw fit it is strange i ought to have been outraged but id already learned that day that pearson had stolen cynthia and murdered my best friend so this news could offer me no new anger if anything i felt victorious for i had pulled from the fabric of the universe this thread of truth and i had yanked upon it life offers such small triumphs we must rejoice where we can i have only begun to suspect the depth of pearsons villainy in deceiving you dorland he had his own reasons for wishing to be rid of me so he told you horrible falsehoods about your wife to prompt you to attack me only think of it a man willing to ruin anothers domestic happiness in order to commit a vicarious murder dorland now came closer one moment he said do you mean to say that you and my wifei mean thatthat you oh just say it dorland were she and i together no of course not i have addressed her more than once and she is lovely but how could you ever doubt so good a lady as your susan its sarah he said softly his mind elsewhere what do i care about her name i asked you ought to pay more attention to her goodness and less to her preferring to be called one thing or another it is well that dorland was not so good at detecting a lie as i was i saw no reason why i should not offer the lady this small comfort i had made her life uneasy perhaps i could with little effort restore it why did you not say so before he asked me because you annoyed me i told him you threatened violence and then you performed violence i saw no reason to put you at your ease but i was wrong for it harmed your wife and she had done nothing to deserve it i was foolish and for that i am sorry he now stepped even closer and gave me his hand i must thank you he said i wish you had told me sooner but i cannot tell you the joy this news brings me now we shook hands and dorland rushed inside no doubt to see his good lady and apologize in a thousand ways i could only hope the woman was clever enough to hold her tongue and accept i turned to head back to my rooms to prepare to leave the coming morning on the express coach which departed at am i now had a new dilemma to ponder on my voyage even before i had met kyler lavien before i had troubled myself with william duer heard from cynthia or known of a plot brewing against the bank of the united statesbefore all of this pearson had been plotting to kill me it was time to discover why joan maycott summer our little log cabin despite the damage from the fire fetched far more than i would have supposed i was not surprised that skyes property as prim and proper as he made it brought in a fair amount but by far the greatest wealth came from daltons sharenot his buildings which were excellent or his land improvements which were significant but his stills which were in the west close in nature to a mint and for practical purposes a license to manufacture money certainly there were concerns about the new excise tax but no one truly believed that the distant government in philadelphia particularly now that tindall was gone would be effective in collecting it or in otherwise hampering the production of monongahela rye to make certain brackenridge at our behest made it clear that whoever bought dalton s land and stills would also buy his whiskeymaking recipes i will not burden the reader with the details of our return to the east the money we procured from this transaction did not make us rich but it gave us what we would need for the scheme mr dalton spoke to five of his whiskey boys the five he considered most trustworthy and intelligent and given that they now had no means of earning their living they were content to throw in their lot with us particularly when we could offer them both money in hand now and the promise of more to come thus it happened that we relocated to philadelphia in the early summer of renting a small house in the unfashionable but neat elfreths alley it was a narrow thing with no room more than six feet in width and it could have housed perhaps four comfortably but we nine frontier folk made do the men required a bit of abusing if i was to keep things neat we could not have the neighbors gossiping about a woman living alone with eight men so we put it about that mr skye was my brother and no more was said the arrangement did not last long our news in the west had been woefully behind the times but soon after our arrival we were well acquainted with the doings of hamilton s bank which was producing a frenzy upon the streets of philadelphia shares were slated to go on sale on july fourthdid not that alone show the contempt in which these men held american libertyand everywhere men schemed how they might best position themselves to obtain their portion bank stock was expected to soar almost immediately it was a mania a largescale bribe with which hamilton tricked people into funding his schemes making them believe they would be rewarded for doing so these moneyed men thought themselves invincible but i felt certain that destroying their bank would be none too difficult i took some two weeks to study the matter consult my books and take long walks along the river and so reformulated my plan when all was in readiness i presented it to my confederates and though some finer points were unabsorbed particularly by the whiskey boys they agreed one and all in a few weeks time it became necessary to establish a second base of operations in new york and though they were reluctant to leave me on my own i sent dalton and jericho along with two of his whiskey boys isaac and jemmy much that would happen next would depend upon their efforts and i did not think they could possibly succeed for the better part of a year but within a few months my men in new york had laid plans for the banks destruction on july fourth hamilton s bank opened for business at carpenters hall and before noon its allotment of shares had been sold out soon they were trading at and percent above par it was reckoned an enormous success by the treasury department the federalist newspapers crowed with triumph the poor of the city grumbled and observed in the bank the mechanism of british oligarchy but the rich refused to see how they made a darling of their own destruction in new york dalton and his boys had done their part it was now time for me to do mine accordingly i was obliged to spend more of our little stock of money than i should like upon clothing but i needed to look every bit the lady i rented my own rooms in a fashionable house on second street and i began to appear in public i promenaded about high street and struck up conversations with other fashionable women i appeared at concerts and performances sometimes with a handsomely dressed mr skye as my escort i let it be known that i was a widow of means and that was all the recommendation i needed to enter society as my men in new york discovered william duer had more than a few accomplices in philadelphia some of them were known as his agents and the world presumed they acted upon his orders others however were unknown should they be discovered their usefulness would come to an end their primary responsibilities were no more than to set themselves up as speculators in their own right with their own reputations and then when called upon to soften or freeze trade as duer required if a speculator wished to get the better of william duer he need only discover the identities of those hidden agents learn their orders and proceed accordingly given duers prominence given that a sneeze or cough from his lips had the power to send prices soaring or plummeting i was a bit surprised no one had previously attempted our scheme to infiltrate the innermost sanctum of his operation and outwit him yes i suppose it required a singular focus to even think of such a thing and the truth is such an operation would be unlikely to yield significant results duer might be outwitted once and even twice but upon the third occasion he would certainly begin to suspect betrayal it required a unique set of circumstances such as those belonging to our little band of whiskey rebels that a single instance could suffice we waited until late august when the worst of the convulsions from the bank launch had passed on the morning in question i arrived at the city tavern in the company of mr skye whom the general company must have thought to be a trader it was not unknown for speculators to bring a lady to their trading sessions perhaps to impress someone of the delicate sex with the manly pursuit of financial chicanery we took a seat at a table in the main room without attracting overmuch notice we called for tea and once we had been served skye slipped away leaving me alone in this room full of panting sweating gesticulating men too bent upon their own pursuits to notice that a lone lady sat among their number my wish had been to remain unnoticed until i desired notice and then to be noticed indeed accordingly i wore a creamcolored gown with a high neck and long sleeves it was not my best color but i believe its cut showed off my shape to advantage i wished to be pleasing to the man who looked twice not the one who looked once here i was then at the very center of the hamiltonian maelstrom i looked about in disgust at the traders who seemed in their slavering greed more beast than man as though like in a childs story transformed by vile magic i recalled such stories from my own childhood but i would not tell any myself not to my own children that was what this room these men had taken from me fifteen years before in this very city not a quarter of an hours walk from where i now sit men had gathered in the pennsylvania statehouse to ratify the declaration of independence how they had been like gods how they had put aside their petty differences and concerns their alltooreal fears for their own safety and property and lives that they might carve from the raw stone of idea and history an empire of republican value now all was in decline as good as ruined owing to hamilton and his policies of gluttony and oligarchy and corruption men like jefferson and madison might condemn these outrages but their condemnation would do no good if the men and women of the republic did not fight for the principals of the revolution as i looked at these men how i hated hamilton more than duer more even than tindall i hated hamilton for what he had wrought duer who had lured us west tindall who had murdered my husbandthey were but dogs hamilton was the master who had trained them and i would destroy him and his work so help me i would destroy it all and so i readied myself to do so glancing about the room i wondered if any manner of dress or even no dress at all could have distracted these legions of mammon there were some dozen or so tables at which sat between one and six men each had about him saucers of tea dishes of coffee tankards of beer goblets of wine or some jumble of all four papers and documents and books were strewn about and little portable inkstands had been arranged quills dipped and wrote with such fury that they produced a hurricane of ink one man would speak to another and a third would lean forward and say ho whats that selling suchandsuch are you at what price a good price and others would rise and shout and buy or sell and mark it down and all this done with manic gestures to suggest that these were not men of business but men of madness better suited for a house of lunatics than for this tavern where the fortunes of a newly born empire were to be set forth not three tables separated me from mr burlington black whom i knew thanks to the excellent work accomplished in new york by dalton and his boys the plan was simple but no less cunning particularly since duer had executed it many times and remained undetected he wished to purchase bank of north america issues at a discount in philadelphia and then sell them in new york where the price remained untouched by a rumor that lowered the price in philadelphia thus the previous evening he had had it set about that the shares were trading at a deep discount in new york which was untrue this morning mr black acting upon this rumor would sell a fair number of shares well below market price duer did not worry about the loss since he would buy enough to make up the difference in new york profits and experience had taught him that he would be able to buy the shares back himself and at only slightly more than mr black had sold them in the first place in the past duer had attempted operations in which one of his agents sold and a second bought but he had discovered so i learned through daltons communications that this entailed a significant risk namely that the world might remain oblivious of this bit of stagecraft it was far more efficacious to recruit real speculators engaged in real efforts to earn money he knew the inclination of these people to swarm like bees about good news and bad so all he had to do was offer the right sort of pollen to attract their attention in this case mr black would remind the world through word and deed of the rumors duer and his agents had cast about he would support the rumors with a willingness to shed his bank of north america issues at any price and would watch while the other men in the room endeavored to unload their holdings then purchases in hand he or his man would take the next express coach to new york and trade there before word of the selloff in philadelphia reached those markets no one had yet noticed me a quiet lady as i sat alone in that most masculine of taverns but i observed many men as they went about their business i especially observed mr burlington black upon whom so much depended he was a softlooking man of perhaps fifty inclined to be stout but his was a softness like the pliable fat of an infant i had been in place sipping my tea slowly when at last mr burlington black lumbered to his feet to show the world the unusual shortness of his legs he then called to another speculator across the room mr cheever correct me if i am mistaken but did you not wish the week before last to acquire bank of north america issues his voice was far deeper and steadier than i would have supposed he was in appearance quite foolish but in utterance impressive i have some number of shares that i am ready to part with if you are so inclined if not he shrugged his shoulders to signal his indifference the mr cheever to whom he addressed this speech an elderly gentleman who rose to his feet only with the aid of a cane in one hand and a younger supporter lifting his elbow readied himself and returned his address to mr black like duers agent he shouted across the large tavern room but then i had already observed this to be the custom close conversation and whispering being regarded as mean things you were not so ready to part with them two weeks ago when i offered a reasonable price i am merely shifting my holdings as does any man answered mr black i believe you offered me some twentyseven hundred dollars two weeks ago and i stand ready now to accept mr cheever in return barked out a laugh ive done too much business and seen you go about your affairs far too often you know something about the issues dont you some trouble at that bank is it i would not buy for twentythree hundred the other men in the room continued to trade and go about their own business but i could see that each one had one ear or eye upon this transaction for it was also their business to sense when something might change and there were signs of such a thing about to happen here mr burlington black swallowed hard sending a wave of undulation along the wattle of his throat i shall sell you the portfolio discussed for twentyone hundred dollars now indeed trades fell silent and the other speculators turned to watch for what happened next would determine if they would buy more of the banks holdings or sell what they already possessed mr cheever peered at the other man with much skepticism i decline he said with the wave of a withered hand silence befell the room mr black to his credit reddened considerably and appeared extremely agitated i know not if his response was from anxiety about the burden placed upon him or mere theatrical skill but in either case he created the impression of a man most distressed nineteen hundred he said his voice tremulous and you know you have a significant bargain a serving boy came in to collect some of the dirty saucers and one of the speculators shushed him as he dared to clink dish upon dish mr cheever evidently scented trouble i dont like your urgency and i shall decline now a gasp arose from the room in but a few minutes the value of these holdings had fallen by a third and the speculators were for a moment frozen as they attempted to form their strategies those who owned issues from the bank of north america plotted how best to relieve themselves of the unwanted things those who did not scrambled to determine how they might profit from this sudden shift it was at this moment when all was in flux and no one knew yet what he would do in the seconds before someone would decide to buy and send the main room of the city tavern into a bacchanal of buying and selling that mr duer always made his move i knew this from the dispatches sent by mr dalton he would rise and announce that he had faith in one of this countrys great banks and he would be glad to accept mr blacks offer he would then gather to himself similar offerings reduced by a third and when he turned around and sold them in new york he would be praised as a sagacious businessman who scented the wind far better than his brothers of that trade i rose from my chair i shall buy for nineteen hundred i called in a clear voice it is difficult to say if my willingness to purchase or my being a woman produced more surprise but there was a momentary outburst as all shouted at once and an expression of terror and confusion washed over mr blacks face by the accepted rules of the city tavern mr black could not pick and choose to whom he would sell and his offer to mr cheever once rejected by that gentleman might be fairly taken by any other i had done what any man might do and my actions might be condemned as improper because i was a woman but they could not be rejected mr black however must have weighed his options and determined that he could not sell to me at such a price he turned a near purple color as he struggled to find some escape and at last he shook his head sending his cheeks to shuddering i must decline to sell i do not trade with ladies then he decided he would make himself into a scoundrel if he must in order to save his trade and added or with women for that matter once more the floor erupted men called no and custom and the rules one man shouted you must sell and received general approbation encouraged he added if you do not you are no longer welcome here we cannot have a man who will not observe our customs this comment received general assent and at last knowing that he had been backed into a corner mr black nodded indeed he looked somewhat relieved i supposed he had told himself he had done all he could and duer could not reproach him i strode over to him and mr black offered me a bow i am unused to trading with ladies and my passions overcame me i beg your forgiveness i smiled and curtsied and shook his hand to signal completion of the trade it was done and he could not now rescind without ruining his reputation it is no matter sir you have not harmed me indeed you have served me well for i know that these issues retain their full value if i can find no one to buy them here i doubt not i can sell them in new york where my agents tell me they will sell quite readily i had not said this in anything above a conversational voice but i knew i would be heard and the surety with which i spoke would destroy duers ability to perpetuate his scheme it was not that my opinion carried any weight for the traders did not know me and i was only a woman after all yet the certainty with which i spoke would break the spell cast by duers agents efforts and no one would be anxious either to buy or to sell until more could be learned my business being concluded i went back to my table and collected my things making a show of preparing to leave i hoped i would be stopped i hoped my sagacity would after this one trade be enough to attract interest but i could not be certain if not i would have to risk more trades though there would be diminishing returns for each new success would be regarded less with admiration and wonder and more with suspicion i need not have worried for i felt a hand fall upon my elbow and when i turned my smile quite prepared i met the eye of none other than mr william duer himself i had not known he was present and had not seen him arrive i had hoped he would be on the scene to watch his little deception and here he was witness to my own he stood before me the principal villain of my lifes woe the man who had through his conniving and greed destroyed everything i loved this man had murdered my child and my andrew and he now smiled at me madam william duer of new york at your service he bowed to me though i observe from a thousand little things that you are new to the business of trading you have impressed me with your knowledge and your coolness i wonder if you would honor me by joining me for a dish of chocolate upstairs where the rooms are far quieter i met the monsters gaze directly mr duer i should be foolish indeed to neglect the attentions of a man so well regarded as yourself and thus it was that we went upstairs together ethan saunders i have never enjoyed traveling long distances by road the movement of the coach prevents any reading or other amusement and there is little to do that passes the time other than conversation with strangers yet the quality of strangers in a coach is never high instead one must endure perpetual jostling an ongoing merciless rump paddling combined with rough swaying and shoving in winter when the windows must be closed against the cold the stench is of stewing bodies of breath and garlic and onion and unclean breeches above that is the smell too of old damp wood wet wool and leather and inevitable flatulence it is an unkind experience the roads at least were clear it had not snowed hard in several days and the precipitation on the kings highway had been well tramped down by previous expresses our coach was typical of the sort a long enclosed cart capable of holding nine people divided into four benches with leather curtains that could be drawn for the slender pretense of privacy it lacked storage for our bags so we were forced to set our allotted fourteen pounds worth before us the four horses that pulled us made good time but even so there was little to do but watch the scenery pass having leonidas by my side did make matters pass more agreeably for it provided me with someone to whom to whisper disparaging comments about our fellow travelers and soon enough i discovered that i might gain at least something from the journey for it turned out that typical of this run between new york and philadelphia nearly every man aboard was a speculator traveling upon business one of our companions a tall man with narrow diabolical eyes that rested under bushy brows asked me my business i thought it a good idea to hold out bait and said i went to new york in order to put a lately deceased cousins estate in order i received some questions regarding how much money id been left and if i had any interest in investing in this fund or that project but otherwise i did not excite much interest among my fellow travelers soon these speculators forgot that we were even present and they began to speak freely among themselves their talk centered largely around the price of six percent government issues they were in agreement that duer banked upon the decline of government securities and that his agents were shorting them significantly in philadelphia beyond this much of what they had to say regarded how cheaply loans were to be got both from the bank of the united states and the bank of new york this made investment in the funds logical but one of the principal problems in doing so seemed to be that duer was so active in shorting the funds that only a fool would buy when he might sell to ensure that this line of credit would continue should there be a curtailing on the part of the two major banks duer had involved himself in a scheme to found a new bank in new york to be called the million bank leonidas and i barely risked exchanging glances i showed no particular interest but merely asked how long this plan had been in the works the wartnosed speculator turned to me if you have some interest in investing in the new banks you may call upon me in new york i can broker any investment you choose i would need to know more before i could invest any money you need only know that if you hesitate someone else will take your placeand willingly too interest in the banks has risen so high that investors are calling it a bancomania i promise you that you will find my commissions to be very reasonable but the million bank launches this coming wednesday so if you wish to benefit from this opportunity you will need to act quickly he handed me his card and i pretended to look at it with interest one of the other speculators turned to me you may be sure he speaks the truth if you do not act quickly you may lose the opportunity however that may not be a good enough reason to invest why not i asked the bank of the united states was born under the guidance of the treasury secretary who is a capable man and the bank of new york and the bank of north america have stood the test of time but these new banks are only ventures designed to make money for the first investors there is no thought of the banks future prospects which because neglected must be poor take my advice and act with caution the wartnosed man turned to his colleague i say that was rather unkind of you frightening off a customer tis rather rude to do that to a man who is sharing your coach is he not also sharing my coach the other asked the wartnosed man pondered this question for a moment perhaps so but i stood to make money by enticing him you stood to make none by dissuading him that sort of thingwell tis hardly better than vandalism some would call it integrity i suggested whoever would say that never worked upon commission in his life he answered w e made excellent time and arrived that afternoon very late at the new jersey side of the hudson where we concluded our journey by ferry arriving in full dark we were greeted at once by the bustle of new york i had abided in that city for some years after the war and always liked it without wishing to call it my home it was full of frenetic people who could be little troubled to speak to a stranger though once you started conversing with a new yorker he could no more stop himself from speaking than a river can stop flowing i have ever felt fondness for philadelphia and it is in many ways a far more gracious city in which to live but i could not help but feel regret that the capital was no longer in new york which i had ever thought with its sharpish tone the very place for a national seat of all the cities in america it has the most european flavor with its international fashions its excellent eateries its diversions and its variety the streets are peopled with speakers of a hundred languages and the harbor is ever full even in winter with ships stretching out into a forest of masts tired and in need of refreshment we took ourselves at once to fraunces tavern and proceeded to secure our room after washing i went down to the taproom a spacious and welllit affair where i called for a plate of boiled ham and bread and two bottles of their most agreeable wine once we had completed our meal i told leonidas that we might do well to begin our work well go see duer i said he has ever been at the center of all of this perhaps he can tell us where to find pearson what makes you think he will tell you anything i shrugged i will ask politely we then hired a coach and traveled to a more northern location on the island of manhattan a village called greenwich where duers palatial home stood with all the regal bearing of an oldworld manor house i understood that our trip might be for naught for a man of mr duers prominence could well be abroad attending to business or social concerns but we were fortunate and he was at home the servant appeared reluctant to admit us but i used the name of hamilton which proved a shibboleth not to be denied particularly when duers own wife was cousin to hamilton s lady with leonidas taken to the kitchens to learn what he could i was shown to a commodious room identified as a study and offered refreshment at last the door opened and i recognized the prim and slender form of mr duer from our brief encounters at philadelphia there was no sign of the mysterious mr reynolds but now he was accompanied by a very tall creature a man with large eyes of a sunken appearance a hooked nose and thin lips seemingly devoid of blood his hair the color of dirt thinned considerably in the front but hung loose and stringy in the back he was as i say tall though of a narrow and stooping frame with hunched and rounded shoulders and he appeared for all the world to be panting ah captain saunders duer said i am so sorry i could not keep our appointment in philadelphia but it is good of you to call upon me here though its rather an extravagant gesture a letter would do perhaps my particular interests favor a visit i kept my voice agreeable but i met his eye with a determined stare yes yes but where are my manners he shouted to the universe wherever are they i must present to you my associate he said gesturing to the man i found increasingly trolllike lurking still near the door mr isaac whippo whippo is something of a factotum in my service i have found him to be indispensable in my work i expected the factotum to bow or acknowledge the kindness of his master instead he picked at a piece of lint on his notoverclean sleeve as though i were not worth his interest duer gestured for me to sit and i did so though whippo remained standing at first lurking near the door and then standing near the window gazing out into the darkness like a pampered pet who wishes the freedom to relieve himself duer steepled his fingers and gazed at me through the window of digits yes well it is all a bit redundant i suppose i must answer questions but i dont see that i must do it twice twice yes that little jewish man lavien has already been here today now must i speak to you as well lavien how did he get here before i did i took the first express after i last saw him he rode said duer upon horseback i believe much faster than the express and did you have a pleasant conversation with mr lavien no i did not i dont like the fellow then you may have a pleasant conversation with me unlike mr lavien i do not work for the government or for hamilton i am here upon my own business lavien i presume was anxious to learn about information surrounding the bank i had intended to refer to the bank of the united states but duer misunderstood me yes i told him i have no connection to any new banks i would not invest in the million bank and i pity anyone who does it is doomed to fail i have heard that you are intimately involved in the million bank i said its a damnable lie he said someone makes free with my name it happens frequently i am sad to say it is an unfortunate consequence of reputation that when my name is attached to a project it is often viewed as a sign of inevitable success thus there are men who will cast it about that i have smiled upon their undertaking to generate interest among the general populace i fear it may be so in this case anyone who invests in the million bank is certain to lose his money and what of the bank of the united states did mr lavien ask you about that what is there to ask he continued to peer at me through his fingers which made it difficult to measure his face as i would like some sort of danger to the bank perhaps dont be absurd the bank is already a monolith nothing can harm it not even the million bank it would be like a mouse assaulting a lion i decided i would set out my concerns directly and see what happened next am i to presume from what you say that you have no designs yourself against the national bank no effort in seeing it stumble or even fail what an absurd notion why should i wish to see it fail the bank could not be more dear to me dear to you precisely how i asked the bank and government securities are quite closely bound together and i have discovered your agents are selling government securities short you are gambling upon the price of the stock going down are you not your situation as i understand it would suffer considerably if the price should go up it sounds to me that what is dear to you is the depression of our economy at last he moved his hands that he might flick his fingers dismissively you have many excellent talents i dont doubt but you do not know a great deal about finance whippo does captain saunders strike you as a financial man whippo slowly rotated his cadaverous head toward me tis not how he strikes me truly you must not think of this as a play sir with a hero and a villain an agent in my employ may or may not sell short for he is my agent not my servant he may engage in any number of transactions separate from or even contrary to my own wishes that he does so does not mean he acts according to my orders i am an important man and very influential i would not have you saying in public that i sell securities short nevertheless i said on the express from philadelphia i heard a group of speculators saying just that duer snickered and turned to whippo he heard a group of speculators quotha then to me you cannot be serious that you come to me in order to relate idle gossip heard on a coach that is not your business is it to my surprise the speculator had taken control of the conversation with the tenacity of a terrier and did not mean to let go now as to the reality of the matter duer continued i do not say what my agents buy or sell when they are about their own affairs it is not for me to know as for what i do i prefer to keep that to myself and i ask that you keep your suppositions to yourself as well any rumors you might spread could be very detrimental to my finances and by extension to america itself you have been attempting to drive down prices i said how can you say you do so for the good of america i am afraid this confusion originates from your own poor understanding of the markets let us say i do gamble upon the value of securities declining does that make me an enemy of the government i think not prices are in endless shift and if i am to wager they shall be down this moment it does not mean i wish them to be down or expect them to remain down forever it is but the natural ebb and flow of the market and it is no more than what hamilton expectsindeed what hamilton desires why else has his bank made credit so cheap but that we might buy and sell and attempt to guess the end result to say i abuse the markets by attempting to predict them is like saying a ship abuses the ocean by riding upon it i honestly did not know where his bluster and fabrication ended and where the truth began this was not war where secrets relate to tangible things like troop movements army composition and battle plans this was the world of finance in which even the nature of truth can twist upon the slightest wind i did not pursue the matter further because i did not believe i could learn more from listening to duer spin his tales what then i said as though it were the natural consequence of what had come before can you tell me of pearson duer allowed himself the indulgence of a brief frown just a flicking downturn of the mouth jack pearson what of him i would like it if you could tell me about your animosity toward him he had now returned to smiling animosity you say i know nothing of it it has been said that you are his enemy that the financial difficulties he is currently experiencing are of your engineering that you and pearson are locked in some sort of duel to the death and that he has already emerged as the clear loser duer stood up a slow deliberate motion his face was now set like a man enduring pain whippo observed this with some alarm as though i were using invisible witchcraft to harm his master he took a step toward me who told you that duer demanded it is something i heard i said casually i finished my wine have you more of this claret it is really quite good mr duer asked you a question whippo said his voice was deep and resonant but had the vague quality of the perpetually bored oh i heard him but i also asked a question regarding the wine i handed whippo the glass a bit more if you please fellow duer nodded at whippo and though the large mans face was set in a mask of smoldering resentmentnarrow eyes flat lips flaring nostrilshe went to the sideboard and tipped the bottle filling the glass almost to the brim once the wine was in hand i smiled like a contented pasha so much better now do sit mr duer it is bad enough that pantagruel there menaces me but i cannot speak to you gentleman to gentleman while you tower above me duer perhaps wishing to regain the illusion of composure returned to his seat i sipped my wine now i said what was your question damn you you drunk fool where did you hear i was against pearson who told you ah yes pearson lest my reader believe that i was actually inebriated i should point out that much of this behavior was in the order of a ruse it served my purpose to have them believe me far more drunk than i was i emptied my glass to the point where i could hold it comfortably without spilling while i did so i considered what lie would best suit my purposes it was clear that duer and his factotum both believed it a terrible thing that rumors of this sort should be spread i could not tell them i had intercepted coded messages between parties i did not know at the same time i did not want to tell them i had heard rumors cast about in a tavern or on the express since doing so would alarm them and while causing an alarm was an arrow i might later want to pull from my quiver i was not yet ready to do so for the nonce i wished to calm them the gentlemans wife i said at last when i saw mrs pearson at the bingham house she expressed some concern about the nature of her husbands business with you duer let out a breath whippo unclenched his fists wives are apt to speak of what they do not understand said duer they believe they know better than their husbands and consider all new ventures to be ruinous ones what then is the nature of your business with pearson i cannot tell you that said duer what business i did with pearson is all in the past i told you as much i have no knowledge of his current troubles other than what i hear the same as any man and where is pearson now i have no idea said duer i believed him in philadelphia but if you have come looking for him i presume it must not be the case and where did he go when he disappeared previously i have no knowledge of that either do you have any immediate plans to do new business with pearson you need not tell me the nature of the business only the day duer smiled it would be foolish to do business with a ruined man i rose then i shall waste no more of your time i said leonidas met me at the coach and together we made our dark uneven way back to new york it was a closed coach but it contained a small window by which we could observe the coachman and i noticed that he looked back at us more than once since beginning our journey leonidas and i had spoken only of trivial matters but it seemed to me that the coachman hung upon every word what did you learn leonidas asked at last clearly impatient with my silence i cast a quick nod toward the coachman and then said oh nothing of import he was tightlipped but it hardly mattered i always know when a man is concealing something and he was not and you did you hear anything from the servants i suspected he had something he wished to tell me but i shook my head ever so slightly he understood my meaning and said that he had learned nothing when our coach arrived at fraunces tavern we climbed down but then i turned to the coachman what were you offered sir by duers man he offered you money to report upon anything we said how much he shrugged caught but unwilling to deny it he offered me a dollar i handed him some coins from the fund mrs pearson had given me heres two dollars report back that i said nothing only made you stop the coach so i could vomit at the roadside he nodded thank you sir leonidas and i went and warmed ourselves by the fire did you learn anything of moment leonidas asked me what are his plans is the scheme the shortselling of stock i dont think so i said duer is playing at something he thinks very clever but i dont think its selling bank stock short how can you know that because whenever he spoke of it his discourse became theoretical saying a man may do this or my agent might do that he defended what he neither admits nor denies doing he spoke about it in the most obviously evasive manner and so could not have been more obviously hoping i would believe the shorting of issues was his goal he was trying to lead me down a path to one thing and by inference away from another from what i shook my head i cant be sure did you learn anything in the kitchens possibly he said some major event is afoot with the servants things are to be made ready for early wednesday morning the coaches are to be prepared and food ready for an early meal there will be a large and early breakfast at the house it has all been discussed and planned with the greatest urgency yet no one knows the occasion i slapped my hand upon the table oh poor mr lavien he shall be behind us now for we know what duer intends and when he intends it we do do you not remember what the men in the express told us the million bank launches on wednesday duer plans to have his agents come to the house for one last strategy meeting and then descend upon the launch he considers it vital that the world have no faith in the million bank because if i am correct he means to take control of the bank on its first day we have until wednesday then to learn why we have to find out if this is just another financial maneuver or if it is connected to dark schemes in philadelphia leonidas looked significantly brighter it must be very satisfactory he said to know you have so well retained the old skills oh well you know i said modestly but it pleased me more than i could say that he should notice but was that a clever move paying the coachman such as you did he might just as well report your bribery to duer if he tells duer what he overheard duer will think i know nothing and will never learn anything he will cease to regard me seriously and if he tells duer that you paid him to lie then i said we will have stirred up the hornets nest and we shall be able to watch the results always better to be involved in chaos of your own making leonidas we know almost nothing and are set against powerful forces but as long as they are reacting to what we do the advantage is ours joan maycott autumn within a few months of our arrival in philadelphia even jericho richmond the most cynical of our band began to think success was likely if not precisely assured william duer may have been intrigued initially by the mere novelty of a female speculator but soon enough he came to regard me as a sage advisor as well i should like to have been able to offer him advice on how to invest and have that advice bear fruit but i am no more prescient than any other mortal and i had no abilities beyond those provided by keen observation and common sense accordingly i did the next best thing already having one of dalton s whiskey boys close to duer i could receive word on the speculators plans and then advise him to do what i knew he intended if i could not predict the market i could at least predict the investor and he hearing his own ideas parroted back believed me brilliant for i reflected back to him his belief in his own sagacity it was important that i also know the history of the investor when i met with duer i questioned him as closely as i dared my interest would always have to be that of an adoring woman not a countinghouse clerk and yet it was the details of the ledger book i craved indeed duer dropped a few hints of some past exploits i thought could be useful and accordingly i visited the library company that marvelous institution founded by benjamin franklin and conducted some researches into old papers in reviewing the accounts of the old board of treasury which functioned between the end of the war and the establishment of the constitution i learned that when william duer had run the board he lent himself some and only a careful review of the records one conducted with knowledge of the cheat made clear that the money had never been returned duer had stolen from his country and apparently no one knew it i had found what i most sought a key to duers ruin it was a primed pistol ready for me to discharge when the time was right d uer was as near as i could tell quite dedicated to his wife lady kitty the daughter of william alexander the famous lord stirling hero of the revolution yet after our first meeting he asked me to meet him again the next day at the city tavern where we might discuss further my insights into speculation i cared little for his reputation or the feelings of lady kitty so i agreed immediately as we were stepping out onto the street however we were joined again by reynolds who continued to eye me with suspicion im certain i know you from somewheres he said to me mind how you speak to a lady reynolds said duer im not looking to be impertinent he said but i am to look after you and im telling you i know her i had to make a decision for if i denied knowing them my falsehood might later expose me thus i smiled at duer you sold my husband a ground lease in the west some years ago reynolds colored by god thats it youre maynard or mayweather or something of that sort this is mrs maycott said duer now if youre done thats her the one what tindall said killed her own husband reynolds shouted an expression of understanding crossed duers face i dont know how much he had heard of the incident but if he dealt with tindall he would have had some notion of his perfidy he looked at me with a very contrite face i never did hear the full story but my understanding was that tindall treated your family unkindly and then attempted to lay the blame upon you i bristled at his use of so limpid a euphemism for murder but this was not the time to resolve such things instead i said i suppose none of us could be surprised that tindall dealt with himself so harshly given the crimes upon his conscience as it happened accusations of murder had never surfaced in the tindall affair perhaps phineas ultimately lacked the resolve to deliver his confession and the sheriff decided that a wound to the back of the head was consistent with a hanging after brackenridge had humiliated tindall before the sheriff a man who did not scruple to talk about his supposedly private conversations it was widely rumored that tindall had murdered both andrew and his own man and after attempting and failing to blame me had taken his own life rather than face the humiliation of a trial i met his gaze those events are in the past duer took my hand and held it softly for my own part in that wretched affair i shook my head i did not want to hear a meaningless apology from him you did no more than sell us a lease you cannot be responsible for how tindall behaved of course not he said and yet some small part of the affair must be set before me no i said it is noble that you say so but it is not true wait one moment said reynolds he stepped close to me crowding me with his massive form i believed i could actually feel the heat emanating from him and his smell like that of a bull filled my nostrils i dont like this at all duer pushed him back mind yourself reynolds i think id rather mind you and her she always was a cagey one this lady you forget i rode out to pittsburgh with her shes one of those women who must always have her own way is there another kind haha youll forgive me madam i smiled in deference you dont think it a bit odd reynolds said her appearing here making nice with you after what you done that will be enough reynolds duer barked silence yourselfnow reynolds took a step back as if struck though his face showed no expression of pain just puzzlement he wished to know what i did with duer and i could see he did not believe for a moment that our meeting was by chance or that i was so quick to forget the injury the speculator had done me even then i could see behind his dark eyes so obvious in their brooding that he searched not for a way to protect duer but to turn my unlikely presence to his own advantage i began to meet with mr duer at the city tavern whenever he did business in philadelphia which amounted to at least one protracted visit every two weeks though men wondered at the nature of our friendship no one wondered aloud in our presence as i repeated to duer his own ideas handily reported to me by my man in his service the speculator began to grow increasingly sanguine about my opinions thus after meeting with him for the better part of two months i decided it was time to begin pushing him in the direction i so desired duer made it a point to introduce me to a number of his associatesperhaps he wished them to believe our relationship was of a more intimate nature than it was or perhaps he wished to impress them with his marvelous pet the thinking womanand so i came to know a number of men in duers circle the circle itself was a curious thing his most important project that autumn was a loose confederation of traders he called the six percent club its principal object as all its members knew was to establish control over those government issues yielding six percent interest there was value in monopoly for its own sake of course but duers scheme was more farreaching when the bank of the united states launched investors could only buy scrip the ownership of which allowed them to make the four subsequent payments necessary to own actual bank shares not until those four payments were complete would the scrip holder actually be a shareholder two of those payments were to be made in specie but two were to be made in six percent issues hamilton s intention in doing this was actually quite clever create a demand for government securities in order to increase the trade and consequently the value duers plan was equally clever but far more diabolical control the flow of the six percents make them impossible to obtain and the original bank investors cannot hope to turn their scrip into actual shares their scrip becomes worthless and they must sell itto members of the six percent club it was his intention that by the end of the next year his cartel would control both bank scrip and the six percent issues required to redeem it there was one added dimension however the six percent club consisted of both agents whom duer publicly acknowledged and those he did not there were men who bought and sold with duers money and those who bought and sold with their own not all in the latter category but certainly many of them were nothing more than stooges men duer sacrificed to manipulate the market if he wanted prices to go down he would send the unwitting agents out to sell if he wanted prices to go up he would send them out to buy that their investments would ruin them mattered nothing to him he did not see himself as directing a skirmish but rather the final battle of a long war when it was done he might have ruined the markets but he would own them he might have ruined his reputation but by then it would not matter much of this i learned from our man in duers employ in new york and much i learned from my own observation duer liked to keep me on hand as a kind of sign of his power a charming woman with a considerable knowledge of finance never not once did he suggest he wished for a greater familiarity with me though at times he might touch my arm when he spoke or place a hand upon my back it was intimacy of a sort certainly and it took all my will not to recoil but it was far less than i had feared he might demand too he discovered that my presence disarmed potential victims i was a refined lady and who would attempt chicanery in front of me only once did he ask me to participate in one of his ruses late in a man began to appear regularly at the city tavern a local landowner of some significance named jacob pearson pearson would sit quietly during trading and then strike up conversations with other traders explaining loudly that they had made terrible mistakes he said he had observed the markets since their inception in this country and knew an error when he saw oneand a good trade as well yet he himself refrained from trading why do you think he behaves thus duer asked me because he in fact knows nothing of the difference between a good trade and a bad one he wishes to benefit from the markets but is too proud to admit knowing nothing precisely duer said he is quite perfect for our purposes duer sent the man a note saying he wished to meet but that the meeting must be private lest the world know of their business thus it was we arranged to meet in the back room of another tavern where we could discuss these matters in private will he not be confused by my presence i asked duer that can only work to our advantage he said from a distance id found mr pearson to be an unlikable person loud and vain and pleased with himself to an unreasonable degree in close conversation i found him even more unpleasant but because of not despite a kind of native charm a man of a certain fading beauty he displayed with duer a selfconfident expansiveness but with me he used a predatory charm it was the alluring gaze of a predator i felt at once that pearson was a dangerous creaturenot to us perhaps but to those in his power for myself i did not fear him but i did immediately despise him to this man duer explained that he needed someone to help him alter the market someone who must buy and sell with his own money when he profited he would keep what he earned minus a small commission when he lost he would be reimbursed some men duer had explained to me reacted quite harshly to this suggestion not liking the idea of behaving dishonorably to other traders but that was what made pearson so perfect he was a stranger to the trading community and had no concerns about betraying his brothers more to the point he wished to learn the secrets of trade yet he had nothing but contempt for those who had learned the secrets through the usual slow and persistent means duer offered him an opportunity to demonstrate his inherent superiority wrapped in the protective cloak so he would believe of the undisputed master it began slowly duer had pearson make a few trades he knew would prove sound and these enticed pearsons appetite while he profited duer also directed pearson to lose a few thousand dollars on a single trade and duer did not hesitate to return the funds with all speed and cheer demonstrating that he was as good as his word and pearson had nothing to fear from his losses within six weeks pearson was making a name for himself on the philadelphia floor as a canny investor no one knew he was duers puppet and no one knew he was doomed p art of the difficulty of attempting to corner a market is that it does not take long for buyers to recognize that someone even if they dont know who it is consistently snaps up an issue when it comes to market thus the prices of six percent securities began to rise which made them more expensive and harder to obtain men who already held them understood an attempt at a corner was under way and so were understandably reluctant to sell the best way to bring more issues to market was to convince holders that they did not know all and that someone else knew more thus it was that duer and pearson executed a simple but effective deception at the city tavern duer arrived and announced he wished to sell six percents and buy four percents rated less valuable for the simple reason that they yielded less interest yet the price of six percents was high and the other speculators drew the obvious conclusion that duer anticipated that six percents had peaked and that four percents were undervalued and poised for a sudden increase pearson per prior arrangement accepted duers offer to sell it was a perfect deal since pearson would simply return the six percents back to duer later in the day pearson who had begun to attract some notice then announced that he would buy four percents from anyone who would sell them and that he no longer wished to purchase six percents within a few days the price of four percents soared while six percents declined duers other agents those acting with his money snapped up the six percent issues now on the market pearson continued to buy four percents at a newly inflated rate a rate they would likely never see again but this rate kept the four percents high and the six percents low it was for this reason and no other that duer continued to drive pearson and anyone who would follow him to keep buying when it was all done pearson had committed himself to more than sixty thousand dollars of four percents issues whose value was wildly overinflated and would crash without warning i doubt the whole lot is worth more than forty thousand duer said to me and that is under the most optimistic of circumstances if pearson tries to sell them in anything but the smallest increments he shall drive the price even lower of course much of this will depend on how the other buyer chooses to act what other buyer i inquired i havent been able to determine his identity but there is another trader attempting to obtain four percents it hardly matters though if the price goes down a little or a lotor even stays highit is nothing to me but what of pearson have you not ruined him for more purchases i asked not at all he is like the drunkard who must have more wine he has a taste of victory and he will not let a little loss affect him indeed he does not even know yet that he has lost i believe i can extract another fifty or sixty thousand dollars of losses from him before he begins to grow suspicious and by then it will be too late while duer delighted in his deception i plotted mine duer now trusted me entirely and soon it would be time for me to lead him to his own destruction after the phenomenal success of the initial opening of the bank of the united states and the wild trade in scrip a number of other banks began to make preparations to launch and though they had no real means of sustaining themselves they hoped that public enthusiasm for new banks would prop up what would be otherwise empty ventures and sustain operations until the banks could become selfsufficient the most unlikely of these ventures was something called the million bank as much a political as an economic scheme launched by hamilton s old political enemy melancton smith with the aid of new york governor george clinton a fellow hamiltonhater i would never find a bank launched for worse reasons by more inept men anyone involved would be likely to incur hamilton s anger and i knew at once it was just the thing i required i saw pearson as the perfect vehicle to lead duer to the million bank but i was not entirely certain how to convince him of my idea without incurring his suspicion or perhaps his scorn i therefore decided i would need to be more intimate with his family and arranged on several occasions to be introduced to mrs pearson i had anticipated a dour creature someone cold either from a cruelty compatible with her husbands or a weakness that made her subject to it but it turned out that mrs pearson was a pretty woman with fair hair and blue eyes lively and full of wit and good humor yes there was an unmistakable sense of sadness in her given the nature of her husband i could hardly be surprised mrs pearson soon became my particular friend and i enjoyed the times i spent with her it had been a long time indeed since id had a close friendship with another woman and cynthia was for me the perfect companion warm and intelligent but streaked with a melancholy and cynicism that left her with no patience for the empty platitudes that pass for conversation in polite society she had never known the hardship of the west but she had known her own sort of hardship and seemed like a sister to me yet i lamented the connection for while we grew ever more attached i was searching for an opportunity to destroy her husbandan action that must also destroy her one afternoon while we drank tea in her parlor i observed that mr pearson was at home and i had the distinct impression that he was listening to our conversation i pushed the talk toward private matters in particular the happiness i had known with my late husband is it not a wonderful thing i said to have a husband with whom you can enjoy so much likeness of mind above all things it is necessary to contentment that ones spouse be agreeable at once cynthias face clouded over and i heard a creak upon the floorboards of the adjoining room pearson crept closer hoping to hear her response i am sorry you lost your husband said mrs pearson it sounds as though there were never two more compatible people i had long since sensed that she and her husband were far from companionable and so i did not press the issue i had what i wantedpearsons secret attentionand i meant to press the attack i wish i could understand other men as well as i understood my husband i said to mrs pearson it is on that score i wished your advice you know i am friends with mr duer the world knows it she said her words containing more than what was spoken though i know not what else i flattered myself it was no more than curiosity i put my hand to my mouth i hope no one suggests anything improper she shook her head one need only look upon the two of you he regards you more like a daughter i believe than anything else i am glad to hear you say so he is a clever man and i have learned a great deal from him but he is i am afraid rather dismissive of some of my ideas you say he treats me like a daughter but sometimes he treats me like a child i wish to present a proposal to him one i believe could make him a great deal of money but i must suggest it in just the right way lest he dismiss it out of hand mrs pearson began to offer up much sage advice on soothing male pride but i only pretended to listen my heart beat hard in my chest i could only hope this scheme would work because if it did not i would have to take a much more direct approach and the more pearson believed the idea his and not mine the greater my chance of success all this concern was for nothing as i left the house pearson came after me not precisely racing but walking in his slow methodical stiff manner his chin was raised his eyes heavy and vaguely sleepy he clearly wished to appear seductive in that moment i hated him more than i hated duer or hamilton you will forgive me madam he said but inadvertently i overheard what you said to my wife it is true that duer may not take your proposal seriously but you may be assured he will take it seriously from me he has learned to trust me indeed he has i said he placed one of his large hands on my elbow perhaps because he had seen duer touch me thus i hated when duer touched me and yet i did not fear him the way i feared pearson duer was merely a vile selfcentered villain pearson i was beginning to understand was a beast you must tell me what you have in mind he said and if i like it i shall present the idea to duer if he wishes to implement it we shall tell him whose idea it was why that is generous of you i said offering him my most gracious smile shall we return to the house and discuss it by all means i looked up and there at the window was mrs pearson peering down at us with concern in her eyes at first i thought she suspected i had some evil design upon her husband but then our eyes met and i realized her concern was for me in my madness to destroy duer and hamilton in my hatred for pearson i had refused to think of mrs pearson that lovely intelligent and oppressed creature i had refused to consider her children they too would be destroyed with pearson when duer and hamilton and the rest came undone the innocents would be undone with them i had come much too far to turn away on such an account i could not refuse to fight a war because there might be innocents harmed innocents were harmed during the revolution and no one would say the war was not worth fighting even so at that moment i took a silent vow i would break hamilton and duer yes and it was now a foregone conclusion that pearson would be dashed upon the rocks as well but i would protect mrs pearson and her children from the worst of it god help me i would not become what i despised ethan saunders a new morning met me in new york leonidas and i breakfasted together and i informed him we would waste no time in pressing forward to that end i said we would spend the dayunless something of greater interest revealed itselfin the merchants coffeehouse which i knew from my time living in this city to be the financial center of new york at the corner of wall and water streets the merchants was a handsome structure in the new york style bold on the outside spacious within the taproom of this establishment was commodious and comfortable with several fireplaces and a surplus of candles to keep the place well lit it was filled by a wide variety of gentleman most of whom appeared to me to be too old and too fat to warrant much respect leonidas garnered a few curious looks from those uncomfortable with the notion of socializing with negroes and he suggested he return to our rooms i would not let him go i need to have someone to speak to i do better thinking when i can speak my ideas aloud then you may hire a whore to sit and talk with you if it is all the same dont be so sensitive you are like a jilted lover in any event you must know by now that you are more than a person with whom i can engage in dialogue you are proving to be a very capable spy yourself leonidas he appeared pleased with my saying it but what of the looks the traders dont like a negro here even stronger than their dislike is their greed and indifference if there were one of those instructional books an every man his own spy or something of that nature one of the chapters would certainly instruct you to act everywhere you go as if you belong there that more than anything else will keep you safe now let us see what sort of trouble we can cause you there i grabbed a passing trader is it true that the million bank launches next week he snorted yes but what of it the million bank is a sham a scheme rooted in political mischief and greed no one but a fool will waste his money upon it i affected a look of surprise are you certain i know for a fact that duer means to invest heavily can the great duer be mistaken something changed upon the mans face you are certain of that from the mans lips himself i said then for gods sake tell no one else he said and hurried off there will always be a storm i told leonidas you may be rained upon or cause the rain yourself i very much prefer the latter what do you imagine he prefers leonidas asked pointing to a table across the room drinking coffee with an expression of utter seriousness was my old friend kyler lavien he was alone at his table so leonidas and i sat down to join him good afternoon leonidas captain saunders what are you doing here you know what im doing here i said im looking for pearson he smiled i understand that you have good reason to do so and he has good reason to fear your finding him but that doesnt explain why you went out to greenwich to see duer you know about that he leaned forward i know about everything at least in the end i want you to stay away from duer duer is my best chance of finding pearson there is something improper in their dealings but they do business together somehow and at least for pearson it is a desperate business if i stir things up for duer sufficiently pearson will emerge if i can find out anything about where pearson is i shall tell you i appreciate that i said but i trust you wont mind if i continue to look on my own as it happens i do mind there are things in play nowdelicate things i cannot risk your acting on your own then bring me in i said tell me what you do i have not permission for that you of all men must understand that i am in a difficult position were it in my power to trust you i would but i must act alone and you must stay away from anything involving the million bank stay away from anything involving the bank of the united states and stay away from duer he rose you and i have been friends saunders but do not test me on this you know what i am capable of good day leonidas watched him leave he is unhappy rather unkind of him to take out his frustration on us dont you think i signaled the boy to place our orders but he did not come over instead an older man in a very dirty apron manifested himself and came to our table are you named saunders he asked leonidas stiffened considerably in his chair i dont know what he made ready for but i suppose after ten years in my service he knew that any time a stranger recognized me it might well mean trouble i told the man i was indeed who he thought but there was nothing threatening in him he was in fact naught but smiles very good sir im meant to inform you that your orders sir for drinks onlyspirituous drinks you understandare to be paid for at no charge to you may i send you a bottle of our best claret sir yes that would be very good better make it two i said ah very good sir your wine shall be with you anon he bowed and retreated backward for a few steps as though afraid i might attack him if he turned away duer means to keep you drunk leonidas said obviously he is clearly afraid of the damage you might do to him certainly and what shall you do about it drink his wine and then do the damage t o the accompaniment of some very good wine indeed we spent several hours watching small trades transpire about us at pm there was a mass exodus into one of the merchants long rooms where an auction in government securities was conducted by a man named john pintard it was a raucous and loud affair and things happened far too quickly for me to understand who sold and who bought duer did not himself attend but i noticed the unusually tall isaac whippo standing toward the back of the room carefully observing each transaction after this we retired back to the taproom as did many of the speculators the auction seemed to be only the most orderly and organized of the days activities for the real trading took place afterward in comfort and semiprivacy whippo left after the auction which i considered to my advantage i did not want him around to see me work my business it had been of some value to sit and watch to listen to men talk it was an even greater advantage to invite them to talk with me using the excellent free wine as an incentive i decided it would be wrong of me very wrong not to use duers assault upon my perceived weakness against him and i spread it about that i was willing to share my bounty with any man willing to share information about duer no one precisely lined up but as soon as one man left my table another was willing to take his place i listened to what each had to say and would ask the occasional question about pearson though this yielded little fruit some knew who he was and had seen him in new york though not recently some asserted he worked with duer but none could say to what end or in what capacity i did hear a great deal about duer though much of it contradictory the million bank was indeed upon everyones lips and while most men had absorbed the message duer wished them to receivethat this project was a fiscal disaster in the makingi was also pleased to hear repeated back to me the very rumor i had spread that morning that the million bank was poised to be a major enterprise and that duer himself had invested heavily i had been at my project almost two hours and growing weary of it when a shadow crossed over my table and a vaguely familiar voice greeted me the man himself was uncompelling in stature losing his hair precipitously and dressed finely in a new suit of light blue material it took a moment but then i recognized him for id met him at the bingham house this was the new senator from new york colonel aaron burr id hoped to make your acquaintance once again he said and sat without waiting to be invited i presented leonidas to him who nodded and spoke a few pleasant and forgettable words as was his habit when i treated him as an equal burr looked at the bottle of wine having clearly heard rumor of my bottomless supply i called for a fresh glass and a fresh bottle with wine in hand he appeared ever more relaxed what brings you to new york saunders i hear you have been making inquiries of duer are you making inquiries for hamilton im merely curious i said he knew an obfuscation when he heard one and i had no doubt he had issued more than his share then you are not upon treasury department business i am upon personal business i said as though this were but more casual conversation tell me have you seen jacob pearson here in new york i have seen him in new york but not recently are you hoping to create a reunion of our little circle from the bingham house what do you mean well the two of us pearson and that delightful mrs maycott this was interesting she is in new york oh yes she has rooms in a boardinghouse on wall street you must be careful though a rich widow is always an attractive target but her irishman doesnt let any suitors too close it was tempting to jump to conclusions but i could not know that this was the same irishman id met outside the statehouse new york was more full of irishmen than ireland have you met this guardian oh yes very imposing fellow not young but tall hairless as an egg and smelling of whiskey i would not recommend crossing him the charming and beautiful mrs maycott who claimed to be my best friend in this affair was in league with the bald and giant irishman from the statehouse this was disturbing news indeed as for pearson he continued that is a more difficult matter they say he is hiding from the treasury department though no one knows precisely why i suppose that is why freneau is passing his time here in new york he must wish to find pearson as well as you though i imagine for different reasons philip freneau said leonidas jefferson s newspaper man what has he to do with all of this i dont know said burr but if you wish to know i can think of no better method of discovering the truth than asking him he is sitting across the room fortunately he had the good sense to do no more than gesture with his head i looked over and there indeed was a gentleman i recognized i could not disguise my astonishment i knew the mans name and i knew his face but i had never before associated the one with the other it was the frogfaced man whom i had seen watching me all over philadelphia he sat behind a pillar so he was mostly obscured and he was looking away at the moment but every few minutes he glanced in my direction he took a lazy note on a piece of foolscap the man who had appeared everywhere i went was jefferson s newspaper man he has been following me for some time i said to burr have you any idea why i imagine it is because he believes you can lead him to a story for his newspaper and if it is for his paper it must be something to make hamilton look poorly do you know the man i asked not well but i know him a little ive had a few social interactions is he a physical man i asked does he possess courage not that ive seen said burr i glanced at leonidas he said good n ot long after that mr burr excused himself leonidas and i entertained a few more speculators in search of good claret and dropped a few more hints about the million bank but i kept my eye on the froggy mr freneau at near eight oclock he left the merchants and leonidas and i followed him there could be no guarantee that his path would provide an opportunity for us but as it turned out the streets were quiet and poorly lit and it was no difficult task to find our moment we approached him quietly from behind and leonidas turned his shoulder outward and slammed hard into mr freneaus back leonidas then stepped backmen are more indignant if they know they are knocked down by a negroand i moved forward to take his place i do beg your pardon i said picking up mr freneaus leather bag which he had dropped as an inevitable result of leonidass expertly placed blow it was dark and thus easy for my fingers to explore inside extract a thick package of folded papers and slip them into my own coat your bag sir i said holding it out he snatched the bag with great irritation you did that purposefully for what reason i demanded would i knock down a stranger on purpose come saunders you must know by now ive been keeping my eye on you i gasped can it be you may choose to play games said freneau but i think it time we dealt openly being in possession of freneaus documents i could not help but think the advantage was mine so i invited him to join me in the taproom of fraunces tavern i was happy to escape the cold and we made ourselves comfortable near the fire before i could call for refreshment the publican came forth to inform me that duer had made the same arrangement with him as with the owner of the merchants i therefore asked him to send me two of his best bottles of wine i did not want them for myself only to make duer pay and to make him believe i depended more on his generosity than i did now then i said to freneau perhaps you will tell me what you wish of me you know what i wish i wish to know what duer and hamilton are up to they are not up to anything together together separate it hardly matters you will find it is all of a piece now out with it there has been something brewing for some time ive long felt it this is an election year you know and my readers must have the truth perhaps you should first tell us what you know since i too must have the truth you say what you know and then i will add what i can freneau pressed his lips together in satisfaction which made him look all the more froggish i know duer plans to gain ownership of the million bank he puts it about that he thinks the scheme will fail but it is only so he and his agents can obtain more shares themselves what is the harm in that many predict the bank wont survive but if duer wants to invest in it may he not do so duer lies he warns everyone away from the million bank launch and then he plans to move in with his agents to gain a controlling share what happens then its a new bank it is regarded with interest and enthusiasm the value of its shares rise and inevitably the value of the shares of other banks falls it may be temporary but it happens but if a man controls enough of one bank he can then use the artificial value of the inflated price of shares to buy up a controlling interest in another bank in this case duer thinks he can use the million bank to take over the bank of the united states when he is done the most venal man in america will hold in his hands the nations finances and hamilton will have all but handed his bank over to him it is a fantasy of hamiltonhaters i said why should hamilton wish to sacrifice the bank the thing of which he is most proud by surrendering it to duer hamilton wishes to erase the difference between the government and the moneyed interests said freneau he wants to outbritish the british to build a corrupt nation run by the rich who use land and people as a factory for their greed it must be pleasant to believe ones own lies i said i have proof enough he patted his bag i can demonstrate what sort of a monster duer is his agents in philadelphia and baltimore and charleston short government issues and the word spreads so the price declines his agents in new york and boston then buy them at a reduced price but how does that aid him i asked one set of agents loses money the other set gains does that not eliminate or at least reduce his profits it would said freneau if the agents shorting were using duers money no these are more like partners convinced that they are sharing risks and rewards with the great man they dont know it but duer sacrifices them in order to gain what he imagines to be ultimate wealth is jacob pearson such a man i asked he is freneau said duer has quite devastated pearsons holdings but the man is too big a fool to see it what remains of pearsons wealth will be put into the million bank and then duer will offer to help with pearsons new debt in exchange for his million bank shares that cant be the only means by which duer aims to get control of the bank no said freneau he has other agents men who will in fact use duers money to buy on the day of the launch do you know who they are i have that information he said patting his bag again but it is time for you to give me something ive heard a rumor that pearson is in new york do you know if thats true i have heard he is but i have also heard he does not wish his whereabouts known so you can tell me nothing of it i pressed nothing said freneau but one never knows when new information may be acquired make me your friend sir and i shall keep your questions in mind i was distracted thinking of pearson of his hitting cynthia of his fist striking her face i thought of him threatening to harm his own children i had thought freneau could tell me but he knew nothing if he deceived me about anything i believed it was about the likelihood he might yet discover the information i wanted very well i muttered tell me about kyler lavien said freneau that brought me back to the conversation i did not know how much freneau and the jeffersonians knew about lavien but anything was too much i looked at him and did my best to appear puzzled who dont attempt to make me into a fool he said how could i attempt myself what nature hath wrought to perfection freneau sat straight do you break your word in order to protect a scoundrel like hamilton ive grown somewhat fond of hamilton i said i discover he is a decent man and ill not help a bloodthirsty jackal like you libel his name because you refuse to recognize that he and duer however much they may once have been friends are now set against each other can you not advance the cause of your democratical republicanism with the truth if you cant perhaps it is not worth advancing freneau chose to act as though id said nothing i asked you to tell me about lavien i cannot tell you of a man ive never heard of is he the french ambassador perhaps jefferson knows him from all that time he spent in paris buying wines and furnishings while the rest of us fought a war freneau unflatteringly allowed his eyes to bulge im sorry i told you anything i wish i could take back my words and i wish all children of the world might be given the gift of beautiful flowers now be gone you tedious man and trouble me no longer freneau stood you will regret using me so i dont think so i said i think in fact i will look back on this abuse with pleasure now please go before i ask my man to knock you down again leonidas grinned at him and that proved the final argument he stood cast us a resentful glance and left the tavern i had hoped to find pearson tonight but my hopes had been dashed even so it was hardly a disastrous evening indeed i had every reason to be pleased with myself and with this in mind i took the papers from freneaus bag and proceeded to see what he had to teach us john maycott autumn and winter back in his house while his wife attempted to walk noiselessly one floor above us i sat with mr pearson in his library he poured me a glass of wine and i sat in an armchair while he sat across from me on the sofa i had a curious role to play part child part speculator part seductress and i was suddenly uneasy aware of the noises of the street outside us the clicking of the clock in the room the distant barking of a dog i sipped the wine so it would redden my lips and then i began i spoke of the million bank describing it as yes another bank attempting to capitalize on the publics new mania for banks but also far more under the correct circumstances it could become the most powerful financial institution in the new country it only required daring leadership it require men who were willing to see the times for what they were times of unchecked possibility times in which destiny might be shaped by the bold and the clever pearson who imagined himself such a man and was indeed looking at my winedarkened lips hung upon my every word so i told him how i believed a relatively small group of investors if they could but command enough money might attempt to take the whole initial stock offering imagine i said what a cabal might do if it suddenly and for a relatively small investment found itself in control of a bank he stopped staring at my lips long enough to ask me how that might happen i explained that i thought a new bank might use the initial euphoria that followed its launch to take over another more established bank such as the bank of new york or evenfor men of true audacitythe bank of the united states mr pearson finished his drink and poured another he stared out the foggy window for a long moment while he worked his lips soundlessly as though having a long and somewhat contentious conversation with himself at last apparently having won the argument he turned back to me you chose not to present this to duer i did not wish to impose upon our friendship he asks me for advice yes and values my opinion but it did not seem right that i should offer to direct his affairs let us be honest mrs maycott that is not the reason at all i think it is time for you to be direct with me sir i said in protest what had i done i wondered to tip my hand had i grown too lax in my deception had one success after another led me to lay down my guard if you have any reservations about what i say you may feel free to disregard it i remind you that it was you who wished me to speak he laughed loud and barking it sounded either forced or seething with madness you bring it to me because you understand the way things are duers success is but a fluke but i have had to build my achievements one brick at a time he is nothing but a rich speculator but you know a man of vision when you see one i was on uncertain ground here there could be no doubt of that but at least i was not myself the subject of his suspicion i masked the sound of my exhalation of relief mr duer is my friend and i have the greatest respect for his successes of course of course he laughed again though this time less like a lunatic and waved one of his big hands through the air but different men have different talents and not everyone can be a visionary not everyone can be bold enough to see what is invisible to others that is most certainly true can i then conclude you think this is something that could be effected i think it can it only lacks a man with both means and ambition enough it requires something else of course it requires capital and only a handful of men in the country have enough to attempt such a thing and if i understand how things stand there is only one man with the means who might be willing to try i will speak to duer he said understanding full well the value of a coup de théâtre i said then you must not mention my name i do not go to him directly because i fear he will not take me seriously but if you tell him the idea is from me he may wonder why i did not trust him it must be our secret but what do you gain if i take the credit for your idea i gain the satisfaction of feeling clever several days later mr duer and i sat in the city tavern and he told me of what he understood to be pearsons scheme his voice was strangely flat and i wondered if i had somehow wandered into a trap did he know i had been deceiving him yet i could not back away now i listened as he described my million bank scheme back to me in all its blunt insane glory do you think it possible he asked me i pretended to give the matter a great deal of consideration i do think so yes he rubbed his hands together the trick will be how to shift pearson away from attempting to order me about it is a brilliant idea but he would not know how to go about it it is only by the strangest of flukes that he would even think of it before i did you need not worry i said pearson likes to present himself as brilliant but he is all bluster and he knows it you will make him do as you wish by letting him tell you that he is doing as he wishes even while he follows you about as though led by the nose you need only tend to his pride and he will give you all you need duer smiled at me you are an astute observer of human nature i should very much hate for you to be my enemy i sipped my tea and said nothing over duers shoulder the scarred mr reynolds smirked at me and i could not help but wonder if he had been working on duer convincing him to doubt me it was only a matter of time of course until reynolds or circumstances proved to duer that hed been foolish to be so open with me but i was almost certain that the time was not yet here joan maycott december it was when the scheme to take charge of the million bank was under way that we first became aware of ethan saunders who was to become so significant an actor in the events that followed since i had formed my friendship with duer he and his followers had redoubled efforts to gain a controlling interest of six percent issues there were now two fairly significant irons in the fire and when we met one evening at pearsons house to talk of these things it was i who raised the question for the first time at some point i said these activities are going to attract hamilton s attention are they not oh that is nothing said duer i can tend to hammy all he requires is a kind word and he shall be satisfied to know him is to understand he is more dog than man duer and i had more than once discussed pearsons need to exaggerate his own importance but duer was frequently guilty of the same sin when hamilton s name came up he would pretend to a closeness and influence for which i had never seen evidence this above all concerned me for if hamilton were to discover duers activities too early duer would indeed be ruined but hamilton would walk awayperhaps not unscathed but relatively intact i think shes right said pearson scenting duers blood he was now significantly in debt because of his involvement in duers schemes and he had borrowed recklessly from the bank of the united states in order to continue losing money and to have enough to invest personally in the million bank launch there were rumors about town that he had even begun to sell off some of his real estate holdings and if that was the case he was more precariously poised than i had realized or intended if he fell from the precipice now i had no notion of how i would save his wife and children other than to give them money of my own mrs maycott is always sensible said duer but that does not make her right hamilton has invested everythinghis heart his soul his reputation his careerinto the bank of the united states and the american financial system i said i cannot believe he will ignore suspicious activity simply because you are behind it william i did not say what we were all thinking yet the world knew during the crisis that followed the banks launch hamilton had ignored duers advice against stabilizing the market and had achieved calm at the expense of duers profits well what can he do asked duer he can request that we stop but he has no power to direct us if he knows too precisely what we plan he can thwart us i said and how would he learn what we plan duer asked it was pearson who spoke the name saying it as if it were something vile a bitter pill that lodged under the tongue blossoms foully in the mouth ethan saunders who is that i asked at that point id not before heard the name what said duer ethan saunders from the war was he not cashiered from the army as a traitor he left under a cloud yes said pearson but hamilton chose never to bring forth official treason charges he was guilty and everyone knew it but no one could be troubled with it the war was nearing its close but he was washington and hamilton s pet and i cannot imagine hamilton will not use him now i have seen him about town of late hes become a drunk and a womanizerthe sort of man you cannot look on without wanting to destroy then it seems unlikely that hamilton would engage his services i observed he looked at me a long moment and i must admit it made me extraordinarily uncomfortable must you always contradict me pearson asked these things concern me i said attempting to keep my voice calm we do not discuss what we had for supper last week but what must be done next i do not contradict mr pearson i participate yes yes you are a clever woman and all that he said but you must remember that i am a man and that makes me cleverer you are at best a parlor trick duer rose to his feet and looked to me like a little boy who needed to relieve himself but knew not where to do it i do not wish to involve myself in what must be a private dispute you will excuse me for a moment seeing me abused duer wished to absent himself and so be rid of the discomfort i forced a pleasing smile at pearson my face was bright and full of nothing but admiration and congeniality we have no disagreement i said mr duer may sit back down and you sir may continue we are all friends here duer looked not at me but at pearson and seeing something he liked or at least found agreeable he returned to his seat with your leave pearson said to me of course i answered easily and with that he continued as though there had been no disruption saunders is not what he was but hamilton will bring him in because he is here and because he was said to have been the cleverest spy of his day im sure he wasnt but that is what they said of him besides he owes hamilton a debt for not bringing him up on charges hamilton would have to be a fool not to use a man who must regard him as the greatest of benefactors so what do you propose asked duer obviously exerting some effort to sound easy and natural he did not wish to have pearson explode before him as well ill tend to saunders said pearson as it happens i observed him not two weeks ago leaving a low sort of place with the wife of an acquaintance of mine a word whispered in his ear will encourage this man dorland to remove saunders for us once he is fled or otherwise gone hamilton will have no spy at his command if he learns what we plan it will only be when it is too late in truth i did not consider this matter as important as pearson seemed to whatever his experience had been with saunders it had evidently been unpleasant in the extreme so if he wished to remove this potential asset to hamilton i would not object once i was done speaking to the gentlemen i went upstairs and found mrs pearson in the sitting room she was upon the sofa reading from pilgrims progress to the children who sat listening in rapt fascination the fire reflected against her pale skin and she seemed almost to glow upon seeing me she closed the book thats enough for now children i would like a word with mrs maycott i expected groans and complaints however halfhearted for it is a timehonored tradition that children protest when story time ends these children however unfolded themselves from the floor and quietly left the room they were afraid and overdisciplined and i knew it was not mrs pearsons hand that had rendered them so once we were alone together mrs pearson rose and shut the door to the sitting room she poured us wine and then sat near me on the sofa that she might speak in low tones i hope you will not be angry if i tell you i overheard some of what you spoke of with the gentlemen of course not i said she however was not quite ready to begin i envy you the way you move among them as an equal you are so beautiful and yet they dont treat you as though you were a plaything how do you gain their respect i gain it by demanding it i said she turned away i cannot demand respect from mr pearson i know i said quietly i know what things are like here cynthia dont think i havent seen it andand i mean to help you she looked at me with great intensity and i could not tell if it was surprise or hope help me how i shook my head i dont know yet i dont know but i will help you cynthia you have my word when this is over you shall be the better for it she turned back to me when what is over the business i do with your husband and mr duer she smiled at me it was a strange thing mrs pearson was fair and i dark her eyes the palest blue mine a heavy green her features tiny and delicate mine sharp and prominent no one would ever have called us alike and yet for an instant i felt as though i looked in a mirror i knew that smile in its stark cynicism and cold penetrating understanding of the truth you command their respect but you blind them with charm too i dont take your meaning she smiled again though this time it seemed to me more forced i dont know what you are doing with them but i know it is not what they think no do not say a word i dont want you to lie to me and i dont want you to tell me the truth lest mr pearson force me to tell him i dont know mr duer and i have no opinion of him but i know my husband and i shall not interfere with you i swallowed hard and attempted to show no reaction at all is that what you wished to say to me no she whispered she turned away again facing the window with her voice low and the crackling of the fire i could hardly hear her yet against the odds her words made their way to me and somehow were clear i heard a mention of captain saunders and i want to know what was said can it be you know him this man said to be a traitor i knew him during the war he was no traitor and he was my fathers friend and your friend i asked she nodded i was to marry him she faced me now but her voice was so low it was almost indistinguishable from breath things went very wrong my father died and ethanhad to flee they accused him of crimes he could not have committed but the world thought him guilty and he could not endure that the taint should fall upon me also i have never believed for a moment he did anything wrong ethan saunders is the most astonishing man ive ever known he is now in philadelphia i said her eyes went wide what he is in town and your husband means to harm him she took my hand you dont mean to let him do you i shook my head oh no i said you may depend upon it i had never heard of ethan saunders before tonight but he sounds like the sort of man worth protecting i meant it without having met him i liked him already perhaps because we had both suffered at the hands of an ungrateful government at the same time i could not help but wonder if he might prove to be of some use to me i have to admit i was extremely curious about this saunders and also quite sanguine about what he could mean for our project my man in duers employ in new york had proved vital but the rest of the men had been forced to endure months of inactivity trusting in me as i cavorted with duer hoping i knew what i was doing worrying that instead of bringing down our enemies i only strengthened them learning more about saunders would give us something to do one at a time the boys went out to observe him to see what sort of man he was to see if he was a threat or an asset i longed to see him for myself but most of the public places he frequented were not the sort in which i could hope to blend unseen the first time i saw him was at the duck pond on a cold and sunny sunday afternoon skye had been observing him and believing he would be present for some time more sent a boy to fetch me when i arrived i watched him from a distance walking the perimeter observing the ladies with predatory interest he seemed to be particularly attentive to ladies who traveled in groups with no gentlemanly accompaniment what do you think of him asked skye hes very handsome i said and very drunk i doubt he could be much of a threat to us and im not convinced he will be much of an asset best to be safe said skye it is always better to be safe i agreed does he have anyone close to him someone we could approach there are not many but i do believe there is someone skye said then it is time we began to pay this someone to keep us informed ethan saunders the next morning leonidas and i ordered a pot of tea sent up to my room and with daylight streaming upon my small table we continued to look over the dozens of pages id taken from freneau the man had been busy i will say that much for him for he had not only several pages of closely written notes but many letters he had evidently borrowed or stolen these were from and to duer and covered many tedious details some too convoluted or elliptical to be deciphered but others quite clear duer the letters indicated was indeed planning on taking control of the million bank and using its moment of ascendancy to absorb the bank of the united states freneaus documents made clear that duer had organized a group of traders into what he called a six percent club these men conspired to bring down the price of the six percent issues that duer might then buy obtaining a near monopoly with the issues out of circulation their value would rise increasing duers wealth moreover bank of the united states scrip holders needed these issues to pay out their shares if they could not obtain the six percents they would have to sell the scrip most likely at a discount thus duer hoped to gain a monopoly on bank of the united states scrip he imagined that by the end of the year he would be the only significant holder of either he would in effect own the american economy is it not enough to be rich leonidas asked me what drives a man to a wealth that will crush all others it is the dark side of liberty i said a man is not hindered by what cannot be done so twisted men like duer apply that liberty to their greed but can he actually take over the bank asked leonidas no i said i dont think so there are too many variables too many things he must juggle but he can do great damage to the economy to hamilton and ultimately to the country in the process so what do we do we stop him lavien said not to he is wrong perhaps he is too cautious he doesnt know what we do then why not tell him because this is my fight leonidas our fight duers scheme makes a sacrifice of pearson and i have sworn to protect his wife i may hate pearson but i must drag him from duers fire if i am to save his wife from penury i cannot trust that lavien will see things my way first we stop duer then we tell lavien what we know he nodded my mind was churning thinking of a thousand things that might be done would you return to duers mansion i asked him learn some more from the servants about his plans for wednesday after leonidas set off for greenwich i took some lunch in the tavern and rather than sit and drink duers free wine decided to take a turn about the city to consider my next move i had not visited new york in several years and it continued to improve from the sorry state in which the war had left it everywhere were new buildings or buildings under construction even in winter streets that had been no more than muddy alleyways during the war were now lined with magisterial homes here and there were old ruinsabandoned houses and barns and along the river docksremnants of the citys past struggles these i had no doubt would soon enough disappear lost to new construction and commerce i had traveled no more than a block or two from the tavern when i felt that the same shadow had been lurking behind me too long during the war i had many times been in philadelphia or new york or other occupied regions and i was always alert to being followed it is not a skill one forgets thus i sped up and feeling that my pursuer must also be speeding i immediately turned around and headed back in doing so i nearly collided with a tall and decomposing wreck of a man why i said tis isaac whippo fancy seeing you here i did not know this was the best part of town to pursue boy buggery why i had taken such a strong dislike to the man eluded me but i had and that was enough for now perhaps it was because of his absurdly sinister appearance perhaps because i felt i could treat him badly and get away with it duers strange man glared at me but said nothing you may tell duer that if he wishes to know what i am about he need only ask he need not send a cadaver to come spying after me it is something i dont like and i dont like you he said dont say so my good pudendum bit of a term of affection in philadelphia strange place that but still as i rather like you i must shout it to the world i then raised my hands and called out to all who passed this man is my very dear pudendum big men small men great men and disentombed menthere is no great difference most enter into situations thinking they will have to face this conflict or that it has ever been my experience that if you present an alternative completely foreign to their expectations it will end the encounter entirely so it was with my friend mr whippo he skulked away like the mummified thing he was after being followed by mr whippo i thought it best to disappear from the street for a short period of time i therefore chose to divert myself with a visit to dr kings celebrated exhibit on wall street to view his living menagerie of creatures it turned out to be a cramped house of the most unspeakable odor full of small cages in which raged a variety of unhappy creatures including a pair of sloths a pair of porcupines monkeys of all descriptions and even a male and female of the species known as orangutans these were very tall hairy creatures of a ginger color with uncannily long arms and lugubrious faces dr king himself making a proprietary pass through the exhibition hall informed me that these creatures were every bit as intelligent as negroes but all my efforts at communication failed and i ultimately decided his conclusions were overly optimistic once it grew dark i returned to fraunces tavern and sent one of the serving boys upstairs to find leonidas he had he told me been there for several hours but knew not where to find me so he had chosen simply to wait his visit to the duer mansion had proved to be of little value he had spoken to the serving staff once again and found them eager to gossip about their master but in the end they had little to say that we did not already know the six agents in duers employ were to gather at his house for a meeting at eight oclock on wednesday morning and from there they would proceed to corres hotel where the million banks initial stock would be sold as he spoke i sensed a presence nearby someone listening to our conversation when i looked up i beheld philip freneau who approached our table looking very pleased with himself he sat down and stretched his legs out before him comfortably you asked if i could find jacob pearson he said it turns out that i can you are impressed i can tell of course i have no intention of telling you where he is but i thought you might be interested to learn that he now knows where you are i said nothing leonidas leaned forward his face only inches away from freneau are you implying that you are attempting to make certain some harm befalls captain saunders he shrugged apparently quite unafraid of leonidas i do not know i would have been so unafraid had he leaned in that way toward me but freneau merely smiled oh no i am not a violent man and would never promote violence in others i merely thought you might wish to know that jacob pearson appeared to my eyes at any rate quite agitated to learn of your presence what do you want freneau i asked i thought our business was done and it would have been done had you dealt with me honestly but it seems thats not your way is it captain saunders perhaps it is simply not the hamilton way i should even have been content to lick my wounds had you only dealt with me as dishonestly as i had at first thought but when i returned home i found you had been far more treacherous than i had suspected you stole documents from my bag and i would like them returned stole from your bag i asked good lord am i now a thief you stole them and i want them back and if you dont return them to me you shall be very sorry sir i have given you but a hint of the harm i can do you leonidas poured himself a glass of wine he was of course usually abstemious in his habits but he knew well enough how to affect a cool demeanor to menacing effect mr freneau please take my advice leonidas said even i found his calm unnerving stand up and leave we have nothing of yours and nothing you want if captain saunders feels threatened he will call upon me to protect him you do not want that freneaus face did seem to blanch but he held his ground admirably i had to admit captain saunders i can do you genuine harm and i dont mean revealing your whereabouts to a man who hates you already i can harm you in ways you would not care to think of as regards your friend and slave you know of what i speak now return to me the documents you stole and we shall forget this conversation ever took place could he know about my liberating leonidas id told no one but i was not so naïve as to believe that such information like all information could not be bought and sold if only someone recognized its value i felt suddenly frightened the issue at hand was of an act of generosity i had performed but i understood full well how leonidas if the news was presented in a biased manner might misunderstand my actions seeming to understand my thoughts freneau smiled at me it is amazing how a man might visit an attorney and not trouble to learn he is a jeffersonian in inclination whatever he tells you i said to leonidas is misleading at best he cannot have all the facts so let him speak and we shall sort it out when the rascal leaves us be i attempted to sound confident but i could not hide from myself the feeling of rapid descent from a precipice leonidas stood again and looked at freneau you have nothing to say to interest me oh you will want to hear this freneau assured him no i wont go leonidas said i smiled at freneau seeing i had defeated him leonidass loyalty would win out over any trivial detail freneau stood very well he replaced his hat i see i am beaten he began to walk off but stopped short you must know you are a free man leonidas and have been for weeks saunders took the trouble to free you but he did not take the trouble to mention it he turned quickly as if afraid of some punishment leaping out at him and departed our company leonidas and i watched him go carefully avoiding each others gaze it seemed to me impossible given the momentousness of what was just said that the others in the taproom paid us no mind yet no eyes fell upon us and our crisis came without notice men gathered in their clusters and drank and spoke and laughed life continued all around us and yet it seemed we were upon a stage a great light flooding down on us at last i turned to look at leonidas whose dark eyes were narrow and bloodshot and intense do not say anything else he warned i leaned back in my seat do make yourself easy leonidas i had hoped to make this a surprise when our task was completed but i see i must tell you now in order to avoid any resentment a greater sense of ceremony would have been welcome but now this will have to do yes i made arrangements with a lawyer congratulations sir you are a free man i raised my glass to toast him it was a bittersweet moment for i hated to let him go but his freedom was long overdue i hoped he would in turn look upon me in friendship and gratitude this was not i told myself the end of my connection with leonidas yet the look on his face remained dark harsh unforgiving he glowered and his breathing had quickened and i understood something had happened something terrible and unstoppable i have been a free man for weeks and you did not tell me well i meant to but then this business with cynthia arose and i could not spare you i thought it best to postpone he sucked in air as though hed been slapped you did not trust me to continue to help you of my own accord i stammered like a man explaining away a whore to his wife of course i trusted you but it hardly seemed necessary to make any big announcements when we had so much with which to concern ourselves a month or two could hardly make a difference you had no right to hold a free man in servitude i think you are taking this out of context i said you were only free because i freed you its not as though i captured you in the african jungle it doesnt matter how i was freed i was free and you continued to hold me he said rising to his feet it is unforgivable no no no you are focusing on the wrong things i have reformed leonidas i have freed you i understand that this is a confusing moment but you will sort it out sit have a drink let us talk about your plans he remained quiet in a pose of consideration his face returned to its more customary sable and his eyes returned to their traditional oval shape he blinked at me a few times then he said i am going upstairs to collect my things and then i am leaving what now i stood you cannot leave me now i am in the thick of it you said i ought to have trusted that you would remain by my side and now you threaten me with leaving i make no threats but a pronouncement i cannot remain with a man who would use me so had you told me before i would stay but you did not goodbye ethan i opened my mouth to speak but he had already turned and i would not demean myself by calling after him like a jilted lover instead i sat and poured myself some of duers wine i sat and waited i watched as he descended the stairs once more and i watched as he turned to the door without once looking back toward me i watched as he walked out into the cold new york night leaving me entirely alone on the eve of crisis joan maycott january id thought to go alone and might well have done so it was not that i did not trust the man i was to meet in this whole affair he seemed to me among the most honorable perhaps curiously so it was not a question of fear but one of power would it make me seem more powerful i wondered to go alone and thus show him how secure i felt or to bring a man with me and show him i had more men in my orbit than he had seen in the end i chose the latter the time had not yet comeif it were to cometo let him know how few we were it hardly mattered for we had achieved much and would i believed achieve all the smallness of our numbers made us adaptable and agile but to an outsider it might make us appear weak in earlier meetings he had met dalton and richmond so i brought with me mr skye who accepted the assignment with solemnity now it was dark and we sat in our hired coachid had skye hire the plainest one he could findon the side of a quiet street in an indifferent neighborhood it was modest but not poor and by no means unruly it was one of those parts of town where men labored hard for their few dollars and held to their homes with pride it was not yet nine the hour of our meeting and skye and i sat in the dark he sat perhaps closer to me than he ought to have and i could smell the scent of him leather and tobacco and the sweet hint of whiskey that clung to them all all the whiskey rebels what are his loyalties skye asked after a long silence he spoke quietly almost a whisper though i did not think such discretion was necessary i did not think he believed the question necessary either he spoke so as to have something to say right now i think hes loyal to himself i said which means as long as we continue to pay him he will serve us we have to be careful however not to push him too far or make him fear that anything he does will hurt someone he cares about i suspect no amount of money will make him do harm no of course not else you would not have recruited him his limitations are why you trust him i laughed you are wise and you are impressive more impressive than i can say i felt him take my hand joan he said so much has happenedto both of usand i would never imagine that you could put your grief for andrew aside yet you are alive a vibrant woman and i should be a strange sort of man were i not moved by your courage and leadershipand yes beauty i resisted the urge to pull my hand away from his i could not afford to offend him to make him feel ashamed i must be honest also and say that his attentions were not without their appeal skye was older than i was but charming and learned and attentive he never bristled at my leadership andrew for all that i loved him had regarded me with a mixture of admiration and tolerance he humored me as much as he admired me skye though it pained me to admit it understood me in many ways better than my husband ever could have yet i could not imagine giving my heart over to another man something had been taken from me when andrew was murdered and i did not want my armor pierced and there was more i did not know what would come but i knew i must be unfettered those around me had broken all the rules of human decency to bring me low and i would not be bound by any rules in striking back at them i would not be deterred not by loyalty nor affection nor love from doing what must be done most of all i did not want him because i did not love him the way he loved me or believed he did i wanted his friendship and loyalty and affection but i wanted nothing more you know it cannot be i said to him you are in my heart and i am in yours but that is as far as we may go there is too much far too much that lies before us he removed his hand and said after a moment of attempting to master himself will revenge bring us happiness i let out a bark of a laugh it is too late for happiness revenge shant bring it if i am to speak honestly i do not think it will even bring satisfaction how can it revenge is the emptiest of enterprises do you not think so days and weeks perhaps years to plan and execute and then once it is over what have you it is put together as meticulously as the artist crafts his work but there is no painting or sculpture or poem to stand as testament to the labor there is only the sensation and that sensation must always be hollow then why do you do it he asked is it only for the money you hope to earn i should like the money i said but it cannot motivate me i do it for the same reason you dobecause it is my duty having conceived of it having understood it could be done and that it ought to be done not doing it would destroy me doing it may destroy us as well yes it may but that sort of destruction i can accept i parted the dusty curtain of the coach and saw him emerging from his little house a few minutes sooner might have avoided the conversation with skye but i suppose it was well to have it done with i had turned skye away but not hurt him that should keep him content for a little while out the window i saw the man approach the equipage with a cold determination a man in perfect control though full of perhaps violent emotions his stride was easy enough however as though i were there to take him to an appointment he anticipated with pleasure or at least contentment he opened the door and folded his large body into the coach he nodded to me and skye and then took a seat across from us he was a handsome man with good teeth perfect and easy in his manners in a new nation of rough men and rugged manners it seemed ironic that in him i should find so complete a gentleman he looked at skye yet another associate he is with me i said but ill refrain from introducing him i prefer to avoid names where i can im sure that is sound he waited a moment then said i suppose it was inevitable you would come for me we do pay you and quite well i said and i do not complain though i harbored the hope that i might continue to be paid well in exchange for doing nothing i must say i hoped the same i said but things are changing he took a deep breath what is it you ask of me i want regular reports i said i want them sent every day i want to know what saunders is up to what he plans what he knows and what he believes he knows he took in a deep breath i dont much like it you should have thought of that before suppose i simply choose to defy you he said mr skye leaned forward that would not be the wisest course i shook my head at the man vaguely coquettish vaguely maternal it is too late for that dont you think you are a man who believes in the value of keeping his word is that not why you are here captain saunders did not keep his word to you he promised to emancipate you and yet he has not he does not deserve your loyalty no said the slave called leonidas he does not deserve it and yet it is surprisingly hard to let it go you know who we are i said and you know what we have promised our enemies are his enemies it is just that he does not know it and if we deceive him it is only to prompt him to do as he would choose himself if he but knew all he nodded ill do it but if i think he will come to harm i will not help you if that is the case i shall tell him everything and then i shall be your enemy you are more loyal than he deserves but i think youll find that we deserve it as well when it is all over you shall see we will be reconciled leonidas nodded again without another word he departed from the coach through the curtain i watched him return to the house for i wished to be sure he did not try to follow us and skye watched me watch him that is i suppose why we did not see the man approaching from the other side of the carriage he opened the door and joined us taking leonidass seat almost before we knew he was there i knew the scent almost before i knew the face and in an instant i thought how very ironic it was for to itemize the odors they were nearly the same as skyestobacco whiskey animal hides but there was more too this man stank of old sweat of clothes infrequently changed of urine and alley assignations he carried about him the coppery smell of blood and an indescribable but instantly recognizable scent of menace even in the dark i could make out the wide swath of scar that stretched across his face well if it aint joan maycott and john skye reynolds said i hope i aint interrupting anything too important or private i hear talk about you skye how did you find us skye asked his voice rose in excitement and fear he had not learned as i had to mask his emotions give no power no authority when it is yours to withhold ive been following your lady friend here for some time trying to figure out what shes about it aint been easy and ill be honest with you i still dont know what you are up to i couldnt get close enough to the coach to hear much so you know of nothing against me i said now i suggest you get out of the coach before i inform mr duer how youve treated me he will not love to hear of this rudeness duer reynolds waved a hand in the air hed be through with me if he knew no doubt about it but you wont tell him i dont know what youre about but i know you dont want him to know youre having secret meetings with saunderss darky things aint what they seem joan they aint at all now i dont care much i admire a pretty and clever woman my own wife is plenty pretty but not so clever on the other hand i dont much admire duer never have but he pays me so you see my difficulty if only i had someshall we call it incentiveto keep me from mentioning what i seen what sort of incentive skye asked i think a hundred dollars ought to keep my curiosity buried for a hundred dollars id want your curiosity buried forever forever is onefifty bit more one hundred only gets you a temporary situation i did not like it but had no choice give me a few days to get the money and i shall pay you the larger sum i hope however you are as good as your word we can deal with this amicably and financially so long as no one is exceptionally greedy but if you think this a well you can return to again and again i cannot answer for your prospects as it is i will need to conceal this arrangement from some of my allies men who are not so willing to seek compromise as i i conceal it you understand for your benefit i take your meaning he said and i will call upon you again soon good evening madam skye he departed the coach and i ordered the driver to move on lest we get more visitors skye said he will not be content not for long there is no forever for a man like reynolds no i said of course not then why did you agree because i hope one hundred fifty dollars will buy us at least a little more time and when he asks for more we will give him more if he asks for two hundred or five hundred we will give it to him as long as it is likely he will remain quiet he has too much power over us skye said we have one advantage however he does not know we need only a little more time we have to hope his greed and his belief in his own cleverness give us the time we need it was a new year and i believed that duer hamilton and the bank of the united states had only a few more months left they did not know it but the ice beneath them was cracking and all would soon fall into oblivion duer increasingly found that he did not wish to be without my advice so he rented for me a set of rooms at a boardinghouse in new york upon the broad way when he was in new york he wished me there too though we did not travel together i was not permitted to visit him at his home or to meet lady kitty cynics will believe that he and i must have crossed beyond the boundaries of propriety but it was not the case it might be that he desired me perhaps he even believed he loved meor loved the woman he thought me to bebut he did not seek to break his marriage vows he did not even hint that he longed for such a thing i provided him with something else but even i was never certain what perhaps i did not wish to know pearson was but one man among many more than a dozen that i knew of whom duer deceived to ruin though none of them knew it yet some of these men each believed himself to be duers closest friend in the world each had no idea that within weeks he would be revealed to be worth nothing his money sunk into duers colossal dreams duer would talk around these things never addressing them directly i would listen and i would assuage his guilt by telling him of his greatness and his ambition how what washington was on the battlefield duer was on the trading floor had washington won liberty without sacrificing some of his beloved soldiers of course not when men play at grand strategy i told him they can weep for the pawns they sacrifice but they must sacrifice them still your vision of grandeur is too great for small men i told him one day in any glorious enterprise in any historic rise to power there must be men who suffer for the greater good if you are to show this country this world your vision of what financial greatness can be are you to stop because some lesser men might get hurt perhaps on the surface such a sacrifice might seem noble but if you are truly willing to turn away from your destiny because it makes you a little uneasy it is cowardly and selfishand i know you are not those things he nodded you are very wise and once you have achieved your final victory you can be generous to those who were hurt because they were foolish enough to lie down where you needed to step it is true he said i can make amends later i felt nothing but contempt for him as he planned to help later those he harmed now but i could also not help but wonder if i was any better than he after all was i not willing to let cynthia pearson suffer now and help her at some future date in the meantime duer might have struggled with his feelings of guilt but he also laughed at men like pearson men who were ruined and did not know it yet duer was ruined too and he did not know it either he owned more and more six percent issues but he had borrowed far more than their value and he continued to borrow he borrowed from the banks and when they would give him no more he borrowed from the moneylenders when they would give him no more he turned to the poor and the desperate its really quite marvelous he said i cannot gain control of the six percents or the banks without ready money so where is it to come from why now i borrow from little peopletradesmen and shopkeepers and cart men a few dollars here and there for a promise of absurd interest payments i shall never make good but that is no matter once i have the banks there will be no one to hold me to account they may complain about their interest but it is of no matter and i am not a bad man you know i shall give them back what they lent me but no more than that i think this was too much it was one thing to cheat speculators men who knew they must go into trade with their eyes open if they were too foolish to see for themselves what duer did they had no one but themselves to blame they must be devoured by the beast they hoped to ride but now for him to turn his sights on the laboring poor to squeeze their pennies out of them so he could keep his operations afloat it was too much there must be some alternative i said oh dont you worry he said i have thought it through carefully when you own the economy the workingmen and women of the city cannot be hobbled with debt they will be a drag upon everything you worry too much my dear he said and you are all goodness which i love but you must trust me on this the poor shall not miss their pennies and there are always more where their first came from they must work a little harder is all i smiled at him to show him my approbation at what point i wondered does silence become complicity at what point must the enemy of evil take responsibility for the harm done in the fight against evil i did not know and i dared not think of it i would only think of poor ethan saunders whom i had turned into my puppet he would act as i wished never knowing it was i who wished it and he would make certain that duer failed i t was during this trip to new york that mr pearson himself came to visit us while we sat in the parlor of my boardinghouse i do not think he knew i was with duer when he arrived and he seemed surprised perhaps even disappointed to see him in pearsons mind he could trust me entirely but duer was always an object of suspicionas he should have been duer after all was an untrustworthy man i think my landlady must not have told pearson i had company for he strode into the room manfully but on seeing duer begin to rise his body slackened if i had not been watching him closely measuring any sign of dispositionfor it was now how i watched everyonei might not have seen it but there it was the corners of his mouth twisted his shoulders drooped his arms dropped slightly and he bent just a little at the knees he and duer greeted one anotherpearsons enormous hand circling duers tiny onebut his eyes were upon me there was something pleading there but i could not tell what he wished from me at first i believed he wanted me to dismiss duer but i soon decided it must be something else i think even he himself could not have said what he wanted but he somehow believed i would be able to provide it what brings you to new york asked duer pearson was to his core a philadelphia man and i certainly had not known him to travel to other cities more to the point i believed duer considered me when we were in new york his exclusively he did not like to share me and he would have resented doing so with someone so beneath him as pearsona man ruined in everything but his understanding of his ruin the men returned to their seats and pearson brushed at his breeches it seemed to be a nervous compulsion rather than a response to any dirt from the streets i am having difficulties in philadelphia i spoke to take charge of the conversation for him to make him believe i was attempting to mind his interests what has happened sir is something wrong ill tell you whats wrong he snapped though not at me he was looking directly at duer i have sold off nearly everything i own i have done everything you asked me to do and i am nearly a hundred thousand dollars in debt all i have to my name are these blasted four percent securities and they lose value every day i would have suspected something ill on your part long ago had there not been others buying them up but this might have been only some other fools following your lead they are worthless i might as well use them to kindle my fires for all they are worth and the men i speak tothey say they will never again rise in valuethat they long ago reached an unrealistic peak duer smiled jack weve talked about this the four percents are nothing you must regard them as nothing your debt is nothing it shall be paid back it must be paid back now duer you promised me that if i did as you asked you would cover my losses ive sold my properties ive borrowed money from the bank of the united states and all will be made easy said duer but you know we must wait pearson rose to his feet there is no we duer it is i who wait i rose too and put a hand upon pearsons wrist i know a man such as you who honors his name in the world of business must hate to owe what you cannot pay but you understand that the money is spoken for mr duer intends to use it to gain control of the million bank once that bank is launched he shall take the bank of the united states it is hard but you must be patient he bit his lip like a child and shook his head but he sat again allowing me to do the same it is not about patience he said my creditors are after me ive left philadelphia because philadelphia is too hot duer laughed that is nothing he said send a list of these creditors to my man whippo i shall dispatch notes upon the next express explaining that i vouch for you and give my word that you shall make good within the quarter no one will trouble you it was true enough a note like that from william duer was almost specie itself one more set of debts that would ruin him that answers well enough for the baker and the grocer and the tailor said pearson i dont think it shall satisfy hamilton you owe hamilton money duer asked not hamilton the man snapped pearson i owe the bank you urged me to take out a loan and i dont even know where that money has gone your honey tongue did its magic and now it is all gone but hamilton has sent his spy around on behalf of the bank loan it seems the bank is restricting credit calling in loans and as i never respond to any of the letters theyve put a man upon me that saunders fellow i asked he shook his head no hamilton has a new spy a little jewish man called lavien and he is the very devil he has the tenacity of a terrier one day he waited in my parlor for six hours hoping to see me my servants tell me he was as impassive as an indian brave there is something in his eyes i met him once and i felt as though i were speaking to a man who had visited hell itself and spat out its fires with contempt duer attempted a dismissive smile tell my man whippo your creditors names and what of hamilton s man i asked i did it on behalf of pearson so he would think me his ally but also because i wished to know i could not have hamilton and this new spy of his put a stop to things before the final blow was struck im sure it is nothing said duer you may ignore it i think i said it might be better if you were to limit your time in philadelphia until the million bank launch i had hoped to go to a gathering at the bingham house next week by all means go i said but do not linger go and stay for a day or two if you must but do not remain too long not until after the launch then everything will be made easy pearson left the room and i walked duer to the door to put him at ease i saw now how things must be i could not save cynthia pearson entirely i did not know if i could save her house and the great wealth she had long enjoyed but i would save her from total destruction once duer was out the door i turned to find pearson in the foyer his arms stretched behind him while one of the serving girls helped him on with his coat he dusted it off once it was upon him and turned to me i dont know how you can trust that man he is the devil hes not i said softly he is brilliant but perhaps not as effective at explaining himself as he might be i could not have told a bigger lie of course duer was a fool but quite good at getting people to do what he wished that had ever been his secret he understood no more about finance than anyone else and less than many you do know i am fond of you do you not i asked him my tone was sweet but not flirtatious i hated myself for even the suggestion that i would seek to harm cynthia in this way but i could not have pearson abandon the schemenot now if he left others might follow and then duer would fall far too soon perhaps pearson need not ruin himself with the million bank launch i might find a waysaunders perhapsto make certain he did not lose the last of his wealth there but for now i needed him to remain steadfast he seemed stunned by my question he took a step forward and held my hand why mrs maycott of course i do i hated his vile touch his oversized hands hardly seemed to belong to a human body and yet i smiled i know duer better than almost anyone i think do you not agree he continued holding my hand but we had moved from the amorous to the financial and he perhaps forgot he still touched me it does seem that way he parses out information a little at a time i shall tell you what he will not do not sell your four percents mr pearson no matter how low the value falls no matter how much you lose on them do not sell them they will come back i swear to you they will come back and if you will hold on your patience will be rewarded and you will not only not be the loser for your efforts you will profit duer tells no one this because he does not wish anyone to act upon it but you have the right to know he enveloped my other hand in his meaty paw i know not how to thank you madam not only for the kindness of putting my anxieties to rest but for showing me i have not been a fool i pulled away i hope not too abruptly it is our secret i said i wished him gone and breathed with relief when he left the house though the relief was illusory i had taken a chance i had risked my position the wealth of my band of whiskey rebels and even the scheme itself for if duer suspected even for a moment that i was anything other than a clever admirer i should be out and once out i would be powerless yet i had no choice i had reluctantly turned a blind eye while duer ruined one speculator after another even when he sent his men out to the street to ruin tailors and fishmongers but i would not let him ruin a wife and mother who had befriended me i would not do it and i could only hope iand my friendswould not suffer for my loyalty b ack in philadelphia a general discontent fell over the house at elfreths alley when i returned after my first new york visit of the year i found dalton out but richmond and skye home clearly angry with one another you are spending too much time with duer richmond said to me i sat in our narrow gathering room on the ground floor there was a small sofa and several chairs skye had brought me tea which i sipped but neither of them would join me skye sat across the room watching richmond as he paced like a caged tiger at a county fair have you forgotten why we came here i said duer and hamilton stole from us the money owed us and lied to us that we might trade it for misery and deprivation in the west then once we turned that misery into success they took it away againtheir theft disguised as a tax levied upon those with no money i spend time with duer not because i delight in his vile company but because i want to destroy him and save the nation from hamilton fine goals those said skye and i rejoice in them but theres more too let us not forget we get not only revenge from this but compensation too our joan has already more than tripled our holdings at what cost richmond said she cleaves so close to duer i doubt she herself knows whose side shes on tell me joan do you care more for the country and for justice after this tripling of holdings did i not know better i would have thought richmond had become jealous but that was not it at all he had always been cynical had always been opposed to any project other than licking our wounds and finding the best possible hole in which to hide ourselves he accused me of the worst because he feared the worst skye rose to his feet youll apologize he said please sit john i said softly i turned to richmond you grow tired of doing nothing i know the time for action will come and if it does not theres no helping it but one way or another it will be over soon enough it will be over by march or april i promise we will have revenge the whiskey tax will be repealed hamilton and duer will be destroyed then we may go our separate ways if that is what you wish but we will have money with which to do it i know it is hard to be patient but you must persevere there is no other choice when a mans blood is up there is nothing quite so infuriating as good solid reason richmond grabbed his coat and left the house at once after a moment of silence skye walked over to me took away my cup of tea and left the room he came back in a moment with a bottle of wine and two glasses he set them on the table poured two glasses and sat directly across from me youve got to give richmond something to do he said he will go mad and he will drive me mad hes always been more beast than man not in the brutal way we often use the term but he is meant for doing and action for being outdoors and finding his own food sitting about in a house all day attempting to draw no attention to himself is no life for him we may need him yet i said though i pray god no if things come to a crisis well be glad of him and hell be glad to be of use it cannot be helped that he is too uneasy to wait quietly for that moment you seem to have no complaints john they also serve who only stand and wait he quoted and cook dinner and clean the house he attempted a smile i sipped my wine and closed my eyes behind me the fire burned i loved the feel of the heat on my neck i had been in a carriage all the day before and now to be upon a comfortable sofa with a glass of wine seemed the height of luxury i was able to enjoy my peace only a moment however before the door flew open hard and loud i leaped up knowing not what to expect but fearing either we had been discovered by duer for what we were or that richmond was back somehow more angry than before the door was now open the wind stirred up the fire sending it into a rage and snow blew into the front room dalton stood in the doorway looking massive and vibrant a huge grin broke out under his red mustaches i was hoping youd be back girl weve got some good things brewing what is it skye walked toward dalton for no other reason i believed than because it gave him something to do something unrelated to his awkward conversation with me its that saunders fellow he said hes hooked for certain now what do you mean i demanded you know that pearsons fled town recollecting himself he shut the door and then walked over to the calming fire to warm his hands i saw him in new york i said hes hiding from creditors dalton nodded his wife suspects something she sent a note to saunders i felt something spring to life inside me what sort of note now how would i know the answer to that he asked get it i said go to his boardinghouse and if he isnt home yet get it pay the landlady what you must to give it to you and keep her mouth shut promise her more each week she helps us shell not betray us if she thinks theres more money to be had why do you want to delay him skye asked hell find out in the end thats precisely why to dalton i said when you pay the landlady give your name as reynolds make sure she hears the name and knows it when saunders finds out as he must he will begin to look to duer dalton sighed i hope you know what youre doing joan if saunders stops duer too soon its all for nothing we need to make sure we can hobble duer when we need to so well set saunders to sniffing around but after the wrong things it will make duer uneasy and more eager to trust me we had been thinking of using saunders only to keep duer from growing too powerful too quickly but now i see he can be much more than that through saunders we can manipulate hamilton we can make certain he learns nothing before we are ready and everything when we wish it the two men left and i was alone in the house suddenly feeling content and at ease i could not say why precisely but i felt certain that all was now in hand or soon would be ethan saunders i was on my own so be it i have worked alone in the past and i would do so again alone i would prevent william duer from taking control of the million bank i would have to remove from the game six men in the space of one morning and to do that i would need to learn who they were where they lived and the nature of their personal arrangements it would be difficult but eminently possible i began to go through freneaus papers anew freneau had taken detailed and useful notes regarding duers scheme with the million bank it was not clear to me why freneau had not yet revealed his discovery to the public and i could only conclude that rather than save the nation from a dangerous financial collapse he would much prefer to see that collapse transpire with hamilton humiliated freneau would then be in a position to explain it fortunately however i was in a position to prevent that collapse from taking place the key lay in duers agents and i studied freneaus papers to learn what i could of them including their names and where they lived i gleaned a little more from a few of the lettersthis one was unmarried and lived alone that one had a wife and two children they were small details but they might make all the difference time not passed in discovering the details of duers agents i spent in the merchants coffeehouse where the air trembled with expectationin part i own through my own machinations for i never failed when given the opportunity to whisper that the million bank launch was imminent and that william duer himself thought it the best investment of the season though cooler heads still regarded the new bank as a foolish venture destined for failure there were a number of traderssome of them clearly new to the world of speculationbeing drawn into a bancomania at each turn i congratulated myself that i did so well on my own id had leonidas with me almost the entire span of my disgrace and had regarded him as indispensable i was not quite prepared to say i was better off without him but i did well enough i was lonely yes and i hated truly hated that i had no one with whom to share my thoughts but i managed duer did not show himself at merchants and i saw no sign of reynolds or pearson but whippo did his job as he moved from table to table predicting gloom for the million bank and attemptingunsuccessfully i thoughtto undo the damage i did by speaking constantly of duers enthusiasm it was not the only time i saw whippo i was down by the docks returning to my room after researching the address of one of duers men when i observed him from a fair distance speaking in animated terms to a grocer i watched while the grocer shook his head whippo spoke some more and the grocer shook his head once more whippos color rose he waved his hand excitedly as he spoke this time the grocer nodded and then grinned the way a man does when he achieves some small victory over a social superior he disappeared into his shop and returned a moment later with a purse which he gave to whippo in return whippo handed the grocer several small pieces of paper they shook hands and whippo wandered off i then approached the grocer and introduced myself rather vaguely but inquired immediately of his business with whippo what the grocer asked you want a bit for yourself a bit of what the loans that fellows master duer is borrowing at six percent it is a fair rate but nothing to get overly excited about i said six percent per week the very notion was absurdit was as though duer was giving money awayand i could not think what it meant i left the grocer immediately and headed toward fraunces tavern but my path was blocked there before me was the cadaverous form of isaac whippo he stood with legs apart his sunken chest thrust outward and his head back he glared at me as though he had some hope of intimidating me and perhaps this time he did for my good mr whippo was not alone by his side stood a roughlooking fellow broad in the shoulder uncouth in manner it was james reynolds who looked at me with a very unsavory expression what pit of vomit have you crawled from whippo inquired why good afternoon to you too my friend i answered your eyes are looking particularly hollow today how do you accomplish that i notice you dont insult this gentleman he said gesturing at reynolds i would not insult a man with so beautiful a wife it cannot be easy to have convinced such a gem to marry a man of your stripe shes a slut said reynolds well i said brightly that is good news enough banter saunders why are you following us i was not following you i said i merely happened to see you and thought id ask that grocer about your personal and private business you dont object do you i advise you to stay out of my affairs he said lest i ask reynolds to keep you away if he asks it is something im paid to do said reynolds i think you may depend upon it that is what i think do you know what i think i asked i think it is a bad policy to lend at six percent a week unless of course ones aim is to lose everything you might wish to pass that along to mr duer stay away from us and mr duer whippo said or ill ruin you too late for i come already ruined then reynolds will break you reynolds snarled at me showing a mouth of yellow teeth no doubt feeling that their threats eliminated all possible retorts they began to walk off im also broken i called after them but they did not turn around so busy were they in seeking out tradesmen to whom to offer their lucrative interest rates i t was the evening before the million bank launch it was early yet perhaps half past four but already dark i had work to do but not yet and the sound thing would have been to retire to my room to sleep until the small hours of the morning and yet i knew sleep would not be possible the entire city was stretched taut with anticipation waiting to see what would happen half the city predicted the million bank would be a disaster the other half a wealthgenerating engine i did not know or care which so long as the bank fulfilled its destiny without being controlled by duer too anxious to remain still i decided to take a stroll about the city for an hour or two in the hopes i would become relaxed enough to sleep perhaps i had grown too arrogant but i dont think so rather i think it safe to say i misunderstood the malice of those against whom i had set myself i walked north in the direction of the pleasure gardens and considered briefly taking a turn inside though it was early in the evening and cold which meant there would be little to distract me yet i looked at the gates as i passed with their graceful stone arching and inviting vaguely lurid statues of women something wanton in their eyes i was i suppose too distracted for i did not notice that of the conveyances upon the street onea covered cartkept near pace with me cleverly it stayed behind me where i was least likely to notice it though notice it i did at last when it pulled even with me and i caught a glimpse of the driver first i observed that he was better dressed than the drivers of such cartshe wore the spotless gray coat of a gentlemanand though he kept his face carefully pointed away from mine there was something familiar about him i quickened my pace for a better look he turned away so i could see only the back of his head but i observed his hands on the reinsmassive bestial handsand so it was i knew him it was jacob pearson driving the cart alongside me i stopped and stiffened needing a moments immobility to attempt to understand what this meant and what i must do then being able to reach no immediate decision i decided i would apprehend him now and once done i would decide what to do with him i tensed to spring forward when all went dark a heavy leather bag had been thrust over my head a pair of powerful hands gripped my arms just below my elbows and pressed them to my sides so hard they were pinned there at once i smelled tobacco and sweat and sour clothes whoever had me was not only unclean but strong far stronger than i and though i did not wish to submit i was not going to extricate myself from this encounter with violence it had all happened quicklyit would have to be quick if they were to avoid attracting the attention of others on the street the man who pinned my arms to my side thrust me forward and into the back of the cart throwing me down on the rough floor it smelled of hay and manure human beings were not the usual beasts conveyed in the vehicle though that told me nothing whoever had me might easily have hired the cart from a farmer for the afternoon the man who had me released one arm for an instant grabbed my hair and knocked my head against the floor he did this hard but not brutally so the impact hurt and i felt a wave of nausea and dizziness it soon passed however and when it did even under the leather hood i understood a few things i understood that my assailant had pulled the heavy tarpaulin cover over us both encasing us in smothering darkness i understood that he acted alone and that he alone must concern himself with me while pearson drove the cart for otherwise he would not have needed to knock my head in order to buy a few seconds to cover us up in the flat of the cart he now straddled me placing his full weight upon the small of my back while he held my arms flat by the wrists he said nothing so i learned nothing of him that way but among his many unpleasant odorsand i thought it significanti did not detect whiskey like the irishman from outside the statehouse so that was the third thing i understood whoever had me pinned to the bottom of this cart was the same man who had attacked me at my home in philadelphia and had been shot at by mrs deisher good evening i attempted to alter my voice my words were hard even for me to hear lost in the leather hood and the tarpaulin and the rumble of the wheels upon the road my name is mr henry rufus and i cannot help but think you have taken me by mistake shut up saunders he answered im not an idiot i knew that voice i could almost place it but the noise of the road and the muffling made it impossible for me to put the sound with its owner look what is it you want with me quiet yourself he said again ill not speak with you theres no point and youve a devils tongue pearson will tell you when hes ready when hes ready turned out to be perhaps an hour later we drove for some time and i could detect little except that the sounds from our surroundings grew fainter and less frequent we drove someplace unpopulatedneither surprising nor comforting at last the cart stopped we remained motionless for a moment and i listened to my own breath in the hood and my assailants heavy breath over me and beyond that something else the lapping of water against the shore next i heard a rapping like a cane against wood it struck four times no doubt a signal and the man atop me eased up the weight upon me he raised the tarpaulin letting in a refreshing wave of cool air next he grabbed me by one arm now less concerned that i might attempt to run away i knew not where i was so how could i run he pulled me from the cart and onto the ground where my other arm was gripped hard by a second man mr pearson i imagine i said i am so very flattered that you would trouble yourself to call upon me but i must inform you that we would be much more comfortable at my inn than here i have a most agreeable line of credit at least with the wine he said nothing perhaps he wished to torment me but i dont think so i believe he was afraid i believe he knew it was dangerous to engage in conversation with me and would not risk it i made several further attempts but he said nothing we walked first upon grass and then upon soft dirt wet dirt i believed then we walked briefly along a stone path they led me next down a set of slick stairs more clearly now i heard the sound and smelled the tang of a river waters both clean and stagnant the scent of dead fish washed ashore the air was cool and wet and soon i was walking in the mud at last one of the men pushed me forward and there were subtle differencesa shift in the darkness the disappearance of the windthat led me to believe i was now in an enclosed space a room of some kind except the earth beneath us was still wet and i could hear the river just as distinctly the stronger of the two menthat is not pearsonpushed me to my knees and held me down pearson then began to bind my arms behind me with heavy rope next he bound my feet together at the ankles i felt him fumbling with the ropes and though he pulled hard to make certain his knots were tight i knew he was inexperienced in these arts once this operation was complete they pulled me to my feet once more with a sharp tug the hood was yanked from my head and i stood in neartotal dark only inches from my face i observed the malicious grin of pearson by his side also grinning but in the easy simple way of dogs was reynolds so this is all duers bidding i said and you pearson are but one of his puppets i work for duer said reynolds but i am willing to serve other men when time allows at the moment i work for mr pearson and the evening my landlady chased you away from her house were you in mr pearsons service then too aye he said my eyes having had a moment to adjust i now looked around me all was still in darkness but in shades of gray i determined a few things none of them encouraging the earth was wet mud and it caked my stockings and breeches from when id knelt all around me were the iron bars of a prison though this cell was very small not four feet in length or width wide enough for a man to sit but never lie down it was perhaps seven feet in height and there was a single iron door that opened along a square stone slab the cage rested only inches from the river and above us was blackness i smelled the decay of old wood perhaps we were under a disused pier pearson saw my appraising glances and chose to answer my unspoken questions its an old dock used by the british during the occupation but it was damaged in the war and has never been repaired a friend of mine a british colonel told me of this cage and i wondered if it might someday become useful a friend of yours i said a british colonel how shocking you may make all the quips you like but i have you and may do with you what i wish and what do you wish i asked why go to all this trouble tomorrow he said the million bank launches duer wishes me to invest heavily to deploy my own agents to buy as much as we can keeping the share within the circle of his acquaintance i know he has tried to dissuade investment in the launch but you have been singing its praises i wish to know why and what you have in mind what i have in mind i said is making certain duer does not gain control of the bank listen to me pearson keep your money out of the million bank youll lose everything that bank will fail in a matter of months duer doesnt think so duer doesnt care i said the million bank can be destroyed in half a year and it wont matter to him all he cares about is controlling the bank for now using the credit such action will grant him to gain control of the market for six percents and later the bank of the united states but you didnt know that did you he convinced you to use your own money in lowering the price of six percents so he could buy them cheaply he convinced you to buy four percents to raise the value so others would come flocking to sell their six percents in order to buy four percents but now the four percents are worthless dont lose even more in the million bank he paused just long enough for me to see that my words disquieted him and why should i believe you why should i take your advice on any of these matters for the sake of your wife i said the only reason she has not fled from you is because a woman and two children enduring poverty exposes herself to more dangers and abuse even than living with you i could not endure to see her living in poverty and with you he did his best to appear untroubled well we shall see i will wait a hour or so after the launch before deciding what to do and then based on what i have learned i will come back and see if you have perhaps been withholding important information from me here reynolds took a step forward if i may mr pearson he said it is my experience that it is always a poor decision to leave an enemy aliveparticularly a sly one like saunders here now i dont have nothing against him he lives or he dies it dont signify one way or the other to me if im paid to hurt him or kill him thats what i do but leaving him here its just foolishness if he escapes hes going to make your life very difficult mine too likely likely i agreed i hate to agree with him in a matter so detrimental to my wellbeing but reynolds is right its bad policy to leave me alive pearson spat upon the earth ill not be goaded into giving him what he wants youre mad if you think what saunders wants is death reynolds pointed out he is playing a game with you he is attempting to convince you to leave him be dont give him what he wants what he wants is to keep something from me and if he believes it will aid my wife i have no doubt he is foolish enough to prefer to die than speak the truth all these soldiers with their romantic notions they all want death but he shant get it without telling me everything first he turned to me this little jail makes for an excellent means of revealing the truth my friend the british colonel told me of its operation this door as you shall see is far too heavy for any one man to open and close though we shall lock it all the same you will be bound within unable to move your arms or legs you will be cold and hungry and thirsty and when the tide comes in you will suffer tremendously the water will not drown you but come up to your waist perhaps very unpleasant in january i should think you will have no means to relieve yourself but in your breeches when i return in a day or perhaps two i will find you desperate demoralized and pliable dont leave me here i said kill me now or you will regret it listen to him reynolds said i do listen to him pearson said he tells me he knows something he wishes for me never to learn i will find out what it is i will let the cold and the river and his own misery extract it from him finish with the rope with my ankles tied together and my wrists bound behind my back i was already in a poor state but now reynolds placed a small ball of clothfortunately not too dirtyin my mouth and held it in place with a strip of the same cloth tied around my head i have never loved being gagged for it is a most dreadful feeling and the idea that i would remain that way for a day or two was unbearable i watched as pearson and reynolds left the little cage and together pushed hard against the door it did indeed seem to take all their energy to get the heavy door to move they leaned into it their backs bent and pushing from their legs managed finally to put the door into place breathing heavily from his exertions reynolds now took a metal chain and wrapped it through cage and door securing it with a lock it seemed a needless precaution but i supposed they wished to make certain that even should i be discovered i could not be easily rescued pearson gazed at me from the other side of the cage your easy manner suggests you think yourself in possession of some secret but you will not escape this prison no one ever has not one do you believe you can accomplish what all who came before you could not you have no secret advantage and you shall no more escape than did the others i shrugged to show that i did not much mind or perhaps that i conceded his point without truly believing it the two men stepped into the night and though i thought it would be pearson who turned around to gaze at me he did not instead it was reynolds who briefly stopped and stared in the dark i could understand neither his expression nor his meaning if he meant to convey one only that he looked for a moment and then walked on leaving me alone and cold and bound w hat a terrible situation if only there were a clock visible so i could time myself to see how quickly i managed to extricate myself how much better would i be able to recount the story later yes i faced my challenges with a certain confidence but then i had many advantages which perhaps mr pearson did not trouble himself to consider first i had been captured many times during the war and had each time escaped when i chose second he had never before most likely captured a prisoner let alone one with my record for escape third i did not believe the universe was ordered such that he could triumph over me so entirely thus once i was certain they had left me alone and my actions would go unobserved i began the first step was to place my hands before me and this was easily accomplished though by no means as easily as it had been ten or fifteen years ago when i was younger and more flexible i sat upon the earth and slowly with some discomfort put the loop of my arms under my bottom i then folded my legs and straining considerably at the shoulders pushed my arms up i felt an unpleasant popping and for a moment feared i had dislocated something which would have answered my arrogance nicely but it was merely the straining of underused joints i gave one last push and my hands were now in front when taking a prisoner if you wish to be certain he does not escape i highly recommend tying the thumbs for they are invaluable in freeing oneself from ropes in addition when binding the ropes be certain that the wrists are as close together as can be managed if the prisoner is clever he will keep his wrists as separated as he can contrive without drawing attention to this fact this i had done so when i began to work at the ropes they were already quite loose and pliable it would have been far easier had i not been gagged for i might have used my teeth but i had slack enough to angle my right wrist toward my body and use my thumb and index finger upon the left wrist my task was not to untie the rope for the knot was well constructed and i could not easily do so rather i pulled at it expanding the slack as much as i might i then gripped it hard and pulled upward with my right wrist backward with my left the rope burned into my flesh but soon it was just below the knuckles the widest portion of the hand experience had taught me that even the tightest of ropes might then be moved piecemeal if not all at once but in this case one great shove answered the business and the rope came free using my free hands i now immediately untied the gag about my mouth and then slid the remaining rope off my wrist the ankles were no more difficult and only required that i remove my boots to be free of that burden now before i replaced the boots i removed from within them my useful little picks and began to work at the lock upon the iron door this was no challenge and the darkness no impediment since the picking of locks is done by feel and sound in a moment i heard a click and the lock fell away i was pleased with myself and with good reason but i still had one great object before me the door i placed the lock picks back in my boot and attempted to push the door open it did not move i thrust my shoulder into it and the door reverberated wildly but did not move i lay down upon my back and attempted to push it with my feet but again nothing pearson had said it required two men at a minimum to move it and that appeared to be the case i took a moment to consider my circumstances all of course was not lost in the morning i would have a better sense of my surroundings i might hear others walking nearby and call to them i might if necessary replace the lock and pretend to be bound when pearson and reynolds returned provided i could convince them to open the door i would then have the advantage of surprise these were options but they were not agreeable options because more than simply wishing for freedom i wished for immediate freedom i had work to do and if i were not free duer might well succeed in taking for his own the million bank should he do that he would at worst take possession of the bank of the united states at best produce a financial panic i needed to get out of this cage and yet i could think of no means of doing it without the help of at least one other person gone were the days when i might hope for the sudden and fortuitous arrival of leonidas i sat upon the earth thinking i should enjoy sitting before the cage began to flood i considered everything certain i had not neglected some path to freedom but forcing myself to turn everything over again and again it was all i thought of and it was what i was thinking of when i saw three figures emerging from the dark one was tall and broad one quite smalla woman i thoughtand it was not until they were only feet away did i recognize them as reynolds the irishman from the statehouse and mrs joan maycott joan maycott january it was early evening having already eaten my dinner i was in my room alone reading quietly and sipping at a glass of watered wine when my landlady knocked at the door i had a visitor below but he was of the sort she could not admit to her house lest she receive complaints from the other tenants i immediately apologized that she should be troubled by such a person and descended the stairs i remained calm in my demeanor though in truth i was very anxious for i feared my visitor might be one of the whiskey boys having encountered some trouble dire enough to risk visiting me in my home i knew not if i should be relieved or dismayed to find mr reynolds on my stoop leaning against the stone rail and spitting tobacco juice into the street he looked at me grinned and took off his hat a moment of your time mrs maycott i cannot imagine it would be anything but a moment wasted no need to be so harsh to a man come maybe to help you he said maybe i dont know but i got a feeling i might youve seen enough of me i think to know im loyal to no one and nothing if it pays thats all i care for so heres a chance for me to make some money if i know you right know me right about what about captain saunders he stands against mr duer and so do you you misunderstand me if you think im not mr duers friend and you misunderstand me if you think i trouble myself one way or tother i work for duer true but he aint no friend of mine and you forget what i know already so do you want to help saunders or do you want to leave him where he is where is he where he cant get out reynolds said and at pearsons mercy which aint a great place for him are you telling me hes somehow been abducted not somehow i helped capture him and now im willing to help you set him free if you want to pay for what i know you were paid by pearson to abduct him and now you wish to be paid to free him clever aint it i would not comment on that point where is he cant tell you that i had perhaps erred in making saunders so vital to my plans for things with him were coming undone rapidly i had only just received word from his slave that he had been forced to break with saunders it appeared that saunders had freed leonidas without bothering to tell him and leonidas believed that he could no longer stay by saunderss side his logic was that if he did not respond with appropriate resentment saunders would begin to grow suspicious it was perhaps true but hardly convenient leonidas had assured me their rupture would in no way interfere with saunderss ability to thwart duer his capture by pearson however was another matter if saunders was tucked away in some basement or garret somewhere he would not be able to act against duer in the morning and nothing right now was more important than keeping duer from taking control of the million bank if he had the banks credit at his disposal he could conceivably be too powerful to be stopped and we would not only have failed we would have aided our enemy in achieving a wealth and power never before conceived of it would not stand how much i asked twenty dollars agreed too quickly agreed in my opinion fifty dollars i dont like you very much mr reynolds he shrugged nobody seems to but in the end they pay me r eynolds informed me that i would need the help of another man in retrieving saunders so we stopped by daltons boardinghouse and he joined our little party next reynolds led us north to a deserted pier one abused and abandoned by the british during the war underneath it we found a diabolical little cage and therein was captain saunders sitting against the far wall his arms folded a chain and picked lock lay at the door a scattering of abandoned ropes lay strewn in the sand i told pearson it was a mistake to leave saunders unattended look at him im still imprisoned he observed his tone dry not for long eh reynolds said ive brung these folks to offer up their services in freeing you saunders looked at us but did not move freeing me and not let us say killing me which i should very much object to i could hardly be surprised at his suspicion and had he known to what extent i hoped to manipulate him i could not doubt his anger even so it pained mesurprisinglythat he should be so suspicious hardly captain i have told you before that i believe we both stand for the same things what about him he gestured with his chin toward dalton he abused me and threatened me outside the statehouse he told me a sharpshooter would murder me if i did not act as he wished theres no point in holding a grudge lad dalton said perhaps this rescue will even things for us mr dalton did not yet know you to be an honorable man i had anticipated certain concerns on captain saunderss part and id troubled myself to construct some plausible stories during the journey here we believed you one of duers men at the time only later did we understand our error come lets get you out of there and i shall tell you everything on the way back to your room mr dalton and reynolds both planted their feet firmly in the earth and grabbed hold of the bars of the door captain saunders bent over gripped hold of two bars slightly beneath their positions and pushed the door moved slowly but steadily and in a few seconds was open wide enough for the captain to slip out with relative ease as we walked to the carriage he maintained a silent if agreeable demeanor as though there were nothing unusual in our little outing but i watched his eyes even in the dark he it was plain that he scanned each of us slowly and carefully taking full measure of our moves weighing our intents i dont know that i would have made an effort to manipulate him had i understood him to be quite so vigilant quite so clever when we reached our transport i asked him if he would not object to ride alone with me in the carriage and when he assented i sent reynolds and dalton up to ride with the coachman dalton would understand and reynolds was being well paid for his discomfort once we were seated he turned to me reynolds works for duer for pearson and for you reynolds will work for who will pay him he took money from pearson to imprison you and then came immediately to me because he believed i would pay for your release perhaps it is time you told me why you cared to pay for my release i thought we were friends i said it is no more than i would do for any friend please mrs maycott do not attempt to manipulate me how do you know the big irishman dalton you called him i know him from the west and i am proud to call him my friend as well he and i are patriots captain just as i believe you do we stand against duer who is a vile man whose ambitions will undo the country if he is not checked he has already stolen from the nation is he now to be allowed to bankrupt it stolen what do you mean i had held on to this little bit of knowledge but now seemed a good time to use it save something too long and it becomes worthless if despite all that had happened to him saunders was still to attempt to thwart duer tomorrow i would need to use everything i could muster before the ratification of the constitution duer served as director on what was then called the board of treasury it was a powerful position and he was a trusted man yet he abused that trust he procured for himself which he has never returned saunders said nothing for a moment you have proof it can be proved i said though i can offer you no documentary evidence i doubt not that hamilton could prove it had he the will but of course he is duers lapdog i knew that saunders disagreed and my accusation irritated him but he was careful not to let himself be distracted why did daltonand i presume youwish to keep me from searching for pearson because of mrs pearson i answered duers men were threatening her to keep her quiet duer wanted pearsons money invested in his schemes and he feared that if pearson was apprehended by treasury men he would be forced to repay his loan rather than lose more money in duers projects i could not risk harm to mrs pearson these were more lies but i could not tell him the truth that we had all along manipulated him hooked him like a fish and pulled him where we liked many ladies care for their friends he said but few employ giant irishmen and secret sharpshooters to aid them in their efforts then they have never lived on the border i answered i dont know that my answer satisfied him but it silenced him long enough that i was made to explain no more before arriving at fraunces tavern you are a mysterious woman mrs maycott he said i am not a fool and i know you will not tell me what you wish to keep secret but i must beg you to be more open with me you say you are my friend and we stand together yet you tell me little or nothing you have saved me from at the least an unpleasant day or two in that cold cage and quite possibly from an even more terrible fate i am grateful as you must know but i am not content the time has not come for you to know more i said but soon and so he departed if he recollected that i had promised to tell him everything in the carriage he did not hold me to it i believe i understood him well enough to know he did recall and chose not to attempt to hold me to a promise he knew i would never keep ethan saunders it was now half past nine i had lost several hours but no more than that my plans to thwart duer were as solid as ever and my hatred of pearson equally strong what could he do to me that would make me despise him more than i did for what hed done to his own wife as for mrs maycott her actions tonight her association with the whiskey irishman only confirmed that she was a more significant actor in these affairs than she would admit but for the moment at least she appeared to be an actor who favored my success and cynthias safety there was but one person in new york who could now answer my questions so after cleaning myself and concealing the bulk of my injuries i went to the home of senator aaron burr where his girl directed me to a local coffeehouse and there i found him holding court for a large group of political clientsor perhaps men to whom he was a client i hardly knew but i was quite gratified to see him gesture to me to take a seat and indicate that he would be with me when he could soon burr rose and came over to my table there were still men where hed sat but they seemed to have enough to say that they did not require his presence at the moment how may i help you captain it is rather important im afraid and i must keep it between the two of us i had hoped you might be able to tell me more about joan maycott i know little of her myself he said she appeared upon the scene less than a year ago she is a fashionable lady a wealthy woman and a widow she and her husband traded his soldiers debt for land out west where he made something of a success as a whiskey distiller but after he died she returned to the east if pressed she will speak against hamiltons whiskey tax on this account he shrugged to indicate he had no more to add when did she move to the west i dont know he said she mentioned to me once having lived in new york with her husband during the ratification of the constitution so it could not have been so long ago i thought about this for a moment how did her husband die she has never chosen to speak of it and a man is never inclined to inquire too deeply of a dead husband to a pretty widow there is no shortage of opportunities for a man out west to meet his death and yet his voice trailed off you have the impression that there is some bitterness there i proposed that she believes there was an injustice his eyes brightened that is exactly right he looked over his shoulder i see you must return i said thank you for your time he wrinkled his brow but i have told you nothing i shrugged and that seemed to be enough for him we rose and shook hands he pretended not to see how badly cut and scraped was my hand and went back to his men as he did so i thought about how interesting he was he could not be ignorant of my reputation of the things said about my past and yet he chose to attend to me in public he could not help but notice that hardly a day went by that i did not have some injury it seemed to me that burr was a man like myself one who enjoyed courting a little bit of scandal so long as it was only a little bit i hoped this tendency would not lead him into any great difficulties in the meantime though he thought he had told me little he had in reality explained a great deal mrs maycott and her husband would not have traded war debt for land had they not been needy and yet she returned from the west after only a few years a wealthy woman i did not think any amount of success as a whiskey distiller could have produced significant money in so short a span either she and her husband had in that time inherited a fortune or there was far more to her past than she was making public one thing seemed certain something terrible had happened to her husband out west and if he had traded his debt for land it seemed to me likely he had traded directly or indirectly with the largest and most energetic architect of these exchanges william duer i had hired a horse in advance so i had little to do but pass the time i dared not sleep lest i fail to awake in time i therefore waited impatiently until when the clock struck one and the rest of the world was abed i rode out to greenwich village and duers estate where i did some naughty things to make that speculators life uncomfortable and did them without being seen or heard i returned late nearly four in the morning there was no point in attempting more sleep i would have to begin in an hour or two at the most so i sat in my room drank a bottle of port and rehearsed over and over again what i must do perhaps i fell asleep for a quarter hour or so but when i heard the watchman call out four of the clock i roused myself splashed my face with cold water and set out to make my mark upon william duer the plan was simple i would visit duers agents one by one and then visit corres hotel usually a venue for music and now the place where the million bank was due to launch perhaps i would see duer there perhaps not i did not know which i hoped for if duer did not show perhaps pearson would not show either if pearson did appear he would see duers plan already in disarray and would refrain from investing all of which of course depended upon my doing what yet needed doing so thinking i headed out into the cold morning speculators are an early rising lot so it was not yet five when i visited the first of my agents mr james isser whose removal i believed would be done without difficulty he was a young man who lived in a busy boardinghouse on cedar street my observations indicated that many men came and went from the house with regularity particularly in the early morning hours so having secured a key from a chatty maid who did not mind the pockets of her skirt i was able to enter the premises and ascend the stairs to his rooms without notice i knocked upon his door and heard a faint scuffling from within a moment later the door opened a crack and there stood a small man a bit too fond perhaps of beef and beer for his young age his eyes were red and narrow and rather dull you look sleepy i said and shoved him hard in the chest he stumbled backward into his room so i stepped in closed and locked the door and punched the man in his soft stomach i did so not to be cruel but to keep him from crying out quickly i took a burlap sack from my jacket and slipped it over his head he started to cry out again and though i had no wish to hurt him i had my own difficulties to think of so i struck him once more in the stomach i did this in part with distaste for i am not a brutal man and later i knew i would regret hurting an innocent i always did but in the moment i only acted my advice i said my voice even and calm is that you not speak i grabbed his arms and tied them behind his back he hardly resisted not having any notion of who i was or what i wanted i believe it never quite occurred to him that he ought to fight me having immobilized and blinded him i now placed a gag in his mouth imposed over the sack mrs greenhills husband has sent me to you mr jukes it is a matter of revenge for it is a cruel thing cruel indeed to violate a mans bed with his wife he mumbled and grunted no doubt telling me that he knew no mrs greenhill and was not mr jukes i of course pretended i could not understand him you are to leave that married woman alone you rascal this shall be your last warning having finished my task i departed upon his inevitable discovery he would tell his tale and it would be perceived as a simple misunderstanding when all of duers agents suffered from such misunderstandings it would be clear that something more sinister had transpired but by then it would be too late i shant describe each encounter for i used the same technique four times with the four unmarried agents i had planned my course in advance so i could move with all deliberate speed from one to the next the remaining two agents were married men with children in their homes and i would not break open their houses and assault them where they lived to do so would be dangerous and unseemly instead i dealt with each according to his personality mr geoffrey amesbury liked to go by coach each day to his place of work this day he would take a coach to duers estate so it was no difficult thing to pay his regular coachman to fall ill and pay a substitute to take him to be robbed the thieves i hireda visit to the area of pecks slip was all that was required to find themwould take his money and his clothes and separate him from his coach but he was not to be harmed the final victim mr thomas hunt lived in a large house with his wife four children and an elderly mother so there could be no safe and easy way to detain him at home because i could not determine how he intended to get to mr duers house i was forced to deal with him somewhat more creatively mr hunt was in the prime of his manhood tall and well made with thick brown hair and the sort of face that women find pleasing it is not surprising that a man of his stripe had married a pretty lady and he was known to be dedicated to his wife but such was his regard for the gentle sex that his dedication was too large to be contained by a single woman no matter how worthy i suspected it must be so and a little idle coffeehouse gossip confirmed my suspicions thus it was i procured the service of a handsome woman from a local bawdy house when mr hunt left his home at eight in the morning he was approached by the lady i had hired she stopped him on the street and made some polite inquiries of direction and then once the conversation had begun asked if he were not thomas hunt the wellknown speculator who had been pointed out to her so often she spoke those words as though she regarded stock trading as only slightly less remarkable and heroic than minotaur slaying she had she said a large sum to invest and she knew not what to do with it and perhaps so great and successful a man as he could advise her on how best to order these troublesome dollars he told her he would be happy to advise her on the matter and would call upon her tomorrow or perhaps even later today but that this moment was for him bespoken alas she answered she was but in town for the day before she returned to boston and required an agent in new york immediately if he could spare just half an hour she would be eternally grateful he removed his watch and studied it with great anxiety but once he had taken the time to calculate his duties and responsibilities found he did have half an hour to give her though no more i watched from a safe distance as the lady led him to an empty house one for sale the use of which she had acquired for the day left to his own devices mr hunt would be occupied well past half an hour i had no doubt a man means to dally for but a short time but when he is with a willing lady the hands of the clock move at a most unreliable pace a quarter hour becomes two or three ones morning appointment is forgotten as noon comes and goes should these events come paired with a bottle or two of good claret then so much the better mr thomas hunt would not be available for duers service and he could blame no one but himself thus it was no great matter to procure a bucket of beer and a tankard and find a comfortable place to sit while watching the door to the house i had rented to make certain that mr thomas hunt hunter of whores and dollars remained where i intended yes it was cold and yes flurries of snow fell upon me and into my beer but i did not mind i was a man hardened by the trials of revolution and a chill in the air meant nothing so it was that at fifteen or twenty minutes to nine still enough time for him to arrive at his destination without much difficulty the door to the house flew open and mr thomas hunt emerged hurriedly putting his arm through the sleeve of his greatcoat my good whore not so much dressed as her man with her shift falling off her shoulder tried to hold him back but mr thomas hunt brushed her off and rudely too more roughly than i like to see women treated mr thomas hunt it was now quite clear to me was a bad man and though i had better than half my beer remaining and leaving it upon the street meant i could forget ever again seeing my deposit i nevertheless heeded the call of duty and sprang forward great god sir i called out mr hunt mr thomas hunt i say you are in danger sir go no further take not another step mr thomas hunt for your life is in the balance he looked up and saw me running toward him running with concern plastered upon my face and he must have recognized in me the countenance of a revolutionary hero for he paused in his tracks long enough for me to catch him thank jesus youre safe i breathed holding on to his arm they are coming and you must hide i began to lead him back up the steps to my rented house now he resisted who are you sir who is after me of what do you speak i faced the not inconsiderable problem of having no idea of what i spoke i struggled within myself for an answer i dont know that i took more than a few seconds if that long and then i gestured toward the street with my head men you have cheated i said he was a speculator and it seemed to me likely that hed cheated someone indeed he blanched and without further explanation he moved toward the entrance of the house inside the foyer was stripped of paintings and decorative objects but the wallpaper and the floor covering painted like dutch tiles were still there and the house seemed a bit sterile if not precisely empty our footsteps echoed however as we pushed farther inside at the end of the hallway stood the whore waiting to see what happened next i tried to hold him she said sounding bored by her own words but he wouldnt be held id no time to signal her to keep her silence and shed not read the commands upon my face or even the irritation that came after as for mr thomas hunt he looked between us and in an instant understood that the danger he faced came from me and from no other quarter he attempted to push past me shoving hard into me with his shoulder but i held my ground and held mr thomas hunt fast taking his arm in my grip just keep your peace and be still and nothing will happen to you i said whoreson he answered only not in a calm and quiet voice as it might appear on the page no it was loud and shrill and full of fight and fire more like whoreson i suppose and hethe true whoreson if one of us must be so nominatedmade to stick his fingers in my eyes it was unexpected vicious and resourceful he came at me his fingers extended like an eagles talons if i had not thrust a knee into his testicles i would be a blind man today like his companion before him mr thomas hunt found himself tied quite handily his arms behind him i had no need of his silence we having the house to ourselves so i concentrated only upon his hands and feet and with him so detained i dragged him into the front sitting room and put him upon a settee the house being sold with some furnishings intact keep him here until two pm i said to the woman then you may let him go to the man i said when she unties you lay not a finger upon her in vengeance or she will come to me and i will make you pay for it if i am to be kept prisoner he said may i have the womans services at least he was a practical man and i could not fault him for it if hes still interested at two this afternoon let him enjoy himself and then i added for it never hurts to let a man know that his enemy understands how things lie he may return to his wife r umors of the impending success of the million bank had been spreading throughout the city for some weeks so i cannot say with any certainty that if i had not hindered duer he might still have stumbled as it happened he arrived at corres hotel nearly an hour late at almost eleven oclock i never heard what happened at his home but i imagined the scene first perhaps duer would be tapping his foot waiting impatiently for at least one of his agents to show himself yet not a one appeared then a servant would come running inside with the most horrific announcement it would seem that every carriage in the house had suffered a breaking of the wheels and the doors to their stables having been thrown open the horses had all wandered away oh such carelessness and on so important a day too it was almost as though some malevolent spirit had visited greenwich in the middle of the night to effect the chaos with no other option duer and his man whippo would be forced to find what horses they could and ride to the city i suppose they had been in hopeful expectation of discovering their agents in place handily purchasing every bit of stock available their own lateness costing nothing more than the pleasure of observing a successful operation their arrival proved to them an unhappy truth corres hotel was packed full of the angry and the agitated a mob to be contained by a table at which sat three cashiers far too few for the demands put upon them the million bank had hoped to launch successfully but not so frantically not with the verve and enthusiasm that had marked the launch of the bank of the united states the previous summer yet here was a throng of angry pushing men each hoping to buy riches cheap new york was a city of foreigners and on hand to purchase stocks were germans and dutchmen and italians and spaniards and jews there were the confident and loud speculators who haunted the merchants coffeehouse but there were other men too more timid men of more respectable businesses who having watched the excitement of hamiltons bank hoped now to profit for themselves there were also men of a lower order men who perhaps brought their life savings in the hopes of in a single moment changing their lives forever it seemed the only significant group not to be found in this hodgepodge was duers agents in the press of men i observed this absence with some satisfaction i was abandoned and alone beaten and abused despised by the world but i had done my duty for my nation from across the room i observed a new face enter into the lobby of corres it was pearson looking overwhelmed and a little bit like a child who has lost his minder in a crowded market did he know id already escaped his prison i doubted it and there he was a man i hated above all others the man who had murdered my greatest friend ruined my life married the woman i loved and made her life into an unendurable torment here he was having freshly imprisoned me come to invest the last of his money but upon scanning the room it was clear he was dismayed by what he saw all was madness and chaos with no sign of duers agents or duer himself pearson and i were separated by perhaps fifty feet and perhaps a thousand men but for an instant across the press of bodies and the cries of impatience our eyes locked i cannot claim to understand what crossed his faceperhaps something like surprise and horror he must have understood several things at once that i had escaped his inescapable dungeon that i was far more dangerous an enemy than he had reckoned and that things would be different from now on he also must have understood that money invested in the million bank was money lost he understood that trusting duer had been a colossal error and he understood something else that knowing what i did about who he was and what he had doneto me to fleet to his own wifei had still given him good advice he stared at me now nothing but derision and contempt upon his face for the man who had saved him and then he left i wanted to follow him i knew not when i would get a better chance but it seemed to me the wrong choice i needed to wait and see how the launch proceeded make certain duer did not find some way to turn everything to his advantage i had outwitted him yes but until all was over i could not be certain he had no tricks to extricate himself not long after i observed duer himself actually it was the remarkably tall whippo i saw first duer was more easily lost in the throng i had not seen their arrival but they now moved through the crowds who did not welcome them with enthusiasm as they cried out the names of their associatescalls that went unanswered duer stared in dismay at the long lines to approach the cashiers but having no other choice he queued up in one whippo in another they had not been standing fifteen minutes however and were seemingly no closer to the cashiers table when the announcement went out that the bank was fully subscribed those who had waited without success were thanked for their interest and asked to vacate the premises some men walked off in triumph others in despair a sizable number who had come after reading reports in the newspapers and thinking this something they should not miss out on wandered off in resignation duer and his man did not leave at all but remained like dazed horses amid the battlefield carnage i stood near the door leaning against the wall watching events unfold duers mouth tightened into a little bloodless line for a moment i thought he might weep like a child during these confusions mr isser the first agent id detained and a man apparently well versed in the art of untying knots came rushing into the hotel he found duer at once and began explaining something to him i imagine he gave a somewhat jumbled version of eventsan improbable tale of assault and detainment of mistaken identity and capture and escape they talked for only a moment and then whippo began to look about the room i dont know what he looked for but it was not long before his eyes found mine and locked on with an intense but unreadable expression his lips trembled as though he stifled a laugh something passed between us that i did not understand he looked as though he understood what i had done and approved of it it was gone in an instant he turned away and i was left to ponder the strange and wonderful events duer had been thwarted and the threat against the bank of the united states averted having saved cynthia pearson and perhaps the republic i was content to depart ethan saunders i considered it a successful day and returned to fraunces tavern where i found lavien in the taproom sipping a cup of tea and writing a letter on a piece of foolscap his hand was slow and deliberate his letters neat and precise he almost did not need to blot he set down the quill and looked at me i asked you not to interfere with the million bank launch i sat at his table i recollect something about that i called for a bottle of wine dont obstruct government business i said to lavien something on that order yes you disobeyed the orders of the treasury department well yes i said but i dont work for the treasury department your suggestions are taken into account but do not direct my actions any more than mine direct yours i have no obligation to anyone or anything except honor love and vengeance and i have attempted to fulfill those three as best i can my wine arrived along with two glasses i set one out for him and expected him to push it away instead he poured for both of us i suppose thats so he said i dont know what chaos youve brought down on us but it was nicely done he raised his glass to me why thank you very much i believe youve now learned where pearson was during the time of his absence and your actions today suggest you know what he was up to he was here in new york i said you knew that as well as to what he was engaged in business for duer that had to be kept secret because of his horrible debts in philadelphia he was shorting six percents and driving up the price of four percents so duers other agents his real agents could buy cheap and he was making arrangements to invest in the million bank the money invested in the six percents is gone but i spared cynthia the final ruin of pearsons sinking his remaining funds into the million bank there can be no doubt you saved her from ruin even if the million bank succeeds its shares are already devalued it oversubscribed today in no small part thanks to your rumormongering it oversubscribed by a factor of ten so shares have been diminished by a factor of ten the million bank will have to do well or else every investor will be a loser then perhaps duer will thank me too he will not he did not need the shares he owned to possess their value but to control the million bank itself he cared nothing for trading those shares and turning a profit on them he wanted the wealth of the million bank as a whole if anything the devaluing would have aided him in buying up shares from disappointed investors but to do that he would have already had to possess a significant portion which thanks to you he doesnt lavien sipped his wine it must be difficult for you though you said your obligations were to honor love and vengeance you have certainly fulfilled two of those today you have demonstrated your honor and your love for mrs pearson in defending what is left of her fortune but what of vengeance to protect her you must save him i could not tell if he was chastising me teasing me or encouraging me to act pearsons time will come i have no doubt lavien grinned and i felt a coldness wash over me nor do i after a moment he said leonidas came to see me he wished to take his leave i took a drink it was a bit of a debaclenot so well handled as i might have liked laviens face softened and for a moment he seemed to be just a man full of kindness and concern im sorry youve lost him i understand his anger but i think it is out of proportion to your crime you did him wrong in not telling him sooner that you had behaved justly but you did behave justly he ought to have seen that in the end he will thank you kind of you to say he looked at my glass of wine and smiled in balance id say the reform is going well i must be sure to tell my wife what a wonderful effect shes had upon you to that there could be no response well i suppose we should make arrangements to return to philadelphia he continued our work here is done well ride back together leaving early this morning by express your expenses paid for by treasury in the meantime we have work to do had he then risen i believe i would have risen with himor at least begun to do so before i recollected myself yet he did not command me and he never had i was not so tired from lack of sleep not so addled with wine that i failed to recollect that i was my own man i know we are not precisely opposed but i do not work for you or for treasury i have my own business to attend and that begins with pearson if youd like he said i can slit his throat before we leave his words were so calm and easy i believe he would have done it had i given him the word and how easy it would have been perhaps that was why i reacted so strongly i did not want him to offer again i am not going to murder him he leaned forward then what are you going to do jeer at him point and laugh there are things in motion and you are not on the margins saunders this is no longer a case of hoping to find out what some minor british functionary is up to so that six months into the future some tiny bit of intelligence youve gathered can be placed together with a hundred other tiny bits in order to reach a conclusion that can be acted upon six months later do you dare to insult the work i did never he answered but it was a long war and events unfolded on a large scale now we have not the luxury of time you are in the thick of it whether you like it or not and waiting to see who pearson contacts in two weeks is not an option he must be dealt with now why is it your concern duer is struck down by my hand the threat against the bank is finished he shook his head we dont know what the real threat was but i can assure you it was not duers effort to take over the million bank at best that was but a portion the threat is still real and we cannot lose a day in our pursuit of it i do not work for you i said and i do not work for hamilton yes you do he said hamilton does not know it yet but you do and when all this is over he will see what youve done and you will have what youve wantednot only reform but redemption when i first met you i thought you were nothing but a useless drunk it ought not to have stung i presented myself as nothing more and yet i did not want to hear it and now and now he said i find you are a useful drunk i pushed the bottle away but not the glass then i looked him full in the face i want to help you the devil take me i want to help hamilton though i never thought i would utter such words but first i must help cynthia that is my obligation and my desire it is the air in my lungs and i cannot breathe if i turn from it you must see that i do see it but i see what you dont you can rid cynthia of her husband in a single stroke and only we shall know of it yet you wont do it i understand why but if you wont do it in a single stroke we must do it strategically pearson has bound himself and his fortune to larger schemes and if you want to be rid of him we must deal with duer and the threat to the bank we must discover the plot and bring down the plotters and somewhere amid all that chaos i believe pearson will be dealt with you believe it too i think and i know you long to be part of this to bring down duer with me you simply cannot endure the torment of taking your eye off pearson i promise you you may turn away from him and he will not trouble you he is done in philadelphia he is in exile he cant hurt her now and if we do this right he will not hurt her again i could see the reason in what he said and i did not mind that hed thrown in a few very kind words about me this was kyler lavien perhaps the most powerful manif only secretly soin the employ of the most powerful man in washingtons administration and he begged me for my help i would have hated to turn him away but perhaps i did not have to perhaps he was right i had no notion of what to do about pearson i would go instead with lavien and see what came of his methods what do we do he grinned that evil grin again weve only a few hours before we take the express back to philadelphia so in the meantime we see duer we find out what he means to do next and then we report to hamilton in keeping pearson from utterly undoing himself you may have completed your new york business as a private citizen now you are upon treasury business a t near seven duer received us in the parlor of his greenwich mansion he seemed as unflappable as ever cool and friendly a man at ease in the comforts of his own home and he was alone no isaac whippo in sight and no reynolds he showed us a painting hed purchased and pointed out his window to a new pair of hunting dogs not a care in the world and certainly not a thought for that pesky business with the million bank at last we sat but unlike our last visit no offer of refreshment was made now how is it i can assist you gentlemen always at the service of the secretary of the treasury and his men lavien leaped right in i have heard that your plans to acquire a controlling interest in the million bank came to nothing duer kept his speculators smile in place let the building collapse around him duer would not flinch i never entertained such a scheme i thought very ill of that project lavien scowled and now i hear that your agents move to acquire bank of new york issues and you continue your efforts to control government six percents you perhaps think you observe much from your little perch in the merchants duer said but you are new to the world of trade and you may not understand all you see i beg you to leave my business to me i have politely entertained your interference but you must understand that colonel hamilton will not thank you for troubling me i understand it is time for you to be honest with us lavien answered no more prevarication if you please i must object sir he said with a bit of a nervous laugh you speak to me as i am unused duer turned to me do you not think a more civil tone is in order i shall tell you what is in order said lavien with surprising harshness forthrightness sir i must know of your plans i want to know everything about your schemes with the banks and with the government issues i want it all and i want it now and then treasury will decide if you can be permitted to continue duer flushed but attempted to laugh it off oh a businessman never reveals such things im sure you understand i dont give a fig for your schemes said lavien and you sir do not wish to stand in my way now wait a moment no lavien said his voice hard but quiet there is no negotiation i am telling you what will happen not proposing an arrangement the time for subtlety is done you will tell me what i wish to know or i will find out my own way and you shant like it duers face which had gone white suggested he did not doubt it no one looking upon lavien could doubt it the man appeared to be himself in every way and yet somehow he had metamorphosed into a devil there was a hardness in his eyes a hooded quality to his brow i am happy to make open inquiries lavien said to spread about what i know and collect the information i require from others laying open your schemes as i understand them to all i presume you do not wish that duer continued to gaze upon lavien but said nothing i believe this man who had made his way through the world with lies and manipulation could not now speak when faced with the sheer unmovable force of a man who would not under any circumstances allow himself to be convinced charmed or manipulated lavien turned to me we will now go to the merchants coffeehouse we will announce what we know about mr duer and offer a reward for anyone who will tell us more surely if we get enough men together each saying what he has heard from the man himself and each finding himself contradicted then we shall know all before i could rise duer spoke no no wait i will tell you but you must promise to keep everything i say a secret lavien said ill promise nothing im not a gossip and ill not go about speaking of your business idly but ill speak of it as needs must duer shook his head as though exasperated at laviens stupidity i think the value of both six percent securities and bank stock will rise i am patriot enough to invest in my country and if you wish to persecute me for that go ahead yes i have tried to convince the world that i do otherwise but that is the curse of my success i am watched too closely and my plans would be thwarted should they be uncovered that is all asked lavien what about your mr whippo buying up money so dearlytaking those absurdly expensive loans from grocers and peddlers duer shrugged i require cash it is a steep rate of interest but it shall be repaid by and by hammy has made sure of it by extending credit through the bank so readily that is all lavien a man who attempts so much at once in an economy as small as ours must have cash so i raise cash would you destroy me for that lavien smiled if you had said as much sooner we could have avoided the bickering you must understand that a man of trade must keep his secrets and a man of the government must sometimes discover them lavien rose from his chair and i did the same in the hall i observed whippo as he came out of a room a pair of heavy books tucked under his arm he stopped and looked at me and i thought he should say something accusing instead he shook his head as though with a recollected amusement and laughed softly pudendum he said very witty a s we rode back to the tavern lavien sat in silent contemplation i did not think he was withholding anything from me as we rolled past the dark countryside between greenwich village and new york city and he stared into the darkness i honestly believed he forgot i was beside him he might even have forgotten that he himself was there perhaps he was back in some dank surinam jungle it is still our plan to return to philadelphia i ventured at last yes he said his voice thick i thought of cynthia pearson whom i would soon see so our work is done here it would seem so duer is acquiring both bank stock and government securities he is interested in hoarding not trading what he has for quick profit that is why he is willing to borrow money at such exorbitant interest rates but he will have to pay the interest and even if he makes a fortune in his venture he will have a hard time making enough to cover his loans it is more complicated the bank issues that are in circulation are not yet fully paid for they are bought in several payments and those payments have not yet come due the bank will accept specie for some payments but it will only accept six percent government securities for others do you understand now duer will control government securities which bank scrip holders need to make their payments and because they will be off the market the prices of six percents will soar while bank scrip values plummet duer will then sell off a small portion of the six percents so he can raise enough money to buy a controlling interest in bank scrip which will now be cheap since holders cant get six percents to pay them off and in that way he means to gain control of the bank of the united states yes said lavien that is why we are going back to philadelphia we have i believe discovered the nature of the threat against the bank of the united states we know its author and his means we now need only to discover how to stop it joan maycott january there are signs irrefutable signs that a moment in history is coming to a head i was not aware that i knew to look for these signs and yet when one manifested there could be no mistaking them and so when i was awakened in the darkest black of night by my landladys very agitated serving girl who moaned rather than said that a man was below to visit me i understood at once that events had accelerated i had passed through a threshold from one era to another i dressed quickly and allowed the girl to lead me down the darkened staircase to the parlor where candles had been lit hastily and where the fire from the evening before burned low for all the girls rushed attention the room was still thick with shadow not at all the sort of place a widow ought to sit alone with a latenight caller she seemed to know it and once she showed me in she lurked behind me unwilling to leave me unless asked to do so i too was not certain i wished to be left with my caller but i had no choice and sent the girl away pacing before the low fire looking drunk and unkempt was mr pearson his cravat was loose his shirt torn and stained with wine and the right sleeve of his jacket was tattered as though it had been caught in some brutal machine that had mysteriously spared his hand i could not pretend to be surprised to see him so this was the day of the million bank launch and all had gone far better than i could have imagined id known of ethan saunderss plans to sabotage duers efforts to gain control of the bank and had done all i could to make certain he would succeed pearson in his jealousy and cruelty had almost destroyed those plans but fate and good fortune had turned reynolds that brute into my ally i now approached pearson and thought to hold out my hands but i could not summon the energy to pretend to care for him in his state i doubted he would notice sir this visit is most unexpected i hope nothing terrible has happened the million bank was a disaster pearson said i could not have known i told him i proposed it because i thought it would subscribe no one could know how much it would oversubscribe i did not invest he said i could not help myself i clapped my hands together oh thank the lord his eyes glistened with moisture for he mistook my concern for his wife as something meant for him weve all been foolish weve all arrogantly believed that our cleverness elevated us above the madness of the markets which no intellect can ever truly predict i have tried to advise you the best i can but i am relieved you had the foresight to avoid the million bank even if the rest of us did not it wasnt foresight he said rather bitterly it was ethan saunders he warned me off even while ii was unkind to him he gave me good advice for my wifes sake i hope you will recall my advice regarding the four percents i said he smiled somewhat bashfully as though embarrassed to speak on this point already the price has begun to rise in this matter you were surely correct but as for duer i think we all misjudged him you see it too i think he is about to topple no one has ever been so overextended as he because hed been counting on taking the million bank now i dont see how he can survive i cannot say i wanted to choose my words carefully i did not wish to make myself sound more prescient than i ought to be nor did i wish to expose my lack of loyalty to duer he has a great many resources and he is clever but the failure of his million bank plan is a serious blow and i believe things may have now entered the realm of uncertainty the only reason i am not now hounded by creditors is because duer vouches for me once duer falls i will not be far behind given his failure today it may already be too late for me i must retreat to where i have a house off the kings highway between here and philadelphia in brighton id heard you sold it he smiled it is what i meant people to hear how long do you intend to stay there until duer falls he said or until he recovers unequivocally and can vouch for me or better yet pay me what he owes i smiled at himbrightly i hopefor i was thinking of how events might fall and a safe haven on the philadelphia road seemed to me just the thing i needed would you object if i were to visit you there he bowed i shall never object to your company i chose not to tell him i was inclined to bring friends nor that my friends were rough men from the frontier best to leave that out for now when he stood facing mr dalton i had no doubt pearson would keep any objections he might have to himself ethan saunders we rode the express coach but it took us nearly four days to return to philadelphia three hours after crossing the ferry to new jersey we were struck by a malicious snowstorm that slowed our movement to a crawl we were forced to stop for the night at the dismal town of woodbridge having progressed no more than thirty miles i should like to say we fared no better the next day but that would be presenting things in too pleasant a light our equipage struck a gap in the road and overturned near new brunswick a town even more miserable than woodbridge two of our fellow travelers both speculators were hurt quite badly one breaking his leg and being in serious danger of dying the carriage was fixed by late morning of the third day and the roads were somewhat clearer but muddy and our progress was slow we stopped for the night in colestowntantalizingly close to our destinationand arrived in philadelphia early the next morning lavien rode off at once to report his findings to hamilton i had other business and walked from the city tavern where we wearily departed from our coach to the pearson house i had no intention of knocking upon the door but i wanted to see it i wanted to get a sense from the outside that all was well within perhaps i told myself i would catch a glimpse of her at an upstairs window perhaps she would see me as well our eyes would meet and a thousand unsaid things would pass between us as i approached the house i felt the cold air pierce my greatcoat it had the eerie chill of foreboding there was a large cart parked outside and a dozen or more laborers were in the process of removing furnishings i watched as three men carried a heavy oaken writing desk i rushed to them hold what happens here where is mrs pearson one of the men turned to me he was a burly fellow the sort usually found down at the docks he was no doubt glad of the work hard to come by in the heart of winter dont rightly know but aint no one living in there if thats what youre asking what do you mean the house has been sold were working for a mr john becker whats bought it hes marked the furnishings he dont want and were taking them to store for the auction i took a step closer chilled at once by a thousand possibilities but one above all else i should have followed laviens first advice i should have let him cut pearsons throat when we were in new york it took a moment but i found my voice when did this happen he shook his head cant tell you we started work here this morning but i cant say when the house was sold i got from the man the location of his employer and went to see this becker but he was of little help he bought the house he told me through a broker and while he had been in negotiations for some time the deal had only been finished two days earlier as for mr pearson he had no knowledge of where to find that manor his wife with no better notion of what to do i took myself back to the city tavern and began to question men at random if they had heard anything of pearson i forced myself to remain calm and easy and merely presented my questions as though i had business with the gentleman i am searching for jacob pearson i said in order to conclude a transaction begun sometime earlier can anyone here direct me to him good luck friend said one man hes run from his creditors sold his properties in town or else they were taken from him sold his house in germantown and the one in bristol hes gone for good i hear he went to england said another i heard it was the west indies said another but he killed his wife and children first he did not kill them said another man he sold them to pirates thats what my footman told me and harry is never wrong about such things such things was there a category of things that included selling ones family to pirates not that i believed the tale the rumors were ugly but when a man flees his fellows are always eager to believe the worst and while i thought little was beneath pearson and i feared for cynthias safety this story at least i could dismiss but that brought me no closer to the truth so i called for a pen and paper and wrote at once to colonel burr begging him to make inquiries for me it seemed futile but i could think of nothing else to do other than lament that i had let pearson slip through my fingers i vowed that given the chance i would not do so again i staggered out of the city tavern hardly able to continue my search not knowing where i might go i accepted that after four days of punishing road travel i needed my rest so i returned to my lodgings threw myself upon my familiar bed and slept perhaps five hours by the time i awoke and arranged myself it was dark approaching six oclock and though it seemed unlikely i should meet with success i decided to try hamilton at his office the treasury building was not locked and hamilton was not yet gone he agreed to see me in short order and i went into his office and took a seat before him he looked tired himself haggard and uneasy as though he had been awake several nights in a row nevertheless he forced himself to smile apparently he said you did not heed my warning to stay away from the inquiry apparently he smiled again mr lavien tells me you performed extremely well you thwarted duers efforts to take command of the million bank had he succeeded it might have had disastrous consequences for the economy i am glad to hear you approve and strangely i was it is easy to hate a man we mistakenly believed wronged us for it gives us the opportunity not to consider our own prejudices or mistakes it was true enough that even if i had been wrong about his sins of the past i had reason enough to suspect him and even so i could not help myself i enjoyed his praise i knew not if i admired the man if i wished somehow to return to a different time or if it was hamiltons own proximity to washington that excited these feelings but they were there regardless of their source and then he continued there is the matter of the money that you reported missing it does indeed look like duer took from the board of treasury it is too early to tell for certain if we can prove it but i have my man oliver wolcott inquiring into it and thus far we believe there may be cause to bring action against him and until such a time what shall you do i asked it seems that duer and i are at odds he is attempting to control six percent securities and he is attempting to control bank scrip the million bank was a setback but he yet appears to have ample funds thanks to the greedy fishmongers and milliners of new york nevertheless i can make things hotter for him i have directed the bank president to begin calling in shortterm loans and restricting new ones which should effectively shrink the entire credit market in addition i am dispatching my agents to every trading center in the country i can try to thwart his plans if he is a threat to the bank as mr lavien believes he is a threat we can contain by freeing up six percents at a reasonable price that will allow bank scrip investors to continue to maintain their holdings it is a slow process so for now we must wait i cleared my throat have you heard anything of pearson he nodded he has sold his house and fled town they say he has sold his other properties out of town as well though i cannot confirm that i know of nothing else but i understand your connection to this matter and if i hear more i will let you know have you no suggestions he gazed upward in thought perhaps you should ask your slave to inquire there are networks of information among the negroes that can be useful of course i said wishing to say no more on this topic now captain i have much work to do if you will excuse me he spoke suddenly in clipped tones like a man saying one thing to avoid saying another it put me in mind of his relationship with reynolds which i could not help but suspect as being the source of his ill ease are you well colonel you appear perturbed i am overtaxed he said rather curtly and you have been dismissed i rose from my chair strode across the room and opened the door outside was dark most of the clerks had retired for the evening and the candles had been snuffed but a few oil lamps burned still and in the gloom i could see a man waiting for hamiltons attention i could not at first see his face but then he turned and i knew him at once it was reynolds was he here as the man who threw me into pearsons dungeon or the one who rescued me i was in no mood to find out on his terms he was just then turning to me a foolish grin upon his face and i swung out with my fist i am no man of action i have said so but even i can throw a good punch at an unready opponent reynolds however was apparently always ready he reached out with his hand and caught my punch i felt my fist slam hard into the bones of his hand and the pain echoed up my arm to my elbow he hardly moved thats unkind he said hamilton was out of his chair and rushed over to the doorway what happens here the captain here took a swing at me said reynolds captain saunders hamilton shouted sounding less like an army officer than a latin master you will leave at once my fist was still entangled in reynoldss meaty hand which held on with a firm unchanging grip i felt myself start to perspire this man attacked me in new york i told ye he said it were just business i was paid to and so i did and i made it right didnt i wheres pearson now i asked dont know i havent seen him so you are back to working for duer reynoldss business is not your concern said hamilton to the beast he said let go of his hand captain saunders is now leaving i demand to know what you do with him i said who are you to demand hamilton answered reynolds let go his grip i said not another word but strode from the building too angry to devise another option hamilton had secret dealings with reynolds i had long known that though not why surely it wasnt possible that the animosity between hamilton and duer was a mere illusion meant to confuse his enemies hamilton had dedicated himself to government service at the expense of his personal economy it was conceivable he would do terrible things even destroy his own brainchild the bank rather than remain poor forever but i did not believe it hamilton would never sacrifice the bank for anything let alone greed and in any case leonidas had seen hamilton pay reynolds not the other way around reynolds had made it clear that he would hire himself out to other men to perform other tasks unsavory tasks hamilton had lavien but hed made it clear he was uneasy with laviens scrupulous view of duty which meant that whatever business hamilton had with reynolds was something he did not wish discovered by the world i did not know what any of this meant but i was determined to find out there was but one man in the world to whom i could pose a question on hamiltons character and i meant to ask him immediately t here are few things in this world for which i am prepared to show reverence it is true but for this appointment i would show all the respect i could muster id refrained from drinking the previous night and so i awoke tuesday morning well rested and easy as the time for the visit approached i dressed myself quite neatly making frequent use of the mirror to make certain all was in order rather than risk soiling my pumps and stockings with filth from the street i hired a coach to take me the distance to sixth and market where the great mansion stood it was one of the first houses in the city owned by merchant bob morris but now rented to his distinguished tenant as i approached the door a liveried negro held out his hand for my invitation i do not have an invitation i said then you may not enter my name is captain ethan saunders i said i must speak with him and i must do so in this manner i cannot have the world know i conferred with him and so it must be a public and seemingly vacuous exchange he will certainly see me if he knows i am here will you present my name to him it was evident to me that he did not know if he ought to and yet he seemed to sense the force of my request asking another usher to take his place he disappeared into the house for several minutes when he returned he told me that i might proceed i was ushered inside an antechamber all red and gold furnishings filled with some of the first people of the city as well as visitors from the several states and even a few foreign dignitaries none knew my name and though i knew many of theirs i was not present to make idle chatter to gossip or find my social footing i merely stood by the window and made small conversation for i was called upon to do it with an episcopalian bishop named white at precisely pm the doors to the receiving room opened and we queued up obediently on the left another liveried man announced each guests name this servant was not a negro since his role including reading and a literate negro might offend southerners i was situated approximately in the middle of the queue and so it came to be my turn i handed my card to the servant and he loudly proclaimed captain ethan saunders i felt my stomach drop the way it does before a man rushes into battle i was full of fear yes but also exhilaration and i felt shame for all at once i saw the last decade of my life unfold before me as nothing but a string of drunken days and debauched encounters as unsavory as they were unwise i had once long ago been singled out for special notice by men who saw my particular talents as a means to serve rather than as an excuse never to achieve yes i had been dealt some blows but what excuse had i to surrender to failure and despair such were my feelings when i turned to my right where president washington stood dressed in formal finery in his velvet suit and gloves ceremonial sword at his side i had not seen him close in many years and time had not been kind to him his skin had grown dry and papery slashed with broken red veins his eyes appeared sunken his mouth winced with the pressure of false teeth whose pain was already legendary on top of it all he appeared surprised as he did on the battlefield he took his surprise manfully he shook my hand and bowed slightly and i proceeded to the circular room where i took my place alongside the other guests according to the custom the doors closed at precisely half past three and the president began to make his rounds i had heard of the tedium of these events but until it is experienced it is impossible to believe that the human mind free of the shackles of primordial tradition could devise a ritual so designed to salt out the lifeblood of human fellowship clockwise the president turned to each of the guests bowed and exchanged some inconsequential words if he knew the man he might ask of his family or more in washingtons character of his land its crops and improvements if he was a stranger he might speak of the weather or some development of trade or infrastructure near the mans home these exchanges were not precisely whispered but they were kept quiet to maintain the fiction of privacy as the president approached i could little contain my distress perhaps he would refuse to speak to me perhaps he would condemn me as the failure i had become perhaps he would upbraid me as a traitor for how could i know if he had ever learned the truth of those charges leveled so long ago i held my ground and hoped i displayed no more signs of my terrible anxiety than the sweat that beaded along my brow the president turned to me and offered me a stiff bow he smelled of wet wool good afternoon captain saunders it has been too long i was upon business and though i revered him as much as any i would not insult him by showing it hamilton i said can he be trusted washington showed no surprise he must have intuited the purpose of my visit and he would have certainly already determined on a course of action his mouth twitched slightly in something like a grin and his lips drew back over his false teeth he may be trusted absolutely what if appearances are against him i asked have you been listening to mr jeffersons supporters ive seen things for myself i have seen certain associations he nodded what do you believe eyes were upon us now this little exchange brief though it was had already consumed more than the usual allotment of time the men in the room could hear at least part of what we said and they knew this was not a wooden exchange of pleasantries no there was a seriousness an urgency that i had not bothered to mask and neither had washington but it was too late to retreat it was too late not to accomplish what i had hoped let them listen let them wonder it would mean nothing to them yet it would mean everything for me i believe he is on balance honorable i said even if i cannot comprehend his actions he is my closest advisor and he is to be trusted he might lead himself into hell but he would never lead another he made another poor attempt to smile and i cannot say if it pained him more than me and what of you captain saunders are you to be trusted was i ever sir i asked no hint of a smile this time oh yes he said the world never thought ill of you people thought you saw your duty as a game a lark but i knew better i knew you hid behind the jollity a fierceness you dared not display if you wear it on the surface you become something else something like lavien i said he nodded precisely with that he turned to bow to the next guest and in a room of dozens of men i felt utterly alone e ven in my perplexity i was not unmindful of important things i returned to my boardinghouse to change my clothing to something less formal i would need to pursue this thing to the end that night when i walked past the treasury building i could not but observe a light in the window of what i believed to be hamiltons office i approached and inquired of a watchman who told me the secretary was indeed yet inside i withdrew and retreated to the shadows planning nothing more than to wait for him perhaps follow him home and speak to him there i suppose i could have entered the building and walked into the office but the truth was i preferred lurking in the shadows and trailing men across empty streets it made me feel useful and involved hamilton was well known for his long nights so i was relieved when he emerged less than an hour later i had a good view of him from across the street and i was astonished by the look on his facea kind of furtive guilty sneakish look i did not like i followed as he traveled away from the center of town and toward areas i knew to be most unlike those favored by fashionable gentlemen our secretary of the treasury in short was heading toward southwark before he reached the house i had guessed his destination for i had been to this neighborhood before and in hamiltons wake too this was reynoldss home and it was here i expected to find answers philadelphia was in general a city of welllit streets but in these poor neighborhoods a homeowners duties were often neglected and i was easily able to ensconce myself in shadow mere feet from the stoop i was no lavien who i suspected could glide above leaf and twig but i moved silently enough and only men on their guard could have detected my approach i watched as hamilton knocked on the door and waited to see reynoldss brutish face perhaps i thought i should confront the man let him know he was exposed that i was no longer fooled by his pretense of honor and rectitude indeed i had gone so far as to step forward when the door opened and it was not the beastly james reynolds who stood there but the lovely maria she smiled at him and placed a hand upon his face he removed it i ought not to be here he said your husband did not my husband write you and beg you to visit me he left philadelphia this morning upon some mission for his master think nothing of my husband how can i think nothing of him hamilton said he presses me for money because you and i have been together and then when i leave you alone he begs me to return to you must i not believe that he will press me again hush she said come inside we will discuss it he followed her in and closed the door as to whether or not they would do much discussing i was in doubt but there it was hamilton with his children his devoted wife his staunch morals had been drawn into a sordid affair with this woman at once i understood this lady and her husband she beautiful and he wretched hed told me his wife was a slut and i could only presume the funds hamilton paid reynolds were a sort of compensation for the services she provided the treasury secretary did hamilton not see that they both used him he did not seeor rather he saw and could not stop himself ethan saunders hamilton had fallen victim to the pleasures of the flesh i could hardly blame him for showing human frailty with a creature as lovely as maria reynolds and i could hardly blame her with her brute of a husband for preferring a dalliance with one of the most powerful men in the nation he traveled a dangerous course however i believed washington that hamilton would never sacrifice the good of the nation to feed his own desire but he might well destroy himself i would do what i could for him he had proved he would do what he could for me and it seemed only just in the meantime i would continue to pursue cynthia and her husband i had been unable to find anyone in the city who knew for certain where they had gone and i needed to enlist someone who possessed connections i did not the next day cloudy and dark and windy i went to southwark where the bulk of the towns negroes made their home and proceeded to ask directions for i knew those streets indifferently well among the clusters of negroes gathered by their market hawking their roots and meats and bowls of pepper pot white men such as myself are regarded with considerable suspicion but i believe it is generally considered unwise to neglect their inquiries indeed a few smiles and coins made it clear that i wished nothing but kindness and within a few hours of beginning my project i found the place for which i searched it was a neat little house of exceptional narrowness but pleasing and well maintained i knocked upon the door and was greeted quickly by a pretty negress with large eyes and skin the color of drinking chocolate she appeared momentarily alarmed no doubt unused to white men on her stoop but i smiled removed my hat and bowed you are mrs i stopped because i did not know leonidass surname it was customary for slaves to take the names of their masters but i could not imagine leonidas doing so you are married to leonidas she nodded then her face bunched in a spasm of fear has something happened no need for alarm i know nothing of him good or ill i had hoped to find him home but i intuit from your words that he is not her concern melted away and i admired again her attractive features dignified in the negro mold and also her unmistakable strength of will leonidas had done well in marrying a woman who i had no doubt both appreciated and matched him and who are you she asked it was a rather strong way to talk to a white man she did not know but i would not trouble myself over that i do beg your pardon i am captain ethan saunders i bowed once more youre him she asked she gazed upon my face she looked me up and down the length of my body like a side of beef presented for sale and then she laughed in a way i did not like at all w e sat in her neat little parlor sipping tea she told me her name was pamela but seemed reluctant to present to me the surname leonidas had chosen it was no matter for she treated me graciously even though i suspected something else lay just beneath the surface mrs pamela served an agreeable tea and some sweet oat cakes with bits of raisin in them they were quite tasty and wholesome these are good cakes i said she nodded her thanks the raisinsa nice touch raisins make everything better i think some prefer plums or even apricots but when it comes to dried fruit i shall always take raisins she said nothing pamela i tried again i like the name pamela it is very pretty this kind observation solicited no response i tried again from spenser i believe she stared at me he is an english poet she scratched the bridge of her nose he wrote the faerie queene said i she blinked it is i attempted a very long poem long and dull more blinking i began to fear that i had misjudged blankness for determination and that my friend leonidas had married a stupid woman i supposed he knew best his own domestic felicity but i feared mrs pamela must make for dull company my husband told me about you she said at last and what did he say nothing too unflattering i hope haha she took a sip of tea he told me you were a wastrel and a scoundrel but that you have a sentimental heart for so selfish a creature your husband has ever been an excellent judge of character i said now feeling nostalgic for the spenser discourse and the raisins he told me that you are by nature the sort of man who would despise the practice of slavery but you held on to him for as long as you could because it was the only way you could conceive of to keep from spending your days alone is that true i cannot say i told her suddenly feeling warm mrs pamela i did not come here to make you uneasy then for what did you come why do you trouble us that is something i must discuss with your husband this answer must have offered some offense for the good woman did not trouble herself to respond thus we sat in silence for near the better part of an hour though she was so good as to refill my teacup two times by the time the front door of the house opened and closed and footsteps approached i was quite ready for a chamber pot leonidas entered the room still wearing his greatcoat flakes of snow freshly melted upon it he had removed his hat and still held it in his hand when he noticed me i grinned at him he looked at me and never had i observed such a look of rage upon his faceand never on anyones face outside of warfare his dark face twisted his eyes widened and then narrowed what are you doing here in my home his voice was calm perhaps that was what made me so easy i stood i beg your pardon i do not mean to disturb your domestic peace i should never have troubled you if it were not importantif someones convenience other than my own were not at issue he appeared to give the matter some thought he took another step toward me and sniffed like a beast you havent been drinking have you at last reformed i suppose i have it is amazing how people can change for the better ill not believe it leonidas i know you are angry with me and if i cannot truly understand the depth of your anger it is only because i cannot know what you have known i shall not attempt to justify my actions or place them in context to help you see what justice must that on balance i have treated you well and better than you could have hoped for from another how dare you i held up my hand i do not care to hear it not because it is just or unjust but because cynthia pearson is in danger and i need your help her husband has absconded with her and her children and no one knows where i had hoped you might inquire among the servants and see if you might learn what others cannot you come to me for a favor i want nothing from you can you not recognize a plea not for myself but for a womans life and for the life of her children you would hold a grudge against the life of two children leonidas his wife said softly you must not be stubborn to the point of cruelty you need not like him to help him in this i will not have him stand here and pretend his motives are something other than selfishness he claims to want to help others but it is only desire that motivates him to me he said what are the names of these children it was true that i did not know but i saw no need to demonstrate that he had so successfully taken my measure julia and dennis i said very quickly too leonidas said nothing for several long moments then finally he nodded if i can learn anything i shall let you know i stepped forward with my hand out you are a good man i knew i could depend upon you he only stared at my hand it does not mean we are friends it only means i will not let others suffer because you have earned my enmity i sniffed right well thank you even so if i have more to say to you i will go to you you are not to return to my home not under any circumstances now leave the two of them followed me to the door as though i could not be trusted to find it or to leave without helping myself to some of their goods on the way leonidas opened the door i stepped through and turned removing my hat and bowing the lady of the house met my eye daring me to turn away i do not find spenser at all dull she said her husband slammed the door h amilton had not brought me into government service not really but here i was speaking to him to washington working alongside his principal spy i could not ignore what i knew and i could not leave him to his own peril that being the case the next day i rose early just after nine in the morning dressed myself neatly and strolled to the treasury offices on third where i casually asked to have an audience with the secretary he saw me almost immediately and i took a seat across from him in his small spare office how can i help you this time captain i coughed into my fist i wonder if there has been any progress in your dealings with duer he leaned back in his seat when this matter is resolved i want you to come see me i wish for you to work with lavien if you think you can do so youve proved your worth to me and you seem to have mastered yourself considerably this is the second time youve been here without the stench of drink upon you i am flattered and you may depend upon me but why must we wait because at the moment there is nothing for you to doeither for you or mr lavien i am in touch with my men in new york and i know what duer plans he is still attempting to control the six percents he is still borrowing dangerously and he is about to learn that we have begun proceedings against him for the money he embezzled while upon the board of treasury the word will spreadon its own or with our helpand it is but a matter of weeks perhaps only days until duer collapses and the bank is safe you have played no small role in this captain and i am grateful you may be certain i will do all i can in addition to offering you employment to make certain the world knows you and fleet were falsely maligned those many years ago lavien told you he did if all this is true why do you keep me at arms length now you are of no use to me he said i cannot depend on you i tried hard not to show my anger or was it my shame what do you mean i mean you ask about duer because you are interested and involved but it is not what is upon your mind you want to find pearson the man who destroyed you killed your friend and stole the woman you loved you want to find his muchabused wife and children the revolution is won and while i dont doubt your patriotism i do not expect you would be able to put any assignment i might give you before your duty to mrs pearson find her bring her to safety and then you may come work with me i stood up and bowed i see you are a man who understands the human heart i returned to my seat he turned away when it comes to our passions we do as we must i coughed again it is upon that subject that i have come in part to see you ive spoken to no one and to my knowledge i am the only other person who knows about this i say this first to spare you the pain of asking i must advise you to end your liaison with maria reynolds her husband is closely connected with duer i do not know that your dealings with his wife have any bearing on these other matters but i need not tell you that this is a powder keg that could explode in your face he remained still for a moment how did you learn of this i followed you his face turned dark at once his fists clenched and unclenched like a babys you followed me colonel reynolds was waiting outside your office my man had already seen you giving him money i had to know the connection he nodded he discovered my intimacy with the lady several months ago and has been allowing it to continue in exchange for money money i truly dont have it has been a nightmare but i know not what to do about it he presses me whether i see maria or not and so you might as well see her to be blunt said hamilton i am not entirely certain that she did not begin to attract my attention with this scheme in mind she is very beautiful i have seen her then you know she is lovely but flighty and inconstant andwell not particularly clever yet i cannot help myself i vow never to see her more yet i return when it comes to our passions i said we do as we must this time he met my gaze his stare was raw with shame yet in this case you must not i said if jefferson or his minions were to learn of this it would destroy you they would destroy you they would never believeor they would pretend never to believethat this is a mere personal impropriety but portray it as evidence of a larger corruption you must vow never to see her again he said nothing but i knew he understood i expected to feel some satisfaction in standing upon the moral high ground with hamilton but all i felt was sympathy and something not entirely unlike friendship i wish i could say that the next several weeks were productive or eventful but they were not i spent my time doing little but attempting to find pearson and having no luck i made regular visits to the city tavern and other establishments that catered to businessmen i spoke to anyone with whom the pearsons had a personal connection including the mighty bingham family but no one could say where they had gone burr in new york wrote me to say no one had seen pearson and promised to write again if he learned anything i received regular updates from lavien and hamilton on duer as he slid toward destruction around the city construction slowed as the bank of the united states withdrew its loans to protect itself but the loans were for the most part being repaid and hamilton felt confident that the bank was safe i saw no more of mrs maycott and i could only imagine that she herself was satisfied with duers current troubles i heard nothing from leonidas for the most part i continued my efforts at reform i did not eschew drink entirely for a man must not die of thirst but i was temperate if not precisely frequently then certainly more often than before i admit however that one afternoon at the city tavern i had far too much wine and began demanding of anyone who would listen that i had grown weary of waiting for information i would go to new york i said and find duer and demand he tell me where i might find cynthia pearson a kindly young trader escorted me to the door and i made my way home myself that would have been the end of the incident but the next afternoon mrs deisher announced that a delivery had been made to mea crate of ten bottles of good spanish sherry the accompanying note was from william duer and it announced that he hoped i knew how well my efforts had served him and the wine was a gift of gratitude the words were spare and to the point yet there could be no doubt of a kind of gloating perhaps he had been in town and learned of my drunkenness it hardly mattered for i would not be goaded into anything even regret by a man such as he on the brink of ruin i was still contemplating these developments and sampling one of the bottlesfor it ought not to be wastedwhen mrs deisher announced that i had a visitor below she appeared out of sorts and when i went into the parlor i saw leonidas standing with his back to me he wore a fine new suit and he held a handsome leather hat in his hands and yet for all this grand appearance he looked somewhat abashed his eyes were cast to the ground and his fingers worked uneasily at the brim of his hat he turned to me his face grave i noticed for the first time lines forming about his eyes as if he had aged five or ten years since last i saw him good afternoon ethan i did not expect you to come calling i kept my voice calm and even yet how my heart leaped to see him not since the war not since i had studied under fleets tutelage had i known a friendship like his and to think that it was over that leonidas could not forgive me nearly staggered me yet i would not show it i could not i never intended to call but i thought you would wish to hear what i have to say you asked me to inquire into the pearsons and i did so though until now i have learned nothing of import but just this morning i received a visit from one of the former kitchen maids who heard if somewhat belatedly that i was willing to pay for information in exchange for two dollars she told me that she knew their fate with absolute certainty i stepped forward well he closed his eyes as though bracing himself and then looked at me boldly as would a man offering a challenge it seems that pearson has taken his family west to pittsburgh they hired a guide and a team of animals packed up a minimum of belongings and departed pittsburgh i whispered the word and then sat falling into old habits leonidas poured me a glass of duers sherry and then sat across from me his hands were on his knees and he leaned forward paternally i know the woman and she is not prone to fabrication if she says she is certain i believe it must be true i am sorry i know this is hard news i drank down the sherry at once ill go after her he rose refilled my glass and handed it to me anew this time nearly to overflowing do you think thats wise i understand that you feel the need to save her but is that something for which you are prepareda wilderness conflict with a man as willful as pearson i drank half my glass are you mad you think i am not fit to confront pearson in city or wilderness she depends upon me to go after her i must prepare at once thank you leonidas for telling me i know you are angry but you have done the right thing i finished the drink already i felt the sherry flowing through me and with it the inexorable energy that came with the first warmth of drink and i felt shame a deep and burning shame that what leonidas had taken from our years together was that i was not the man to save cynthia how wrong he was i would go at once leonidas studied me as though attempting to take some measure i shall leave you to your preparations then he held out his hand for me to shake i took it but a terrible unspoken truth hung over this parting i saw the distress in his gaze and i understood it for the same trouble i felt in my heart once not so long ago the two of us would have faced these difficulties together now i was alone i dared not ask him to join me and his pride would never let him volunteer perhaps when i returned when all these troubles had passed leonidas and i could begin to build the friendship anew perhaps this was my test only once id proved i did not depend on him could he trust me enough to befriend me i went upstairs and began to pull things from my trunks things i could not do without i would have to travel light and travel fast they were several people including children they had animals carrying their packs they would be slow they had a significant head start but i would travel by horse and do so alone or perhaps with lavien if i were swift and made do with little sleep i could hope to overtake them i looked at the crate of wine upon my floor the bottles stillfor the most partnestled in their straw there was a time and it was not so long ago when it would have been enough to stop me or at least slow me down i looked at the crate again which bore the name of the vendor stenciled upon the side at once i grabbed my hat and coat and headed out to the street it was but half an hours walk to reach the wine merchant and i burst inside demanding at once to speak to the owner it was later than i realized and the man before me had been preparing to close his shop but he needed only to look upon my face to understand that he would be better served saying nothing of this to me this man tall and balding and with a very red face announced that he was mr nelson the owner i put my question to him at once i am captain ethan saunders you delivered to me a case of wine this afternoon yes sir i trust there was no trouble with it it was among our finest spanish the wine was excellent but i must know where it came from who placed the order well i dont know he said looking confused rather than sinister was it mr duer of new york did he write to you no one wrote to me he said a man came in and placed the order directly a big and very black fellow he was but very polite and speaking like a white man he didnt give his name and i didnt need it he paid me with good money and as there could be no harm in sending a man a crate of good wine that was all there needed to be between us i hardly heard the rest for i wandered from the shop why had leonidas done these things there could be no other explanation but that he was attempting by various means to manipulate me for joan maycott i would either collapse into drunkenness or drop everything to chase the pearsons to pittsburgh all of which meant i would not do what i had threatened in public to dogo to new york and confront duer now i understood everything or at least enough i understood why leonidas had fled once he learned of his freedom he could not bear to betray me once he learned i had not betrayed him i understood why he had been so cruel to me when i visited him at his homethere could be no friendship between us while he served my enemies most of all i understood how much i had been manipulatedhow much we all had the ground was icy and the sun had by now set casting the city in darkness still i ran i ran past pedestrians and pigs and cows and carts and cart men who shouted at me to watch where i went i was called a brute and a damned fool but i did not care i ran until i reached laviens door and i pounded and pounded and pounded until the miserable old woman answered and i pushed past her at once without a word lavien sat at dinner with his wife and children and looked up at me in alarm we must go i said we must go to new york now at once he rose what has happened the whole time we were wrong we thought to prevent the collapse of the bank but we have done everything conceivable to bring about the banks destruction it wasnt duer it was us we are the plot against the bank he set down his knife what are you talking about we were so convinced that duer was the danger that we did not see the obvious truth it is duers failure that will destroy the bank that is why they dont want me to go to new york they dont want me to see duer to understand how much in debt he is how precarious is his situation if he goes bankrupt he could well bring the country with him lavien remained still for a moment then he said we must see hamilton e liza hamilton made us tea while i sat in hamiltons study he remained impassive while he listened to us only a tapping foot gave away his agitation i explained to him what i had concluded and why i had concluded it he understood he insisted i wait however the night was too dark to ride out now the roads too covered in snow i would leave i said an hour before dawn and ride by the lights of the city until the sun rose hamilton then began to write out another letter this one for duer i am explaining all to him he said i hope to appeal to his better nature you must do the same you must augment this letter as best you can but you must convince him to reverse course he will have to sell what he can clear out what debt he can he will have to sacrifice his dreams of conquest in exchange for an opportunity to avoid complete ruin and ignominy i cannot imagine duer accepting such a trade i said he nodded his quill still making its methodical way across his heavy sheet of paper neither can i nevertheless it is the choice he will have to make he must understand the consequences of ruin he cannot be allowed to be exposed as a bankrupt he cannot allow the public to know of his debts if that happens if he is exposed he is ruined and that will produce a chain of events so devastating i cannot endure to think of it england survived its south sea bubble because it was an old and large and entrenched economy but france where modern finance was new never recovered from its simultaneous mississippi bubble if duer is exposed we will be lucky tolike francesee no more than our economy ruined and our people pauperized banks will fail so merchants will fail and then farms and then starvation and that is the best we can hope for i dare not think of how much worse it could become but the resulting turmoil could put an end to our system of governance he paused in his writing i had been staring at the fire thinking of all those with whom i now knew leonidas to be involved but most of all joan maycott i knew she hated hamilton and had some grievance with duer but could this be what she wished could that lady and her whiskeysmelling associates truly wish to see the destruction of american republicanism in its infancy you will have to offer him something if he is to agree i said duer never acts not even to save himself if he cannot see something shining and glittering at the end of it you may have to promise him some kind of quiet bribe money with which to live when all is settled hamilton hastily scratched a few words onto the page and then began to blot no i cannot have it be said when all is finished that i paid this man a reward for his work of nearly destroying the nation even if duer understands what he has done to himself and even if he understands that a quiet reversal is his only hope he will later feel resentment he will tell himself he was tricked and bullied into giving up his scheme and so he will complain of it to all who will listen i cannot have jeffersons republican faction learning that in essence ive bribed a scoundrel for nearly ruining the nation he now looked at lavien you will have to make certain he agrees to everything you understand me lavien nodded he will agree i understood their meaning you dont think the jeffersonians will use it against you if you start breaking duers fingers they will use it against me if i have boiled beef for my dinner hamilton said what matters is the force of their argument the populace will forgive a politician who uses rough means to accomplish a good end they will never forgive a man who makes secret payments to a villain when the letter was dry he folded it placed it in an envelope and handed it to me along with a letter of credit from the government of the united states he said i was to do what i musttrade horses buy horses it did not matter spend any amount to get to new york with all due haste but keep your receipts he added so the ledgers will balance even in the midst of crisis he could not help being himself joan maycott march things began to happen not precisely quickly for events were spread out over several weeks but certainly with a kind of consistency that looked at later with the eye of history would certainly give the impression of rapidity duer attempted to proceed with his plan to control six percent securities but his failure with the million bank was a public setback news spread that duers schemes had failed him and so finally there was tarnish upon his name soon thereafter the bank of the united states began to restrict credit calling in loans including a number belonging to duer that were difficult if not impossible for him to meet then the last blow was struck the treasury department itself had conducted an inquiry into duers actions on the old treasury boardthe ones i had myself discoveredand found the he had illegally appropriated duer objected and wrote to hamilton begging forbearance but these were only delaying tactics and now it was but a matter of waiting for the inevitable the great speculator no longer made appearances at the merchants coffeehouse he could ask none of his agents to do his bidding all either faced their own ruin or would not be touched by duers new ignominy instead he barricaded himself in his house in greenwich village and i could only imagine attempted to convince himself that even the most severe of storms would in the end pass a man who had endured as much as he would endure this he did venture out now and again for private business and one such time near the end he came to see me i received him in my parlor unlike pearson on the day of the million bank launch mr duer appeared neatly dressed and well groomed and were someone not to know his circumstances he would never suspect him to be in any danger i could only see him as the buzzard circling the dying form of a corruptible nation he sipped a glass of sherry and smiled at me inquired how i had been keeping myself and what news i had to report i made small talk of course but in the end i was forced to return the subject to his own concerns i do not like to repeat the unpleasant news i hear in the papers i ventured but you and i have ever been too friendly for me to pretend there are no such reports abroad you need not concern yourself with me he said i shall weather this there are always moments of crisis in a speculators life this is but a distraction i sipped my sherry but never once took my eyes off him i should like to know how you will extract yourself from these difficulties he looked at me seeing something new in me perhaps he might have for i was growing weary of disguise indeed i could hardly imagine a reason to remain in disguise your tone madam suggests you do not think you will see me recover you owe more than half a million dollars by my estimate and that assumes you will liquidate your items of real value including your house creditors such as the bank of the united states are not easily put off and i dont think the coopers and bakers of the city from whom youve borrowed will be any more forgiving indeed you may have more to fear from them than you do the law he said nothing for a long moment as if waiting for the words that would erase what i had already said the words that would turn everything into a great joke ii cannot understand why you would speak to me so i only tell you the truth you do not hate the truth do you i set down my drink folded my hands in my lap and looked at him until he looked away is it the money he asked is that what this comes to you fear i shall soon be worthless and so you scorn me even in your moments of distress you are nothing but a creature of greed you think there is nothing in the world but money sir you think we care for nothing but wealth it means nothing to me have i ever asked you for so much as a penny no never i have never wanted anything from you and yet you did not notice it he wiped his hands on his pants i do not know how to respond to this i must go but he did not stand when you first sought my company i continued i thought you must press me for the most intimate of favors did you know that if i had been made to choose between giving in to you and incurring your displeasure i would have given in that is how much i wanted you to regard me well to trust me but you did not want the pleasures of the flesh you wanted only to feel clever and important and i had to do no more than praise your ideas and confirm your sense of self and now you are ruined ruined beyond redemption and nothing can save you you have debts such as have never been seen on this continent such as could never be paid by any american and if the mob does not take you out for a hanging you shall die in debtors prison mrs maycott he said i would not wait i would say what i had to while i could what i find particularly ironic is that during the revolution i am told you were a true patriot you had not yet let the rot of greed eat your heart to nothingness why would you torment me by saying these things what have i ever done to you that you would hate me so what have you done do you not remember you sat in my house and lied to me and my husband you used your influence and knowledge and trickery to convince us to trade our war debt for worthless land on the frontier to be tormented by your partner colonel tindall i saw tindall die you know i saw him strung up myself with my own eyes this was not strictly true but as i saw duer sink into deeper and deeper reaches of terror i could not resist a little theatrical elaboration you have thought nothing of ruining lives for your wealth and your greed led to the death of my husbandand yes the child in my wombmurdered by your partner all this death and destruction can be set at your feet for you lied to us about what lay in store for us that is why i have done it and now you know i tell you for the simple reason that there is nothing for you to do knowing wont save you your knowing cant hurt me ive committed no crime you can prove yet even if your knowing put me in danger i would tell you for it is important you understand that your ruin is not some random mishap you suffer from the direct consequences of your ambition you are undone in repayment for all these crimes and i have no doubt a thousand more the knowledge of which i have been spared mr duer rose slowly he looked at me imploringly as if i still had some power to undo what had been done i have never known such wickedness he said in a slow deliberate voice perhaps i have not always been honest in my dealings what of it i am a trader it is what i do and what i am but i have never taken pleasure in the destruction of others that you revel in my suffering is unspeakable i take no pleasure in it i said i take my revenge not out of desire but out of duty how could i live with myself if i let you continue i have dedicated my life to your destruction and though seeing it may give me satisfaction it gives me no pleasure it would also make me and my partners wealthy but i chose not to mention this part for there he could still do me harm instead i merely rang the bell and told the girl that i believed mr duer had taken enough of our time m y conversation must have effected a change in duers behavior one notable to his underlings for the next morning just as i began to make preparations to abandon my new york lodgings for good i was approached by mr reynolds he had clearly known better than to call on me and so had been loitering outside my boardinghouse i stepped outside to enter a hackney but before i could reach it mr reynolds stepped out before me and bowed slightly good morning madam nice weather today aint it what can i do for you well to be honest you can give me a bit more money you have already been paid well for your silence i told him its true he acknowledged but i spent that money so ill be wanting more i looked at him sternly i cannot be held accountable for that he showed me his yellow teeth and he seemed to me like an overgrown dog who has eaten his masters dinner its looking to me like you can you bought my silence once im guessing youll do it again oh i know i made certain promises but from where im standing there doesnt seem to me a lot you can do about it he squared his shoulders and hovered over me and he was far taller far broader and undoubtedly far more vicious than i sawor at least more violent yet i would not allow myself to be intimidated by such a brute i had faced down worse than he it is what he did not understand would never understandthat there were limits to what can be accomplished by physical menace mr reynolds i did not buy your silence i rented it and the time for which i required it has now passed us you may now tell mr duer what you like i imagine he is out of sorts which made you uneasy and is why you have come back you feared the period in which you might apply to me would be drawing to a close but it has already done so he put his face near mine as if we were lovers and i smelled his scent of whiskey and tobacco i hope you aint testing me because i mean to try your words i have told him myself i said he knows ive acted against him i do hope he doesnt owe you much money reynolds stepped back he pays me by the quarter and he aint paid me yet this year i brushed past him and allowed the coachman to open the door for me you shant see the money i stepped in and looked out the window at him i do hope you earn more than one hundred and fifty dollars a quarter i told him if thats the case youve been a loser for your efforts good day mr reynolds for your own safety let this be the last time i see you and indeed it was for i left new york that evening and made my way to the point of rendezvous with most of the others in my band only three remained in new york to protect the mission from saunders having done so much to aid us he could still do us harm if he managed to divine our scheme in philadelphia my agents had done everything possible to lead him astray but it was yet possible he might come to new york so the remaining men were there to make sure he attempted nothing that would harm us and if he did to use appropriate measures to stop him ethan saunders the watchman had only finished crying out three in the morning when lavien and i presented hamilton s letter at the governments stable we were given two stout wellfed beasts and a bit earlier than agreed we began to make our way we rode in silence the cold and the dark and the urgency made talk seem trivial when dawn trickled orange into the eastern sky we quickened our pace the horses were surefooted in the melting snow and we rode hard we traded horses in princeton and were at the ferry in new jersey by two in the afternoon once upon the new york side of the river we took the greenwich road to duers mansion it had not snowed there and the roads were dry so we made good time when we arrived there was a gathering of people outside duers palatial estatemaybe as many as a hundredand they looked angry some appeared to be duers brothers of the speculation trade dressed in fine suits and handsome coats their own excellent carriages parked nearby alongside them were poor women in tattered dresses their hair covered with rags a boy with a dirty face clutched the hand of an angry father a negro man in homespun looked somewhat dazed as though hed been struck in the head some stared at the house some shouted at it one man aging and onearmed with the look of an old soldier held a rock that he clearly meant to throw lavien and i exchanged glances but we did not speak we did not need to we had come prepared to do what we must to make duer see reason to make him begin reversing course we were prepared to make him through kindness or cruelty begin writing letters to creditors and merchants and traders we had not come prepared for this we had come prepared to stop his ruin we had not come prepared merely to witness it it seemed we were too late we rode around to the stables and were admitted by the liveried servant once we showed him hamiltons letter i did not know if he could read but he seemed impressed with our earnestness once inside we demanded to see duer and if the servant we spoke to was put off by our haggard looks or the dirt of the road upon us he did not comment he seemed to have troubles aplenty of his own and absently led us to the parlor i helped myself to some wine from the sideboard while lavien gulped from a pitcher of water flavored with oranges duer however did not keep us waiting long he pushed into the room after we had been there for less than ten minutes his suit was rumpled as though he had slept in it and his hair was wild streaks of redness shot across his eyes this is all the result of your meddling he said you and hamilton and the rest of you have you no idea what youve done what is happening lavien asked it may be we can reverse things he could not have believed it but it was something to say i felt a chill run through me for i heard something in laviens voice i thought unimaginable i heard fear how can you not know duer sneered at him word of this absurd lawsuit has gotten out and the rumor is i am to be ruined now my creditors gather like starving birds ready to pick at me until there is nothing left lavien began to pace back and forth he put a hand to his temple how vulnerable are you how much do you need to make this go away can you placate some of your creditors and thus make the others leave you be how vulnerable am i i am entirely exposed that is how vulnerable i am and you know full well that no creditor will be satisfied until he is paid can you not even cover your most immediate debts i asked my debts were never designed to be covered he said i am engaged in business but now that the government has seen fit to interfere all is falling to ruin your drawing back the banks credit and now with the absurd suit for money i supposedly owe hamilton has pulled the rug from under me what is the difference between what you have and what you owe i asked i dont know not too much above eight hundred thousand i walked over to duer and shoved him so he fell back into his chair listen to me you greedy turd you had better think of a way to escape bankruptcy there are some very dangerous people who wish to see you fail and we cannot let them have their way perhaps because he sensed an opportunity he appeared unconcerned by my violence i cannot avoid it unless you know of some source willing to give me the money the bank perhaps yes thats it the bank can lend me the money give it to me outright perhaps it is a great deal of money i know but surely it is worth it to save us from such confusion it cannot happen lavien said lending you that money would be as good as ruining the government once word escaped washington and his administration would be seen as no better than corrupt british ministers raiding the treasury for their friends we had better think of something i said the crowd sounds angry outside his window we heard angry callswe want duer he has got our moneyover and over again one group had started a poetic cry of put duer in the sewer hardly euphonious but certainly concise in its meaning i peeked out the window and saw an old woman bent over at the waist leaning upon a walking stick and looking upward i want my five dollars she cried good god man i said to duer you borrowed five dollars from a stooped old woman have you no shame she would have had no complaints when i paid her what i owed you were never going to pay i said you never could pay how could it have worked when the government itself is against me he demanded hamilton pretended to be my friend but it was he who has brought this upon me hamilton restricted the credit hamilton prosecuted me about old debts if my fall brings about the ruin of the nation it will be upon hamiltons head you are like a murderer who blames his victim for provoking him i said hamilton restricted credit because there was too much of it prompting greedy men like you to abuse the aberration he has prosecuted you for your crimes because to do anything else would be dishonest if hamilton is to blame it is for not crushing you sooner and harder perhaps then you would never have had a chance to attempt a scheme foolish beyond reason but it made such sense he said and she convinced me it would work she joan maycott i asked but i believe i already knew this was her treachery yes i know what you will say i ought not to have taken advice from a woman but she seemed to know what she spoke of so charming and clever how could i know she hated me blamed me for her husbands death whippo pushed me toward this too and where is he now hes abandoned me thats where he stole as much of my silver as he could carry and then slipped out in the night just ahead of the crowds youve been manipulated duer i said and we along with you now i want you to collect your ledgers for me i turned to lavien youll need to determine how much he owes and to whom maybe we can put it out that he has the means to repay his debts if we can but calm the crowds we can perhaps calm the markets before they panic im no money man lavien answered i may understand some of how these mechanisms work but i cant speedily interpret such things ill help you duer volunteered in exchange for a promise of government assistance and an end to this absurd lawsuit of course yes we must forget about that no said lavien you wont bargain your way out of this we will have to bring in a few clerks from treasury to review your books and the best we will be able to do is see to it that you pay first those who need it most i dont know if that will accomplish anything but we must try laviens words were punctuated by the sound of shattering glass a rock flew into a window in a room above us then another to our left and then in the room we currently occupied we could now hear clearly the cries of the crowd bring us duer our money or his head several angry men waved muskets one held a blazing torch christ i said they could burn the building down weve got to get him someplace safe lavien said where theres only one place duer said ive known it all morning but i would not say it to myself until this threat of violence i cannot see lady kitty burned out of her home youve got to take me to jail debtors prison is my lot now the mob must see me taken there so they will leave my family in peace and so we did we ushered him out of the house and drove him south to the city jail on murray street which also acted as the citys debtors prison during the stretch of the journey we were followed by an angry mob which called after us with withering insults duer sat tightlipped his eyes clenched almost shut as i could only imagine images of his failed aspirations paraded before him we were strange pied pipers for as our coach progressed it drew larger and larger crowds and when we reached the prison i feared we must be arrested for orchestrating a riot duers crossing the threshold of the city jail seemed to act as some sort of signalhis ruin was complete so no restraint was now required men rushed into the two friendly brothers tavern across the way to fortify their indignation with strong drink accordingly food began to fly in our direction eggs and apples and oranges oyster shells and old hard rolls lavien and i made it inside the jail without much harm but duer was struck in the forehead with an old egg the sulfurous yolk rotten and reeking trickled down his face but as we led him inside the stone edifice he did not bother to wipe it away o utside the prison stones and dead animals and fruit continued to strike the walls a dull cannonade of impotent rage duer was ruined worth less than nothing and yet not without assets or ready money and he had little difficulty in securing for himself the finest accommodations in the building a pleasant suite of rooms upon the third floor the turnkeys behaved like obsequious publicans and were rewarded by duer for their courtesy he sat on a chair in his little sitting room head in his hands his face now cleaned of the earlier yolk i shall pay them back he said every last one i shall pay back with what money lavien asked i shall pay them back duer said i rubbed my face rough with beard stubble yes yes when the money fairies visit you in the night and dust your bed with banknotes you will pay them back i understand but what will happen to the markets now that your ruin is under way he stared at me as though slapped i dont believe he had fully accepted the truth even though he had been struck in the face with a rotten egg even though he sat at that moment in city jail vowing to pay his creditors until i said the word i do not believe he fully understood that this was not merely an unseemly diversion on the road to triumph this was indeed the roads end duer looked at me i told you if you ruined me you would ruin the country did i not say so go now to merchants coffeehouse and what shall you see men scrambling to sell their bank scrip and government issues the prices shall plummet and as i am made to sell off my holdings six percents will plummet too you men have ruined me but not only me you have ruined all of us there it is lavien said this is what they wanted from the beginning and we have given it to them now we must ride back as fast as we can our only hope is to reach philadelphia and make certain hamilton gets the information before the news hits the markets things were always much farther along than we suspected and there is nothing we can do here it is up to hamilton he can position his men to buy and buy at decent prices he can use the power of the treasury to prevent a complete disaster what happens in new york will be harmful but the center of finance in this country is philadelphia if word of this reaches the philadelphia markets before we do it may be too late for hamilton to stop it to stop what the collapse of our economic system lavien said everything but four percents said duer who appeared to be relieved of his misery for a moment in order to lecture us on money things theyve been undervalued and i believe the collapse of six percents will revive them is that enough to keep the markets from collapsing i asked no oh the irony of it i had thought to ruin men like pearson by having them gorge themselves on four percents but if he now sells at the right moment he shall be rich and i shall be penniless i hoped for cynthias sake pearson would know that right moment but we could wait to hear no more we were out the door and pushing our way through the angry crowds they had no knowledge of who we were and how or if we were connected to duer but they were angry and only by holding ourselves erect and pushing back when assaulted did we manage to get to our carriage unscathed there was no time to return to greenwich for our horses so we found the public stables and using hamiltons credit gained access to the best horses we could find from there we made our way to the ferry and waited to make the interminable passage to the new jersey side we sat astride our horses on the flat ferry listening to the waves of the river lap at the sides while icy winds blasted us lavien looked at me you have never been comfortable doing precisely what i say not without argument or debate still you have a certain regard for me i hope you prove it merited we have been watched and followed all dayto duers mansion to the stables to the ferry there are at least three of them and by their rough look i believe them whiskey men they did not take the ferry with us which is too bad for i should have knocked them into the river and been done with it they will find another boat across however are you prepared for violence certainly just as long as it is not visited upon me he nodded grimly you will have to do as i say it is no longer a question of strategy i believe it is one of survivalours and the nations above all else you must keep that in mind this is as important as any intelligence you ran in the war if we do not reach hamilton before the news i cannot guess the devastation that will befall this union we came off the ferry riding hard under a sky hooded with gray clouds foretelling not snow or rain but merely a kind of gloom the road was free of ice and i thought we started well i was mistaken for we had not gone more than five or six miles before we heard the sound of men behind us three of them bent over spurring their horses to catch us whiskey men i shouted but it was not necessary lavien must have recognized them for he already had taken a primed pistol from his pocket now he turned and fired off a shot all done seemingly without thought or exertion it could not be i thought that such a shot could find its target but one of the men threw up his handsi know not if in pain or from the impactand fell from his horse i took out my primed pistol and fired too i was never much of a shot from a moving horse and aiming behind rather than forward made matters even more difficult but i was determined to fire true i turned to glance at the riders to see who would make the better target there were two men one far taller than the other and it was then that i recognized him the taller one was duers man isaac whippo i aimed at him rather than the other purely out of irritation but the shot went wide distant as he was i saw him glower at me cadaverously lavien returned his pistol to his pocket and drew a knife from his belt from his moving horse he took the blade between his fingers and tossed it with a hard thrust from his arm shooting out it twirled like a whirligig spiraling through the air until it struck the shorter of our pursuers in the sternum even above the roar of thudding hooves i heard his groan less a cry of pain than an exhalation of despair the sound of a man who knows he is to die i had fallen behind lavien so i spurred my horse forward ignoring the smoking of my spent pistol in my saddlebag and dared another look behind me isaac whippo had slowed somewhat perhaps dispirited and no longer liking his chances quite so well as he once did i turned to lavien he may lose heart weve all but gotten away it was not to be however for though he kept his distance he did not leave off the pursuit i could only presume that lavien had no more guns or knives about him for he did not attempt to lose this last man then i saw why this third man remained in pursuit even though we had bested his fellows up ahead a quarter mile down the road were two more whiskey men their horses blocking the road we were trapped s top lavien called and he pulled up on his reins the men in front and whippo behind were at enough of a distance that he would have time for at least a brief conversation before they were upon us we brought our horses to a pause by the side of the road following his lead i quickly tied mine to a tree and then dashed into the woods behind him that was duers man i said he was with the whiskey men i know he said in a breathy low voice as he half ran keeping his pace both swift and stealthy there is a clearing in the woods i saw it through the trees maybe half a mile back well make for that spot keeping out of sight of the road what if they kill our mounts there are always more horses he said their own for instance they wont need them once theyre dead i did not know why we should want a clearing of all things and i did not want to abandon the animals but here was a situation in which i knew lavien to be my superior and i would not argue i ran hard unused to continuous physical exertion almost at once i felt a stitch in my side and a burning feeling that rose in my throat and extended to the tip of my tongue the blood pounded in my ears and my eyes darted back and forth for any sign of danger but as near as i could determine we were not yet seen more than once i almost fell over in exhaustion but lavien continued to run hard and i would not be the one to drag us down somehow i found the strength to keep pacenearly for i lagged ten or fifteen yards behinduntil we came out in the clearing that lavien had seen from the road it was perhaps a fiftyfoot circle of flat earth pocked with mounds of dirty snow there were signs that men had slept here recentlyfootprints and the bones of a small animal perhaps a rabbit or a chickenand a stink that suggested they had not wandered far to use the necessary nearly at the center was a small stone circle in which they had made a fire and there were still pieces of wood there some but blackened coal others reasonably fresh i stood still panting and holding my side which now flared and fired and set forth cannonades of pain good said lavien in a low voice as he stooped to examine the stone circle this will do theres enough wood left to burn well he handed me his pistol took a tinderbox and began to relight the fire youll find powder and balls in my travel bag prime the weapons are you mad theyll see our smoke captain that is what i wish we havent time for evasion weve got to get to philadelphia and that means we need to fight them if we want to do it quickly and without fear of sharpshooters we must engage them on our terms we will draw them here i readied the firearms though i did it slowly and clumsily my hands shook from the exertion of the chase and the running and i kept searching the woods for any sign that the whiskey men had found us before we wished them to there was no point in doing so these were border men who stalked bears naked and slept in trees for days waiting to pounce upon deer if they knew we were here and wished us dead we would be dead already lavien quickly lit the fire poking at it until it burned vigorously he then went over to the nearest tree and broke off several small twigs which he put upon the blaze theyre moist and will make the fire produce more smoke he gazed about him and took one of the smaller pieces of wood from the fire a rounded branch not more than a foot long and narrow enough to easily hold in the hand and lifted it like a torch this way he said gesturing away from the road why do you want that i asked you will see why he answered in a grim tone that suggested confidence but no satisfaction we must not let this fire go out i followed him out of the clearing we moved back several feet that we might not be seen or not seen easily from the vicinity of the fire he held his torch behind a tree and squatted his other hand in his bag his eyes wide and unblinking let us hope they are as rushed as we are he said quietly these westerners are good hunters as stealthy and deadly in their own way as the maroons of surinam i understand i said if we die we do not get our message to hamilton and well be dead that is undesirable in itself i felt tension urgency and anxiety for what must come next it was not precisely fear though there was fear in it i am not one of those men who go into battle with nothing but courage in his heart i felt fear aplenty but enough other things that it was merely one flavor of the stew ive no doubt he continued that they have good shots among them and they could pick us off if they choose before we even sensed they were near i said i understand damn you he grinned at me just making certain he muttered something under his breath it sounded like a prayer and it sounded like a foreign language though i know not know if it was hebrew or the heathen maroon tongue then he was silent and there was little else but silence the silence of the woods in winter when men have come tramping through moments before there was a rustle of dead branches and birdsong sporadic but distant i heard the click of speedy animal claws not far awayperhaps a hearty squirrel that had not slept for the winter or had awoken early in a few moments one of our pursuers walked into the clearing he was an older man missing an eye of average height but thin build with fair hair and pale skin somewhat blemished with freckles and the scars of smallpox his clothes looked several sizes too big for him and he comported himself with the shambling attitude of the habitual drinker the oneeyed rebel looked at the fire and then turned back the way he had come and let out a whistle the kind that sounds precisely like a man trying to sound like a bird in a moment whippo and the third whiskey rebel walked briskly into the clearing soon the trio was circling the fire speaking in low tones attempting to make sense of it read some logic into its presence some indication of our location whippo turned not precisely toward us but close enough facing a deep thicket of wood hands upon his narrow hips he called i know youre in there saunders why not come out and talk things over youre taking it all a bit hard i suppose its our own fault making you think us so ruthless were not violent men just clever ones we need not be at odds lavien looked at me and put a finger to his lips as though i would need to be told its been but a game whippo called out you and i being enemies saundersi never felt it if you knew who we were and the wrongs weve suffered from hamilton and duer you would join with us we know youre no aristocrat like those fellows the violence thats been done today is our fault ill own it you come out now and well talk well parley well lay down our weapons he squatted to the earth and set his gun upon the hard ground i watched him with such intensity that i did not at first see lavien pull his hand out of the bag only when he held his object against his little torch did i see it and understand it was a ball of cast iron as shiny as silver a bit larger than an orange with a pair of decorative horns molded onto it as though it were a bull or a devil from between the horns rose a wick it took me a moment to recognize the object for i had not seen one since the war it would appear that lavien had thought to bring with him a grenade he held the wick to his torch and let it burn and then he held it in his hand my eyes must have registered concern because he looked at the wick and then at the men to tell me he dared not toss it too soon that wick seemed to me the slowest ever made it felt as though we waited for long minutes though it could only have been a few seconds i lived in fear that the men would see us and come running they would lose interest and wander off or sense a trap and flee i feared that lavien would misjudge and wait too long indeed the wick grew shorter and shorter and it took every bit of selfcontrol i possessed not to shout at him to tell him to throw it for love of god it burned with a fiery glow and a faint hiss and when it seemed to me that lavien had waited too long already he tossed the metal ball so that it landed just before the fire bounced slightly and came to rest within the little blaze i knew not if i should be more impressed with his aim or his cleverness had the ball landed before them they should have seen it and fled instead the three men looked at the fire certain they had seen something move yet unable to find any sign of aught new upon the scene the oneeyed man squatted down and peered into the blaze bringing his face in very close then came the flash the grenade burst in terrible cry of fire and heat and screaming metal it sent out a rain of fire and dirt and broken branches leaves and wet lumps of snow fell from the skies birds took flight unseen animal feet scurried i turned away and threw myself to the ground though lavien did not move or turn away he must have known to the inch the grenades range when i turned back lavien was already standing give me the pistols he said i did so and he walked toward the clearing two of the men were dead beyond any doubt one body was entirely without its head another nearly torn in two missing an arm not to be seen anywhere the dirt had turned a mottled black and little mounds of snow were spotted pink with blood astonishingly isaac whippo was still alive the grenade must have blasted away from him for he sat upright holding one arm dangling and clearly broken in the other his face was wet with blood and one eye was injured and closed perhaps ruined i had mocked this man sought to belittle and humiliate him and now he rocked back and forth slowly deliberately like an old man with his pipe he might yet live i said softly no said lavien he wont he raised his pistol and fired it into whippos head i turned away though i saw the flash of the powder and the smoke of the barrel when i turned back whippos body lay upon the ground folded and still a staggering revulsion coursed through me for what i had seen and for lavien this little fount of heartless violence lavien stepped to me and took me by the shoulders he made me face him made me look into his dark eyes small and hot understand me he said in a low voice i have now murdered a wounded man thats how important this is it isnt about money or pride or power it is about the future of the most audacious experiment in human liberty ever attempted i do not want this government to do what i have just done i take it on myself i swallowed you jews have a fine history of taking sins upon yourself he looked in the general direction of the road youre a funny man lets go ethan saunders it was growing dark but that would not matter could not matter we would ride through the night at a slow crawl if need be if that would get us to philadelphia before the trading began we rode swiftly clinging to every last second of daylight and with the violence behind us the violence i would not permit myself to think of it did indeed seem as though we could get there before dawn the roads were good and there was no sign of rain or snow we would arrive in time and hamilton could perform whatever magic was required to calm the city tavern crowd it was too late to prevent some damage in new york but he could send agents there as well as to the other trading cities who would buy at treasurys direction to stanch the bleeding i thought of what we would do not what we had done i had no wish to recollect the whiskey men torn apart by laviens grenade or isaac whippo executed or charming joan maycott who had engineered death and plotted to ruin a nation i tried not to think of these things and for the most part i succeeded i thought mostly of the cold and discomfort and the growing dark after sunset as our pace slowed we took turns holding a torch to light our way we rode on in silence the cold bludgeoning us numbing us our arms ached from holding the reins from holding the torch our legs and backs were stiff and wretched the skin on the insides of my thighs burned and itched onward we rode i did not take out my watch i would not i would ride in the dark as fast as i could and that would be enough knowing that i made good time or ill would not matter to me i dont know that i fell asleep not precisely my mind however went elsewhere as we made our way in that slow deliberate careful pace it was black of night no end conceivable as though we were to ride in the cold barren darkness forever and then toward the east i saw the first rouging of the sky we had not spoken in hours now lavien turned back to look at me we shall be at hamiltons office before seven oclock weve done it saunders weve done all that men could do and that will have to be enough we rode on picking up the pace with the rising of the sun in ten minutes we were trotting five minutes after that we were in a full gallop the road showed signs of a nearby town spotted now with farmers shacks and outbuildings and a tavern where i wished dearly wished we might stop for tea and warm punch and the freshly baked bread that perfumed the air it was an abstract wish for what i truly wanted was to complete my task to take my news to hamilton and then rest to eat my fill of food and drink and then lie down and let sleep overtake me and not wake for a day or more next i would find cynthia and then with no urgency upon me with the schemers on the run wallowing in the filth of their own ruined plots i would track them down one by one and make certain they knew justice we rode hard leaning forward in our saddles no longer troubled by pain or fatigue or cold the chill wind and the beating of the hooves drummed in my ears but i felt gleeful and giddy i turned to lavien i said you know in the midst of all this madness that was as much as i said because all went wild and the sky twisted from the top to the side and the ground corkscrewed around to meet my face in a slap of cold earth that came hard and fast making my teeth rattle the blood trickled from my mouth my nose i felt the most dreadful of pains those that come from a blow to the head i never heard the shot that killed my horse but i heard the next one it must have been only an instant after the one that brought me down but i was already upon the ground stunned and feeling pain reach out with its first tentative exploring tendrils there was a second crack and laviens beast reared up threw him off and collapsed upon him i thought how foolish they had been to shoot at me first but it did not seem to matter not yet and then i remembered that they had a marksman among their number one of daniel morgans men and theyd shot our horses not us it could not have been an accident wed killed five of their men the day before and they still took pains to keep us alive but then again it occurred to me they could not know no one could have traveled faster than we had if news was coming it was not yet there lavien was upon the ground some fifteen feet ahead of me his horse atop his lower body bloodi presumed the animalspooled around him he did not move lavien lay in the muck of the kings highway perhaps dead perhaps dying i was determined i would go to him and was attempting to clear my head when i heard the voice can you stand asked the voice i knew not if hed been standing there ten feet behind me all along or if hed approached while i lay in my daze i could not see him easily in the glare of the sun but i could determine that he was a large man riding like an ancient warrior upon his beast it was the irishman i asked if you can stand laviens hurt i said i pushed myself to my feet and found that yes i could stand i was dizzy and my head ached and i wished to christ i had someone or something to lean against but i would not tell him that i wiped at my bloody nose with my sleeve it bled but was not broken hes hurt i said again well see to him the irishman answered dalton there must have been other men men who used the glare of the sun and my own disorientation against me for a hood came down over my head and i felt rough hands grab me and begin to tie my wrists together behind my back hands moved me so a tree was to my back and i was made to sit the blood still ran from my nose and it trickled over my lips from a distance i heard voices they said his leg is broke and well need a litter and to the house i heard daltons irish accent and i heard another man who sounded like a scot i thought its still early if we get to philadelphia by ten or eleven oclock we might yet salvage all but i did not know how that could happen i was dazed and bound and hooded lavien it seemed had broken his leg and what was i without lavien i was a mind without a body an arm without a fist time passed i knew not how quickly or slowly but i felt its agonizing excruciating pace i feared not for myself these people wanted us aliveor at least had no will to kill us what was life to me though we had done what we had done because lavien believed believed to his soul that the survival of the country depended upon our arriving in philadelphia in time for hamilton to quiet the markets hed set aside his humanity murdered a helpless man because he believed if he did not get to philadelphia in time duers ruin would be the spark to ignite the destruction of a new fragile nation i could not simply allow myself to be held to live passively while the forces of destruction won out at last i felt hands lifting me to my feet they were soft hands and i smelled the flowery scent of female flesh come captain saunders said mrs maycott lets come this way lavien i croaked i was thirsty but would not ask for drink hes hurt she said his horse fell on his leg its broken but dalton says its a clean break he knows a bit of surgery from the war and from the west too hes already set the bone which he says will heal well enough in time theyve borne him back to the house what house i walked slowly as she guided me daring to trust her leadership its not half a mile east by the river its lovely actually what do you want with us as our men in new york seem not to have detained you we must do it ourselves we only want to keep you as our guests she said until perhaps this evening when all will be too late for hamilton then you may go i said nothing which she seemed not to like she said there were two groups sent to stop you five men in all how did you get past mr whippo and the rest i shook my head never saw them must have outrun them without knowing it i heard skepticism in her voice but did not pursue it you might have outrun whippos men but what of mortimer he and his partner should have intercepted you in new jersey i shook my head never saw them she sighed i suppose all will out for now let us get you to the house i did not answer there was nothing i could say we walked and walked and then the dirt made treacherous by rocks and malevolent tree roots gave way to packed gravel our feet crunched along this for a few minutes and then joan led me up a set of steps and i heard the sound of a door opening now i went up one flight of stairs and then another i sniffed the air trying to learn something of my surroundings but i could smell nothing but the wetness of the sack and my own blood i heard another door open and then i was pressed down in a chair the door closed and a lock turned my hood came off i was in a small room empty of furniture except for the chair upon which i sat marks on the floor and walls suggested that the room had previously contained more furnishings and wall hangings but these were now gone i could not help but wonder if theyd been removed for my sake for fear i should turn a chair or a portrait into a deadly weapon before me stood joan maycott looking pretty in a gown of pale pink with a white bodice she smiled and perhaps it was the sunlight that streamed through the windows but i saw the lines about her eyes for the first time she looked like a woman past her youth oh look at you she gently wiped at my face with her handkerchief the fabric felt hard and rough and hot so this is it i said this is what you were after all along you wanted to ruin duer and you made me help you duer is evil she said as she wiped blood from my upper lip she had a gentle touch he deserves ruin and the bank the bank in an instrument of oppression she said its shares will collapse in the coming panic and they shall never recover hamilton gave birth to his whiskey tax to fund the bank without giving a single thought to the damage it would dothat it does yet and what of the country itself i asked have you thought of that ive thought of little else she said im a patriot captain saunders just like you this country began in a flash of brilliance but look what has happened the suffering of human chattel ignored by our government a small cadre of rich men dictating our national policies in the west men diethey die siras a consequence of this greed this is not why my husband fought in the revolution i suspect its not what you fought for either now i fight to change it and what if something worse comes from the chaos then the world will have to wait for just governance she said better anarchy than an unjust nation that masquerades as a beacon of righteousness that would be worse than outright tyranny well i said that is certainly interesting and you clearly have the better of me i wonder if you would consider untying me and if i could impose upon you for some food and drink if i am to be your prisoner i should like at least to be a comfortable one i would ask for your word that you make no mischief but i somehow dont think you would consider yourself bound by it what do you think i thought at first that this question was addressed to me but then i realized she spoke past me to someone i had not yet noticed captain saunders is a man of honor but it is his own unique sort he would not consider himself bound by his word if by breaking it he believed he might do a greater good the man came and stood near joan maycott where i could see him it was leonidas i could not be surprised to see him there not after he had attempted to trick me with a case of sherry into a drunken expedition to the western frontier even so it left me uneasy he turned to mrs maycott i beg you give us a few minutes she nodded and took herself from the room once she was gone leonidas removed a knife and cut free the ropes binding my hands the freedom of movement felt wonderful and i rubbed at my wrists now its your turn to free me i said you had me wait longer than i would have wished it is time for me to return the favor he suppressed a smile and mad though it was i could not help but feel that it was good to see him even under these circumstances for now i understood that though he had betrayed me he had not abandoned our friendship my god leonidas why would you join with them money he said i did it for money and the promise of freedom but you were free i shouted yes but i did not know it ethan do you not hear your own words what good is my freedom if i and the world know nothing of it i have a wife i will have a family and we must have liberty mrs maycott offered me enough money to live free and she promised no harm would come to you i said nothing for i could neither forgive nor condemn you need not worry he said ive visited with mr lavien and he is well his leg broke clean and should heal and without fever neither of you will be harmed what mrs maycott says is true theres still time i said you could let me go he shook his head no ethan i wont beyond the money i believe in the cause it is better to burn down the edifice than let it rest on a rotten foundation i sighed can i get something to drink at least dont expect a glass bottle he left the room and came back in a few minutes with a wineskin and a small pewter cup i would not trust lavien with even this little but i dont believe you can do much damage with these i never thought to drink wine from pewter i said its whiskey he said drink as much as you like the drunker you are the more comfortable we shall be i resented leonidass implication but i nevertheless poured a drink before even a few minutes had passed however i heard a rattle at the door to my room which arrested me from my efforts to excuse my inaction the door swung open i expected to see leonidas or mrs maycott or perhaps even dalton it was lavien he stood upon one leg the other was out before him held straight by a splint and wrapped in a thick sheath of bandages he used a long rifle as a crutch his face was drawn and pale beneath the darkness of his beard but his eyes were bright with pain and i thought with the delight of his disregard for it are you prepared to leave he asked me he pulled back his lips in something like a sneeror perhaps a wince it took me a moment to find words i must say im touched that you troubled yourself to rescue me he managed a sort of shrug i dont think i can get down the stairs by myself his voice was easy as though he discussed something of import but i felt his gaze on me urgent and desperate and something else something greater and hotter and more intense this i understood was laviens place and laviens time he was a cannonball fired toward philadelphia and no wall no flesh no fire would stop him i pushed myself to my feet and stepped out into the hall and the mirth and wonder drained away there upon the floor lying at the sick angles of the lifeless was a man pale and bloodied his eyes wide as the face of oblivion id not seen him before but he was a ruggedlooking fellow probably handsome while hed been alive now his throat had been opened and for the first time i noticed the knife tucked into laviens belt christ whos that i asked keeping my voice low lavien did not spare a glance but then why should he i could only be speaking of one man a marksman they called him jericho hes probably the one who shot our horses now hes dead lets go how are we going to get out of here how are we going to get past the whiskey men his eyes grew harder darker his lips turned ruddy with anticipation we will kill anyone who opposes us hold i hissed suddenly feeling as though i held conversation not with a man but with a raging storm i am not going to kill joan maycott and leonidas is with them he nodded ive seen him i am fond of leonidas but ill kill him if he opposes me my god lavien is it worth it all this killing to save hamiltons bank how many times must i tell you it is not about the bank he breathed its about averting chaos riot and bloodshed and another war of brother against brother this country is a house of cards and it will not take much to bring it down now lets go he moved down the hall hopping on one foot and using the butt of the rifle to balance himself and yet he moved more quietly than i did we came to the first set of stairs i scouted down and saw no one on the secondfloor landing and reported back to lavien i think theyre all downstairs i said i heard some faint voices he nodded whose house is this anyhow where are we who is helping them i heard them say we are just outside bristol he said a chill spread through me not here i thought why must it be here the bristol house pearson put it about that it was sold but it wasnt they were here all the time cynthia and the children are likely here for gods sake be careful with your fire lavien nodded and i knew at once that he already knew or suspected that this was pearsons house hed simply neglected to tell me we took the steps slowly one at a time lavien steadied himself silently pressed his rifle butt to the stair below us and swung down he repeated this over and over never making a noise not even letting the stairs creak at last we made it to the secondfloor landing before us stood the stairs to the first floor to the left a wall on which hung a large portrait of a puritanical sort of man and to the right a corridor with two doors on either side and one at the end as we stood there the door at the end opened and we faced a man in his fifties graying and bearded strangely elegant i recognized him at once he was the scot id met at the city tavern he saw us and his eyes went wide with surprise and terror from behind me lavien pushed forward taking a massive leap off his good leg landing upon it again using the rifle to balance himself but somehow keeping it from banging against the floor in two such impossible strides he was upon the old fellow gripping his throat pressing him against the wall and taking out his knife i hurried over stay your bloody hand i cried in as loud a whisper as i dared i could not see his face so i did not know how he responded but he did stop you said not to kill the woman or leonidas you said nothing of this man we dont have to slaughter them we only have to get away from them theyre not fiends lavien theyre patriots they may be misguided patriots but they do what they do for love of country and i wont hurt them if i can help it i havent the time he said in an exasperated breath we havent the time for stealth or cleverness weve only time for violence so he said but he still did not kill the poor man he continued to squeeze his throat and his face began to purple behind the gray of the short beard but lavien did not strike with the knife my heart beat so hard i felt the reverberation in my clavicle fists clenched in rage i struggled to think of something to spare this man this schemer who had been set against me for weeks my mind was soft and spongy and would not answer when i called there had to be something i told myself and without knowing what i would say i began to talk it was always the best way do you remember lavien when we had our first talk that night at your house do you remember how you told me hamilton described me to you he nodded he said you could talk the devil himself into selling you his soul then let me do it he didnt say you could do it with all speed lavien hissed let me try damn it i felt the faintest hint of optimism but terror too for if he gave me this chance i did not know how to use it he lowered the knife and eased his grip on the scot did you hear all that or were you too busy being killed i asked the man he nodded vigorously which for the sake of convenience i chose to understand meant he had heard good then now ive just saved your life fellow thats usually worth something is it worth something to you it is he managed in a scottish brogue but ill not betray my friends oh theres no betrayal in the works i promise you that we only want a way out of here thats all we want its a betrayal for youll run to hamilton and tell him all i shook my head desperate for something its too late for that its already too late but this man this man with a beard just like your own only darker with youth his wife is due to deliver unto him his first child and we must hurry you would not want i think to be the cause of him not being at her side when she gives birth you are not so base as that are you youll have to do better than that said the scot if you want to talk the devil into giving up his soul i could not blame him it had been a weak effort but given he knew i attempted to trick him none but a weak effort would do right then i said to lavien best to kill him hold he gasped throwing forth his arms much as i had predicted ill help you the front door is locked but take my key he dug into his pocket and came forth with a heavy brass key which he handed to me they are all in the back sitting room by the kitchens theyll not hear you good scot i said and shoved him into the room there was a key to that room on the inside lock in the door i removed it and locked him in i suppose he could have still done harm banging upon the floor or some such thing but i believed wed scared him sufficiently i turned to lavien far better than murder dont you think it took too long he muttered and then gestured forward with his head i was to scout the stairway i crept down and faced the front door there was a sitting room forward and to my right and behind that a private room of some sort and behind that the kitchens i heard voices emerging from the back of the house i returned to lavien with this intelligence he nodded once we make it out of the house we head around the left to the stables ive seen no sign of servantsperhaps pearson can no longer afford anyso we should be able to get horses then we need only ride hard to philadelphia how are you going to make it to philadelphia on a broken leg i can only do my best if the pain should make me lose consciousness however you will have to finish the task yourself i studied him his face was utterly placid but for an instant i recognized it was a mask he wore to disguise the agony he felt you are a frightening man i said the trek to the bottom of the stairs was terrifying for we were most vulnerable but we made it with good speed and little noise lavien rested against the banister while i went to the door the adjacent sitting rooms windows faced west and there were no windows at all in this room so the foyer with its dark wallpaper and uncovered floors was gloomy even so once i took out the key the scot had given me i did not even have to try it to realize it was far too big for the lock its thick brass glinted like a winking eye in the dark room hed tricked us it looks like the devil wins this one said lavien better to kill everyone in case they turn out to be not nice its not as fast as a key but i can try to pick the lock i stooped down preparing to remove my boot and retrieve my picking tool when i saw a presence from the corner of my eye oh why trouble yourself said a voice vaguely familiar and even before i could identify it a thrill of terror ran through me somewhere at the base of my consciousness i knew that things had taken another turn become more dangerous and more unpredictable for a fleeting instant i kept myself from looking as though i could prevent this encounter simply by not seeing it but the instant passed and my head turned there upon the top of the stairs was jacob pearson he stood with his wife directly before him however lavien were he so inclined could not toss his knife to eliminate him he had one arm around her waist held in that tight grip i had experienced myself the other against her back and her eyes were wide and moist and even from a great distance i could see they were red from crying he did not have to tell me for me to know there was a gun pressed to her cynthia met my gaze and i could see in her all the hope all the expectation she placed in me i would get her out of this i would protect her i had no idea how but i would make it happen no doubt you thought yourself too clever but ive bested you before and will do so now he said you would bring your wife and children into the middle of this violence i said you are more of a wretch than i thought the children are safe he said theyre with my sister my wifewell she deserves no special consideration youll be pleased to know shes tried to run away several times no doubt to go to you so the two of you can live in adulterous poverty and turn my children into an object of scandal i think its safe to say that cynthia does not know what is best for her she smiled a sad smile at me i knew what it meant she was trying to be brave to be ready should some chance present itself i intended that it would after you escaped from the prison under the pier said pearson i was prepared to kill you when i had the opportunity but now i wont have to i believe the big irishman will take care of it for me when he sees what youve done to his man i wish youd killed the other but one will have to do that bitch of a widow made us all swear this way and that not to harm you unless our lives were in the balance but i dont believe dalton will honor her word now ho dalton irishman come here quick i heard footsteps running toward us and i glared at lavien if he were to take his chances with pearson it would be now but i met his eye stay your hand i said if you hurt her ill kill you myself he did not react but i had not expected him to now leonidas came into the foyer squinting as his eyes adjusted from the welllit rooms of the back of the house to the gloom of the front what is this he demanded i called for the irishman not the nigger though there is little enough difference said pearson get the irishman theyve killed richmond i believe dalton will want his revenge leonidas looked as though hed just learned of the death of a parent his eyes grew wide with horror oh ethan why have you done it daltons a good man but he wont let this go i would not defend myself not even to say that this time it was not ethan saunders who took a bad situation and made it worse things would sort themselves out or i would die but i would not allow my final words to be a speech of equivocation mrs maycott walked into the foyer followed closely behind by dalton the space was now crowded five of us stood where two or three might comfortably remain pearson led cynthia halfway down the stairs but then stopped remaining distant dalton looked us over and shook his head not bothering to hide his amusement theyre determined ill say that for them now back to their rooms wheres skye and jericho well need their help skyes been locked in a bedroom pearson spat theyve killed richmond murdered him in cold blood daltons face turned pale and his lips instantly bloodless quivered as though he were a little child then in an instant his face turned cold and hard and frightening in its cruelty he underwent a second metamorphosis to something ugly and fierce something that wanted vengeance he stepped forward then stopped he swallowed is it true he asked quietly then when he received no response he screamed the same words is it true it was loud ringing like the roar of a deranged lion and from his coat he pulled two pistols primed he held them aloft not quite sure what to do next and then he turned on us joan said no dalton and stepped before him but he pressed a hand hard to her breasts and shoved and she staggered down the hall losing her balance falling upon her knees leonidas took out his own pistol and pointed it at dalton fire your weapon and youre a dead man he said for gods sake leonidas if youre going to kill him do it before he shoots me not after but i beg that no one shoot anyone look you if you have eyes that man there on the staircase holding a gun to the back of his wife he is the one who tells you we hurt your friend we did not its true we locked away your man skye but we did not hurt him and he will tell you so himself i tossed joan the key to skyes room go unlock him and ask why should we kill one man and let another live we would not if this man this known liar and thief says your friend is dead i doubt not it is because he did the killing himself i did not know if they believed it but it would buy us time which was the best we could hope for at the moment put away the knife i mouthed to lavien to my astonishment he obeyed though i had no doubt he could have it out again in a matter of seconds should he so desire for now however he would give me my chance to take the devils soul after all i reached down and helped lavien to his feetto his foot whatever pain he had suffered he appeared no more disabled than he had been before i handed him his weapon and i believe he made a good show of himself by using it as a crutch and doing nothing more i dont deny we wish to escape i said to joan but that is how the game is played you make your move and we make ours that is all but that man i said pointing to pearson would hold a woman hostagehis own wifewhich is as base a thing as a man can do he killed your friend for no other reason than to lay the blame upon us lavien turned to dalton and pulled his knife from his belt it meant that he would be the target of the first fire for a man cannot aim at two enemies at once i had not a moment to spare so i thrust out my leg into laviens one good one and he slipped out from under himself landing upon his broken limb i cannot imagine the pain but he made not a noise though his face twisted in agony or perhaps shock or perhaps relief for as he landed daltons pistol fired unleashing its thunder crack and black smoke and sharp scent into the little space the ball passed through the air where lavien would have stood blasting instead into the front door there was a second blastjust an instant after the firstand wood splintered and sunlight shot into the gloomy foyer as the door swung open on its hinges that at least was a bit of good luck if we lived to take advantage of it i thought back to that night in helltown that night that now seemed so long ago when i had been prepared to let dorland kill me i had stood in the cold and the filth of the helltown alley and considered that i might yet talk my way into living but i held my tongue i would not stay quiet this time the air smelled of powder and my eyes stung with smoke just behind me a door lay open and sunlight seeped into our little gathering storm of violence this would likely end in more deaths there were far too many people in the room for whom i caredmaybe the only people on earth for whom i caredand i would not let it go that way i had been built from my foundation with a capacity to deceive and here if ever there was one was a time for deception hold i cried hold let there be no more violence dalton pointed his other pistol to lavien who lay prostrate upon the ground and i stood directly in his path all this time cynthia had stood a mute statue i had hardly dared to look upon her a weapon had already been fired and there was like to be more i would not have my own resolve softened by her fear but now cynthia spoke up and her voice though wavering had a kind of clarity that surprised me its true my god it is true i knew he was cruel but i never thought he could kill a man in cold blood he walked up to him and your manhe suspected nothing was ever anyone so in love as i at that moment did ever man since the fall of eve so rejoice in the lies of woman shut up pearson hissed at her its not true he said to the others but if cynthia had just spoken the most convincing of lies her husband had the misfortune of sounding entirely false while speaking truth leonidas trained his gun upon pearson let the lady go but they lie he said you make a better case leonidas said if you are not holding a gun to a woman she is my wife i may use her as i wish let the lady go joan said and her voice was hard and angry somehow cynthia held upon the stairs by her husband a gun to her back had become the most important thing to everyone in the roomnot the dead man upstairs not the two prisoners who had gotten free not the open door to freedom that lay behind us he released his grip and cynthia ran down the stairs and toward me our eyes met and she for but a fleeting instant nodded at me and i knew that this was the moment when she must prove herself she must be the woman she had always wished to be or she would fail me i dared to hold her eyes for a long important moment and i hoped it would be enough for her to understand you stupid bitch i snapped this is all your fault she took a step back the hurt on her face so realor so seemingly realit nearly broke my heart ethan i am sorry i told you no one gets hurt i told you that she shook her head i could not stop him she said tears began to well up in her eyes i tried to stop him ethan but i could not i tried you should have been there for me but you werent and i could not do it alone oh shut up i said i never should have trusted you dalton had heard enough he turned now on pearson while in general i do not care to see unarmed men viciously assaulted here was a case in which i could make an exception dalton darted up the stairs grabbed pearson under his armpits and lifted him high in the air as if he weighed no more than a baby dalton then locked his elbows and hurled pearsonwhose mouth was open in terror too primal for noisethrough the air and hard against the wall separating the foyer from the sitting room he struck with a sharp agonizing crack spun slightly and then landed with his feet against a narrow chair his head toward us though it was cocked at the most unnatural of angles cynthia let out a moan and covered her mouth leonidas whispered something under his breath dalton took a moment to admire his work and then ran up two flights of stairs above i heard him wail i turned to joan i am sorry it ended thus yours are good people with your own sense of honor and i do not doubt youve been wronged i wish we were never opposed she shook her head so much bloodshed i stepped to her it never ought to have been like this joan you are better than this you are so much better imagine what you might have done had you only tried your hand at creating rather than destroying i touched her face imagine what we could do together joan you and i must be together cynthia rushed forward ethan are you mad you promised it would be me you swore you loved me you silly woman i said with a laugh how could i love someone like you leonidas let out a throaty laugh and began to clap his hands i must say i am remarkably impressed you cannot have practiced this and yet it is so easy and natural joan turned to him what do you mean leonidas laughed again i have seen it a hundred times though never when the stakes were so high it is ethan saunders being ethan saunders when lies and false notions and absurd claims roll off his tongue we all watched him but now i look up and see his point even i who ought not to have been fooled was caught up do you not notice someone is missing and indeed he was i could not say when lavien had slipped away i had made a point not to look at him myself hoping that if he was invisible to me he might be invisible to all joan maycott now rushed to the door and looked out into the morning light i moved behind her prepared to place my hand over her mouth should she try to call to dalton but she made no effort she stood there in confused silence far away upon the distant kings highway appeared a single awkward figure upon a gray horse riding hard and fast like paul revere to save a country that was not even his own native land i did not believe that there would ever be ballads sung of this ride but oh how worthy how glorious it was and it had been made possible by my actions which i could not but like c ynthia once more collapsed into my arms she trembled and i could not be surprised she had witnessed more violence in a few minutes than most women see in a lifetime her husband however foul a man had been killed before her eyes killed upon false pretenses and owing to her own machinations it would not be easy for her in the days to come but i meant to help her all i could for her part joan maycott looked hardly less stunned i underestimated you captain saunders you too cynthia i thought you were but a victim but you are clever enough to deserve the captain she took out a watch and studied it your friend may yet save the bank you appear less distraught than i would have thought i said even if hamilton can save the bank duers ruin is accomplished and cannot be undone and his fall will be a terrible blow there will be panic and chaos and the hamiltonian plan may not be utterly demolished but it will be discredited i had four goals captain saunders to destroy the bank destroy hamilton destroy duer and enrich myself even if the bank survives hamiltons career will end and with the collapse of the market for overvalued six percent securities i will profit handsomely on my own four percents whose value will rise by the way mrs pearson you husband was a principal owner i advise you to sell them the moment they rise above par they wont stay there long she is good in defeat i said to leonidas and what are you like in victory she asked do you think to apprehend me and my men no i answered lavien may have felt otherwise but he is gone and i dont believe leonidas would permit it for my own part i do not want to see you plotting more against the nation but i would not see you in prison she nodded you and cynthia may take horses from the stables but i beg you get gone it is mrs pearsons house i said perhaps this is not the time to stand upon ceremony said leonidas joan maycotts man was dead upstairs and there were five more dead on the kings highway she would learn of it soon enough and i would not be there right we shall get gone and allow you to make your escape cynthia ashen and trembling clung to me as we made our way from the house we did not look back to wonder what leonidas or joan or dalton would do next we went to the stables found beasts to our liking and rode hard to overtake the rather sluggish lavien who struggled mightily with his leg i left cynthia to ride with him and i went on ahead to philadelphia to deliver the news to hamilton that he might act swiftly and with great skill to save the nation thanks to me joan maycott july it took twelve more years to gain the full revenge i wished though if truth be known it was not so sweet as i imagined my schemes in came to far less than i had hoped and cost me far more than i would have believed so many of our whiskey boys deadall because we underestimated kyler lavien and ethan saunders i bore those men no ill will however and never sought to strike back at them they did what they believed to be their duty and they did it without malice in particular i could never have sought to harm captain saunders i had the feeling his path and mine would cross again and though we were never what one might call friends when it happened we bore each other respect mr dalton and i parted ways shortly after i collected on my investments in duers failure he went west again this time to the territory of kentucky where he established a large still to make whiskey in the new style he intended to use his money to pay his taxes until such a time as the whiskey excise was revoked men are strange having done so much scheming and violence in the end he was content to retire to private life and let political affairs sort themselves out in their own time mr skye however remained faithful to me and with his help i was able in the end to complete my revenge the markets did not collapse because of duers failure for which i blame laviens frenetic ride to philadelphia the bank did not fail hamilton sent men to the city tavern and fast riders to boston new york baltimore and charleston and with the power of the treasury department they bought depressed issues and soothed frightened speculators i caused a panic not a failure i staggered a nationi a border widow whom the great and powerful had used as their playthingbut i did no more than stagger it the nation did not collapse or fly apart or buckle under the weight of its own corruption it merely stumbled and regained its footing i did not even bring down hamilton his reputation was tarnished by the panic and by duers ruin and provided fodder for his enemies but he was more determined than i would have imagined and i saw it would take more than a panic in the markets to destroy him if anything he was emboldened he continued to pursue his whiskey tax and the men of the west grew ever more angry and restless on the one side were government men who would demand that distillers pay money they could never have had on the other the angry populace led by david bradford and shored up by angry men with frontier spirit and an american belief in their own rights between these two forces the wise amiable hugh henry brackenridge stood for the ordinary man tried to negotiate peace and was nearly hanged for his efforts hamilton led an army of thirteen thousand menthe size of the entire continental force in the revolutioninto the west against a rebellion that he could not despite his best efforts locate there were no insurrectionists to fight so some twenty men were rounded up and two sentenced to die though they were both in the end pardoned secretary hamilton had been determined to stretch the limits of federal power and colonel hamilton did just that in the war it is said he longed to command an army and in peace he created a conflict so he could have his wish i cannot say if he took any satisfaction that the enemy he pursued was entirely of his own manufacture and mostly in his own imagination i could not remain in philadelphia or anywhere else i was known but i was not done with revenge i would not act so rashly as i had once but i would act two years later i delivered a series of anonymous letters informing hamiltons republican enemies of his affair with maria reynolds and if i embellished his crimes suggesting he used federal money to pay off the ladys husband i will not apologize hamilton was not above dirty tricks and i saw no reason to be above them either the affair ruined hamilton for public office and made it impossible that he could ever stand for president it would be enough for the time being after more than ten years had passed i dared to impose upon my friendship with an old associate of hamiltons aaron burr previously the senator from new york and now vice president of the united states he and hamilton had once been friends but they had ended up on opposite sides of the federalist divide burr was well known for showing preference for the ladies he was a handsome man though not tall and already his hair was beginning to recede but he never failed to charm and i always enjoyed his company it had seemed for so long particularly in the wake of the maria reynolds affair that hamilton would destroy himself yet as the years went by hamilton moved from one disaster to another and always survived always remained in the public eye always voiced his longwinded opinions publicly and vociferously i began to whisper in the vice presidents ear of the many wrongs hamilton had done him the terrible things hamilton said of him a man of mr burrs stamp could not long endure insults b urr arrived at my front door the afternoon of july his hair was wild his clothes stained with mud his hands shook i ought never to have listened to you he said standing on my stoop ive killed him i could not suppress a smile come inside he stepped in but turned to face the door i cannot stay i must flee ill be wanted for murder nonsense you are the vice president this is a nation of laws mrs maycott being the vice president will count for nothing why did i ever listen to you and allow this petty squabble to escalate he insults your honor you said he mocks you in print you said he will not duel you said well he did duel and ive shot him is he dead i asked i dont think so not yet but he will be soon he was shot in the hip and bled tremendously it was a terrible wound he cannot live long he was a monster he is one so long as he lives he threw away his shot said burr my god he fired first and threw away his shot and i cool as you please aimed directly at him i am not a good shot i never thought i would hit him i only wanted him to see my earnestness i will not have you regretting it it is no more than he deserves for what he did to andrew who is andrew asked the vice president it doesnt matter now not to you hamilton brought this upon himself and you cannot be blamed the world will not blame you hamilton is hated and you will be loved for this this turned out not to be the case at all hamiltons scandals his british leanings his federalist schemes and his insane plan to march on south america at the head of an army a new world bonaparteall these things were forgotten hamilton in death was recast as a hero once word of the duel circulated one would think the vice president had dug up the body of george washington and shot it full of holes at weehawken why did you lead me to this burr cried out oh never mind i havent the time to hear why or how i shall flee at once to south carolina i think to be with theodosia this was his daughter whom he loved beyond all else it is nice for him that he had someone to whom to turn in his dark hour and so he left me i thought about seeking out the dying hamilton to confront him with what he had done and all he had to answer for but if he were alive he would be in pain and he would be prayerful he would beg my forgiveness like a dying christian and it would only plant in me feelings of regret i had no interest in that so instead i returned to my sitting room where i read a charming novel called belinda by maria edgeworth it was amusing but slight as novels were becoming i thought as i often did that perhaps i should attempt once more to write one of my own but i could not help but feel that novels had missed their chance they were but silly things and nothing i had to say would rightly belong in one historical note as with my previous historical novels this is a work of fiction based on genuine events unlike the previous novels this book intertwines fact and fiction more liberally necessarily this note contains spoilers so i recommend holding off until youve finished your reading in previous novels i have always tried to focus more on major historical events and trends rather than on historical figures but it is difficult to write about the federalist period without including at least a few canonical figures though the principal characters in the noveljoan maycott and ethan saundersare fictional many of the people within these pages are real and ive done my best to portray them with at least reasonable accuracy readers will of course be familiar with alexander hamilton but other figures from history include william duer hugh henry brackenridge philip freneau anne bingham and james and maria reynolds aaron burr as most readers will know did shoot alexander hamilton in a duel on the plains of weehawken thus becoming the first sitting american vice president to be involved in a scandalous shooting incident though it is a matter of some controversy as to whether or not he shot hamilton on purpose or if hamilton threw away his shot hamiltons pet project was indeed the bank of the united states and while william duers reckless trading habits brought about the first american financial panic in early ive fictionalized the matter of the plot against the bank the historical buildup to the panic of the machinations in government securities the attempt to overtake the million bank and duers bankruptcyare all a matter of record ive merely made joan and her whiskey rebels the cause of these events this novel in many respects details the events that led up to the whiskey rebellion of which numerous historians and novelists have dealt with in much depth the insurrection was indeed caused by an onerous tax levied upon whiskey a commodity more used for trade and consumption than generating revenue by alexander hamilton who was eager not only to raise money but also to test the new power of a strong federal government conditions on the western frontier were every bit as brutal as i describe and probably more so acknowledgments historical fiction is never written in isolation but this novel has been a far less solitary project than anything ive done before my previous historical novels have focused on relatively minor and underresearched events but attempting to get a handle on the revolutionary war and federalist periods the founding fathers new york philadelphia and western pennsylvania of the late eighteenth centuries and countless other subjects has been one of the most challenging projects of my career thus id like to begin by thanking those who made the research possible in philadelphia i was very fortunate to receive the help and support of many wonderful people and institutions many thanks to the library company of philadelphia with its amazing collections and people especially wendy wolson sarah weatherwax phil lapsansky and john c van horne i must also thank the historical society of philadelphia perhaps less gregarious but with an invaluable collection i was delighted by how much helpful specific and scholarly information i received from philadelphias many living historians especially mitchell kramer jack lynch my old friend and walking eighteenthcentury encyclopedia provided much help and pointed me to muchneeded resources bernice t hamel a total stranger literally pulled me off the street to help me with research on the man full of trouble tavern and paul boni also provided much help on my research into eighteenthcentury tavern life i also received help from edward colimore and from the national museum of american jewish history my research in pittsburgh was made a pleasure thanks to animal friends of pittsburgh and robert fragasso of the fragasso group robert was remarkably generous with his time and resources i would also like to thank lisa lazor at the john heinz history center in new york many thanks to joseph ditta of the newyork historical society for whiskey i am in debt to gary regan and mike veach i was very lucky in my research on the bank of the united states to have the generous help of the worlds foremost authorities on early american banking david j cowen richard sylla and robert e wright carl g karsch helped me understand the logistics of the bank at carpenters hall unfortunately i was obligated to remove numerous sections with thomas jefferson nevertheless i must thank jeff looney of monticello for his input and advice id also like to thank the hospitality of the many coffee shops which ive made my homes away from home the late and lamented café espuma where this book was first conceived ruta maya in downtown san antonio where i worked on the early drafts and olmos perk where the book was finished and polished i am indebted to those whose ears i bent during thrillerfest especially joseph finder katherine neville and leslie silbert and i am eternally grateful to the early readers of this very long manuscript billy taylor and sophia hollander as always i am grateful for the help and support from my phenomenal agent liz darhansoff if this novel is worth reading it is only so because of the hard work and insightful creative and encouraging if sometimes unwelcome advice of my extraordinary editor jennifer hershey as well as that of dana isaacson i suspect myself of having more typos than the average writer so thanks to dennis ambrose at random house and janet hotson baker my copy editor i hope i am not jumping the gun but assuming my publicist will once more be sally marvin i will thank her in advance for her wonderful and tireless work if its not sally then ill be content to thank her for her work in the past because of the necessary chronology of the publishing schedule publicists dont get the public praise they deserve for reasons that need not be stated i must thank my family for their love and encouragement and my cats for their therapeutic value and for making sure i never overslept about the author david liss is the author of a spectacle of corruption the coffee trader and a conspiracy of paper winner of the edgar award for best first novel
