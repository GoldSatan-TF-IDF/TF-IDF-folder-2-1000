the business man by edgar allan poe method is the soul of business old saying i am a business man i am a methodical man method is the thing after all but there are no people i more heartily despise than your eccentric fools who prate about method without understanding it attending strictly to its letter and violating its spirit these fellows are always doing the most outoftheway things in what they call an orderly manner now here i conceive is a positive paradox true method appertains to the ordinary and the obvious alone and cannot be applied to the outre what definite idea can a body attach to such expressions as methodical jack o dandy or a systematical will o the wisp my notions upon this head might not have been so clear as they are but for a fortunate accident which happened to me when i was a very little boy a goodhearted old irish nurse whom i shall not forget in my will took me up one day by the heels when i was making more noise than was necessary and swinging me round two or knocked my head into a cocked hat against the bedpost this i say decided my fate and made my fortune a bump arose at once on my sinciput and turned out to be as pretty an organ of order as one shall see on a summers day hence that positive appetite for system and regularity which has made me the distinguished man of business that i am if there is any thing on earth i hate it is a genius your geniuses are all arrant assesthe greater the genius the greater the assand to this rule there is no exception whatever especially you cannot make a man of business out of a genius any more than money out of a jew or the best nutmegs out of pineknots the creatures are always going off at a tangent into some fantastic employment or ridiculous speculation entirely at variance with the fitness of things and having no business whatever to be considered as a business at all thus you may tell these characters immediately by the nature of their occupations if you ever perceive a man setting up as a merchant or a manufacturer or going into the cotton or tobacco trade or any of those eccentric pursuits or getting to be a drygoods dealer or soapboiler or something of that kind or pretending to be a lawyer or a blacksmith or a physicianany thing out of the usual wayyou may set him down at once as a genius and then according to the ruleofthree hes an ass now i am not in any respect a genius but a regular business man my daybook and ledger will evince this in a minute they are well kept though i say it myself and in my general habits of accuracy and punctuality i am not to be beat by a clock moreover my occupations have been always made to chime in with the ordinary habitudes of my fellowmen not that i feel the least indebted upon this score to my exceedingly weakminded parents who beyond doubt would have made an arrant genius of me at last if my guardian angel had not come in good time to the rescue in biography the truth is every thing and in autobiography it is especially soyet i scarcely hope to be believed when i state however solemnly that my poor father put me when i was about fifteen years of age into the countinghouse of what be termed a respectable hardware and commission merchant doing a capital bit of business a capital bit of fiddlestick however the consequence of this folly was that in two or three days i had to be sent home to my buttonheaded family in a high state of fever and with a most violent and dangerous pain in the sinciput all around about my organ of order it was nearly a gone case with me thenjust touchandgo for six weeksthe physicians giving me up and all that sort of thing but although i suffered much i was a thankful boy in the main i was saved from being a respectable hardware and commission merchant doing a capital bit of business and i felt grateful to the protuberance which had been the means of my salvation as well as to the kindhearted female who had originally put these means within my reach the most of boys run away from home at ten or twelve years of age but i waited till i was sixteen i dont know that i should have gone even then if i had not happened to hear my old mother talk about setting me up on my own hook in the grocery way the grocery wayonly think of that i resolved to be off forthwith and try and establish myself in some decent occupation without dancing attendance any longer upon the caprices of these eccentric old people and running the risk of being made a genius of in the end in this project i succeeded perfectly well at the first effort and by the time i was fairly eighteen found myself doing an extensive and profitable business in the tailors walkingadvertisement line i was enabled to discharge the onerous duties of this profession only by that rigid adherence to system which formed the leading feature of my mind a scrupulous method characterized my actions as well as my accounts in my case it was methodnot moneywhich made the man at least all of him that was not made by the tailor whom i served at nine every morning i called upon that individual for the clothes of the day ten oclock found me in some fashionable promenade or other place of public amusement the precise regularity with which i turned my handsome person about so as to bring successively into view every portion of the suit upon my back was the admiration of all the knowing men in the trade noon never passed without my bringing home a customer to the house of my employers messrs cut comeagain i say this proudly but with tears in my eyesfor the firm proved themselves the basest of ingrates the little account about which we quarreled and finally parted cannot in any item be thought overcharged by gentlemen really conversant with the nature of the business upon this point however i feel a degree of proud satisfaction in permitting the reader to judge for himself my bill ran thus messrs cut comeagain merchant tailors to peter proffit walking advertiser drs july to promenade as usual and customer brought home july to do do do july to one lie second class damaged black cloth sold for invisible green july to one lie first class extra quality and size recommended milled satinet as broadcloth july to purchasing brand new paper shirt collar or dickey to set off gray petersham aug to wearing doublepadded bobtail frock thermometer in the shade aug standing on one leg three hours to show off newstyle strapped pants at cents per leg per hour aug to promenade as usual and large customer brought fat man aug to do do medium size aug to do do small man and bad pay total sic the item chiefly disputed in this bill was the very moderate charge of two pennies for the dickey upon my word of honor this was not an unreasonable price for that dickey it was one of the cleanest and prettiest little dickeys i ever saw and i have good reason to believe that it effected the sale of three petershams the elder partner of the firm however would allow me only one penny of the charge and took it upon himself to show in what manner four of the same sized conveniences could be got out of a sheet of foolscap but it is needless to say that i stood upon the principle of the thing business is business and should be done in a business way there was no system whatever in swindling me out of a pennya clear fraud of fifty per centno method in any respect i left at once the employment of messrs cut comeagain and set up in the eyesore line by myselfone of the most lucrative respectable and independent of the ordinary occupations my strict integrity economy and rigorous business habits here again came into play i found myself driving a flourishing trade and soon became a marked man upon change the truth is i never dabbled in flashy matters but jogged on in the good old sober routine of the callinga calling in which i should no doubt have remained to the present hour but for a little accident which happened to me in the prosecution of one of the usual business operations of the profession whenever a rich old hunks or prodigal heir or bankrupt corporation gets into the notion of putting up a palace there is no such thing in the world as stopping either of them and this every intelligent person knows the fact in question is indeed the basis of the eyesore trade as soon therefore as a buildingproject is fairly afoot by one of these parties we merchants secure a nice corner of the lot in contemplation or a prime little situation just adjoining or tight in front this done we wait until the palace is halfway up and then we pay some tasty architect to run us up an ornamental mud hovel right against it or a downeast or dutch pagoda or a pigsty or an ingenious little bit of fancy work either esquimau kickapoo or hottentot of course we cant afford to take these structures down under a bonus of five hundred per cent upon the prime cost of our lot and plaster can we i ask the question i ask it of business men it would be irrational to suppose that we can and yet there was a rascally corporation which asked me to do this very thingthis very thing i did not reply to their absurd proposition of course but i felt it a duty to go that same night and lampblack the whole of their palace for this the unreasonable villains clapped me into jail and the gentlemen of the eyesore trade could not well avoid cutting my connection when i came out the assaultandbattery business into which i was now forced to adventure for a livelihood was somewhat illadapted to the delicate nature of my constitution but i went to work in it with a good heart and found my account here as heretofore in those stern habits of methodical accuracy which had been thumped into me by that delightful old nursei would indeed be the basest of men not to remember her well in my will by observing as i say the strictest system in all my dealings and keeping a wellregulated set of books i was enabled to get over many serious difficulties and in the end to establish myself very decently in the profession the truth is that few individuals in any line did a snugger little business than i i will just copy a page or so out of my daybook and this will save me the necessity of blowing my own trumpeta contemptible practice of which no highminded man will be guilty now the daybook is a thing that dont lie jan new years day met snap in the street groggy memhell do met gruff shortly afterward blind drunk memhell answer too entered both gentlemen in my ledger and opened a running account with each jan saw snap at the exchange and went up and trod on his toe doubled his fist and knocked me down goodgot up again some trifling difficulty with bag my attorney i want the damages at a thousand but he says that for so simple a knock down we cant lay them at more than five hundred memmust get rid of bagno system at all jan went to the theatre to look for gruff saw him sitting in a side box in the second tier between a fat lady and a lean one quizzed the whole party through an operaglass till i saw the fat lady blush and whisper to g went round then into the box and put my nose within reach of his hand wouldnt pull itno go blew it and tried againno go sat down then and winked at the lean lady when i had the high satisfaction of finding him lift me up by the nape of the neck and fling me over into the pit neck dislocated and right leg capitally splintered went home in high glee drank a bottle of champagne and booked the young man for five thousand bag says itll do feb compromised the case of mr snap amount entered in journalfifty centswhich see feb cast by that ruffian gruff who made me a present of five dollars costs of suit four dollars and twentyfive cents nett profitsee journalseventyfive cents now here is a clear gain in a very brief period of no less than one dollar and twentyfive centsthis is in the mere cases of snap and gruff and i solemnly assure the reader that these extracts are taken at random from my daybook its an old saying and a true one however that money is nothing in comparison with health i found the exactions of the profession somewhat too much for my delicate state of body and discovering at last that i was knocked all out of shape so that i didnt know very well what to make of the matter and so that my friends when they met me in the street couldnt tell that i was peter proffit at all it occurred to me that the best expedient i could adopt was to alter my line of business i turned my attention therefore to muddabbling and continued it for some years the worst of this occupation is that too many people take a fancy to it and the competition is in consequence excessive every ignoramus of a fellow who finds that he hasnt brains in sufficient quantity to make his way as a walking advertiser or an eyesore prig or a saltandbatter man thinks of course that hell answer very well as a dabbler of mud but there never was entertained a more erroneous idea than that it requires no brains to muddabble especially there is nothing to be made in this way without method i did only a retail business myself but my old habits of system carried me swimmingly along i selected my streetcrossing in the first place with great deliberation and i never put down a broom in any part of the town but that i took care too to have a nice little puddle at hand which i could get at in a minute by these means i got to be well known as a man to be trusted and this is onehalf the battle let me tell you in trade nobody ever failed to pitch me a copper and got over my crossing with a clean pair of pantaloons and as my business habits in this respect were sufficiently understood i never met with any attempt at imposition i wouldnt have put up with it if i had never imposing upon any one myself i suffered no one to play the possum with me the frauds of the banks of course i couldnt help their suspension put me to ruinous inconvenience these however are not individuals but corporations and corporations it is very well known have neither bodies to be kicked nor souls to be damned i was making money at this business when in an evil moment i was induced to merge it in the curspatteringa somewhat analogous but by no means so respectable a profession my location to be sure was an excellent one being central and i had capital blacking and brushes my little dog too was quite fat and up to all varieties of snuff he had been in the trade a long time and i may say understood it our general routine was thispompey having rolled himself well in the mud sat upon end at the shop door until he observed a dandy approaching in bright boots he then proceeded to meet him and gave the wellingtons a rub or two with his wool then the dandy swore very much and looked about for a bootblack there i was full in his view with blacking and brushes it was only a minutes work and then came a sixpence this did moderately well for a timein fact i was not avaricious but my dog was i allowed him a third of the profit but he was advised to insist upon half this i couldnt standso we quarrelled and parted i next tried my hand at the organgrinding for a while and may say that i made out pretty well it is a plain straightforward business and requires no particular abilities you can get a musicmill for a mere song and to put it in order you have but to open the works and give them three or four smart raps with a hammer in improves the tone of the thing for business purposes more than you can imagine this done you have only to stroll along with the mill on your back until you see tanbark in the street and a knocker wrapped up in buckskin then you stop and grind looking as if you meant to stop and grind till doomsday presently a window opens and somebody pitches you a sixpence with a request to hush up and go on etc i am aware that some grinders have actually afforded to go on for this sum but for my part i found the necessary outlay of capital too great to permit of my going on under a shilling at this occupation i did a good deal but somehow i was not quite satisfied and so finally abandoned it the truth is i labored under the disadvantage of having no monkeyand american streets are so muddy and a democratic rabble is so obstrusive and so full of demnition mischievous little boys i was now out of employment for some months but at length succeeded by dint of great interest in procuring a situation in the shampost the duties here are simple and not altogether unprofitable for examplevery early in the morning i had to make up my packet of sham letters upon the inside of each of these i had to scrawl a few lines on any subject which occurred to me as sufficiently mysterioussigning all the epistles tom dobson or bobby tompkins or anything in that way having folded and sealed all and stamped them with sham postmarks new orleans bengal botany bay or any other place a great way offi set out forthwith upon my daily route as if in a very great hurry i always called at the big houses to deliver the letters and receive the postage nobody hesitates at paying for a letterespecially for a double onepeople are such foolsand it was no trouble to get round a corner before there was time to open the epistles the worst of this profession was that i had to walk so much and so fast and so frequently to vary my route besides i had serious scruples of conscience i cant bear to hear innocent individuals abusedand the way the whole town took to cursing tom dobson and bobby tompkins was really awful to hear i washed my hands of the matter in disgust my eighth and last speculation has been in the catgrowing way i have found that a most pleasant and lucrative business and really no trouble at all the country it is well known has become infested with catsso much so of late that a petition for relief most numerously and respectably signed was brought before the legislature at its late memorable session the assembly at this epoch was unusually wellinformed and having passed many other wise and wholesome enactments it crowned all with the catact in its original form this law offered a premium for catheads fourpence apiece but the senate succeeded in amending the main clause so as to substitute the word tails for heads this amendment was so obviously proper that the house concurred in it nem con as soon as the governor had signed the bill i invested my whole estate in the purchase of toms and tabbies at first i could only afford to feed them upon mice which are cheap but they fulfilled the scriptural injunction at so marvellous a rate that i at length considered it my best policy to be liberal and so indulged them in oysters and turtle their tails at a legislative price now bring me in a good income for i have discovered a way in which by means of macassar oil i can force three crops in a year it delights me to find too that the animals soon get accustomed to the thing and would rather have the appendages cut off than otherwise i consider myself therefore a made man and am bargaining for a country seat on the hudson
