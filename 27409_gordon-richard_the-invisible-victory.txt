richard gordon the invisible victory first published in authors note who discovered penicillin fleming or florey would either have seen its possibilities had not the sulpha drugs come from nazi germany and who was the sulpha drugs begetter gerhard domagk awarded the nobel prize or an unknown german professor at the same time on trial for his life at nьrnberg for complicity with hitlers ss my research in london oxford and wuppertal gave fresh knowledge about the discoverers of these drugs which have benefited almost everyone alive today this is a novel but its historical and medical facts stay close to the truth the scientists colebrook wright hopkins freeman raistrick and hцrlein all lived chain fletcher and heatley happily still do a note about microbes the sulpha drugs and penicillin kill the dangerous germ streptococcus in the body the equally deadly staphylococcus is killed by penicillin but not by the sulpha drugs you could see the whole of wuppertal from the schwebebahn that was the famous overhead railway its greenpainted girders bestriding ten miles of the river wupper like an angular centipede its neat redandwhite aerial tramcars suspended from their monorail gave the entrancing feeling of floating in the gondola of a lowflying zeppelin the first ride had been taken on october by kaiser wilhelm ii wearing his fieldgrey military cape and spiked helmet the only accident in its history as everyone in wuppertal told you sooner or later was a baby elephant involved in a circus stunt falling through the floor into the water wuppertal was a snake of a town twisting along a steep wooded valley in places barely quarter of a mile across lined with narrow slateroofed tenement houses rising on each others shoulders its headlong outdoor staircases suggested old edinburgh the abuttal everywhere of mans ugliness on natures beauty reminded me of the mining towns in south wales where i had gone bicycling during the cambridge vacations the river banks were settled by weavers in the eighteenth century their linen yarn covering the green fields like snow and its only event to impinge on the outside world was the birth there in of friedrich engels wuppertal was synthetic like the compounds which i created from elements in my chemists testtubes it had been formed from six rhineland towns breathing the same acrid airelberfeld barmen cronenberg ronsdorf beyenburg and vohwinkellike arnold bennetts potteries that was three years before my arrival i came to work there on january a perfectly ridiculous moment for a particle of the british empire to settle on the feverish face of germany in elberfeldeveryone of course still used the old nameswhich formed the northwest corner of wuppertal the schwebebahn bisected the factory of i g farbenindustrie aktiengesellschaft the huge chemical combine which made dyes and anything else profitable to come out of a testtube it was a vast straggling disarray of redbrick buildings the size of warehouses and long wooden sheds the river a squalid ditch canalized by the factory walls rainbowed with oil and overhung with a web of cables and pipes smoke pouring from a dozen tall brick chimneys and steam escaping from myriad valves the conscience of the world had not yet stepped so inconveniently between a manufacturer and the cheap disposal of his waste i worked at the far side of wuppertal in the old district of barmen but that morning i had an appointment at i g farben the schwebebahn was crowded it was eightthirty on the last saturday of january in an age when men got up six days a week for workif they could find it from the factory station a floorless shed suspended in midair i retraced my route to the gates off the main road leading west towards dusseldorf it was a bitter day the grey sky threatening imminent reinforcement for the blackspeckled ironhard snow swept into gutters and corners i was directed across a triangular yard cut by railway tracks where a gang of workmen in leather aprons and shinypeaked caps were loading a dray with carboys of chemicals in straw nests every mans breath a cloud the four horses pawing the icy cobbles and smoking like dragons as i crossed the river by a footbridge of railway sleepers i caught the familiar smell of phenol all wuppertal stank any town making its living from chemicals in those days suffered its nose to be corroded the factory was the pharmaceutical division of i g farben the works strung along the river in the s by the old bayer drug company which still gave its name to the medicaments from phenol the germans were making aspirin to soothe the headaches of the world the sixstorey research block was modern a cleanly contrast to the industrial jungle i was making for the pathology department on the fourth floor where i found a door to the left of the short corridor ajar and walked in i discovered myself in an amazingly luxurious laboratory it was light and airy on the corner of the building with whitetiled walls white desks and swivel chairs a telephone even a refrigerator the bench was separated from a huge window by a shelf of plants in pots the elaborate microscope was far beyond the pocket of the sir william dunn laboratories at cambridge which i had just quit its only occupant was a girl in a white coat busy over conical flasks with cottonwool stoppers she was pretty round faced and darkhaired her eyes murmuring a hint of the slav yes what do you want she asked sharply i must have appeared a freak at cambridge i had learned like michael arlens gerald to despise the genteel habit of wearing an overcoat whether it blew rained snowed or froze my twentytwoyearold frame was hung with grey flannel bags and a brown harris tweed jacket a long knitted blueredandgold trinity college scarf tucked into the lapels my fair hair was disarrayed i was rednosed and rawhanded one fist carried a brown cardboard attachй case from woolworths which contained principally rye bread and sliced sausage for my lunch the other clasped a flapping umbrella god knows why i perpetrated the image of a typical cambridge undergraduate going about his business in an obscure rhineland industrial town perhaps it was patriotic bravado or insularity or bohemianism or perhaps i couldnt afford a change of clothes i have an appointment this morning to see professor dr domagk i replied in german im sorry mein herr but it is strictly forbidden to enter the laboratories my english accent made her more agitated and i thought prettier at that age i had a pressing interest in women perhaps it persisted i have had more wives than usually allowed a professor of biochemistry streng verboten she repeated torn between duty and courtesy in the europe of those days even neighbouring foreigners enjoyed the rarity and mystery of turks to the elizabethans please wait outside this was strange the dunn labs were as open to visitors as cambridge railway station and far more convenient than those famously remote platforms i was about to comply when a door in the far corner opened to admit two men in white linen lab coats the first struck me as a younger copy of the republics president fieldmarshal von hindenburg he was fiftyish squarebuilt bullnecked bushy eyebrowed his hair iron grey his moustache closeclipped wearing circular hornrimmed glasses but everyones glasses were circular then the others lab coat was too long in the sleeves unbuttoned to display brown trousers badly in need of a press i recognized him at once from my german hosts description as professor gerhard domagk quite obviously you are herr elgar said domagk in german taking in my appearance domagk was in his late thirties tall and spare with thinning dark hair cropped so close that the sides of his head appeared shaven he had a neat triangle of clipped moustache and a pin through his soft white collar under the knot of his tie american style the little i knew of him suggested that he might begrudge spending even the small change of his time on me he was a bacteriologist a doctor specializing in germs a study initiated by the germans themselves in the s he held the title of professor from the university of munsterthe nation which makes much of such labels has the pleasant custom of applying them without the accompanying trials of office he had been director of experimental pathology and bacteriology at i g farben for the past five years i needed to dig my youthful fingers deep into my pockets of selfconfidence to announce sir frederick hopkins asked me to pay you his respects herr professor until last summer i was one of his students in the biochemistry department at cambridge so dr dieffenbach explained when he telephoned well im sure were honoured to welcome sir fredericks emissary i sensed no tinge of sarcasm had there been no hopkins our babies might still be misshapen from rickets and our sailors still dying from scurvy sir frederick gowland hopkinshoppywas president of the royal society greatgrandson of a captain at trafalgar and a relation of the jesuit priest whose poems combine subtle conciseness with eccentric metre he was the doctor who in attended the unexpectedly early arrival of ramsay macdonalds firstborn in the flat downstairs at lincolns inn fields he was also the man who discovered vitamins my correspondence with hopkins was a couple of years back when we synthesized vitamin b here in these laboratories domagk explained to his companion the girl with the slav eyes was concentrating on her flasks she seemed of slight importance i judged her a technician not a chemist some people in germany said that hopkins was forestalled in his discovery by the dutchman christian eijkman you know when he observed that natives eating polished rice went down with beriberi i wanted to tell hopkins how i disagreed with that view anyway he was always generous in his praise for eijkmans work fair play he added in english the hindenburglike man grunted didnt the gateman send a porter up with you he enquired of me when i shook my head he remarked resignedly oh theyre too comfortable drinking coffee in their lodge this weather visitors arent supposed to come unescorted he added as an apology we are a commercial undertaking not a university and a company must guard its secrets like its marks in the bank where did you learn your german there were lectures at cambridge for scientists a knowledge of german is of course essential to keep up with modern chemistry i am a chemist so i savour your compliment i became aware while we talked of the unmistakable smell emitted by laboratory mice somewhere beyond the door which they had left ajar would be an animal house its shoeboxsized cages stacked the height of a man each floored with straw and sawdust on which scurried in various states of ill health lapping their cunningly doctored bowls the invaluable and involuntary martyrs to mans easeful supremacy on earth through the opening i glimpsed something like an oversized biscuit tin on legs which from my earlier days working in the inoculation department of st marys hospital in london i recognized as an incubator for growing bacteria for all their secrecy i gathered from the combination that something was going on involving the experimental infection of living beings with germs if professor hцrlein will excuse me for a moment said domagk affably turning to the other i shall install our englishman across the corridor you are lodging with dr dieffenbach remarked hцrlein i enjoyed the hospitality of dr dieffenbachs chaletlike roof in elberfeldliterally my freezing bedroom being under the rafters he had made my appointment domagk lived in the same smart residential area near the zoo at no walkьrenallee but it appeared seemly for one of my insignificance to be received in his laboratory we all know him well a very agreeable man and an excellent doctor how did you come across him asked domagk with a look of curiosity i noticed a habit of inclining his head to one side as he spoke to my knowledge he has never visited england except as an involuntary guest during the war he is an acquaintance of a family friend sir edward triplady ah the physician who attends your king hцrlein exclaimed recognition in his eye i nodded i had mentioned two knights in almost as many breaths they must have thought me splendidly connected the germans taking the english aristocracy completely seriously i concluded from his spacious arbeitszimmer in which domagk left me alone on the other side of the building that all the facilities provided by i g farben compared with those of the cambridge dunn labs as the ritz to the little rose pubs in trumpington street the furniture was plentiful though with the unrelated look of institutional buying the flat rolltopped desk was piled high with typewritten papers coloured cardboard folders and neat piles of scientific journals and against the four tall windows were more of those indoor plants which attract such quaint english names like motherinlaws tongue or busy lizzie outside was a bare cherry tree the grey sky and the schwebebahn decorating the white walls were framed photographs of middleaged or elderly gentlemen mostly looking down microscopes i recognized professor paul ehrlich from frankfurtonmain bushy haired neatly bearded unaccustomedly smart in wing collar and spotted tie and broadcloth cutaway with his soft mouth and his glasses halfway down his nose looking up amiably from some chemical tome as though surprised at someone snatching the habitual box of cigars from under his arm and taking his portrait in ehrlich exploited the german genius for systematic chemistry by testing compounds of arsenic before discovering salvarsan or which killed the treacherous spirochaete treponema pallidum he cleared syphilis from the veins of the world many of them blueblooded on a table against the window a microscope stood tilted for the eye i idly turned the knurled fineadjustment screw focusing the fuzzy blue circle on the glass slide i am a biochemist a student of the molecular mechanism of life but i had worked on bacteria and recognized a specimen of human pus i saw the globular scavengers of the blood resembling the pond amoeba the simplest of gods creatures which expresses the mystery of existence in a single cell among them were twisted minute dark exactly similar dots some in chains of twenty or more some in fives and sixes others in pairs like broken beads on a ballroom floor they were streptococcus pyogenes an enemy of mankind only less deadly than man himself some of the chains had penetrated the blood cells to lie against the blobs of a nucleus deep stained by the blue dye the streptococcus germs were winning this complex and subtle battle they were killing the bodys scavengers on their way to killing the body itself i straightened up noticing with surprise that the colourful bold landscape which had already caught my eye on the wall above was an original painting it was an unusual find in the study of a scientific professor you like my picture domagk entered unexpectedly still in his white coat from the warmth of his greeting i had been caught at a fortunate moment i politely asked the artist otto dix i was going to say that hes one of our younger painters but of course now hes about forty he teaches at dresden hes a disciple of the new objectivitydomagk repeated die neue sachlichkeit in english thats an artistic movement derived from the bridge group formed early this century in dresden he continued in an explanatory way but after the war some rather crazy people joined it his work is taken to express a realistic disillusionment with life in germany todayor by that do we mean a disgust he waved me to a low chair sitting behind the rolltop desk crossing his long legs unwinding my trinity scarf i handed him from my breast pocket a glossy pamphlet entitled les prix nobel en the earlier history of vitamin research sir frederick cowland hopkins f r s on the day i had packed up my luggage my ambitions and my illusions to leave cambridge for good i had taken a selfconsciously sentimental breakfasttime walk along the river it was a december morning which sharply reminded the university that it was but an intruder in the fens the backs wore their midwinter splendour trees ghostly with frost under the bleary eye of a newly awakened sun even the incorrigible mallards dulled with cold on the steely waters of the cam on trinity bridge i encountered floppy long moustache covering the angles of his mouth to bestow a look of everlasting pondering his eyes mirrors of infinite shrewdness when i disclosed i was disappearing to wuppertal he was amazed and shocked going over to the enemy he called it but with his usual kindness he suggested that i carried the signed reprint as an introduction to domagk who might perhaps be useful to me domagk offered a packet of juno cigarettesberlin raucht juno said the advertisementsbut i have never smoked the vitamins may be a simple idea he said turning hoppys few pages but simple ideas need genius to see them i have often to remind myself that a scientist must view the world through a telescope as well as a microscope though sometimes even a telescope is unnecessary because the most useful ideas stand on the horizon like mountains and we never see them there was a silence the conversational possibilities between us seemed swiftly exhausted perhaps thinking it churlish to evict me so promptly domagk added i understand from dr dieffenbach that youre working for the red crown brewery across at barmen thats the american concern isnt it do you find the job interesting not in the slightest domagk gave his shy smile tossing the spent match into a large glass ashtray well i prefer wine myself and so does dr dieffenbach i had already found the cellar no disadvantage in my lodgings we dont see many englishmen or americans in germany its understandable the war was hardly a tennis match you were lucky to go through it as a child herr elgar i had to leave kiel university after my first semester to join the colours as a grenadier i celebrated my nineteenth birthday in a dugout on the belgian coast at nieuport fighting the tommies the tommies wounded me in so i was posted to the medical corps he imparted all this with his usual quiet voice in a most lowly capacity the upshot was my qualifying in medicine at kiel five years later than i expected well i shouldnt complain most of my academic brothers lost their lives i felt somehow personally responsible for these misfortunes and for some reason quoted h g wells it was the war that will end war but domagk only smiled again and diverted the unpleasant subject by asking have you done any research yourself i nodded i held a six months scholarship at cambridge after taking tripos i studied the affinity of bacteria for dyes i was startled at the effect of this scientifically inconsequential information domagk stiffened in his chair staring at me for several seconds frowning and halfsmiling like a man suspecting you are pulling his leg embarrassed and puzzled i explained just the usual bacteriologists dyes gentian violet methylene blue carbol fuchsin and so on they were used to stain bacteria to make them visible under the microscope a notion which had come from the german karl weigert in the previous century i was investigating the chemical reaction behind the colouring effect i see after another moment domagk said as you can imagine were always investigating the properties of dyestuffs in the labs here i g farben manufactures drugs fabrics a hundred things but were essentially a dyemaking concern the company is inclined to see itself as god creating the colourful dawn and rainbows to please his fancy youre familiar with that passage in goethes westцstlicher divan i shook my head at present im investigating a series of dyes to discover if theyve any therapeutic effect against various bacteria it struck me as curious that i g farben should dissipate its scientists time seeking remedies in the colours of curtains and girls dresses the only dyestuffs i recalled being used as medicaments were the bright yellow proflavine and the brilliant green which had disfigured my adolescent face worse than the impetigo spots they were applied to cure while speaking domagk had taken from a desk drawer a reprint of his own on which he scribbled and handed to me with a dismissive please pass that on to sir frederick with my regards and respects i saw the paper was entitled in german the destruction of infectious agents the date was it must have been among the first scientific papers domagk wrote he seemed an early recruit in mans battle against infection which progressed with the gloomy indecision of any which had lurched upon the western front we rose i nodded towards the photograph of paul ehrlich remarking geld geduld geschick gluckmoney patience skill and luck his four ingredients for successful research who taught you that domagk asked as we reached the door when i was seventeen i worked in the inoculation department of st marys hospital in london so young you will soon be a professor he exclaimed humorously i was only a technician i had been the lab boy the equivalent of an office boy who washed the glassware prepared the flat round petri dishes for growing bacteria and of course made the tea before professor ehrlich died during the war he had been on very friendly terms with one of the bacteriologists at st marysprofessor alexander fleming perhaps youve heard of him domagk shook his head i only know the chief of the inoculation department sir almroth wright he came to visit us here at elberfeld you know that must have been after my time knowing wrights disdain for chemistry and particularly the systematized german variety his reflections on domagks lavishlyequipped labs would have reverberated throughout st marys by the way domagk nodded towards ehrlichs photograph its a myth that he had to investigate arsenicals before discovering salvarsan but he examined a good number and slaughtered whole armies of mice in the corridor outside we found professor hцrlein emerging from the lab where we had met from the way domagk stepped back i sensed hцrlein was an important person in the factory but he said to me pleasantly enough youve come a long way to our city of wuppertal herr elgar i hope youll find it an interesting place everyone seemed to damn wuppertal with the faint noncommittal praise of eine interessante stadt the elberfeld rathaus has an excellent museum and there is a remarkable old church in the kolk you have already visited our splendid lauretuiskirke doubtless domagk smiled wuppertal cannot offer a great deal of amusement for a young man its hardly paris nicht water theres the cinema and i expect you enjoy the company of frдulein dieffenbach professor hцrlein shook hands i expect we shall see each other again but we did not until he was on trial for his life at nьrnberg well what do you expect frдulein dieffenbach used an unnaturally sharp voice for arguments or when she was embarrassed or chiding me about the puddles i left on the bathroom floor we supposed everything would be settled in accordance with the famous fourteen points because after all president wilson was a lawyer so he could produce a just agreement in an intelligent way without emotion or malice whoever heard of a lawyer stopping a battle i askedin german because she spoke hardly any english the americans obviously she replied primly the americans think you can fix anything if you hire a smart enough attorney thats exactly the remark i should have expected from you herr elgar she was a schoolmistress and she reproved me in her best schoolmistress manner which sat on her as grotesquely as the broadbrimmed flat black hat she was in the act of unpinning her hair was so blonde it suggested an albino and she wore it coiled in plaits over her ears resembling a telephone girls headphones like any educated young man who cant take things seriously you imagine that you are aa rochefoucauld she said flatteringly not being able to think of anyone else president wilson was a great idealist on the contrary he was only a great optimist well whats wrong with that relying on the best in people but its disastrous every leader whos tried has been painfully disappointed ever since jesus christ now youve gone too far gerda dieffenbach was a catholic unlike most inhabitants of wuppertal renowned in germany as a nest of stinging protestant sects she was a year or so older than me tall and greyeyed always in appalling long serge skirts and a plain white blouse freshly laundered every day she never used cosmetics or scent or even bath salts she smelt wholesomely of household soap she argued with me because i was the first englishman she had met in her life and because argument is flirtation with intelligent young women who are not sure of themselves i did not really argue at all i teased enjoying the delicious spectacle of her pink with indignation her soft mouth open breathlessly it was early evening that same saturday and we were in the shabby room where everyone ate and sat at the front of dr dieffenbachs house near the zoo it was not a large house and her father had to have his surgery the waiting room and his small library aromatic with cigars the gesellschaftszimmer across the narrow tilepaved hall was filled with massive dark furniture and curtained with crimson plush even the subjects of its solidlyframed family portraits looking uncomfortable it was kept shuttered and unheated mercifully reserved for important visitors who by german custom always occupied in solitude the ugly horsehair sofa gerda had just come in from shopping her father was attending a patient her mother gone visiting and her twelveyearold brother gunter somewhere out of the way i could smell our evening meal cooking behind the double doors leading towards the kitchen and faintly hear the wireless and the two maids calling to one another germany accepted the fourteen points on october so that the bloodshed might be ended gerda continued relentlessly then you dictated whatever terms you felt like at versailles and tried to ruin us in the name of reparations well how could you expect herr hitler to like that why shouldnt you pay reparations the kaiser had planned the war for twenty years oh the kaiser she dismissed him impatiently i cant understand why you english never saw through him he was a braggart who simply faded out during the war we looked to hindenburg and ludendorff who ran everything it was the kaisers uboat campaign it was england who first made war by starving little children with the blockade admit it nowgo on i can remember perfectly well not getting enough to eat mama standing for hours on end just to buy a cup of watery milk or a spoonful of jam made from beetroot we had to take down all our net curtains and cut them into bandages for the wounded youve been reading too many english papers mister she shut her lips firmly sitting at the large circular table covered by a pink chenille cloth taking a pile of exercise books from the black leather bag she had brought home that saturday lunchtime she put on a pair of goldrimmed glasses and started to correct the childrens answers gerda was unusual in earning her living in a land which preached the doctrine of kinder kirche kьchechildren church and kitchento its womenfolk as sternly as ever only one german woman in five worked and they mostly toiled on the farm or in the homes of others and to be a teacher of history in a girls elementary school was a position of high importance and respect i sat and opened the wuppertaler zeitung in deferential silence it was less than a month since i had left a nation of three million unemployed for one of five million it had been an act of dizzy sophistication to take the boat train at charing cross and plunge across the channel in a wretched little steamer with its midwinter handful of nauseated passengers i had never been abroad before nor even lived away from my parents except in the narcissistic air of cambridge i had travelled overnight and through ostend as a few shillings cheaper the belgian train had smelt excitingly of coffee and strange tobacco and even the direction do not lean out of the window written in french had a worldly ring i encountered before only in the library novels of somerset maugham and dornford yates i had sat on a wooden bench in a cramped thirdclass compartment like a prisoner in a black maria face pressed against a dark window running with sleet imagination making do for the passing countryside i knew nothing of belgium except that nurse cavell was shot there at aachen i crossed the frontier of germany the land to whom nature gave no frontiers displaying my brand new passport signed by sir john simon observing that faintly sinister air of leisure which invests the movements of officials at frontier stations which struck christopher isherwood but isherwood went to wicked delicious berlinor invented it wuppertal was as staid as a dishful of dumplings i reached the rhineland on the last afternoon of the cafйs glowing yellow and people starting to toast prosit neujahr i knew i should need strenuous and painful mental gymnastics seeing war and peace from the opposite side of the north sea the great war had stamped british thought with a black edge like the writing paper then fashionable for proclaiming bereavement massive monuments had been built above the gently rolling graveyards of the somme and the menin gate in ypres both encrusted with thousands of names all that was left of men lost in the battlefield for ever at home the village war memorial shared the green with the oaks and men doffed their hats passing the cenotaph in whitehall or had them knocked off from behind everyone shared an experience lost with the middle ages of knowing a countryman who had died untimely my uncle jim had been fragmented at hazebrouck in the last german push of a regular soldier he had survived four years so promising of promotion without even rising to the rank of adolf hitler we british wanted to hang the kaiser for it all but this war aim was unachieved like all the others kaiser bill was securely in exile in doom peacefully reading p g wodehouse aloud to his family and repeating all the passages which struck him as particularly funny i knew the germans had suffered as badly or worse but they did not want to hang anyone because they did not know who to hang they went into confused and helpless as bitter with old leaders as old enemies what were you doing going to see professor dr domagk this morning asked gerda unable to suppress her curiosity any longer dont be nosy oh im sorry she looked so crushed that i felt ashamed i was learning how tender she was she was aggressive only in her defencelessness she feared to slacken the tight rein on her emotions lest they drove her headlong i was bringing him a present from another professor i told her relenting her face brightened all women being interested in presents even for other people something nice a long lecture reprinted as a pamphlet on best quality paper and signed by the author that doesnt sound very exciting academic personages often exchange their lectures with a great flourish of politeness its like gentlemen with their visiting cards she returned her eyes to her work i thought you might be seeing professor dr domagk to find a better job why im perfectly happy where i am i cant understand how an intelligent chemist like you can bring himself to work in a brewery she said with contempt louis pasteur worked with fermenting wine and now theres statues of him all over france the american pays you a good salary particularly with the rate of exchange gerda said thoughtfully she had quickly ferreted the figure out of me i could not decide whether her seriousminded concern for my welfare was flattering or irritating but why come to germany you could have sailed to india like all the other english or australia or africa theres no future in germany not if things go on as they are i dont fancy myself as a pukka sahib with a topi and a fly whisk the empire provided the british nation with easygoing if warmish jobs cheap food and a sense of purpose though it was a cardboard palace glittering and showy in the sunshine artfully realistic with its plumed hats and gorgeous uniforms and battleships firing ceremonial salvos of blank ammunition doomed since it saw defeat down the rifles of a few boer farmers hitler never realized this before the day he shot himself i dont know that i should like to meet your friend herr beckerman she went on he sounds like a gangster youd find him charming hes more like an allamerica footballer im lucky to work for him jeff beckerman had been looking for a reliable chemist in london on his way from new york and sir edward tiplady had mentioned my name while treating him for some small ailment at the savoy young jeff always selected the best hotels as well as the best doctors i hope none of the beer reaches america then you would be participating in something illegal prohibitions on its way out i reassured her it was futile of president wilson trying to save the american people from the horrors of drink by passing a lot of laws in just as futile as trying to save the whole world from the horrors of war by passing a lot more in dont tell me im a cynic i wagged my finger im a chemist so i look at life practically talking about americans theres a super musical film on next week called blondie of the follies its got marion davies in it how about coming along this invitation caused her schoolmistresss redink fountain pen to pause in midair and her cheeks to turn the colour of the tablecloth whatever made you think of such a thing she reprimanded me professor dr domagk he said the only items i could find amusing in wuppertal were the cinema and your company the professor would never make a remark like that ask your father to telephone and find out you mustnt mention a word of this to papa she exclaimed delightfully flustered gerda saw my invitation as a serious matter with serious implications she seemed not to haveor she did not dare to haveany casual men friends she was thought in the tail of childhood in an age when marriage was an excitement preserved until the third decade when contraception was unreliable unobtainable and unmentionable when abortion carried a prison sentence and the maidenhead had not yet suffered the fate of much else and become disposable relations between men and women were wary and ceremonious sex a delicate dish rather than a staple diet such attitudes were particularly strong in the middleclasses in catholics in germany and in girls like gerda she added of course herr elgar i enjoy discussing international politics with you because you are intelligent and have been to cambridge university but i thought you regarded me as a sensible woman whom you could talk to in a dispassionate way thats precisely why i want to ask you to the pictures but i almost never go the cinema she said by way of another objection in one so seriouslyminded as yourself frдulein dieffenbach i countered selfdenial is but another pleasure as you insist i shall ask mama if it would be all right she said more cheerfully shifting responsibility i was calmly confident i had noticed how she generally contrived to take the same schwebebahn to work every morning as myself this is a story of drugs not politics i am a biochemist not a historian but it is also the story of a coincidence which occurred in germany over thirtyseven days astride silversterabend new years eve the second of these dates was monday january the better schooled of my present biochemistry students in london can identify it as the day which ushered adolf hitler to power and so comparable with st peters day when the buboes of the black death first festered upon englishmen among the sailors of melcombe regis in dorset the earlier date was december even my fellowprofessors can remember nothing in particular about that christmas eve which suggests that the evil of the s lives after them the good was interred with the hurried riddance of their bones the cauldron of german democracy which had been simmering fitfully for fourteen years since its flame was lit in the haunts of goethe and schiller at weimar came furiously to the boil that saturday when i first met gerhard domagk and nobody realized that the brew was already poisoned no party had a majority in the reichstag though the naziswhich was slang to match sozi for socialistwere the biggest after advancing sensationally to seats in the elections of the previous july they always seemed to be having elections in germany during the past year the rhineland had seen fivetwo for the reinstatement of president hindenburg another for a prussian parliament which vanished almost immediately in a local coup dйtat and two more for the reichstag they were neither the decorous cricket match contests of england nor the raucous carnivals of america they were violent bloody and murderous since the collapse of hermann mailers coalition government in there was still democracy in germany but it was democracy gone mad like a man gripped with mania who performs lifes normal functions of sitting standing and speaking with a fury which seems liable to tear him to pieces over the same period berlin had seen three reich chancellors the austere catholic heinrich brьning had been ousted in may by a fiftyfour year old political dilettante the gentleman showjumper franz von papen lion faced and serpent hearted his name was already known to the world from being thrown out of washington early in the great war a neutral diplomat trying to blow up the united states railroads the gentleman showjumper recruited other gentlemen to his barons cabinet from the fashionable herrenklub in the vosstrasse of berlin as british prime ministers enlisted their schoolfriends from eton but before christmas sly von papen was outfoxed by the affable sharpnosed portly socialist general kurt von schleicher whose name in german meant artful dodger very appropriately to discredit his predecessor chancellor von schleicher fired the haystack of the osthilfe scandal which had diverted millions of marks for agricultural relief in east prussia into the pockets of the estateowning junkers but as so hearteningly happens in politics the flames had blown back on him that saturday morning he had resigned after fiftyseven days of office in which he complained he had been betrayed fiftyseven times the same saturday the government of france fell too even more precociously a sinister coincidence for the sore continent of europe all weekend berlin wriggled with intrigue like a fishermans tin of worms from which a new imperial chancellor had needs to be pulled by the president fieldmarshal paul von hindenburg was phlegmatic narrow devious benevolent fearsomely moustached the eternal victor of tannenberg over the russians in the first months of the great war the heroic embodiment of militafrommhis countrymens exasperating awe of the sword hindenburg had displaced the first president of the brandnew republic friedrich ebert he was put up to the job by his old crony grand admiral von tirpitz who felt the country would be better presided over by a shade from the hohenzollern monarchy than a saddler from heidelberg hindenburg was voted to power by germans with no love of a republic at any price he had officiated for eight years impartially incorruptibly and ineffectively and his mind was now dimmed with the mists of eightysix winters at eleventhirty on the monday morninghalf an hour late through a lastminute squabble over the tantalizingly ripened fruits of officea ragbag of politicians trooped from the room of state secretary otto von meissner to the audience chamber of the presidential palace in berlin only three of the dozen were nazis all subdued in dark suits there was the beetlebrowed shy policeman wilhelm frick who had spied on his own headquarters at munich hermann gцring with a pearl tiepin and adolf hitler displaying nothing more minatory than a party badge in his lapel the gentleman showjumper franz von papen did the honours of introduction the president leaning on his stick grown pettishly impatient vitalized the new imperial cabinet by breathing upon it a few platitudes he had still to appoint his new chancellor the office had been the gift of kaiser wilhelm the weimar constitution had subjected it to the reichstag but there were hands ready to twist the constitution into any desired shape the appointment was open to doubt until sealed by the oath of office goebbels and the other top nazis were waiting in the nearby kaiserhof hotel extremely nervously only the previous thursday hindenburg had sworn again that he would never invest with the mantle of bismarck a bohemian corporal he never even offered hitler a chair when he called but hindenburg saw the corporal as a prisoner in a coalition he would be defused he would be disposed of only a fortnight previously von schleicher had declared hitler no longer a danger nor even a political problem but a thing of the past so had the socialist messiah harold laski in london the corporal became the chancellor later he became the president he was the last before adenauer in between the world entered times when god and his saints slept as men once said about those of king stephen i was unaware of stepping across three days which shakily bridged the new europe from the old i was far more concerned taking gerda to the pictures this was partly because the trivia of human existence continue with the resilience of human life itself and partly because citizens of the british empire had the reputation for walking the world with an air of supreme indifference towards the natives we went to the cinema the following thursday night gerda changed from her habitual serge to a blue and white cotton dress in bold stripes reaching almost to her ankles which i selfflatteringly suspected to be new and perhaps even bought for the occasion a small round furtrimmed hat turned her disquietingly from a goodlooking schoolmistress to a pretty girl the family and the two maids gathered in the hall to wave us off we might have been starting on our honeymoon we took the schwebebahn for ten stops to the old market station across at barmen we found the market square itself packed with an excited crowd there was another nazi demonstration a march of the sturmabteilungen the sa hitlers storm troopers the brownshirts germany had been locked for years in a brawl of private armies the sturmabteilungen against the communists rote frontkampfer squads of the exservicemens stahlhelm and the social democrats reichsbanner schwarzrotgold waiting to be at somebodys throat in the sidelines the storm troopers of well outnumbered the troops of the german army they were recruited from street corners and given clothing food and a sense of identity when the government signally failed to provide all three england had luckily rid herself of such bands with the fifteenthcentury wars of the roses america escaped themthe civil war was a far more official affair ulster suffers them to the day i write much that i then saw in germany reminded me of ireland during the worst of the troubles which coloured the daily papers of my childhood we could hardly move in the square everyone was shouting and jerking their right arms into the nazi salute the storm troopers wore brown shirts breeches and jackboots the sam browne leather crossbelt of british officers and the peaked cap of american baseball players germans bathe voluptuously in the warmth of crowds losing their identity and insecurity they love and honour uniforms they instinctively obey rank i stood on the pavement tucking my trinity scarf into my lapels against the cold i remembered the story about the extras in a german war film lunching in the agfa studio canteen automatically dividing into actors playing officers at the head of the table and other ranks below the salt the brownshirts were of course nothing like the cleancut sternfaced ranks of the party photographs and posters in common with the rest of mankind storm troopers came in all sizes skinny and paunchy lanky and dwarfish adolescent and middleaged people in the crowd were singing snatches of the horst wessel lied the nazi anthem written by a berlin pastors son who went to the bad and got himself killed in the streets and achieved like many other stupid people only martyrdom the tunes one virtue seemed to me a capability of being sung by absolutely everybody like its a long way to tipperary they tramped in columns of four at their heads drummers and flags the swastika had been familiar enough in german streets since the summer of when it was suggested to hitler as an emblem by his dentist and run into a flag on a housewifes sewingmachine as gerda halfsaluted and halfwaved i noticed her eyes wide and brilliant in the gaslight you see she said excitedly stimulated by the show and infected with the surrounding emotion now we can start taking pride in our country again my only feeling was pain that foreigners behaved in so exaggerated a manner it occurred to neither of us that the force embodied in that procession would shortly leave europe strewn with corpses like autumn leaves as casually to be gathered and burnt we pushed our way through the onlookers i bought gerda some chocolate we sat at the back of the cinema and she let me hold her hand which soon became very damp she stared at the hollywood musical with the same innocent admiration as at the marching storm troopers anonymous and unseen in the darkness she became unnaturallyor perhaps naturallygirlish it may have been wirklichkeitsflucht a flight from reality from the joyless and inhibited life of an illpaid state employee in the rigid society of wuppertal forever whispering over its fences and peeping through its lace curtains nazism itself had foundations of the same fantasy then something happened an incident so trivial and unhurtful in its gruesome context that it invited only forgetfulness but hairtriggers fire heavy charges in the human mind perhaps it saved a ripe soul from the nazis the nazis disapproved of blondie of the follies it was american it was bourgeoise it was degenerate it had the fingerprints of jews all over it they had a welltried technique for exhibiting such displeasure in summer they loosed moths which flew into the limelight in winter they let free mice or rats we were in for a different demonstration two men in raincoats to which they had added swastika armbands jumped to the stage with its screen amid the potted palms and ripped the material to ribbons with sheathknives the projector flickered out the house lights went up everybody fell dumb once visible the pair appeared as barely grown boys who contented themselves with flinging jeers at the heads of the audience and made off within a month or two such cinematic entertainments were to be banished from german soil until betty grable arrived on the heels of the american army i turned to see what gerda had made of it she was in tears biting her knuckles shaking with anger oh the swine she cried in disappointment the swine spoiling my evening perhaps we can get our money back i suggested taking the practical view why did they want to do that why did they i was so enjoying it lets go and have some coffee instead it was all so innocent so nice why did they want to spoil it she repeated furiously the film doesnt fit in with their politics i suppose what have politics to do with going to the cinema she demanded ive been looking forward to this evening ever since i first thought you were trying to ask me we had a cup of coffee and went home naturally we never got our money back but gerda remembered the evening she laughed when i reminded her last summer in the little gravel and shrub garden of her house near the zoo at wuppertal a town now as bright and glittering in the smokeless air as wordsworths london the wupper between banks of well clipped municipal grass beneath the schwebebahn as sweetly flowing as edmund spensers thames wuppertal has become so clean and odourless she says it is like living in a convalescent hospital the big black dog became a monster with eyes of firelit emeralds the white steeproofed cottage which it guarded dazzled us for a second then reeled into the darkness we sped through a cramped village with an angular elegantly spired church and past farmhouses cheerlessly black countrymen the world over turning their backs on the night on a hill i caught the turreted outline of a schloss ahead wet bare trees snow falling thinly between them and swirling on the ground as it never did in england broad sheaves of telephone wires undulating gently from post to post as far as we could see it was about eight in the evening of monday february a fortnight after my excursion with gerda jeff beckerman was taking me for a night out in cologne the distance was about thirty miles the road running south along the river wupper through solingen a town famous like sheffield for scissors and knives the autobahn still lay in the mind of germanys new ruler with a lot of other things jeff beckerman laughed youre scared im not used to motoring i said shortly my father could never have owned a car even when mr morris of oxford was putting wheels under the british masses she could do a hundred miles an hour if the road was good i watched uneasily as the speedometer needle hovered round sixty jeff drove a car which i had never heard of before nor seen since a cord l phaeton which he had shipped extravagantly from america in contempt for the bugattis and bentleys the delahayes and alfas which fulfilled the need for mobility and cutting a dash among europes young bloods it was long and white its silvery headlights a foot across its running boards merging into a pair of front mudguards as elegant as an actresss eyebrows i am a mechanical ignoramus but i gathered that it was designed by a man called erret lobban cord to be propelled through the front wheels and that our whitewalltyred spares were strapped either side of the enormous flat bonnet because these front wheels had a tendency to fall off berlin was fantastiche utterly fantastiche the word had just superseded wunderbar in jeff beckermans conversation berlins nothing like wuppertal its nothing like the rest of germany its like america only more like america than america could ever dareyou get me berlins real the skins torn off you can see the raw flesh and nerves underneath i had the feeling that no one was playing a part not the girls in the cabarets the pimps and the crooks they revel in what theyre doing even the whores put their heart and soul into their job my employer did not spend much time in wuppertal he preferred leaving his brewery to herr fritsch the greyfaced elderly manager in his pincenez and butterfly as the germans called a wing collar jeff was interested in germany in the bouncy way he was interested in women or his car he regarded his exile as an educative jaunt before returning to new york and getting down to the serious business of making a million what about our brownshifted friends i asked didnt they spoil your fun why should they old man jeff often used this expression which is sprinkled on english conversation like salt but always getting it a little wrong by putting the emphasis on the end sounding slightly sneering you dont have to walk into trouble neither in berlin nor chicago you dont rate adolf hitlers gangsters more dangerous than al capones i dont capone runs a gang of crooks hitlers are disciplined like the army with his teeth he pulled off his leather gauntlet a reflector of chiselled red glass on the backthe latest thing for displaying driving signals from the pocket of his anklelength black leather motoring coat a trophy from berlin he produced a packet of chesterfields what are the newspapers saying about hitler in england i dont know my mother sends me the sunday graphic every week but it seems filled with pictures of the royal family i lit the cigarette jutting from his full lips jeff was five or six years older than me red faced and too fleshy but still giving the impression of an athlete he wore his brown hair en brosse his heavy eyebrows transecting his face as a single bar he enjoyed a longstanding intimacy with money which reduced it to a reckoning in his daily plans no more intrusive than breathing like many americans his life was a tropical sea of hedonism traversed by occasional icebergs of puritanism his father owned chemical companies in new york statebut of course he was making a fortune from bootlegging the beckermans brewed beer long before dropping their final n en route from hamburg to ellis island and would brew it again when american thirsts might be legally slaked jeff enjoyed a simultaneous reverence and contempt for academics with first class degrees like myself he respected me as the only man in wuppertal with whom he could hold an intelligent conversation but he would have offhandedly packed me home with barely the fare in my pocket he could be very simple or very shrewd equally infuriatingly he might have inhabited the america of scott fitzgerald which vanished in a similar puff of misunderstanding ridicule nostalgia and shame as the british empire the great gatsby had been on bookshelves for seven years but i doubt if he had read it jeff only read books which helped him to get on the journey was boneshaking snow seeping round the celluloid sidescreen jeff had lent me his raccoon coat and i still wore my trinity scarf the road ran close to the huge pharmaceutical works at leverkusen a blue circle in the sky as tall as the factory chimneys which supported it proclaiming twice bayer the words crossed at the y kцln glittered in the diamonds of a road sign i had not returned there since new years eve when i had changed trains at the hauptbahnhof in the shadow of its dazzling skyscraper of a cathedral jeff took the hohenzollern bridge across the rhine the river which flows through the german soul he cursed the far end of the bridge was blocked by another of the uniformed processions which crawled like worms over the body of germany this one presented the torchlight red on sweaty faces the brown shirts were stamping between the cathedral and the tankgasse small knots of spectators in the falling snow raising arms through enthusiasm or prudence while flankers pressed pamphlets upon them jeff had to stop the ends of the bridge the walls everywhere were plastered with posters hitler had dissolved the reichstag there was to be yet another election the following sunday march as a foreigner i found neither significance nor even identity in the dreary gallery of political facesexcept adolf hitlers as instantly recognizable today with his lower middleclass austrian little man moustache which you still see decorating streetcleaners and tram conductors in vienna deutschland eswache cried the nazis posters they had stolen the vivid red of their communist archenemies their message in gothic type always angry vituperative and vile and always highly effective waiting patiently i recalled how cologne had recently shone in the political news the gentleman showjumper franz von papen had craftily made a secret rendezvous there with hitler behind the back of chancellor artful dodger kurt von schleicherwho got wind of it planted a spy with a camera and had it over the next mornings newspapers hitler anyway regarded the gentleman showjumper as a joke so absurd a joke that he later planned to provoke his invasion of austria in by having ambassador papen in vienna spectacularly murdered there doesnt seem to be any trouble jeff tapped the steeringwheel with his reflecting gauntlets the jews keep well out of sight and the communists choose their own time and place to trail their coat i guess everyone else is too cold or too scared and staying home this sort of game is played in berlin every nightyou should have seen it when hitler became chancellor the sa in thousands parading in the tiergarten and marching in columns through the brandenburger tor and along the unter den linden there was nothing of a rabble about it everything was very military bands playing and the marchers singing their heads off what was the reaction rapturous you know how the germans love a torchlight procession he flicked up another chesterfield and they say old hindenburg looked down from his window muttering du lieber gott i never knew wed taken so many russian prisoners we were making for a cabaret called the sphinx of which jeff had heard from some fantastiche girl called heike in berlin it was hardly the famous parisian sphinx where i wentoff limitswith the americans after the liberation and where girls did strange things with cigarettes we discovered a narrow dark doorway a sequence of white electric bulbs writing sphinx continually above it was somewhere in the old town within the elbow of the rhine between the hohenzollern bridge and the suspension bridge to the south near the gurzenich the building where laws were made for the holy roman empire through the unhappy propensity of europeans for blowing up each others cities the whole area is now replaced by orderly pedestrian precincts providing all services from supermarkets to sex shops the lobby was flanked with panels of coloured glass depicting palms pyramids and camels symbols of greater romance and mystery to the germans than the british who policed them jeffs brow clouded it clearly was not a patch on fantastiche berlin but i was excited enough never having been inside a cabaret before down a narrow staircase hung a crimson plush curtain guarded by a german in fez and tasselled uniform suggesting an advertisement for abdullah turkish cigarettes the management tired abruptly of eastern pretence beyond was a long brightlylit basement resembling a teashop with wall mirrors and small wicker tables under white fringed cloths each with a numbered card in a bamboo holder and an oldfashioned telephone at the far end the curtain was down on a small stage and two men in tails played how deep is the ocean on piano and drums as though it were a march attendance was thin the weather and political turmoil not being conducive to carefree nights out in berlin theres men dressed as women and women dressed as men complained jeff the waiter in a floorsweeping apron suggested champagne jeff ordered beer he sat back in his fragilelooking gilt chair lighting another cigarette and scowling his black and white check tweeds came from savile row his silk shirt from florence his foulard tie from the rue de rivoli he dressed his part as man of the world if you want a girl you call up her table number he explained nodding towards some gaudily dressed women sitting alone or in pairs against the walls but my attention was diverted by waiters equipping the patrons at tables near the stage with long bibs of red rubber i was speculating what fancy dish might be on its way when the curtain rose to a roll on the drums revealing a small roped boxing ring a mirror sloping above into which a melancholy man in a long white coat was tipping buckets of greenish mud jeff stuck his thumb in his top waistcoat pocket were going to see a couple of girls wrestling in mud why mud i asked in surprise girls wrestling would be unusual enough for me it has to be in mud the germans have a genius for the extreme it was a coy even lugubrious entertainment one girl was freshfaced and solidlybuilt good looking in a farmyard way the other was pale and sad seeming in need of a square meal both were dressed for the beach in white rubber bathing caps and anklelength robes of dazzlingly patterned towelling removed to reveal swimsuits demurely skirted across the tops of their thighs they climbed into the ring and braced themselves against the ropes like the prizefighters in the newsreels the band broke into franz von suppйs light cavalry they fell upon each other standing in the mud with their breasts pressed together slapping each others buttocks this elections going to be a walkover for hitler jeff was affecting intense tedium hes got big business in his pocketi heard in berlin how sacht and gцring fixed it the music stopped the wrestlers separated standing in their corners glistening with green mud their heaving breasts decrying any sham in the struggle jeff lit another cigarette hey have you read hitlers book mein kampf i shook my head this fantastiche girl heike translated bits for me you talk politics with whores do you jeff looked offended shes a student learning english i have since smelt through its flatulent pages they expose the authors contempt for the mass of his fellowgermans and his greatest respect for the englishso much for our great war prime minister the reader might imagine that lloyd george knew hitlers father it spelt out the fьhrers plans with such determined precision it is unfortunate that it was not translated in bed to an english statesman by some other wayward student of his language the bout restarted the girls entwined on their floor of mud flicking the rubber bibs of the nearest spectators only the army can stop hitler now jeff continued why should they hes hardly a pacifist but hes an upstart and the germans are even worse snobs than the english the pale girl grabbed the larger one between the legs tipping her overhead into the mud then sitting astride her waist the pair were barely distinguishable covered with green slime one of the big girls breasts plunged free from her slippery bathingsuit that was as rehearsed as the gestures in hitlers speeches observed jeff i quoted comte de mirabeau other states have an army in prussia the army has a state jeff countered this with a grin what do you expect in a country which calls war the continuation of foreign policy by other means clausewitz remark was irresponsible and immoral at least it was logical the thin girl was acclaimed the winner both disappeared for a shower the waiters began untying the red rubber bibs within six months this entertainment would be banned in germany along with the music of mendelssohn and the novels of thomas mann then i noticed at a table against the wall the dark slav girl from professor domagks laboratory she looks a pretty thing why dont you call her up jeff indicated the telephone dont be ridiculous shed be dreadfully embarrassed i had recounted our meeting in the laboratory at wuppertal shes peddling her ass she isnt in the position to be embarrassed about anything youre not a sissy are you of course im not jeff was kidding as an englishman chaffed but i could never be certain how thick his cushion of amiability was between jest and truth in the end i thought it wise to invite her she rose wearily not recognizing me until about to sit down at our table i introduced herr beckerman aus amerika and asked whats your name magda youre not from cologne surely from vienna she crossed her hands modestly in the lap of her mauve shotsilk dress i noticed how much more heavily made up she was dont i g farben pay enough she gave an unfriendly look im of a large family she added as though she were moonlighting as a respectable waitress or shopgirl everyone has to take a second job in germany ask what she wants to drink interrupted jeff in english impatient at exclusion from the conversation champagne magda said automatically we held a threecornered conversation in english and german over the bottle jeff never learned german partly from impatience and partly because he feared the natives could outsmart him in their own language magda smiled as i translated his gallantries but she struck me as acting badly the fine de joie how much does she charge jeff enquired abruptly magda told me fifty marks about four pounds why dont you go with her asked jeff amiably he took out his wallet and fluttered a fiftymark note on the table ill grubstake youif thats the correct expression dont be ridiculous i couldnt possibly pick up a girl so blatantly a man who goes off with a whore in secret is like a man who goes off drinking in secret if i kept either from my friends id be ashamed of myself jeffs tone had become abrasive but i was more frightened of the girl than of him two years ago incited by the easygoing tales of fellowundergraduates at trinity who were richer and worldlier than myself i had shopped along the gaudy pavements of londons west end and picked up a tart near marble arch though i had saved for three months i could not afford the best and in my subsequent remorse feared that i had picked the worst i had sponged the parts involved with dilute hydrochloric acid which suggested itself to a chemistry student as a promising antiseptic the result was a raw redness for which i dared invoke neither medical advice nor friendly sympathy and i had no wish to find myself repeating the experiment but jeff pressed me with the amiable wickedness of a man watching another slide into his own sins i gave in magda told us that she lived beyond the hohenstaufenring the first arc of boulevards and squares which spread round old cologne like the ripples from a stone jeff offered us a lift magda suddenly became animated as she climbed into the cord lightly touching the steeringwheel the shiny instruments the gear lever and brake in openmouthed reverence it struck me that she had never before been in a car at all ein wunderbarer auto she breathed fantastiche jeff corrected her glowing with satisfaction as he pulled on his gauntlets magda stopped us at the corner of mozartstrasse a broad and prosperous street saying we could walk the rest she clearly did not wish to arrive in such grandeur jeff said he would find a bar and call heike in berlin he had an extravagance towards tile telephone which i thought admirably american ill be back in half an hourhave a good time he called roaring away and leaving a smell of highgrade petrol i selfconsciously took magdas arm in equal parts aroused and ashamed without speaking a word she led me towards a narrow sidestreet lying in the glow of a sickly gaslamp i had imagined our destination some disreputable small hotel or buginfested lodginghouse as she opened the green door in a fourstoried narrow terrace dwelling i realized with alarm that i was being taken home the tiny hallway was unlit i followed her towards a narrow flight of stairs with broken banisters in gaslight seeping from a door above a small boy and girl were grinning at me i stopped desire fled vice in such domestic surroundings was ridiculous i dont want to i said magda turned youll still have to pay me i pushed at her jeffs fiftymark note which she folded carefully and put in her large brown handbag i turned to the door eager to be out of the place then i imagined myself standing half an hour on a freezing street corner could i have some coffee i asked plaintively silently magda led me to a kitchen downstairs at the back stonefloored and lit by the glow of the stove an old man smoking his pipe rose and left at once bowing to me with a deference which doubled my feelings of guilt magda removed her imitation leather overcoat and lit the gasmantle i heard scuffling upstairs the house was as crammed with humans as a warren with rabbits youve a large family you said four brothers she added sourly all out of work was that your father yes she moved a saucepan of coffee on to the black iron stove hes an engineer but he lost everything when the mark fell to zero so did everyone else of course she spoke as if describing a bad summer which had ruined their holidays i sat at a small rough wooden table which smelt of onions how long have you been at i g farben since the summer i should have been a chemist you know im well educated but in germany today nobody can achieve what they deserve all i do is keep the place clean and look after the laboratory animals whats professor dr domagk like to work for he likes to keep himself to himself hes all right except when anyone makes a mistake not just me one of the other doctors or chemists then he just blows up she screwed a fingertip against her temple his mind works so fast hes always a jump ahead what sort of dyes is the professor trying to turn into medicines i asked partly from curiosity partly from mischievousness over their secrecy she replied in her dull way how should i know almost every day another compound comes to be tested from dr mietzsch and dr klarer i had the feeling of meeting an acquaintance in a foreign land i had heard at cambridge of dr fritz mietzsch the chemist who in had synthesized a drug for the treatment of malaria the disease had formerly been dosed with quinine natures product from cinchona bark in peruthe jesuits bark which the agueracked oliver cromwell stoutly refused to let stick in his throat sitting in magdas kitchen i remembered that the name of mietzschs new antimalarial chemical was mepacrine hydrochloride but that i g farben had dressed it in the fancy title of atebrin i also recalled that mepacrine hydrochloride was an acridine derivative a bright yellow synthetic dye was domagk trying to cure other tropical infections i wondered but domagk had spoken to me of using dyes against various bacteria which to the precise scientist did not mean the parasites causing malaria or other tropical diseases but the streptococcus and staphylococcus and tubercule bacillus which swarmed so richly round mankind everywhere i repeated what dyes why are you so interested were you sent to germany as a spy she poured the coffee into a pair of enamel mugs secrets and cheese go bad with keeping frдulein people begin to smell them are they yellow acridine dyes i persisted as she sat beside me remember ive given you fifty marks tonight it makes no difference to me if i spend half an hour with you down here or upstairs she jerked her head upwards im forced into it by the system she continued bitterly by whats happening in germany everyone at each others throats and the politicians in berlin squabbling like washerwomen perhaps everything will change with hitler he certainly seems to know whats wanted but i admire you doing that to provide for your family whats admirable in degradation its a matter of motives nicht water killing people was widely advertised as highly admirable during the war she sipped her coffee for some time in silence well mister englishman sympathys not something i enjoy every day i assure you i dont suppose it makes much difference if i tell you theyre red azosulphonamide dyes that was interesting i was familiar enough with sulphonamide but i had never heard of its use for killing bacteria they dont work like ordinary disinfectants she said theyre not like carbolic or formalin professor domagk injects them into infected mice do the mice live or die die have you got a cigarette i dont smoke as she felt in her handbag for a packet of cigarettes she produced a folded sheet of paper have that if you like the mice dont always die there was a lot of excitement in the lab just before christmas one of the dyes which dr mietzsch and dr klarer sent up to be tested was very successful that chit will tell you all you want dont let anyone see it i should never have taken it she lit a cigarette we talked for some time about the coming election german politics lloyd george she rose and thrust into the stove a piece of jagged wood from a pile apparently scrounged from fences or dilapidated buildings i had a moment to open the paper and observe a printed list of different bacteria down one side scrawled writing down the other i was intending to sell it magda said frankly but i should never meet anyone who might be interested the american will be back she added reaching for her coat magda turned out the gas as we left i could see the two children again eyeing us from the stairs and whispering excitedly over our parade of wickedness we walked arm and arm to the street corner the snow had stopped you are a chemist mein herr i nodded she made a circular gesture round her face you have the look of an english lord i laughed where do you live in london yes in a big house in harley street youve heard of that she shook her head you travel to wuppertal every day on the train it makes a hole in my pocket couldnt you find a job nearer home is that a joke perhaps youre right and life will get better under hitler thats what people are saying some dont care for him of course the jews and the profiteers but hitler means business you can tell that from the way he speaks hes the only one up there in berlin with the welfare of the ordinary people at heart what do you suppose schleicher and papen and the rest are interested in lining their own pockets look at that disgraceful osthilfe affair what about the communists oh the communists they take their orders from moscow hitler will soon put paid to them thank god they frighten the life out of me she threw her halffinished cigarette into the gutter as we reached the main road jeff was in the cord just round the corner hey do you know what he opened the drivers door i just got through to berlin the reichstags gone up in smoke the whole towns out in the streets looking at it it started around nine this evening the skys as red as dawn and theyre expecting the dome to fall in any minute i translated the news to magda a pity the deputies werent all inside she said we dropped her at the sphinx jeff not bothering to switch off the engine she hurried inside to find another customer as she waved from the doorway with its camels and palm trees i raised my right arm and called jokingly heil hitler she returned a smile the first i had seen from her i never encountered this early supporter of hitler again but she was a slav and doubtless ended with a red line ruled through her name in a concentration camp the red crown brewery was in barmen the opposite end of wuppertal to the i g farben works it was a much smaller but equally hybrid collection of wood and red brick exhaling the same black smoke from its tall chimneys the brewing was done in a tall narrow building with gothic windows and turrets like a selfconfident chapel in south wales it had been there since the s breathing its spicy smell over the area like a genial benediction my cupboardlike laboratory was on the top floor of the administration block over the office which jeff beckerman shared with herr fritsch the manager in the butterfly collar when i arrived at eightthirty the morning after our jaunt to cologne i was surprised to find jeff in the lab already he was smoking a chesterfield and holding a bottle i recognized as a famous brand of london gin hey that reichstag fires sure started something he greeted me excitedly ive just been on to our agent in berlin theyve got the man who set it alight hes a dutchman called van der lubbe or somethinga communist well known to the police thats raised hell naturally the storm troopers are out everywhere rounding up the communists and shouting the states in danger theres a rumour that the police have already got torgler he was the leader of the communist party in the reichstag they reckon to lay their hands on the other ringleaders before the days out i unwound my trinity scarf so the communists have obliged herr hitler as the jesuits obliged king james jeff looked puzzled the gunpowder plotguy fawkes i explained it needs a genius for mismanagement starting out to blow up the seat of authority and ending up being burnt annually in effigy it wont be effigies of the communists going up in smoke hitlers been waiting his chance to rub them out ever since he took over my god how germany fascinates me like i was fascinated by a niggers corpse they fished out of the hudson one day when i was a kid it was bloated looking like it might explode any minute with slugs crawling out of it as he spoke jeff was swilling out a laboratory beaker under the tap of my square sink i want you to try this gin its too early only a sip take it neat he handed me the beaker god how foul i spat the mouthful into the sink it tastes like petrol jeff was amused maybe it is i got it off one of your countrymen it looks like the genuine article ok i guess a lot of people in the states would have paid good money for it thats the racket they reckon only one bottle of smuggled gin in a hundred is real times were hard for bootleggers like everyone else jeffs father had bought the red crown brewery in may and a fair share of the brew went by dray to rotterdam and hamburg then toronto or tampico bribery greasing a path for it across the frontiers a bottle of red crown in new york must have cost more than a bottle of good claret in wuppertal but americans relished a wholesome german beer it amuses me in america today seeing imported red crown advertised in the colour supplements as indicating the educated taste of its drinkers you know my old mans permitted to handle alcohol by the united states government because he runs a chemical plant jeff continued while i rubbed my smarting lips with a handkerchief a lot of its on the level he sells his products dirt cheap just to keep the federal permits going of course the government puts all sorts of crap in the alcohol to make it undrinkable youve heard of boiling i shook my head you redistill the industrial alcohol but it doesnt always work out i want you to find a way of redistilling whats in this gin bottle so we can get ninety per cent pure alcohol from it youve a delicate consideration for the health of your customers oh bull he laughed we make better gin we charge double price i can pick up these bottles and forged labels anywhere i objected i told him i wasnt a bootlegger there was always the chance of blindness or death from drinking impure alcohol a possibility i did not want on my conscience jeff coloured his thick bar of eyebrow drawn into a scowl i always felt nervous of courting his anger but he unexpectedly gave a nod and said youre right i guess i pay you hitler pays the sa but its no excuse for them giving him value for his money he stared at the deceptive bottle in his hand ending from the doorway anyway its a sure bet theyre going to repeal the eighteenth amendment roosevelts saying its a cause of the depression he left me to work my job was to analyse samples of beer for sugars chlorides contaminants like copper or iron from the pipes and vats for acidity and of course for the degree of alcohol i usually started my morning by lighting the pair of bunsen burners to reinforce the sluggish central heating but the weather had turned mild overnight and everything was dripping hitlers weather gerda had observed on the schwebebahn its always fine when he wants to make a big speech people will think he can order that about too that morning i had something more important in mind than the analysis of beer i pulled up a tall stool and sat at the lab bench spreading on the heavily stained wood the sheet of paper i had taken from magda it was headed in gothic type nr des untersuchenden laboratoriums prof dr domagk scribbled figures gave the reference number of the experiment underneath came a printed table giftigkeit pro g maus a intravenous lebt tot b subkutan lebt tot c per os lebt tot more figures had been scribbled to show the percentage living and dying after domagk had dosed his infected twentygram miceeither intravenously subcutaneously or through a minute stomachtube as i had seen performed in the labs at cambridge below was a list of twentyfive common bacteria the causes of diseases like pneumonia tb gonorrhoea or meningitis top of the list was the streptococcus the germ in beadlike chains which i had seen down the microscope in domagks study a pencilled note against its name said in german organisms taken from patient dying of septicaemia given in dilution in broth all twelve treated mice alive at the bottom came wuppertalelberfeld dez the unterschrift a large scrawled initial d it was a jotted laboratory note intended for eyes which had read a thousand similar discarded after incorporation in the report on a string of experiments i doubted if anyone had missed it so the mice in domagks cages suffering the equivalent of fatal human bloodpoisoning were being saved by the red azosulphonamide dye mentioned by magda i was getting to know more that was going on inside i g farben than any inhabitant of wuppertal there were some reference books left by my predecessor an elderly chemist with franz josef muttonchop whiskers who had dropped dead in the laboratory two years previously i was not hopeful of finding much to brush up my knowledge of the sulphonamide compounds oppenheimers der fermente ihre wirkungen published in at leipzig yielded only the pleasant discovery of frederick gowland hopkins writing about das schwefelsystemhoppy on sulphur then i opened a book i had hardly noticed it was a lucky find it bore an inscription on the flyleaf to my predecessor from a brotherchemist working across town at the farbenfabriken and was on the chemistry of dyes i translated to myself a section headed the sulphonamide group which started p gelmo of vienna in synthesized aminobenzinesulphonamide j prakt chem there followed the formula this was basically a benzine ring the familiar sixsided lozenge at its north point hydrogen and nitrogen combined as a radical written in chemists shorthand hn at the south hydrogen and nitrogen were combined with oxygen and sulphur as a sulphamino radical sonh the reference was to the german journal of practical chemistry which i could easily look up at cambridgeif i ever got back there i had never heard of the austrian chemist gelmo but now i knew that he had invented sulphonamide when gerhard domagk was still a child a familiar name illuminated the next paragraph in h hцrlein of i g farbenfabriken patented the first azo dyestuffs which contained the sulphonamide group these dyes showed remarkable fastness in the repeated washing and milling of the material hцrlein attributed this to a strong affinity between the sulphonamide dye and the protein of the wool no wonder the hindenburglike professor hцrlein had been in domagks lab watching over the progress of his protйgй launched on a new career the article continued about chrysoidin a reddish dye popular at the time in gargles and for cleaning up wounds a dr eisenberg in had shown that it might kill bacteria on the surface of the body like carbolic or any other disinfectant but not inside it as quinine killed the parasite causing malaria the section ended in the americans m heidelberger and w a jacobs independently found that azo compounds could be effective against bacteria in vitro j amer chem soc their paper noted that azo compounds were being further tested for their action against bacteria by their coworker wollstein whose report would be published later it never was scientific enthusiasm is as volatile as many of its products i straightened up on my stool now i had a chain of facts the obscure viennese chemist gelmo had invented sulphonamide in the following year professor hцrlein turned it into a red dye of laundrydefying tenacity a german scientist just before the great war and a pair of american ones just after it had halfheartedly tried sulphonamide to kill germs in testtubes and now professor domagk was using it to kill germs inside living mice if there is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune there is an ebb which must be philosophically faced as final had i seen the significance of those twelve micehad i also seen the significance of a spore which my own carelessness once left growing on a plate of bacteriai should have been acclaimed for the benefaction of both sulphonamide drugs and penicillin noosed by my sovereign with the blue and crimson ribbon of the order of merit and presented with the blue and gold folder of the nobel prize which resembles the menu of a de luxe restaurant i did not see domagks mountains towering on the horizon i thought it simply a clever experiment to show that dyes could kill bacteria the concept of everyday chemotherapy was then as difficult to grasp as everyday flights into space that christmas eve of when gerhard domagk saw his mice were alive and jotted down double exclamation marks was a day god shifted a piece upon the chess board of the world on january th it was the move of the devil i was certain that i g farben would have patented the drug derived from their dye or rather all possible processes of its manufacture german patent law protecting neither our beer nor i g farbens chemicals in themselves before leaving for the day i found the list of newly registered patents which jeff kept in his office i ran my finger down the columns until struck by the word wuppertal nr patentiert im deutschen reich vom dezember dr fritz mietzsch in wuppertalbarmen unde dr josef klarer in wuppertalelberfeld i g farbenindustrie aktges they had patented sulphonamide but this told nothing to me or the rest of the world i g farben patented every brainchild born in a fragmentary caul of exploitation i joined the crowd flooding from the brewery lunch tins over their shoulders starting through the gathering darkness on foot or bicycle lighting their pipes and cigarettessmoking at work being forbidden on pain of instant dismissal the newsboys were yelling on my way to the schwebebahn i paid my fifteen pfennigs for a special edition of the wuppertaler zeitung there were big black headlines there seemed to be big black headlines every day in germany at the time they announced that president hindenburg had signed a decree to defend the reich against communism the german people were to be saved from this peril by suspending those sections of the constitution which guaranteed their civil liberties germans were henceforward forbidden to express any opinion they cared to and so were their newspapers meetings of any kind were banned letters could be opened telephones tapped the police could arrest and search as they wished the courts could condemn to decapitation any armed disturber of the peace after the nights outrage of the reichstag fire these measures were pressed upon the president as essential by his new chancellor adolf hitler campaigning from inside the government goebbels exploited the state radio to the last decibel from the wireless set at home from loudspeakers rigged to lampposts in streets thick with redwhiteandblack swastika banners the nazis blared their simple election messagea vote for hitler was a vote for the glorious tomorrow which belonged to germany a vote against was an invitation to the communists to lay hands on every german and all his property this was despite communists being arrested by the lorryload to be beaten tortured and slain along with anyone else the nazis did not care for the reichstag fire singed everybody in germany but the german electorate was ungrateful for the energy which the nazis expended on it hitler neither lost the election nor won he had seats in the reichstag needing the cohesion of his german nationalist allies to scrape a miserable majority of the catholic middle classes in west and south germany had deserted their old parties for the nazis but still only per cent of germans voted for him those who did through their good or selfish reasons had to acceptand accept responsibility forhis policies to their gruesome limits in parliament opposition to hitler was divided jealous bitter and irreconcilable along these fatal flaws democracy in germany disintegrated i should have noticed one change in the dieffenbachs household most people read the local papers in germany but the dieffenbachs kцlnische zeitung became replaced by the volkischer beobachterthe old mьnchener beobachterpublished by max amanns press empire in berlin this was a running mate to goebbels der angriff attack first put out in the masthead title of amanns national observer was punctuated by an eaglecrowned swastika and underscored with editor adolf hitler the issue of friday march had a photograph of the editor on the front page in his brown shirt and sam browne belt addressing the rehoused reichstag from the stage of the kroll opera house in berlin at either hand darksuited butterflycollared officials scribbled respectfully behind the president of the reichstag hermann gцring surveyed the behaviour of his assembled deputies through a pair of binoculars the editor seemed to have little time for the duties of his chair glaring headlines in gothic type announced that adolf hitler had been given unfettered power over germany by the votes of deputies against the paper did not mention those arrested or prevented from entering or the streets outside packed with storm troopers yelling full powers or else so the new reichstag had stayed in business for just eighteen days i turned the pages max reinhardt was directing von hofmannathals das salzburger grosse welttheater at the deutsches theater oscars elephant review began at eightfifteen every evening at the winter garden dr dralle was advertising his lavender soap at pfennigs a bar and there were terrible floods in new zealand the puppets danced the rain fell the fuse was lit to blow a hole in the middle of the twentieth century the grey rhineland winter was shading into spring the gardens livened by the flower which sounds beautiful in any languageosterglocken jonquille daffodil the following sunday was dr dieffenbachs fiftythird birthday he had been called to a consultation in bonn a small town bisected by the railway in which they said only three things ever happenedit was raining the crossinggates were shut or both together he was too poor a master of his own time to arrange a party but i gathered that we were to dine en famille unusually well from venison with kдrntner serviettenklцsse savoury dumplings served in a cloth the doctor was indulged to be extensively reminiscent we had been talking at table about the oxford union resolution passed the previous month this house will in no circumstances fight for its king and country it had been jubilantly reported in germany as another illustration of the degeneracy of the british empire were one needed dr dieffenbach was singularly tolerant it was just a frivolity a jeu desprit he dismissed it students need an occasional outrage to save them being dulled to death with work when i went to kiel university from the gymnasium to take my tentamen physicum the first medical examination i was stuffed full of greek and latin like a perigord goose with corn that was in when we were properly educated dr dieffenbach was bearded fat and jovial resembling king edward vii with whom he shared the quest for excellence in food wine and cigars if not women a couple of years afterwards the government flouted the opinion of us doctors and let medical students go to university before even finishing their gymnasium which half demolished the intellectual level of our profession at the same time they let women become doctors which completed the ruination i stole a glance at spirited argumentative gerda across the whiteclothed table between frau dieffenbach and her schoolboy brother gunter she sat submissively sipping her hock which like indignation turned her a delightful pink her father continued in english of course it wasnt all hard work we had our student clubs with their coloured caps and regalia and all that there was a good seasoning to our young lives of saufen and raufen i could imagine the portly jovial doctor drinking if not duelling he had learned my language while enjoying the hospitality of old england as he put it he had sailed as surgeon aboard admiral von spees cruiser gneisenau which on december had the bad luck to encounter viceadmiral doveton sturdees squadron of battlecruisers when the germans arrived to raid the british radio station on the falkland islands in the south atlantic the gneisenau the scharnhorst and two more german cruisers were swiftly at the bottom with their admiral woo of his men and his two sons dr dieffenbach was lucky he was picked up by hms inflexible and spent the rest of the war practising among his fellow prisoners in a camp of huts near oxford he resumed in german we had to pass in surgery and medicine though the attitude lingered since the wars of liberation that the physician was learned the surgeon a mere butcher of men and germany was as riddled with charlatans as a leper with sores we doctors had to form thewhat would you call it my dear chappie he interjected in english using the awful expression from his days of captivity gesellschaft fьr bekдmpfung der kurpfushertums the antiquack society i suppose he added gloomily well since the war they seem to be flourishing better than ever dr dieffenbach was a product of the golden age of german medicine which produced hermann von helmholtz the descendant of william penn who invented the ophthalmoscope to reveal the retina of the human eye karl thiersch who perfected the paperthin skin graft albert frдnkel of berlin who discovered the cause of pneumonia and the indefatigable rudolf virchow pathologist anthropologist and politician who relaid the berlin drains studied tattooing and stood up to bismarck it was the age when german doctors unlike german lawyers interested themselves in history philosophy and literature and there were two orchestras exclusively of doctors in berlin it was the age which finished that weekend the nazis could not decapitate albert frдnkel because he had died in so during that summer they decapitated his bust i remarked in german that my host shared the same university as professor domagk oh yes he was at kiel after the war he grew interested very early on in the natural defences of the body against infection and how they might be reinforcedby some drug for instance he took a mouthful of the strawcoloured wine smacking his fleshy lips then domagk moved to greifswald university that would be about next to minster to follow his same line of research after that professor hцrlein head of i g farben pharmaceuticals here in elberfeld dr dieffenbach jerked his head in the direction of the factory discovered domagk exactly as a talent scout in america discovers the latest film star frau dieffenbach as tall as gerda so fair and pale she seemed to me almost transparent broke into our conversation with perhaps weve seen the end of the quack doctors standards will begin to improve all round now that herr hitler has got the power he wanted dr dieffenbach nodded vigorously prodding his napkin the firmer into his butterfly collar people will have to start behaving themselves and acting with some sense of responsibility weve had enough of this stupid fighting between bosses and workers between one political party and another herr hitler gives us the chance perhaps the last chance of putting our country first instead of tearing it to pieces and herr hitler achieved his full powers perfectly legally and within the constitution mark you he continued in my direction despite all the spinechilling stories put about by his enemies of storm troopers seizing the reich with their fists and boots what happened in the kroll opera house last thursday could have happened in your own house of commons in london herr elgar which you may already know to be an institution greatly admired by every thinking person in germany i acknowledged the compliment the mother of parliaments certainly enjoyed the admiration of adolf hitler who confessed warmly in mein kampf the dignity with which the lower house there fulfilled its tasks impressed me immensely sir charles barrys buildings beside the thames incited his wilder enthusiasm the sculpture and paintings thrust into its niches striking the fьhrer as the british empires hall of fame it was unfortunate that the british house of commons was later burnt down on his orders as the german one had just been on hermann gцrings there was nothing constitutional in the slightest in herr hitler seizing full powers all four of us turned a startled glance at gerda she made this remark staring straight ahead pinker than ever fingers gripping the stem of her wine glass it was a putup job many more than deputies would have voted against him if they hadnt been frightened for their lives her father was scowling unsure whether to be amused or affronted my dear child hitler was dealing with communists not some debating society force must be met with force theyre all tarred with the same brush communists or nazis gerda said quickly looking frightened at herself theyre the ignorant led by the unscrupulous let me tell you that the communists wouldnt give a second thought to turning their guns on people like us if hitler werent there to protect us he leant towards her redfaced and angry her mother sat upright looking shocked her little brother resumed eating industriously how can you say a thing like that as a german the communists are germans like us gerda persisted if you want your life directed from moscow you had better live it elsewhere than this house she fell silent staring at the tablecloth knuckles so white against the glass that i feared she would break the stem her father contemptuously blew out his lips but he continued in a milder tone who would you rely on to defend us against the communists frдulein the socialists wear the same red shirts washed out as for the catholic parties you might as well expect a ladies sewing circle to round up a band of sicilian brigands weve seen enough of politicians dancing to tunes played outside our own frontiers hitler has taken full powers only to set germany free there was another silence apart from the noise of gunter eating i hoped for her own sake that gerda would hold her tongue but she said quietly free from what dr dieffenbach held up a stubby forefinger angry again listen to me you are too intelligent to misconstrue the truth so i will assume that you have not read the newspapers very carefully herr hitler has been granted full powers by the reichstag correct but hardly a blank cheque it is to be for a strictly limited period of four years and herr hitler has given his solemn promise that these powers will be used most sparingly he has promised equally that the rights of the church shall be respected and the right of every state which composes the reich and above all the rights of the president surely you could have foreseen herr hitlers respect for the presidency from the photographs in the newspapers when the two mensoldier in uniform politician in frock coatshook a solemn handshake in the garrison church at potsdam last month there were tears in hitlers eyes as well as hindenburgs the brief life of the new reichstag had begun with a theatrical excursion its rightful home a burntout shell it had assembled above the remains of frederick the great everything had been organized by dr goebbels the old fieldmarshal appeared gloriously in uniform with pikelhaube and a constellation of medals hitler hardly a regular churchgoer looked like a dyspeptic shopwalker dr dieffenbach unexpectedly extended the arm of friendship in my direction the enemies of germany are no longer the compatriots of herr elgar what has hitler already said why that our natural ally in europe is england had the old politicians renounced to england the colonies and the seas and spared her the edge of competition from our industry england would have in her businesslike way given us a free hand in russia there would have been no bloody war no english soldier would lie under the soil of france our enemies today are not even the french they are socalled germans jews profiteers debauchers criminals youll soon see herr hitler will set them an honest job of work cleaning up their own filth ill tell on you ill tell on you gunter screeched out gleefully pointing a finger vigorously at his sister his mouth full of potato herr esmarch at school said we were to report anyone at home who said anything against hitler weve talked enough politics for one meal said frau dieffenbach hastily its not polite before herr elgar the political goingson inside other countries are always wearisome who is really interested in the details of quarrels in other families the fact that they are quarrelling is doubtless interesting but the causes are generally trivial and the arguments deployed always deadly dull we all accepted this comforting parallel gratefully dr dieffenbach grunted and poured himself some more wine he turned the talk to safe professional subjects recounting at length the last meeting of the versammlung deutscher naturforscher and arztethe congress of german scientists and physicians the oldest of such societies in a country much given to lofty philosophical discussion of natures simple mechanics that night i went to gerdas bedroom there were three rooms in the attic one was shared by the pair of maids the other two up a short stair for gerda and myself the wall between us was so thin that we lived in an acoustic intimacy which sometimes kept me hotly awake in the freezing darkness i could hear the squeak of her cupboard opening the scrape of coathangers with her heavy serge clothes along the raila most exciting sound creating a vision of her in stockings and underwear though an inaccurate and flattering one my knowledge of these garments coming perforce from ladies dress shop windows my students today would think me unenterprising at not broaching the intimacy of that inch or twos lath and plaster but in the bridal dress took firm precedence over the nightdress i was anyway terrified at rousing with creaking boards the maids or more horrifyingly dr dieffenbach himself that sunday night i heard her light snap out her bed creak i could imagine hearing her breathing and the soft rustle of her limbs it grew towards one oclock impulsively i crept from my door tremblingly i opened hers she was not asleep because she sat up at once in her black iron bed like a hospital cot her featherstuffed coverlet pulled round her chin she whispered calmly you mustnt i left the door ajar i sat on the edge of her bed in my brown flannel striped pyjamas from marks and spencers i saw that she wore a white nightgown of some heavy material which covered her from neck to wrist as chastely as a surplice i whispered back i admired you tonight the way you stood up for yourself she said nothing for a moment i noticed how her eyes shone in the faint light from the window above the bed we were seldom in such proximity even fully dressed but neither of us touched the other she still smelt of household soap you shouldnt have come into my room i started shaking less through emotion than because it was very cold i couldnt go to sleep i had to tell you she shrugged her narrow shoulders under the white nightgown i wanted to confess my yearning for her night after night but i feared she would be affronted or think me stupid i had little practical experience of women i shouldnt have contradicted my father i frequently contradict mine no it wasnt right of course it was right i told her in an urgent whisper the nazis are nothing but outofwork clerks and penniless students with a sprinkling of ruffians and criminals anyone can see that and who is hitler not a man of education and culture like papen hes nothing but a corporal who managed to get himself decorated with the iron cross as hes continually reminding everyone i should never have questioned my fathers views especially like that in front of my mother and gunter why shouldnt you i whispered more furiously youre not a child youre a grown woman whos entitled to her own opinions your parents are proud enough of your being a schoolteacher they can hardly object to your claiming a mind of your own you dont understand she shook her head her hair appearing pure white in two plaits over her shoulders if i argue with my father it makes it hard for him to preserve proper discipline to keep order in the house to keep order it was a mystifying conception i said would you like to come to the cinema again youre always asking perhaps next month or go dancing i suggested daringly i cant dance not a step neither can i in fact why are you never serious with me with my prospects in life i cant afford to be serious with women i can only afford flirtation you forget that i have my selfrespect you mean your selfdistrust she responded to this only someone might hear us that would be terrible next sunday ill take you to the zoo for tea ill see promise i urged ill have to ask mama i made to kiss her she tipped her cheek and i dodged on to her mouth mister jim no she protested under her breath you are so beautiful gerda just like marlene dietrich i saw from the shade of a smile in the darkness that she took the compliment seriously i stayed where i was she whispered fiercely you must go i quoted the old viennese saying ich leibe dich and du schlдfsti love you and you sleep the words made her draw in her breath as though i had cut her you shouldnt speak of such serious things come to england with me one day now youre telling fairy tales im not the wars been over fifteen years the people of europe must soon get tired of shouting names at one another across their frontiers who outside a madhouse could want another war one day perhaps she repeated wearily perhaps i went back to bed the chaste excursion had so drained me that i fell asleep at once shared intimacy between a man and a woman can be fully recalled by a glance held a second more than necessary but gerda never hinted that my intrusion into her bedroom was more than a dream a month went by we were walking towards the schwebebahn on our way to work at eight in the morning of the last friday in april she said abruptly you were quite right about hitler that night about him being only a jumpedup corporal why he isnt even german hes an austrian peasant from braunau am inn everyone knows that i thought he was from vienna he was only a vagabond there shouting his mouth off that the army hadnt lost the war but been stabbed in the back by the civilians which to his mind consisted only of socialists communists and jews exactly anyone would have imagined him to have fought the war as a general he picked up a following in the gutter and wouldnt be throwing his weight about today if the munich policemen had shot a little straighter ten years ago she was talking of the famous beer hall putsch of november by then written with illuminated letters in nazi mythology it had been a squalid affair hitler had marched with general ludendorff at the head of his storm troopers on the munich war ministry within half an hour he had sixteen of his followers dead ludendorff arrested and himself cringing on the cobblestones as a final indignity the badly wounded hermann gцring was succoured in a nearby jewish bank weve all the natural resources we need to make us rich and powerful again any of my schoolchildren could tell you that we had passed the zoo where i had in the end taken her for tea and were hurrying up the wooden steps to the platform she was in her discouraging black serge with black lisle stockings and a big black leather bag but hitlers a braggart just like the kaiser and hell get us into the same trouble you mark my words teutomania is too expensive a luxury these days a braggart ive heard him called a second martin luther oh martin luther he was a disastrous failure he never settled our religious differences and united our country like your tudor kings and queens he divided it the more dont forget that i am a catholic mister we reached the platform anyway i shall have to support the nazis she continued more soberly im a schoolteacher im employed by the state if im thought unreliable politically i shall never see promotion more likely ill find myself dismissed thats how everyone sees the situation at school though to tell the truth most of the teachers needed little encouragement to become the wildest enthusiasts for herr hitler and perhaps he wont turn out as bad as he seems youve heard one of our german proverbsnothing is served as hot as its cooked yes almost everybody seems to be applying it to hitler well what odds does it make she added resignedly ill raise my arm as the nazis march past like everyone else a good many heathens and sinners bow to the altar in church who wants to lose a job these days we both became aware in the same instant of a young man staring at us he was pale with a line of black moustache in a dark suit wellpressed but threadbare and a curlybrimmed trilby perhaps a clerk or a shop assistant i was frightened by the hostility of his eyes it was before but not long before everyone in germany had to be careful what they said indoors or out but it was common knowledge that sharp words shot bravely against the nazis were arrows which could provoke artillery doubtless the shabby fellow had no interest in us or was reflecting on a morning row with his wife or had a hangover but we instinctively stayed silent until the linked pair of cars slid into the station on their monorail it was riders lasting bounty that every german grew suspicious of the next i always threw a glance into domagks room as the schwebebahn traversed the i g farben works but i never glimpsed him we crossed the wall the main shopping street of elberfeld festooned with long nazi banners flags were to be flown on all days of national significance of which the germans had many some brave or foolish housekeepers or shopkeepers flaunted the red black and white horizontal stripes of the old weimar republic the flag which hitler described with a lapse of his usual prudery as a bedsheet of the most shameful prostitution shortly the swastika was to fly all over germany triumphantly alone hoisted to the peak of its flagstaff by the law of the land the month of april had jolted past fiercely when the germans recovered their breath from hitlers sweeping up full political power people began to say it was not dangerous or even significant because the nazis were a minority party but the nazi rank and file were aghast that the third reich had gloriously dawned with the jews still opening their shops sitting in court teaching in school and even walking the streets the storm troopers took over on april they organized a national boycott of jewish shops they pushed into courtrooms and forced outside jewish barristers and judges hitler had to seize back the initiative by hastily signing the aryan decrees barring jews from the universities the civil service schools and the legal and medical professions hitlers scrawled signature abolished as easily the ancient german states and unified the reich surmounting the frustrations of bismarcks whole lifetime and proving his own promises to be written on water april had been a month to open the eyes of the germans had many cared to be roused awake hey there old man arent you going to introduce me i looked up from my seat startled amazed and alarmed standing above was jeff beckerman it was a warm day and he wore his light grey english suit with chalk stripes on his head a floppy white linen cap with a button in the middle i had never known him to take the schwebebahn though he came in every day from the black and white villa he rented at vohwinkel out beyond elberfeld i had never known him to move more than a hundred yards anywhere without his car i saw you get aboard he had pushed his way through the crowd of standing passengers and was grinning broadly i had to take the cord into the garage one of the brake drums has cracked clean across its one of the faults with that car i hope to god the jerries know how to fix it his eyes were pawing gerda she gave an unsure smile realizing that this was the american i had spoken about so often i stammered some words of introduction in english and german already i saw the longfeared consequences of her meeting jeff whose air of wealth and worldliness picked him from the seedy passengers of the schwebebahn like a sovereign in a handful of pennies jeff seized her hand shaking it with the enthusiastic vigour he applied to his car im sure glad to meet you frдulein ive heard a whole lot about you from jim frдulein dieffenbach speaks virtually no english i said stiffly then she must learn sure she must its not fair a girl like her in wuppertal and i cant speak to her tell her ill hire her a teacher i translated this dutifully gerda put her hand to her mouth and gave an uncharacteristic giggle i supposed it was a joke i should not have been surprised at jeff sending a professor of english ringing the dieffenbachs doorbell gerdas stop was before ours by then jeff had contrived in bilingual conversation a promise for all three of us to take a spin in his car the following sunday afternoonif of course the brakes were working as she disappeared with a smile through the sliding doors he nudged me hard in the ribs it was mean of you hiding her all this time shes a ripping girl nicht wahr shes very serious you know i said discouragingly she doesnt find anything worth talking about which doesnt affect the lives of five million people i dont believe it shes schцn she doesnt have to wear her brains like a fancy bonnet nobody in the world takes their job more seriously than a german schoolteacher not even the president of the united states youre wrong old man he said cheerfully all women are only interested in little things food clothes if its going to rain and ruin their hair whether a man helps them out of an automobile or takes his hat off in an elevator thats why women make rotten politicians theyve got a proper sense of values anyway i like intelligent girls i grew depressed and panicky my relationship with gerda was insipid but i had the comfortable feeling that she was my property if only because i had no rival my dislike of sundays expedition deepened when jeff arrived at the dieffenbachs gate in brightbuttoned blue blazer and white flannels looking readier for yachting than motoring he grasped a huge bunch of pink white and red carnations elaborately arranged in a cone of frilled paper gerdas eyes glowed at the flowers her mouth opened at the cord gleaming in the sunshine dr and frau dieffenbach came into the narrow front garden similarly impressed with vehicle and burstingly selfconfident owner young gunter scurried round touching the white coachwork reverently even the two maids peeped in whispering admiration through the front lace curtains i had a painful feeling of unnecessity it was a glorious afternoon the sun shone from a blue sunday sky unhazed by smoke and wuppertal hardly smelt at all the streets were full of strollers in their sombre sunday best the walls thick with nazi banners and streamers with the repeated exhortation honour work and respect the worker the morrow was may day declared a national holiday by the new government there were to be parades and rallies all over germany hitler was himself to address a hundred thousand pairs of ears on tempelhof airdrome in berlin plus countless more in every home and through lamppost loudspeakers in every public square of the reich the pomp was to show the nazis as neither puppets of the capitalists nor conspirators of the bourgeoisie but true champions of the german worker on the following day may hitler emphasized this by taking over all german trade unions occupying their offices with storm troopers sequestrating their funds and jailing their leaders we had the car roof folded back the warm breeze tugging the brim of gerdas black straw hat and running its fingers through wisps of her pale hair she wore the anklelength blue and white striped cotton dress which i had imagined bought for my own benefit i sat in the back still with my trinity scarf jeff drove eastwards along the river which flowed through wuppertal like its gut growing progressively filthier beyond barmen the grimy town fell away from us and the valley became walled with the unspoiled woods of the marscheider wald we stopped amid the huddle of steep red roofs against a lake which composed the village of beyenburg it was overshadowed by a fifteenthcentury sandstone church barnlike without transept which we perfunctorily inspected before jeff found a cafй where we could sit outside under a brightly striped umbrella а la franзaise he ordered coffee cream cakes and brandy nazidominated germans enjoyed the freedom denied englishmen of sipping spirits on a sunday afternoon gerda refused the brandy but ate several cakes i found myself translating jeffs compliments and gallantries and her shy smiling replies when jeff tried asking her through my own mouth to take dinner with him the following saturday i jibbed whats the matter old man youre not engaged to her are you no but im rather keen on her oh bull maybe i should tell her about that little brunette in cologne i never touched that woman he looked mockingly you dont say we sat in the kitchen and talked about the drugs theyre experimenting with at i g farben he jerked his head across the table would she believe that du lieber gott how about you and that tart in berlin i keep telling you heike wasnt a professional he arrogantly stuck out his legs in their spotless white trousers anyway women prefer a really experienced man of the world gerda was searching both our faces puzzled and disconcerted by the tone of our exchanges genung jeff exclaimed he commanded the waiter bitte bringe noch zwei glases cognac i noticed that he was beginning to use more german my tide of jealousy rose my anchor was gerdas personality how could a levelheaded schoolmistress with a mind and will of her own fall for the dash and extravagance of jeff what touching faith i had in the constancy of woman the next sunday afternoon jeff appeared in beautifully cut plus fours with knitted brown socks and handmade english brogues he invited gerda for another drive this time i wasnt asked i decided to relinquish gerda in love affairs i withdraw at the gentlest rebuff like a snail in a shower i told myself sourly that a handsome young man with splendid clothes a feeling for flattery and with the only cord car in germany was irresistible i was not wholly fair jeff had charm and vigour and he was american he brought to oldfashioned contorted introspective stiffnecked germany the fresh wind of boundless prairies endless highways topless skyscrapers and unlimited money to gerda he was blondie of the follies herr jim you must have a poor opinion of me she confessed one evening when we found ourselves alone i made some demurring remark jeff is very insistent and i dont get many luxuries here in wuppertal she said artlessly but i feel very guilty because you are so nice and quiet and so much more intelligent than jeff my relations with jeff remained amicable they had to be he seemed to regard his snatching gerda only as a good joke at my expense on may nazi students lit a bonfire from their libraries dr goebbels benignly inspected the flames in the franzjosefplatz while they shouted brenne heinrich heine brenne karl marx brenne sigmund freud brenne heinrich mann but both national and domestic disarray seemed trivial some six weeks later when i thought i was about to lose my right hand on friday morning i smashed a testtube in the lab and from a spot of blood saw with annoyance that i had pricked my right index finger on friday night it was tender it throbbed when i woke on saturday and over the day grew ominously red and swollen i hesitated to consult dr dieffenbach i had lived in a doctors housea kings doctors housesince i was fifteen but my complaints had been always too trivial to provoke the cogitations of sir edward tiplady and by the nature of her profession my mother had an intimacy with household remedies though i was never a sickly child she would regularly apply them out of interest i was dosed with garlic against worms rubbed with hot roast turnip against chilblains or with a steak to be promptly buried in the back garden against warts my bowels never remained unmoved in the presence of senna infusions rhubarb tea and boiled onions i became a hypochondriac which my life working closely with medical men has aggravated they have an instinctive way of eyeing you for promising defects as a knacker a passing horse i have imagined picking up as many diseases as pieces of their jargon you dont look well gerda said as the maids were clearing away our evening meal she showed increased solicitude for my welfare and comfort i assumed through her guilt over jeff and you hardly ate a thing its my finger her face grew concerned as i thrust the swollen tip towards her you must be careful papa had a patient the other day whose finger started just like that in the end he got blood poisoning and they had to take him into the hospital and amputate his arm i thanked her for the encouragement you must show it to papa once he gets back dr dieffenbach had missed his dinner through an urgent call im sure hell be able to stop it spreading with hot fomentations i sat for a while over hans falladas new novel kleiner mann was nun while gerda in her glasses corrected exercisebooks i knew that no infection was trivial my father once caught his hand on a rusty nail rummaging in the dark of the wine cellar and had been incapacitated for weeks we heard the doctor come home i shut my book and followed him to his surgery at the back of the house he was still in his homburg washing his hands come in come in he invited in english have you ever had diphtheria my dear chappie no i havent he hung his hat on the stand with a weary gesture ive just seen a bad case membrane right across the throat and the heart affected its twin attack as garrotter and poisoner herr petersens little girl on the other side of the zoologischer garten ive known him since the war well its the disease which takes four or five thousand german children to heaven every year as he neatly folded the small starched towel which he had dried his hands on i made the remark that a physician of his skill might save the child were i the reincarnation of hippocrates i could battle no more successfully against the klebslцffler bacillus once its on the rampage there are but three things i can do he made a gesture of resignation i can inject diphtheria antitoxin into the veins i can administer strychnine to steady the heart and i can hope for the best if the childs breathing gets worse i shall be called from my bed tonight to perform a tracheotomy he indicated with his forefinger a cut just below his voicebox therere rumours going round this last year or so that theyre developing the immunization against the disease like your edward jenner discovered against smallpox a hundred years ago perhaps that will make a dent in the mortality the room was small with white walls lit by a strong electric bulb in a shade like a saucer and there was a reek of carbolic one side was occupied by an uncomfortablelooking examination couch with a horsehairstuffed top against the other stood a steelandglass case of instruments on top a metal sterilizer like a chafingdish over a spirit lamp on the desk a dish of instrumentsscalpels forceps curved needleslay marinating in reddish antiseptic dr dieffenbach drew a box of cigars from the drawer and clipped one with a pocket guillotine he smoked cigars unabashed while examining his patients i suspected even intimately well old chappie you are looking at me like the unfortunate messenger from birnam wood in macbeth he was fond of parading his involuntary intimacy with english literature i held out my finger with an apologetic air he inspected it in silence while the surgery filled with aromatic smoke he pressed the pulp i winced you have a cellulitis here he announced calmly our old friend the streptococcus has bitten you it wont spread will it i asked alarmed who can say if the infection doesnt resolve in twentyfour hours i can make a little cut or two and insert a rubber drain his unruffled professional manner at that moment struck me as incorporating the worst of british phlegm and german insensitivity sit down and ill take your temperature chin up my dear chappie i shall endeavour not to send you home looking like admiral nelson it appeared that i had some fever he prescribed kaolin poultices every four hours all sunday gerda made them in the kitchen spreading the shiny white china clay on a square of pink lint with a spatula then boiling it like a cabbage in a saucepan of water with frowning seriousness she wrapped the poultice tight and scalding round my finger i always winced and gasped and she would say as she applied the layer of waterproof gauze and a bandage remember herr elgar it is for your own good i felt this unnecessarily schoolmistressy my mind became increasingly occupied with the chances of earning a living as a onearmed chemist i had every faith in dr dieffenbach he was superior to a krankenkasse doctor one employed by the compulsory public sickness insurance which was established in germany in anticipating our british national health service by sixtyfive years and like our british national health service its doctors complained that they were underpaid and overworked its patients complained that they could not always choose their doctor though the verbдnde der artze deutschlands did its best to provide a selection dr dieffenbach looked down on the krankenkasse severely i stayed on my feet that sunday my right arm in a sling i clearly could not go to the brewery on monday anyway jeff was in berlin i awoke feeling so ill and my hand so pained that i could not rouse myself from my bed gerda brought me some barleywater but i was too sick even to savour her concern about noon dr dieffenbach sent a maid to summon me to his surgery as he took off the jacket of my pyjamas i could see clearly red streaks now reaching from my hand and up my forearm towards my heart dr dieffenbach stood smoking his cigar for the best part of a minute inspecting the unbandaged hand impassively well try some new pills he decided i was then so frightened i would have swallowed arsenic had he suggested it perhaps i should send a letter home i said shakily to break the news that i am ill you are hardly in top condition for correspondence ill send a line on your behalf to sir edward tiplady i owe him a note on other matters anyway but if these pills do their job properly by the time he receives it you will be cured dr dieffenbach went to the glass cupboard he reached inside for the aesculape field surgical chest he had acquired from army surplus after the war it was the size of my woolworths attachй case gleaming steel canvas lined every instruments place outlined in black and fitted with german ingenuity and precision for a second i was horrified that he was about to cut off my arm without more ado but he produced a glass phial about four inches long for which the chest was a hiding place i heard only today of these tablets being used on a professional brother who pricked his finger doing a post mortem on a septic case he informed me unnervingly thats often a death warrant you know germs become more virulent altogether more proud of themselves after a triumphal passage through the human body he tipped some tablets into his palm they were an inch across reddish yellow about twenty of them in the phial these would make a horse retch my dear chappie he continued with amusement you must get a couple of them down you three times a day you have quite a nasty phlegmone there in your arm the enemy is attacking up the easy roads of your lymphatic system well we shall teach this adventurous streptococcus a lesson what are they i inspected the two pills in my hand as he filled a glass with water curiosity is a superfluous quality in the patient its stuff called streptozon which to you can mean no more than another brand of schnapps now back to bed dear chappie youre feverish enough to boil a kettle illness abroad is doubly wretched the purple wallpaper which we will grow to hate as we lie in bed with grippe cyril connolly wrote perceptively about his cheap paris hotel i was oppressed by my wallpaper a design of violets the sloping ceiling seemed to be descending to crush me like the torture chamber of peine forte et dure the ghostlike frau dieffenbach brought me broth but i wanted only water even the sounds of gerda next door were no more than an irritation about eight that evening i descended the narrow attic stairs grey woollen dressinggown over my shoulders to the lavatory on the landing below a minute later i was hurriedly out again i leant over the banisters shouting in panic for dr dieffenbach he appeared from the livingroom napkin under chin half alarmed and half angry doctor im bleeding to death i cried in german frau dieffenbach and gerda appeared behind him wondering if i were dying or delirious bleeding where from the doctor asked brusquely this was awkward in front of the ladies internally fore or aft he demanded impatiently fore he mounted the stairs snatching off his napkin and mumbling badtemperedly he followed me into die toilette where i indicated dramatically with my good hand the bright red water in the pan of solid china made in staffordshire and named amid a spray of flowers in english the little thunderer dr dieffenbachs professional balance seemed shaken have you any left he demanded pulling his beard i need a drop more if you can find it he brought a conical flask from his surgery into which i passed an inch of this alarmingly coloured fluid he packed me back to bed after a few minutes he appeared in smiling reassurance no nephritis he announced in english no septicaemic abscess no pyelitis ive tested your offering my dear chappie by the tincture of guiac method and find it free from all blood the colour is a harmless dye which should have occurred to me but a doctor never thinks at his clearest when snatched away from his dinner ive seen the same effect in children whove gorged themselves with sweets which the manufacturers have turned pretty red colours with aniline dyes they pass straight through to the urine and you can imagine how the mothers get hysterics hows the hand why a great improvement already i noticed that the red lines were fading the streptococcus is in full retreat dr dieffenbach said with satisfaction we shant send you home looking like admiral nelson after all he left me lying feebly on my pillow streptozon was transparently a fancy name for sulphonamide as atebrin was for the mepacrine hydrochloride used against malaria i was an involuntary colleague of professor domagks mice in summer everybody thinks less with leaves and flowers to distract the eye skin and air making friends again fresh fruit to eatdelicious proof of natures kindly abundancepeople stop brooding and grow lazy and lecherous life looks different a golden thread to be spun out as long as possible not a coin to be risked for a cause a country becomes docile towards its native politicians and completely indifferent towards foreign ones from his first year of office hitler grasped this as instinctively as any other item of mass psychology hitler busied himself in the sunshine to annihilate his antagonists the storm troopers had for years been able to murder whoever they liked with the tolerance of the law it would have taken a braver witness to testify a braver juryman to convict and a braver judge to sentence than in ireland during the troubles now they had the force of law itself there were rumoured to be germans in concentration camps each prisoner playing the grisly double role of terrorizing those still left outside all opponents of hitler not behind barbed wire were under the earth and even the wraiths of resistance vanished the geleichstellung the coordination of germany was accomplished that summer at breakneck speed hitlers safeguards of march were forgotten his fouryear limit not worth remembering the reichstag enjoyed the vestigial function of hitlers sounding board which it fulfilled to hear his resolve of spreading peace and light across europe a message accepted particularly enthusiastically by the london times the british labour party and president roosevelt hitler was already giving the world a taste of the piecrust promises with which he was stopping the mouths of the germans the german social democratic party vanished hitlers signature dissolved it he also dissolved the german national party his partner in the coalition appointed by president hindenburg with the idea of keeping him under control the catholic centre party lasted until july when storm troopers appeared in its offices to close it down for ever and on july representatives of his holiness in rome signed a concordat with representatives of herr hitler in berlin hitlers success in these early vulnerable months came from his genius for the deadly game of political chess from an eye which saw deeply into the dark timorous mean recesses of the human heart and from his transforming the roughhouse which passed for german society into a disciplined country where everyone knew where he stood hitler restored order and the germans loved him for it as gerda loved her father my dear chappie you must realize how things are for us in germany explained dr dieffenbach clipping his afterdinner cigar a month after saving an english arm with a german drug the jews are vastly overrepresented in medicine as in the law i sometimes wonder if we can truly call these two learned professions german at all but i would agree that herr hitler is being rather hasty he will have second thoughts assuredly you must expect him to be a little headstrong in the first flush of success besides he has to pander a little to his most fervent supporters who are not exactly the type of person i would invite to dinner dr dieffenbach always evaded my questions about the nature of the pills he did not know that i had seen a letter which gerda inadvertently left on the pink chenille cloth when filing her fathers professional papers it was a short handwritten note from domagk saying they were receiving encouraging reports from streptozon all over germany particularly from professor dr schreus at the medical academy in dьsseldorf and from physicians in mьnster and kiel in wuppertal professor dr klee was using it successfully at the municipal hospital for erysipelas and angina of the throat i supposed i g farben had good reasons for keeping the drug up its sleeve though i did not think much about it once cured by his doctor the patient forgets the drug and begrudges the fee i was already planning to spend christmas with my parents i certainly did not see my days in germany as numbered in the years ahead there were plenty of englishmen to visit germany curiously and leave it enthusiastically including lloyd george nazism had a glitteringly superficial appeal a nation as one folk all sharing alikeeven such privations as the weekly one pot mealall setting their country above themselves all healthy straightforward and comradely the apotheosis of togetherness a youth movement for all ages i missed the full significance of the moral infection round me as i had missed the full significance of the cured physical one in my hand once a month i had to report to the polizeiprдsidium on druckerstrasse between river and railway crammed together as they traversed the narrow valley it was a painless and even an amicable episode a citizen of the british empire was a curiosity to break the monotony of hungarians or roumanians dutch or danes a scholarlylooking policeman with pincenez made a neat copperplate entry in violet ink on the yellowish lined paper of my file and that was that i was due to appear at the end of october hitler had just abruptly withdrawn from the disarmament conference at geneva and the league of nations for good measure which particularly disconcerted the london times the british labour party and president roosevelt i was on this occasion shown immediately into a small office containing two men my own age both in nazi brown shirts with sam browne belts swastika armbands above their left elbows breeches and jackboots stuck under a trestle table covered with papers they questioned me for two hours keeping me standing while they smoked cigarettes and drank coffee why was i in germany i protested that my work permit was in front of them yes but why was i really in germany i observed that their country was most interesting and educative to visit had i any jewish blood did i look it i asked where did i learn to speak german and why how much money had i saved in germany did i transfer money to london what was my fathers work they wanted the names and addresses of all the people i knew in wuppertal they were a pair of jacksinoffice dressed in an authority which was neither little nor to the worlds pain brief but the icicles of my reserve began to melt a citizen of the british empire expected to be above the antics of the natives when they grew restive i had a feeling of always being watched in reality too dramatic a notion the gestapo had been in business only six months a minor organization confined to the state of prussia christened by a clerk at his wits end for a set of distinctive initials among the hundreds newly proliferating in germany a few days later i encountered gerda in the hall of the dieffenbachs house below a newer and larger photograph of hitler her face was scarlet her eyes spilling tears i had often seen her indignant and sometimes angry but never weeping it was jeff she explained the school say i must not mix with foreigners if i do they tell me i shall lose my job its not thought right for a german in my position to ride about in a big american car when there are workpeople with hardly enough to keep alive whats it to do with the school whether you ride in an american car or the schwebebahn i protested though not displeased my whole life is of concern to the authorities she said desperately everything that anybody does has the government nosing into it you never know if the teacher sitting next to you is an agent for the sicherheitsdienst this was the sd the early state security service under the cashiered former naval intelligence officer reinhard heydrich whose later extermination in prague led to the elimination of lidice and its whole population therere brownshirts and officials ive never seen before in and out of the school all the time i dont want to end up in the special court i had heard plenty of the sondergericht with three nazi judges and no jury established after the march elections to deal with dissenters people have been in trouble you know quite a lot of them gerda continued hesitant and fearful of what she was saying now the police and the storm troopers are entitled to go into any house they like and ferret out whatever and whoever they wishthere are people papa knows who have just disappeared like that she snapped her fingers papa doesnt say much about it but for all he knows they could be dead and buried perhaps they are all over germany theyre keeping people as long as they like in protective custodyprotective the camps are far worse than the detention barracks in the army anyway the storm troopers ransom people to be let out its a racket like jeffs gangsters in chicago i suppose some lady teacher was jealous of you with jeff and his car and told the brownshirts no it was gunter your own brother i was horrified he passed the story to his schoolmaster you know how gunter thinks absolutely everything about the nazis is wonderful just because they organize camps and give him a uniform and they all sing songs round a fire they tell him its his duty to inform on anything at home which goes in the slightest against the thinking of national socialism you cant blame him all kids are instructed to put their country first even before their parents he doesnt know any better she ended charitably i expect hell grow out of it i decided to guard my tongue carefully within earshot of the young man i noticed that gerda took every chance afterwards to slap the cheeks of hitlers little enthusiast these two incidents decided me to quit germany i had no knowing who might be itching to report me to the sd and put me in serious trouble or perhaps my mind was already made up they were the clicks of a shutter admitting light to a sensitized film jeff was nettled he had bought a cosmetics firm in berlin and had planned my concocting voluptuouslysmelling perfumes and powders from chemicals whats the matter homesick you know i havent a home to pine for i guess germanys getting too noisy a jungle for the explorers to sleep soundly he agreed after trying to dissuade me these nazis are nuts when you come down to it a governments job is to declare war and raise taxes and keep the railroads running not to tell a girl who she can go out with and who she cant sure youve made your mind up i guess englands just like the states right now full of college graduates selling apples i was to leave just before christmas through ostend again and by night on my last day in wuppertal i met professor domagk for the second time dr dieffenbach gave a small evening party to speed me on my way there was french champagne and spiced biscuits and pets de nonnenuns farts the name given to delicately flavoured pastries by voltaire gerda wore her blue and white dress with diagonal stripes i invited jeff she seemed to have accepted renouncing him as she accepted having to raise her arm when the storm troopers marched past dr dieffenbach invited the domagks but the professor arrived alone late and agitated gertrude cant come domagk anxiously explained the absence of his wife its our fouryearold girl you heard she was ill no i hadnt dr dieffenbach looked concerned whats up with the child she pricked herself with a needle and it went septic it may have been contaminated with some virulent organisms which id brought back from the laboratory on my clothing perhaps one can never be sure of these things my dear gerhard im so sorry he grasped the professors hand whats the pathogen have you identified it yes its a streptococcus shes developed a suppurative phlegmon on her arm domagks face drawn with worry passed unseeingly round the rest of us in the room the poor little girls got a positive blood culture septicaemia there you are he said resignedly but shes receiving the best treatment dr dieffenbach asked urgently shes in hospital the surgeons are trying to arrest the infection theyve already made fourteen incisions in the arm the only hope left is amputation du lieber gott but has the decision been made its being made at this moment im on my way to see them you should never have delayed by coming here i came intentionally listen domagk dropped his voice but i was near enough to hear do you suppose i should give her streptozon why not its been proved safe domagk frowned has it who can say its still in the experimental stage youve no alternative dr dieffenbach told him sternly its never been used on a child before never you simply reduce the dosage exactly as you would for any other drug in your armamentarium domagk stood shaking his head amputation might save her life the sulphonamide might equally well kill her give her the drug dr dieffenbach repeated firmly you know perfectly well that you cannot make a proper clinical judgement within your own family when your brains clouded with emotion youre like a seacaptain trying to navigate in fog domagk still demurred i stood listening while my host read him a lecture lit by the candid light of true friendship gerhard youre a fool or rather youre a bacteriologist which in clinical matters is much the same thing you sit all day in your laboratory pottering with your petri dishes and squinting down your microscope and you forget those beastly germs of yours infect real people not just the mice which you use as biological litmus paper real men and women who like eating and drinking and making love to one another and going to the pictures listen to meim a clinician youve always got to be taking chances in clinical medicine an unadventurous doctor leaves nothing but a trail of carefullytreated corpses he ended revealingly i didnt hesitate when i saw that sulphonamide was the only way to prevent our young english friend from cutting the figure of admiral nelson very well domagk nodded several times i shall exhibit sulphonamide he paused i had already made up my mind otto but i wanted to share responsibility with someone outside the family have you the streptozon dr dieffenbach asked urgently ive none of the pills left i was intending to collect some from my laboratory then go on to the hospital why waste time herr elgar here knows the way and his american friend drives the fastest car in germany theyll get to the hospital with the pills before you do go along and see your child and tell the surgeons what youve decided those gentlemen might take some persuading they havent got wind of sulphonamide yet i was instructed to revisit domagks room the one with the painting by otto dix i was told that professor hцrlein had left a phial containing twenty tablets of streptozon on the rolltopped desk domagk departed for the hospital dr dieffenbach telephoned the i g farben works for the nightwatchman to admit me the expedition appealed hugely to jeff in motorists in neither germany nor england were incommoded with speed limits and we roared through the misty night with headlights ablaze and horn blaring the only necessity for our breakneck rush was jeffs sense of the dramatic i left him provoking the car to angry impatient roars in the triangular cobbled yard with the railway tracks while i hurried across the footbridge over the stinking river above me the brightlylit cars of the passing schwebebahn a window or two was alight in the research block indicating some engrossed scientistor perhaps just the cleaners i reached domagks study door on the third floor and switched on the light i saw the sulphonamide at once two phials not one each with twenty tablets i hesitated i should be leaving germany within hours i took one phial in my hand the other i slipped into my tweed jacket pocket i turned to go there was a gap among the framed photographs on the wall i missed the amiable bearded features of professor paul ehrlich from frankfurtonmain the man who cured the infection which took the lives of schubert nietzsche gauguin and toulouselautrec had the misfortune to be born a jew and therefore worthy of nothing but odium we lived in the basement everything we had was secondhand our furniture was the discards of upstairs the carpet old and bald the once expensive chintz sofa grown pale split and extruding flock propped up by whos who and bradshaws railway time table both out of date our newspapers were always yesterdays our magazines last months a radiogram upstairs had given us our portable gramophone a black musical suitcase which my father would charge with a shiny needle and play blue skies on a scratched record our wireless set was almost new in a wooden cabinet as ornamental as a victorian bracket clock it was a gift rather than a throwout that we might enjoy the uplifting diversion of sir john reiths bbc which every sunday had three religious services and five religious talks even our food had been used upstairs cold joints hashed vegetables broached pies milk which left sour little flecks in our tea but we enjoyed the hottest water and the best nuts of coal because we lived beside the boiler and the cellar sometimes during the london summer i imagined that the air we breathed had already been exhaled by the people upstairs and generously passed down for our consumption via the drains my father was sir edward tipladys butler my mother his cook for all i know today there are biochemists and even professors like myself who are the sons of butlers and barmen dustmen and dogcatchers but the educated persons of the s were socially more sensitive and the middle classes suffered a particularly painful neurosis about those who emerged to join them from below stairs whose next intention was suspected as murdering them in their beds largely for these reasons i had been unable to find work in my own country and had gone to seek it in hitlers germany it was early evening on monday january exactly a year after i started at the red crown brewery i had been home a week and ached to be back with the dieffenbachs surroundings which the kindly eye of familiarity had once blurred now struck me as starkly squalid there was the same black kettle forever simmering on the black grate the high barred window like a cells looking on an area beside the holystoned front steps through which i would watch for hours the passing womens calves in harley street i had not seen the rest of my country since returning as it had stayed aloof behind the worst fog in memory this here hitler said my father strikes me more like charlie chaplin than anything dont be misled by the moustache a lot of people in germany are very frightened of him you can take it from me go on he seemed puzzled i reckon hes leading the jerries by the nose on the contrary more and more germans are supporting him because hes successful which you must admit is unusual with most politicians in europe at the moment my father was a cheerful sardonic cockney with curly sandy hair gone grey ostentatious false teeth and terrible feet which had saved his life in the army by keeping him out of the trenches he was a servant always ready for a quick draw of a cigarette behind the door or a quick swig from a forgotten glass i inherited from him a selfconfidence and realism which allowed me to climb in the world with neither humility nor pride which are equally selfaccusatory in the successful man he was wearing a brown norfolk jacketalso secondhandbecause we were having tea proper tea high tea at six oclock with kippers my mother had fried in the huge basement kitchen bread and raspberry jam bright yellow cake from lyons with coconut icing which stuck in your teeth and tea so strong it looked like liquid leather i dont hold with jerries my father concluded sweepingly theres good and bad ones like good and bad englishmen and i suppose good and bad zulus this confused my mother that there were zulus in germany but i had long ago overridden any irritation at these bizarre conversations with my parents she was not the traditional jolly plump flouryarmed governess of the kitchen but thin tense severe and silent her dark clothes always neat her long greasy black hair always tucked away in a linen cap she was ten years younger than my father and like many seriousminded people of shallow intelligence found intense satisfaction in religion from her i inherited my orderliness and purposefulness and by some microscopic genetic twist my brains mind you my father continued emphatically even hitler cant be that barmy hed start another war not after the last little dust up in germany youd sometimes think the next war had started already nah they aint got no army not to speak of therere men always on the march even if theyre only off to the reich labour service camps and armed only with beautifully polished picks and shovels therere always parades bands banners inciting everyone to be patriotic to put their country before absolutely everything even friends families husbands and wives my father looked unbelieving hitler will bring back conscription soon its inevitable hes got the raw material for his army halfcooked already i pray there wont be another war said my mother solemnly i couldnt face it all again thats for sure it was bad enough bringing you up with your dad in the army and the casualties and the zeppelins and the flu she added and thats not even to think of what they did to our bertie our only decoration in the basement was our shrine a photograph of my uncle albert with jaunty spiky moustache in khaki and twinkling brass it shared a frame with a sheet of printed buff foolscap with inked details like a notification of lost property by which the war office informed us that private a elgar of the city regiment had been killed in action it was headed casualties form letter and ended curtly in print i am to express the sympathy of the army council with the soldiers relatives over some distant civil servants signature we working class were of as little consequence dead as alive nobody even bothered advertising to us other than cigarettes beer and patent medicines it was the society of master and man officer and private the vigorous acquisitive voluptuous cruel society of the edwardians a society too thrustful successful and selfconfident to fall a casualty of the great war and was simply demobilized to become the gay twenties it saw britain through world war ii and when mr harold macmillan stopped his artificial respiration in was found to have been dead for several years i wouldnt let jim go for a soldier thats straight not after what hes made of himself my father looked at me proudly a selfindulgence he seldom allowed but if you asks me hitlers just having us on he aint got no money you see can i have another cup of tea please the fourth occupant of our table held across her large slightly chipped cup she was rosie the new nineteenyearold housemaid who completed the household staff with mrs emerald the daily char and holdsworth the chauffeur who lived out and was anyway away with the daimler the tipladys were enjoying their christmas holiday in some huge mansion whose windows glittered across muddy misty english fields like their hostess across the difficult terrain of london society i was naturally interested in rosie snubnosed and bright cheeked sharp and pert neat waisted promisingly plump above and below she slept in the attic five floors above my basement cubicle which was halffilled with chemistry books all week she had been trying perplexedly to make me out i was obviously a gentleman but i mucked in with the servants it was a contradiction beyond her grasp an outrage to established order like a millionaire in prison but when i chatted to her for ten minutes or so i became depressed and disgusted an illlettered housemaid was dross after a german schoolmistress my passion for gerda had burnt almost unfelt like a low fever but had flared painfully with a change of environment rosies bewilderment itself underlined my strange uncomfortable position in the tipladys house i was the frog which had turned into a prince an extremely awkward transformation in england where no former frog could possibly be asked to dinner after tea rosie had to air the beds because the tipladys were expected on the morrow at six thirty on the following evening my father brought me a summons to ascend past that resented green baize door which separated our two families like the watertight bulkheads between first class and steerage on the transatlantic liners i found the firstfloor drawingroom empty i stood where i had often stood before by the heavy brass fender which caged a display of wellpolished fireirons the coals in the carved marble fireplace flickering a vigorous yellow freshly made up for the evening by rosie it was a square room with three tall windows looking on harley street the ceiling moulded and picked out in gold the goldgreen wallpaper striped and silken the curtains matching precisely the furniture was antique and overplentiful there were two good pictures a stubbs of wellnourished groom holding wellnourished horse and a william blake god sinewy and sea green as the ormolu clock on the mantelpiece tinged half past six sir edward tiplady came in he was always punctual always preoccupied but with the doctors knack of concentrating upon you his limitless attention for the strictly circumscribed time allowed in his presence youre a rotten correspondent he said at once his hands were full of open letters accumulated during his holiday im sorry i find writing such an effort i keep putting it off then it seems too late to bother you sound like one of my patients excusing his failure to break his bad habits he went to the mantelpiece taking a cigarette from a silver box amid a forest of shiny white cards inscribed with copperplate seeking his attendance at social or medical gatherings i never remembered the mantelpiece without them he could have accepted barely a fraction but i suppose stuck them up from vanity or for selfassurance or because he thought it churlish to chuck them newly opened into the wastepaper basket you look five years older jim when did you get back christmas eve you knew theyd made tommy horder a lord yes that was last year just after i left england god knows why pal of ramsay macs i suppose tommy hasnt done anything in particular since attending the last king and discovering sugar in the royal wee he was famously jealous of unpretentious sarcastic thomas horder twenty years his senior and living down the road at no horder had made his way without pushing too violently the doors of the many anterooms to medical success tiplady was a deft manipulator of men and their favours and had no doubt whatever that he was a physician fit for a king perhaps he saw the truth which everyone whispered that lord horder was the better doctor did you see this years honours list morris of the morris oxford now lord nuffield neither rolls nor royce managed that sir edward lit the cigarette with his gold petrol lighter and threw himself into a brocade armchair sheaf of letters on his lap he was tall and lean handsome fairhaired and smoothcheeked in his early forties he had as usual plunged from holiday into consultations already arranged by his secretary mrs packer and wore his professional uniform of black jacket and striped trousers he seldom changed for dinner like everyone else his evenings always busy with patients or meetings i noticed that he now sported a large pearl pin through his grey silk tie and a dashing lavender waistcoat he still wore spats though he had abandoned the wing collar during the past twelvemonth he always had a clinical smell about him a faint tangy odour of antiseptic or perhaps he only suggested it he sat smiling wrinkling the fine lines round his pale blue eyes looking at me quizzically but fondly he always treated me in a humorously easygoing way he was always unsparingly kind to me and effortlessly generous i think he found our relationship less complicated than any other which he was obliged to make in the house of course it was a platonic homosexual one this streak in tiplady was then unmentionable tacitly unrecognizable and believed to nurture the seeds of collapse of the british empire as of the roman so youre not going back to germany i shook my head he continued i suppose every young mans entitled to one voyage of adventure even if it ends in shipwreck youre far more selfassured he decided meet any nice girls there only dr dieffenbachs daughter whatshernameyes gerda she must be very grown up she was a little thing of seven or eight when i finally got otto out of the clutches of our military people whats he think of our friend hitler hes one of his most fervent supporters sir edward looked shocked i just dont believe you a man of ottos social position and intelligence falling for all that ranting and raving you dont understand how it is over there i stopped it was becoming increasingly difficult to explain germany in secure easygoing respectable comfortable unexcitable insular fogbound england people like the dieffenbachs see hitler as their saviour against the communists and the man to put germany back on the map the map which they remember from the nazis sit round camp fires singing patriotic songs and the next morning batter to death anyone who disagrees with them but thats all exaggerated surely sir edward looked pained that i should regale him with travellers tales it was exactly the same during the war our newspapers running a serial of frightfulness by the hun babies on bayonets and all that i never believed a word of it neither did anyone else with a brain it was all a ruse of northcliffes to whip up morale on the home front well he got his viscountancy out of it a large fluffy pale ginger cat leapt into sir edwards lap its claws scratching the bundle of letters i had not been aware of an animal in the room but cats seem able to materialize themselves at will he sat stroking it restlessly i utterly refuse to take a single word that hitler utters seriously i did not feel that i could contradict him men believe what they want to believe or dare not disbelieve that was hitlers secret weapon from the start i only repeated what i had told my father of germany already a nation of marching armies well we wont be able to reintroduce conscription here he said cheerfully abruptly standing up and turfing off the cat he always seemed to be moving macdonald and the labour party would have fits well have to rely on the territorials and the officers training corps in the public schools to keep us out of the soup i wager everyone will have forgotten hitler in five years their chancellors come and go like the turns in a music hall show surely he pushed the bell beside the fireplace i say werent you ill over there otto wrote something last summer about a lymphangitis of the arm that must have been most unpleasant for you this was the moment for me to produce like the prize of the saladins talisman from the crusades the phial of tablets which i had stolen from domagks room whats this stuff he stood with legs apart before the fire turning the phial in his fingers without opening it its the drug dr dieffenbach cured my arm with it goes by the name of streptozon proprietary names mean nothing he interrupted impatiently you can name a drug like a new sort of chocolate chemically its paraamino sulphonamide i g farben have been making it for years as a red dye for carpets and curtains and all that for some reason or other they decided to try it against streptococcal infections ive even had a look at the lab report on their infected mice how did you come by this its a sample given me by professor domagk professor who i repeated the name hes the fellow who did all the work on it never heard of him im afraid to my amazement i had my trophy handed back but arent you interested in it not particularly chemotherapy is an exclusively german fetish because they are better at handling molecules than handling people and they have no compunction about slaughtering droves of mice to prove some obscure and often impractical chemical point i suppose i was a bad research worker when i was younger because i became too friendly with my guineapigs he sat at the mahogany bureau by the window spreading out his letters and uncapping his fountainpen leonard colebrook is at this very moment trying to cure ordinary puerperal fever by injecting his mothers with arsenicalsthe arsenicals which ehrlich invented against the spirochaete with utter lack of success i had not imagined this rebuff it worked on my arm i objected id prefer to ascribe that to your own healthy young blood rather than a dye for carpets he did not even look up everyone knows how lymphangitis can clear up on its own accord the germans are always pressing their latest chemicals on us as miraculous cures ive been injecting gold into my tuberculous patients for months with no good reason except that every other doctor in london has been persuaded to do the same i prefer to treat infections on the sound and tried principle of immunology as preached by our mutual friend sir almroth wright we were interrupted by my father in his tail coat with redandwhite striped waistcoat come to serve the evening cocktails you must be pleased to have jim home again elgar remarked sir edward still scribbling he uses too many of them jerry words sir but arent you glad hes become proficient in the german language whats wrong with english sir i always say my father disagreed cheerfully he was carrying a large oval silver tray by its handles ceremoniously breasthigh he lowered it slowly on the eighteenthcentury pier table marble topped its legs a vulgar profusion of gilt mermaids and dolphins then he filled a glass with pale sherry from a square decanter and transferred it to a silver salver all was performed with a solemnity an exaggeration of movement to imply that any action in sir edward tipladys personal service was of importance or that a butlers performance of tasks as easily done by his master was worth the money edward you havent changed yet lady tiplady appeared almost on the heels of my father you know were going to the theatre are we what a bore he was reading a letter through his monocle whats the show its the luntsreunion in vienna at the lyric the rothschilds asked us before christmas to join their box surely you remember ive laid out your evening dress sir came from my father who had to play the valet in the same way that my mother was obliged to double as housekeeper the war had replaced servant plenitude with the servant problem the ingredient of all middleclass conversation well jim you would seem to have resisted the siren voice of die lorelei lady tip as she was known downstairs directed to me a voice laced with the acid she kept for servants tradesmen gossip and dinner guests either boring or more intelligent than herself she was tall slim and darkhaired in her late thirties but looking younger beautiful and beautifully dressed perhaps i was lucky to resist it your ladyship as it is a voice reputed to deprive a man of his sight and hearing then the sirens voice would seem to have caught the ear of a good many people in germany today by all accounts she took a ginandfrench from my fathers salver without glancing at him what are we going to do about jim she asked her husband do he asked vaguely sipping his sherry at the desk i mean he cant go on living here can he i had noticed how the upper classes frequently assumed their language incomprehensible to the lower there were many things which they would never discuss before the servants the servants affairs they could discuss freely over their own heads but i was not listening the tipladys only child elizabeth had come into the room the year which may have changed me had transformed her i had previously disregarded her as a household nuisance like sir edwards half dozen cats now she was nearing fifteen and already developed as a young woman she had the same glistening dark hair pale complexion and high cheekbones as her mother but her eyes were softer her lips full and as inviting as june strawberries her breasts straining impatiently against the maidenly cut of her short blue dress she seemed infinitely innocent submissive and explosivethe look of leonardo da vinci she sat on the sofa turning her attention idly to a copy of the tatler lying on the fireside table with three or four new novels from harrods library the likes of me were to be ignored why not asked sir edward why shouldnt he still live with us the situation has become perfectly bizarre lady tip sat beside elizabeth on the sofa smoothing the sheathlike crimson silk evening gown over her long legs it was all right when he was the butlers boy but now hes a grown man and perfectly able to look after himself he cant expect us to go on feeding and housing him in times like these lady tip hated me she was naturally jealous of the attention and affection which i diverted from her husband my whole education i owed to sir edwards urging expense and inspiration the ladder of learning was then steep sharply tapering and rickety i was lucky to be the child in ten who progressed from elementary to secondary school and among the four in a thousand who stepped further into university there were only three hundred state scholarships and three hundred more from oxford and cambridge fought over by every clever poor child in the country sir edward had spurred me to win one of each he had himself coached me in latin for cambridge little go his cheques at trinity arrived for birthdays may week or out of the blue aside froth the unmentionable part of our relationship he was generous because he had no son and because he hated to see a good brain go to waste without sir edward i should today look back on a life scribbled away as a clerk in some benumbing office or i should be a millionaire jim could at least get a job and make some contribution to his keep lady tip continued perhaps i could persuade almroth wright to take you back at marys sir edward said to me though of course sir almroth hates chemists in any shape or form im seeing alexander fleming next week ill sound him out god what a bore old flem is getting he broke off it must be five years now since he found penicillium mould contaminating his petri dishes and killing off his staphylococci he still keeps working it into a discussion on anything whatever at the research club not of course that anyone can hear a word flem says beyond the first two rows theres always the dole said lady tip sipping her ginandfrench this annoyed sir edward you really cant expect jim to queue at the labour exchange with a lot of unemployed tram drivers and road menders why on earth not she asked calmly another cat a tortoiseshell appeared mysteriously and jumped on to sir edwards lap my father impassively poured a second glass of sherry elizabeth continued turning the shiny pages of the tatler the unattainable eyed by the unspeakable i signed on the dole at a labour exchange just behind oxford street the middleaged clerk behind the grille with his yellowish celluloid collar and dandruff luxuriated in the same official arrogance as the two young nazis in wuppertal police station i got twentynine and threepence a week i paid ten shillings through my father less as a contribution to lady tips household than to her meanness people like the tipladys passed through the depression as comfortably as passengers in a wagon lit across the bleak peasantsustaining plains of eastern europe though in and in london things werent as bad as they were remembered the british national income had dropped by barely a tenth compared with the american by half the hungry thirties was a will o the wisp risen from the industrially rotting areas of coal steel and shipbuilding up north the unemployed marched on london but the fire had gone out of the fight since the general strike of it was then that britain edged the way germany slid the organization for the maintenance of supplies was a private army blessed by home secretary joynsonhicks scourge of the decades touchingly coy pornographers which the various british fascist societies began to infiltrate but in the mids the unemployed were a force as submissive to authority as those who advanced at ypres or the somme and other names which lodged in british folk memorylike the dole itself in the land to which i returned like the land which i had left the political party system was suspended britain had a national government created in under the threat of imminent national bankruptcy and continued until under the threat of imminent national extinction ramsay macdonald had won his last election by asking for a doctors mandate a slogan suggested by sir edward tipladys bete noire sir thomas horder who breakfasted tкteаtкte every tuesday with this selfdoubting selfdespairing prime minister meanwhile king george the fifth gazed upon his subjects in or out of work with unfathomable benignity the prince of wales cut a dash round the empire and cambridge continued to win the boat race the wages of unemployment was boredom i was imprisoned in the basement irritated by the ringing of the patients doorbell to which my father continually ministered i read books from the library and spent afternoons in art galleries and museums obtaining a cultural education denied the usual biochemist as summer came i tramped london from parliament hill to the crystal palace patching the soles of my shoes with scraps of leather my father bought at a penny a bag from a kindly cobbler one early june evening i was idling away watching my father cleaning the silver in his butlers pantry which was hardly more than a large cupboard off the basement kitchen he sat in shirtsleeves and green baize apron an emaciated handrolled cigarette dangling from his lips got your eye on young miss elizabeth aint you he remarked abruptly i coloured at the discovery of a deadly and guilty secret when she came home from boarding school i always contrived to glimpse her round corners and through the cracks of doors or more delightfully skipping past our high window i could only romance about her but our fantasies are always more solidly satisfying than our realities as i was incapable of reply my father added casually while polishing a silver flower bowl shes not his you know i was equally shocked and intrigued what makes you think that i asked sceptically i had often romanticized my own true parentage but i bore a frustrating resemblance to my father i hear things he continued polishing in silence fact theres precious little about the family what i dont know when i goes into a room and they clam up tight i says to myself ullo something fishy here it doesnt take much to overhear a thing or two if youre careful though often its not worth the bother just a row about who theyre having to dinner such duplicity increased my respect for my father he was not entirely the simpleton i took him for but whose child is she do you know remember dr ross sir ronald ross i should say him of malaria day he died a couple of years back surely not ross i exclaimed i remembered sir ronald calling regularly at the house the summer we had moved in eight years previously he was then nearing seventy bull necked and square jawed wearing a grey moustache with spiked ends as might have decorated a sergeantmajor on august in a small laboratory facing queen victorias statue in calcutta ross had discovered the parasite which caused malaria in the stomach of the spottedwinged anopheles mosquito this was the last link in the casual chain of a fever which had baffled man since it had speeded the collapse of the roman empire the day was celebrated by annual oratorical lunches at the ross institute for tropical diseases at putney but ross was mostly proud of his four novels and his poetry which osbert sitwell mysteriously found of unforgettable beauty men always flatter themselves at doing at all what they do badly rather than easily and well he gave me one of his books and asked when i was going to join the army nah not him said my father contemptuously there was an italian doctor what came with him and what had bin aht to india and china and such places he knocked a spike of ash with his little fingernail into the cracked saucer which passed as an ashtray i remembered a tall thin sallow lankhaired younger visitor in ross shadow when sir edward was still a doctor in the army lady tip was having an affair it was during the flu what killed so many people he continued steadily applying silver powder dissolved in methylated spirits from another cracked saucer lady tip didnt catch the flu she caught something whats more common all the year round my amazement was followed by a pleasant feeling of conspiracy in lиsemajestй and the desanctification of the goddess elizabeth they still sees each other to this day and he still gets a bit of tail of her for all i know bloody good thing keeps the bitch in a better temper shouldnt think she gets even half an inch out of sir edward hes a sissy you know written all over him my father dropped his voice the pantry door was open and from the clatter in the kitchen it seemed rosie was laying the trays for tomorrows early morning teas she always seemed to create undue noise whatever she did why doesnt sir edward divorce lady tip i asked simply dont be barmy the kings physician a divorce would be the end of him at the palace thats for sure and in a lot of other respectable houses as well hed never live down the scandal the bell rang my father cursed pinched out his cigarette took off his baize apron and put on his tail coat lady tip wants her booze i suppose polish that jim theres a good lad he tossed me the chamois leather i started clearing the film of powder from the silver bowl ruminating on our sensational conversation i have refrained from giving the italian doctors name because it is perpetuated in a laboratory dye for bacteria and is familiar to the meanest medical student i did not anticipate being alone for long give us a kiss rosie appeared at the pantry door redfaced bright eyed lips pursed invitingly she was in her black art silk afternoon dressit was rough brown calico for the mornings cleaningbut she had taken off her lace apron and her collar and cuffs her dark curls tossed free of a cap giving her an excitingly undressed look i grabbed her she pressed hard against me seeming to exhale the heat of the glowing fires which she was continually reviving when are you going to take me to the pictures she asked pertly i cant afford it im on the dole go on ill pay that would never do why not lots of girls stand treat these days she rubbed her rough square nailed fingers against my cheek as i smiled without conceding to her she said regular toff aint you im one of the servants same as you are you speaks like a toff she slowly and voluptuously cradled my neck in her raw red arms she had set her cap at me as they said in the papercovered novels on greyish pages which she read beside the basement stove i was drawn into her soft embraces like a bee into a summer flower in common with gerda she never used perfume she couldnt afford even woolworths but unlike gerda her body had that heady tang which the italians call odure di donna she whispered if you came upstairs one night i wouldnt mind id wake the whole house up i objected no you wouldnt not if you went careful up the back stairs supposing lady tip found out youd lose your position rosie wrinkled her nose but made no reply i had already planned the route of a tiptoe romeo but had refused to let myself risk it not through chancing rosie the sack but because life was humiliating enough without taking a housemaid as a mistress i should be letting down the toffs we leapt apart the green baize door leading down to the basement creaked on its spring rosie was clattering at her trays again when my mother came in she wore her best black overcoat and her black hat with a bow and black gloves she had been to weekday evensong at holy trinity church by regents park sunday matins being precluded by the tipladys lunch she stood looking through the pantry door taking off her gloves i was busy polishing the silver with my leather dont put them cups down so youll break them she said quietly to rosie rosie looked round sharply and irritatingly set out the rest of the crockery with exaggerated tenderness then she tossed her dark curls and disappeared what was you two up to for a moment i was about to profess amazed innocence like a child then i said simply its nothing whatever to do with you my mother stared at me without changing her expression she looked abruptly at the floor dont waste yourself she raised her glance round the kitchen you can get yourself out of all this she said just loudly enough to carry the hate in her voice the baize door creaked my father clattered down the stone steps it was the bloody cats what wanted feeding he announced bad temperedly he added in the same tone you aint got far with that silver im a chemist not a scullerymaid he grunted picking up his nipped out cigarette from the saucer he turned away in silence it was the first time i dared to perform the experiment which demonstrated how terrified my parents were of me the bruised and silent atmosphere was fortunately shortly broken by the baize door opening again and mrs packer appearing in her hat and about to leave for the day jim there you aresir edward wants you upstairs the secretary was definitely not of the servants she could ring for her tea from her small white office beside the consulting room at the back of the ground floor she was pale and gingery with freckles she wore starched white coats tightly belted round her narrow waist before leaving for wuppertal i had imagined her middleaged but now i realized she could not have been much older than gerda no one seemed to know of mr packer nor to mention him you saw sir edwards been to the palace today she said proudly as we reached the hall its in the evening papers i had not noticed it whats sir edward want me about good news i hope he had a meeting with sir almroth wright earlier perhaps hes found a job for you i felt indifferent to this information when six months earlier i should have been elated idleness had become my life and the arduousness and discipline of employment looked distinctly uninviting the same spiritual enfeeblement was probably suffered by the three million britons who shared my experience i do hope so she was looking at me smiling head on one side it does seem such a criminal waste just kicking your heels down there i mean with a cambridge degree and everything she always sympathized with my being trapped in the lower classes as she would have sympathized with a convict wrongfully imprisoned that the social structure of the country was at blame crossed her mind as little as the prospect that it could ever be altered i found sir edward in his black jacket and striped trousers striding about the upstairs drawingroom hello seen the papers he greeted me boasting cheerfully nothing serious with the old gentleman but you know how panicky everyone gets after last time i took my place on the sheepskin rug the fire in summer replaced by a fan of shiny paper painstakingly folded by rosie and generously speckled with soot the king sends for me he doesnt send for tommy horder he continued in the same tone tommy may be a first rate diagnostician with a first rate practiceh g wells thomas beecham somerset maugham and all thatbut he understands illnesses better than he does people he took a cigarette from a mantelpiece more crowded with cards than ever as it was the height of the london season sir edward was a regular attendant not only at the royal bedside but at the royal armchair whenever his majesty fancied himself seedy he went down so well because of a flair when he chose to use it for putting medical processes into earthy terms and even the language of the stable this appealed to a monarch with a downright vocabulary and an ear for a broad story which was richly satisfied by his dominions secretary the cockney j h thomas he lit the cigarette throwing himself into an armchair you have to keep your head among those people at the palace you can imagine how i felt when lord dawson suddenly called me in that christmas of finding myself in a bedroom with my sovereign unconscious blue in the face and snorting like a grampus chest sounding like bubbleandsqueak xrays inconclusive needletap dry my distinguished colleagues throwing up their hands and the privy council convening all round me to tell the empire the king was dead he laughed and pressed the bell i needed inspiration to think of an abscess under the diaphragm and even more to know exactly where the needle had to go in search of the royal pus but i saved him a couple of months and he was off to convalesce in bognor i remember even today reading a proclamation damp on the wall its heavy official type declaring bravely ornately and pathetically whereas we have been stricken by illness and are unable for the time being to give due attention to the affairs of our realmthe news that a council of state was to act for the king ran through the country like a tolling bell the churches were left open day and night and my mother prayed at the kitchen table the germs of pneumonia were as indifferent to a crown as to a cloth cap and there was no treatment save the skilful fingers of his nurses after dr tiplady was called on the wednesday afternoon of december an internal abscess was spotted a rib snipped to emit the pus and antisepticsoaked gauze packed painfully into the gap the beloved monarch breathed easier the empire rejoiced dr tiplady became sir edward and bognor became bognor regis elgar i think ive found your lad a job sir edward announced as my father appeared with the cocktail tray glad to hear it sir get him from under our feet all day i saw sir almroth and flem this morning what flem never told me before he continued to me not of course that flem ever tells you anything conversation with him is like tennis with an opponent who pockets the ball after your every shotand what you never told me before was that penicillium mould contaminated his petri dish entirely through your own incompetence and carelessness he said this smiling goodhumouredly i never thought much about it at the time i confessed i was awfully busy working for my cambridge scholarship and scared stiff of being blown up by sir almroth if it came to his ears so i kept pretty quiet what modesty he said banteringly you participated in a discovery one of my jobs as a st marys lab boy was preparing the petri dishesshallow circular glass plates three inches across and quarter of an inch high with another fitting snugly over the top faintly resembling the domestic butter dish as even germs must feed these were floored with jelly made from pink japanese seaweed laced with the same meat broth as doubtless sustained the patients they had infected fleming used a loop of sterilized platignum to smear on the jelly the spit or pus which arrived in an unending stream of swabs from the wards to his tiny awkward laboratory in a turret on the corner of the hospital its three windows overlooking busy praed street after a night in the incubator the invisible seeds had grown by repeatedly splitting in two forming characteristic colonies which fleming could identify as one sort of germ or another for confirmation he stained them with dye and inspected them down his microscope which had a special leather guard to prevent condensation from an everrunning nose stimulated by an eversmouldering cigarette once escaped from their protective glass germs could be as dangerous as the vipers kept safely behind the windows of the reptile house of the zoo in my own memory two of sir almroth wrights sons in science as he called his staff had been killed by their work one caught tuberculosis another glanders which can strike down the rider as well as the horse my job was to sterilize the used petri dishes in a metal bowl of strong antiseptic but when fleming left for his holiday in scotland in the miserably cold july of i stacked the dishes in the bowl and completely forgot about them until the morning he returned he summoned me he pointed silently to the top two or three which i had so carelessly left above the level of the disinfectant fluid and which could have been extruding germs into the atmosphere like the breath of a sick man fleming never became angry he reminded me of another scots doctor described by robert louis stevenson in jekyll and hyde as about as emotional as a bagpipe but his taciturnity could make you feel horribly uncertain and guilty as i was hastily carrying the bowl away he picked up the top petri dish and said thats funny i saw it was contaminated with a blob of greenish mould fleming saw that the mould was killing off the colonies of staphylococcus germs all round it sir edward started stroking a black cat which had leapt into his lap i must admit it was canny of flem to notice his colonies of staphs turning to ghosts of their former selves thank god it was flem who baptized the mysterious mouldjuice penicillin did you know that penicillium is the latin for a brush i shook my head wright is so damn proud of his classical education he would have anointed the stuff with jawbreaking polysyllables far beyond flems limited powers of speech he took his glass of sherry from my father her ladyship wont be in to dinner tonight elgar very good sir there must have been a good many chances involvedeven the weatherto let those staphs grow cheek by jowl with the mould sir edward mused i always admired how he effortlessly switched the level of conversation from my father to myself it must have come from handling all manner of men in his profession i suppose the mould floated from praed street or heaven or the funnel of the cornish riviera express in paddington station for all i know hes kept the dish you know he showed it me this morning it is now in the british museumfittingly history being largely the record of mans lucky or unlucky mistakes so flems ended up with a neat little laboratory toy sir edward continued do you know what he does with this penicillin not exactly i never heard of it again until you mentioned it after i got back from germany he mixes it with the agar jelly in his petri dishes and it kills off all the bugs causing the common diseasesyou know pneumonia gonorrhea diphtheria septicaemia and all that but it doesnt touch such odd birds as bacillus influenzae so flem makes his patients cough all over a petri dish soaked in his mould juice and if theyre incubating the influenza bacillus it will grow in lovely colonies instead of being crowded out by the other common or garden bugs thats rather neat oh its a very elegant experiment but of course flems one of the most stylish lab workers ive ever come across i wish we had someone like him at blackfriarsmy own hospital suffers a very hamhanded lot in the bacteriological department though unfortunately the experiment is not of the slightest importance whatever he laughed andrews and the bright boys at the medical research institute have discovered that flu isnt caused by the influenza bacillus at all its due to a virus he drained his sherry no more thank you elgar that will do my father withdrew by custom turning at the door to leave backwards as though sir edward were royalty rather than its medical attendant so flem goes on boring us about his wretched mouldjuice at the research club but i suppose edward jenner utterly bored his friends for twenty years over his smallpox vaccination theories at any rate they tried to chuck him out of something called the conviviomedical club down in gloucester but the story may have a happy ending for you sir almroth would like to see you again hes even asked you to tea sir edward produced his pocket diary screwing in his monocle tuesday july gbs will be there he paused for me to look impressed i knew that shaw was a regular visitor to the ceremonial if unappetizing teas in sir almroths department so youd better sharpen up your wits he advised sir almroth may offer you a job but of course i cant promise the inoculation department at marys is hardly running with money like your german drug companies he pushed the black cat off his lap and stood up now i must run along ive a hundred things to finish before i dine in solitary state my wife is out tonight in the company of an old admirer he tried to say this lightly but in a sentence his voice plummeted down like a singers we both looked embarrassed he struggled to resume in his usual manner let me give you some advicenever get married but he failed then he stroked my cheek that was the only gesture he ever made towards me i was frightened to discover how miserable he was i can remember today that speck of mould on flemings petri dish it was fluffy and white its centre dark green almost black i remember wondering at the time if it was the same mould as grew upon the loaves we ate in the basement too stale to set before our betters above stairs my mother would often bandage it on my septic cuts an old wives remedy which sent me to school with my fingers in the form of a sandwich the mould from a dead mans skull was apparently more effective had she been able to lay her hands on any the mould had at least not lodged me unfavourably in the memory of sir almroth wright as i left for tea with him three weeks later i daringly slipped into my tweed jacket pocket the phial of domagks streptozon i decided that the kings physician had been a shade offhand about the drug today i realize that sir edward had little faith in any treatment at all because there was little treatment to have any faith in even for a king he had only insulin for the diabetic liver for the anaemic and digitalis for the cardiac xrays were ghostly and the electrocardiograph a delicate toy he used mostly his own eyes hands and ears dextrously assembling round the sick man a fragile scaffolding of the medicaments available until nature cured i had not set eyes on st marys hospital since leaving with my scholarship after working there and enjoying free its firstyear lectures it was an exorbitantly solid building of red brick and stone its first and second floors with verandahs looking upon the passing bus tops in praed street the prince consort laid its foundation stone in it grew amid the shrieks of engines from paddington station the miasmas of the grand junction canal and the stink of a nearby carters stables the hospital itself was sick in my time it was the most popular among the medical students in london being the worst and therefore the easiest to get into but the new dean was already effecting a cure as in world war ii he effected it with the health of winston churchill the terrace of seedy victorian shops opposite was the same so was the fountains abbey pub on the corner but the turret which had housed the inoculation department in converted poky wards and sisters sittingrooms was superseded by a handsome rectangular fivestoried building joined to the hospital by a bridge and known to everyone as the house of lords ah young elgar been on your travels i hear i found sir almroth wright in his own laboratory at his elbow a row of metal drums packed with testtubes plugged by cotton wool on the bench before him microscope petri dishes platignum loops a throaty bunsen burner behind him shelves of chemical reagents and dyes a bacteriologist like an airline pilot has to keep everything within fingertip reach he immediately started talking to me in german which he had learned fifty years before as a student in leipzig it seemed to suit his taste for polysyllabled pomposity pink cheeked white hair brushed across the dome of his head white moustached he had a nordic look inherited from his grandfather once director of the swedish mint he had a protruding lower lip circular steelrimmed glasses half way down a stubby nose a dark suit with the hopelessly illfitting look of a growing schoolboys and only a wing collar to show respect for his professional position it would seem that herr hitlers cohorts are now diverting their murderous energies more usefully against each other he broke off in english after we had talked of wuppertal and domagk directly after von papenof all peopledared to speak out for tolerance freedom of the press silence for fanatics and all that causing dr goebbels to stuff his fingers very promptly into his countrymens earholes from my knowledge of the officer corps i should imagine the german army was behind the massacre at munich they wouldnt care for rцhms plan to enlist a brownshirted rabble of two and a half million storm troopers in their ranks i saw that he was not condescending to invite my opinion and indeed events had moved so swiftly in germany after my leaving that i could not give one it was shortly after the night of the long knives when hitler appeared at two oclock on the saturday morning of june at the hanslbauer hotel in the lakeside resort of weissee near munich to pull his closest friend ernst rцhm and other top storm troopers from their beds an operation simplified by many being in bed with each other peculators drunkards and homosexuals the storm troopers appeared through the monocle of general von brauchitschand they were anyway interfering with the serious business of germanys illicit rearmament a thousand other prominent germans were murdered in the days which followed affable portly artful dodger general kurt von schleicher was shot on his doorstep with his new wife the socialism in national socialism was eliminated the storm troopers were demoted the blackuniformed ss were freed to become the most efficient and ruthless political police in europes tortured history president hindenburg watched it all through eyes dimming with death and the gentleman showjumper franz von papen whose talent for survival approached genius lived to fight another day at nьrnberg german politics lead us on to german drugs sir almroth tipped my red streptozon tablets into the palm of his hand i left elberfeld with the laboratory and the factory in my mind inseparable he said in a discouraging voice i g farben churns out every variety of chemical for dyes pesticides and yarns and professor domagk churns them into mice to see if the chemical kills them or the bacteria with which hes already infected the poor creatures thats not experimentation thats not even science its roulettea limited mental exercise which even with the best of luck inevitably bankrupts the players i had anticipated a rebuff more readily than from sir edward sir almroth wright was a victorian naturalist with a microscope at one with the country rector classifying his lepidoptera the holidaymaking schoolmaster chipping specimens from the alps the don with camelhair brush crosspollinating his roses he sought the panacea with glass microscope slides putty and dabs of sealingwax the cure for disease the elimination of human disease altogether lies in the intelligent application of vaccine therapy he emphasized to me this was more than wrights life work it was wrights life do you know what is far superior to any mouse as an experimental animal the human white blood corpuscle we watch down our microscopes the effect of our cures upon that not upon cages of white mice he handed me back the phial i was in no position to protest nor had i the courage our conversation was anyway disrupted by the sudden appearance of dr john freeman tall handsome charterhouse and oxford in his fifties but eternally energetic said in the inoculation department always to blow in blow up and blow out sir almroth gave his usual salutation well friend what have you won from our mother science today they started discussing hay fever on which freeman was an expert he thought this miserable complaint to be caused by the spores of moulds and for years had scraped bedroom floors all over london for specimens of them they were shortly joined by professor alexander fleming as different from freeman as burns from byron flem was not charterhouse and oxford but kilmarnock academy and regent street polytechnic the last of an ayrshire sheep farmers large family he clerked four years in a leadenhall street shipping office before warmer breezes of fortune brought him the windfall of a legacy and wafted him into st marys at the turn of the century he had passed the surgical fellowship with the plan of applying his nimble fingers to the profitable scalpel of an eye surgeon but had been given a job in the inoculation department to retain at st marys his other talents as a sharpshooter in the hospital rifle team their talk turned to wound infection all three had served in the royal army medical corps during the war at no general hospital in boulogne casino studying infection in the top floor laboratory even constructing experimental wounds among the plethora from paper and spiky testtubes impregnated with blood serum and germs wright had always been close to the army he was professor at the army medical school in the s resigning when the army ridiculed his notion of inoculation against typhoid fever fifteen out of every thousand soldiers in the boer war died from typhoid then the army thought again and in the great war the proportion dropped to two sir almroth had a military air about him the atmosphere of his department was said to resemble a mess of the indian medical service and so did the language he always talked of his sons in science and if one of them had the effrontery to get married never spoke to him for six months a marie curie a florence nightingale could never have found work in the inoculation department he had married one of the most intelligent women in ireland but that blew up before europe did in and he went home every night to a housekeepers dinner off the earls court road that he was a homosexual was a secret which everyone knew and no one uttered it was four oclock we went through to the library which contained a divan some wooden chairs a square kitchen table and a gas ring for the kettle tea was a daily ritual which wright naturally dominated george bernard shaw probably attended because even he was flattered to share the cabalistic confidences of medical men i had never set eyes on gbs nor on a performance of one of his plays but i had heard all about him in the s everyone in england had heard all about him because he was continually telling englishmen what to do about everything i saw the famous grizzly white beard the thick white eyebrows and neatly parted white hair he wore a brown tweed suit with a soft collar and looselyknotted tie shaw was then seventyeight wright was seventythree both were irishmen they had known respected and misunderstood one another since the start of the century i had decided to write a note of the expectedly brilliant conversation which i still have like lesser men they talked of women emotional tension is intolerant of an intellectual impasse declared sir almroth but not in the woman the female intellect will fail in trying conditions as a baby austin car will fail on a steep hill he had himself learned to drive a car at the age of sixtyfour she will either come to a halt coast with everincreasing momentum back to where she started from or blow up and burst into tears shaw was arrogantly at ease long legs stuck out the female intellect will grasp as quickly as my own that you are reloading your guns with the same ammunition you fired against the suffragettes and now its even more likely to explode in your face with twenty years rust on it my target has not changed it has simply progressed a little i wrote the unexpurgated case against woman suffrage in everyone in the inoculation department had heard of the book and no one had read it today they hoist the flag of womens freedom but that is the flag of financial freedom for women and financial servitude for men any man will beggar himself for a woman with the exquisite cheerfulness he reserves for observing somebody else beggar his neighbour shaw had of course no need to wind up the watch of his wit but the chimes sometimes had little relevance to the hour i noticed fleming perched on the table looking bored he was a short stocky man with a large head a pink complexion pale blue eyes a small chin and a straight mouth which turned down at each end like sir walter scotts his was that unmercurial lowland face to be encountered as readily in the pubs of glasgow as the mission huts of china or the surgeries of canada he was clean shaven though at the boulogne casino he was a lieutenant with a neat triangular black moustache he seldom smiled he was often silent at fiftythree his thick black hair with a quiff had grown grey he wore his usual dark suit with semistiff collar and spotted bow tie and it was the brief period of the year which he found too warm for his grey knitted pullover he had an enormous wristwatch he was nearly always smoking a cigarette i wondered if his thoughts were in his lab or the chelsea arts club where he stopped on his way home or even further in the hills of argyll sir almroth took a teacup from the fixedly smiling freeman he continued severely you cannot divert attention from good arguments by bad ones as you repeatedly succeed in doing on the stage the female physiological constitution is a matter of fashion like all medical theories todays philosophy is tomorrows absurdity and what was rank foolishness last year is everybodys wisdom the next it was the traditional fireworks display in the inoculation department but the squibs were growing damp shaw did not die until he broke his hip lopping trees in but that afternoon in st marys he had everything behind him only geneva and in good king charless golden days to come it was thirty years since wright had struck from his flinty mind the spark of the doctors dilemma the play was prompted by a gratified observation from freeman that the department had more work than it could handle and wrights reply to shaws inevitable question that the human life for the doctor to save under such pressure of strained resources was the life most worth saving sir almroth had walked out of the first night at the royal court theatre in not because he objected to his depiction on the boards as sir colenso ridgeon the stimulator of the phagocytes but because in his opinion shaw killed off the wrong patient behind sir almroth that afternoon was his brazen declaration the physician of the future will be an immunizer ahead lay the bitter confession at the age of eighty to the royal society of medicine of the need for abandoning much in immunology regarded as assured he left a heap of discredited medical theories and a book on logic which consumed his life in the writing and again which nobody wanted to read as i left fleming handed me silently a copy of the british journal of experimental pathology which he inscribed on the cover for j elgar and signed neither he nor anyone else had said anything about a job jim i was just quitting the hospital under the bridge leading to the house of lords i spun round david what the hell are you doing back here boy taking tea with sir almroth wright what with the holy ghost himself my word youre doing well im on the dole go on pull the other one what are you doing here im doing my clinical im one of the students didnt i tell you i was going to marys when i went down from cambridge ive been here a year did you get that first in your part two david mellors modestly nodded away this achievement what have you been up to more work on the staining of bacteria ive had a year in germany you never let on you were going which university i worked in a brewery oh lovely how do i get a job like that he was small dark wiry lively as welsh as a leek he looked at his wristwatch listen boy ive got a five oclock lecture the fountains across the road opens at six ill meet you in the public bar can you waste an hour an hour seemed of little consequence when i had wasted the past six months i idled the time away by going to paddington station and watching the trains david mellors and i had been friendly at trinity thrown together by both of us being scholarship boys thackerays pendennis was still up at cambridge then most of the undergraduates at trinity were from the great public schools many were there simply to amuse themselves they were swells who never spared their polished contempt for students with the wrong sort of clothes or wrong sort of accent or who worked too hard or had too many brains i had spent vacations cycling with david round the welsh valleys where his father kept a chemists shop and was immeasurably better off than mine we lost touch since i quit cambridge for wuppertal during the christmas vacation of the young live too immediately to recognize friendship as a precious plant worth careful cultivation i arrived at the fountains abbey as the landlord was shooting back the bolts i sat at a small round table with half a pint of mild ale and there being no sign of david pulled out the journal which fleming had pressed on me it was issue no dated june an abstruse publication which appeared every two months and which i had never before opened inside was a list of its editors i recognized only two names j c drummond was a biochemist like myself a sprightly wellliked gourmet professor at university college in bloomsbury w h florey i remembered as an australian at cambridge lecturer in pathology and a fellow of gonville and caius college next door to trinity during my final year dr florey had left to become professor at sheffield and every high table chorused amazed tuttuts the index of papers seemed pretty uninteresting tetanusmyxomatosis of rabbitsthe last of all had the title on the antibacterial action of cultures of a penicillium i had never seen flemings paper on the fruits of my mistake i found it covered thirteen pages bolstered with tables and photographs it told me little that i had not already heard from sir edward tiplady i noticed that twentyfive unknown st marys nurses who are claimed to be the prettiest in london had involuntarily helped the research when laid up with influenza their throat swabs had been cultivated on agar jelly with and without penicillin added on the ordinary jelly the streptococcus and pneumonococcus germs which flourish even in healthy throats grew profusely with the penicillin no nurses germs grew at all there was a photograph of the original petri dish which fleming had shown sir edward it made me recall something which fleming said at the timethat he was studying the pigment which coloured colonies of staphylococcus germs which showed best if the germs were grown at room temperature instead of inside an incubator so that particular petri dish happened to have been left open on the laboratory bench for the penicillium mould to drop on it as sir edward had mentioned the mould juice had been squeezed from a skein of chances fleming ended by mentioning that its lack of irritant or poisonous effect might recommend penicillin as a surgical dressing or for an injection round an infection there was still no sign of david mellors i rolled up the journal and stuck it back in my pocket carefully retaining half an inch in the bottom of my glass to defy the landlord the pub was filling as david burst in pile of notebooks under his arm stethoscope coiling from the jacket of his unkempt blue suit i had a practical to finish whatll you have half of mild halves he said contemptuously pints tonight boy what in the world were you seeing the holy ghost for he demanded as he reappeared with the beer i was trying to get a job im on the dole honestly david took a long draught any luck not the smell of an oilrag like a fool i introduced the subject of chemotherapy that did for me oh chemotherapy wright always calls it pharmacotherapy anyway pompous sod isnt he where are you living same place my parents still work at the tipladys sir edward did pretty well for himself spotting that subphrenic abscess in the old geezer he was referring to his majestys illness it shouldnt have cracked anyones brains open pus somewhere pus nowhere else pus under the diaphragm thats the hoariest of surgical tags perhaps lord dawson and the assembled pundits thought themselves above such aids to memory where are you living im in clover boy with archie fry in london i thought he strode over his broad acres in the country oh archies quite a man about town in his own peculiar way a flat in belgravia doncherknow david tipped up the end of his nose with his forefinger very palatial even a jeeves whats he want to share with you for i asked bluntly its his socialist ideals you know what archies like its his fathers flat but hes got the run of it an enormous place he thinks he should fill with families of unemployed from the east end i salve his conscience im cleaner and im probably less trouble when i come home drunk archie fry was my third friend at trinity where other undergraduates afforded us disdain archie treated david and i to patronizing equality he was a selfmade socialist from eton like george orwell but where cadaverous tuberculous orwell took the world as his punchbag to be pounded with muscular prose archie was delightfully inept at everything he grappledwriting publishing politics or the quest for martyrdom in love or war he volunteered as a matter of course for spain in and for the guards in but succeeded in escaping harm from either since i began writing this story archie has dropped dead on holiday at st tropez age brings no pleasures only compensations of which the cosiest is reading the obituaries of your contemporaries over breakfast as expected the times strewed his grave with ornate wreaths of poisoned ivy but archie was essentially a nice man that highest of sparing tightlipped english compliments and his death brings me now only the feeling of a friend who has left by an earlier train it also finally struck off that unrusting shackle which binds two men who have shared the bed of the same woman drink up i need another pint urged david he was the cleverest student i had ever known and his bucolic bounce no affectation its my turn youre on the dole i refuse to accept charity i said only half humorously why not i accept it from archie look at this tie he held it out its his pure silk from jermyn street i think ive got his socks on as well you dont mind sponging on him its not sponging boy its socialism hes a socialist of the pureminded sort which is a mugs game down where i come from were all socialists but on the receiving end thats different after the next pintor perhaps the one after or the one after thatdavid suggested why dont you batch with archie too you cant go on living in the servants hall for ever i havent the nerve to ask him besides my parents would miss me let them its got to come sooner or later what have you got in common with them they might have found you on the doorstep if it isnt you ill be sleeping among the dregs of a mile end doss house archies conscience has been troubling him a lot lately though id put it down to dyspepsia and the wind he spotted the journal in my pocket and frowned as he pulled it out what are you doing with this rag even real qualified doctors cant understand it not the ones at marys at any rate i turned to flemings paper and told him my part of the story when i finished he said yes ive heard of penicillin but i didnt know what it was its the lysozyme tale all over again isnt it you must have seen that famous cartoon in the marys gazette everybody had seen it at marys it depicted a line of schoolboys being birched at a penny a time by some amiable sadist over jars labelled tear antiseptic one winters day in the niobe of sinuses had mothered a scientific infant when a drip from flemings nose fell on a petri dish and dissolved the germs growing thereexactly like penicillin lysozyme sir almroth had christened the mysterious substance fleming found it in tears which he evoked from his colleagues by squirting lemons into their eyes until to everyones relief he discovered it also in pikes eggs fleming suggested that lysozyme might be used against human infections but medical london in was not particularly interested medical london was becoming wary of the fine scientific horses with flowing philosophical manes which pranced in sir almroth wrights stables i heard later that fleming had given a couple of lectures on the idea but doubtless these were as usual incomprehensible when i worked as a lab boy flem had lost all interest in lysozyme i told david that was a big fault of his according to everyone in the department he was far more interested in performing an elegant experiment than in the result which the experiment was supposed to produce still flems had some jammy luck first a blob of snot then a blob of mould they just happened to drop on a petri dish growing bacteria at exactly the right time surely theres no talent in the world as useful as a talent for luck i snatched back the journal flicking it over to the last page of flemings paper that mould it didnt bloody drop from heaven i can tell you exactly where it came from at the end of the paper fleming gave the usual courteous thanks to his colleagues thats the fellow i exclaimed the irishman with the french name mr la touche he was a mycologist which means that he did nothing from morning to night except handle moulds of various sorts now i come to think of it that penicillium mould couldnt possibly have floated through the windows of flems little lab up in the turret for the simple reason that flem never opened them the noise from the traffic in praed street was terrible and anyway he had enough germs in testtubes on the windowsills to kill the entire british army flem wouldnt have been the most popular man in paddington if theyd dropped on the top deck of a passing omnibus david drained his glass disappointingly unimpressed i remember when i worked there in i went on la touche used to grow specimens of moulds in big open dishes for dr freeman to make vaccines and inject his hayfever patientslike immunization against typhoid and la touches lab was immediately below flems why it was a fungus factory the staircase outside must have had more moulds floating in it than any area in london flems mould didnt originate from the hand of god but from the bedroom slippers of some wheezy asthmatic or rheumyeyed hayfever sufferer do you suppose flem would be interested if i told him i shouldnt think so it would only indicate that he was working in filthy conditions in the end i agreed to move in with david im prepared to pay archie ten bob a week i told him at archies you dont pay you borrow lets go down the road and get some fish and chips ill stand treat i still have the journal signed by fleming if i sent it along to sothebys auction rooms i should get a substantial sum for it you can still see the grease mark of our fish and chips hargraves has just come in today as i write these memoirs on the top floor of arundel college in bloomsbury that most melancholy of districts where the gaily contentious ghosts of lytton strachey and lovely lesbian carrington haunt disconsolately the concrete academic groves of london university my arbeitszimmer is but a quarter the size of gerhard domagks in elberfeld it looks not upon the schwebebahn but on british rail i stare down on the lines winding away from euston station behind the backs of crumbly houses whose tiles were shivered by hitlers luftwaffe and the kaisers zeppelins i have no otto dix on the wallthough our country home sports a couple of bratbys who resembles dix with a splash of cockney cheerfulness but i have the same framed photographs of fellow scientists one is of domagk himself a few strands of hair brushed across the dome of his head in plasticrimmed glasses and the sleeves of his white lab coat still too long for him he is working at his microscope in the room where i met the girl with the slav eyes it is scrawled upon barely legibly freundliche grьsse gerhard domagk a year later he died aged sixtyeight at no jдgerstrasse round the corner from his old home in walkьrenallee near the zoo it was an infected gallbladder the germs got their revenge people in wuppertal said gloomily the photograph next to domagks is inscribed to jim elgar good luck alexander fleming flem is silver haired and unaccountably wistful with rimless glasses and a spotted bow tie and a herpes lesion on his lower lip it is a studio study from the time of his second marriage in to his bacteriological assistant from greece dr amalia koutsourisvourekawho to my mind achieved even mightier distinction by being the first woman allowed by sir almroth wright to work in his department flemings photograph is dated november precisely a year and four months before he died from a coronary thrombosis in bed he lies in the crypt of st pauls with wellington and nelson my third photograph is from the bacteriologist leonard colebrook for professor john elgar regards coli a kind scholarly face a long mouth with a deep upper lip and protruding lower one beetling brows and beaky nose under heavilyrimmed glasses he died on september another coronary the remaining one was given me by jack drummond one of the editors of the journal which contained flemings paper he signed it when he was knighted in he was murdered after the war by a french farmer after such a gallery of fatalities my wife has strictly forbidden me to sign anything for presentation to anyone hargraves would certainly frame my own photograph and hang it on the wall if he thought it would reliably speed my demise hargraves is a coming man and most impatient about it i do not like hargraves not that he is in the slightest unpleasant on the contrary he is always smiling encouraging our juniors joking with our students and shaking hands warmly with our visitors he is an outstanding chemist and exceptional organizer he has stylish hair a fancy moustache glistening teeth square glasses and his clothes always look new at home he has a pink plastic swimming pool and a talkative wife he goes for holidays on baked insanitary beaches in spain and discusses television i suspect that he eats breakfast cereals and drinks vodka and even applies aftershave lotion hargraves had wedged his way between my filing cabinets and my desk ostensibly to chat about my research nobody at arundel knows exactly what research i am doing i am remote in my own small laboratory like the ageing sir almroth wright who would arrive at st marys after lunch and potter scientifically until released by dinner suddenly hargraves threw in a confession i was at the college council meeting yesterdaythey were sorry again you couldnt make itwhen the pleasant suggestion cropped up that you might be allowed to round off your time here with a sabbatical year he meant that he had urged them to push me out early what should i do all day travel oh god well we all know how you love your farm jim why must everyone use christian names hardly through friendship in this age of intense mutual suspicion to insist that we are all equal supposing i had called my mentor almroth my wife runs the farm if i were there all week id only get in the way youre being modest jim she told me you were invaluable with the livestock no i prefer to stay here to the bitter end its disheartening slogging your way through a marathon and giving up at the last lap personally of course im delighted that youre prepared to carry responsibility for the department a little longer im sure you are hargraves left he will try again at the next council meeting unless i mischievously swallow my boredom and attend the summer of saw an improvement in my condition i escaped from the basement and i found a job for both i was indebted to archie fry i left home in the middle of july perhaps my parents were secretly glad to shed the puppy they had become overfond of which turned into a dog they had no idea what to do with rosie turned pale sir edward had sailed to america but lady tip summoned me up to the drawingroom i thought you might have asked to see me of your own accord jim elizabeth sat on the sofa beside her just released from boarding school bewitching in soft summer dress of cream silk she sat looking at me wideeyed as though i were some queer fish dredged from the depths for her biological inspection i didnt imagine that you would be particularly distressed if i failed to say goodbye your ladyship i did not know in my own mind if i were being rude or apologetic i am distressed not because you didnt faire vos adieux thats a matter of indifference but you are leaving my house after eight years without so much as coming to thank me for sheltering you for feeding you and for doing absolutely everything for you during that time you went to germany and came back again without so much as a murmur of thanks or even asking my leave thats exactly the same with everyone of your class rank ingratitude all take and no give my parents may be your ladyships servants but im not i said more boldly as far as im concerned i can see no distinction i cant understand that attitude but of course im so much better educated than you are how dare you remember your position whether through embarrassment or fright or simply from seeing the fun of the situation her daughter broke the tension by giggling shut up snapped lady tip at her but without avail shut up oh get out you little swine she dismissed me archie frys flat was the first floor of an enormous house at the corner of belgrave square gloomy and rambling full of heavy furniture and bad paintings in expensive frames everywhere terribly dusty david and i shared a huge room at the back and looked after ourselves archie was out all day and often most of the night running hostels for downandouts in the east end or reforming the world with the fabian society or nursing a north london constituency which he hoped to win as labour candidate in the next election he failed shortly after my arrival we all three contrived to dine together in the vast green and gold diningroom archie was eager for my impressions of germany surely you cant condemn these labour service camps out of hand archie objected the young germans may make themselves look ridiculous by shouldering arms with shovels but theres plenty of men in this country whod jump at the chance of doing the same for three square meals a day thats not the point the nazis turn even the digging of ditches into a military exercise for the glory of the fatherland how can we blame them the treaty of versailles was perfectly wicked we couldnt expect any selfrespecting nation to lie down under it after fifteen years it seems high time to admit that and admit herr hitlers right to demand parity of armaments with us and the french in the meantime digging ditches seems a preferable occupation for young men in uniform than digging graves but dont you understand the nazis dont see war as we do something to be avoided at all costs they see war as necessary and desirable the great national purifier the hegelian view commented archie the moral health of nations is corrupted by unbroken peace as ternpests preserve the sea from the foulness brought by prolonged calm of course a lot of german philosophy is sheer lunacy i suppose because theyre not blessed with authors like lewis carroll and w s gilbert who can write lunacy properly he struggled to cut his leg of chicken archie was tall and spare with a sharp nose and bony face his eyes soft and brown his hair dark and lank he wore a suit of donegal tweed with a red knitted tie in a loose collar an outfit which other young men of his background would have thought more suitable for the butts than belgravia this chicken complained david mellors across the oval mahogany table i dont know what disease it succumbed to but its got a bad case of rigor mortis watson cant you do better than this demanded archie of his manservant who appeared with a dish of greyish boiled potatoes the jeeves was knobblyfaced bald tubby and flat footed archie proudly claimed the man never needed call him sir the effect was his being uninterruptedly rude to all three of us whats wrong with it watson asked we cant cut it let alone eat it david poured himself another glass of the chateau bottled claret the food at archies was terrible the drink superb and plentiful and he never seemed to worry at our helping ourselves you cant expect me to work miracles watson replied surlily if you wants proper vittles youll have to get a proper cook im sorry cooking is too much for you watson archie told him apologetically id engage a cook tomorrow but you know how i disapprove of a house full of servants then youd better go out to lyons corner house i cant do everything keeping this place clean is like dusting the bloody british museum of course watson i appreciate all you do to make us comfortable if you dont want your chicken ill clear it away watson said aggressively no no watson well try ive got some bicarbonate outside and theres a stomach pump at marys said david watson really is a little difficult archie murmured as he left but if i didnt employ him nobody else would i just cant agree with you jim he resumed i cannot take the nazis seriously you havent seen them at close quarters ive been interrogated by them that was quite frightening yes but germans tend to browbeat people as a matter of course its part of the national character thats the very secret of nazism they exaggerate and twist every thought inside a german head what once passed as normal now becomes dangerous and grotesque love of country respect for discipline pride in raceeven uniforms and torchlight parades and camp fires perfectly harmless in themselves are these days exploited to the single end of the glorification of adolf hitler the germans are perhaps a krankes volk a sick people archie reflected but im perfectly certain that hitler is simply whipping up excitement for excitements sake like a speedway rider or circus performer to keep his peoples minds off the economic situation you mean hitlers just the daring young man on the flying trapeze roughly yes oh god you blind fool i pushed away the chicken i wasnt hungry any more anyway i had come back from germany full of the dangers of hitler and the blessings of sulphonamide nobody would believe me about either i began to suspect i was in the wrong the following week archie found me my job his father was the creator of frys carbolic soap and a thousand other items by which the british masses removed their natural odours and substituted others he was also a governor of the arundel college which employs me to this day which is akin to the imperial college of science in kensington in his secretively generous way archie got his father to grant a few hundred pounds for research into the disinfectant properties of various medicated soaps and there was no difficulty in my being appointed its beneficiary research in those days carried no glamorous suggestion of whitecoated armies steadily advancing the frontiers of knowledge it did not exist outside the few universities and exceptional departments like sir almroth wrights a busy harley street specialist might cut up a cat as sparetime relaxation comparable with salmon fishing or hospital politics if you needed research apparatus more elaborate than a bunsen burner or a retort you constructed it yourself there was nobody to manufacture it there was anyway no money to buy it i started that summer to examine the potency of antiseptics like carbolic chlorine formaldehyde or iodine against common household germs in the end i found plain soap to be more effective than any of them i hope to the gratification of my sponsor but first i had to supply myself with germs for which i turned to an acquaintance of my days in st marys dr leonard colebrook colieveryone called colebrook by his bacteriological nickname from bacillus coli even himselfwas reared a strict nonconformist frugal teetotal his interests only gardening and euthanasia like me he was a grammar school boy he was due to leave the inoculation department the year after i quit it for cambridge and again like me found himself without hope of a job coli was grateful for a salary of ј a year to work in the research laboratory of queen charlottes maternity hospital which midwives know the world over he was still there and the hospital was just down the way from arundel college in the marylebone road coli often bustled into arundel from his little open morris oxford with a bag which seemed more suited for the necessities of a leisured weekend than a days work which he would drop while simultaneously whipping off his homburg hat and struggling from an enormous enveloping raincoat in another moment deep in discussion with some member of the staff more elevated than myself i had started at arundel promptly at the beginning of august and during my second week intercepted him in the marblelined hall why its elgar what have you been doing with yourself he asked amiably he was slightly built and barely five feet tall just turned fifty the last i heard youd got a first at cambridge and were doing some work on staining techniques with hopkins well done i told him about wuppertal he remarked hows your german its improved das versteht sich german is essential for keeping up to date in any of the sciences coli matched a deep voice with a deliberate solemn way of saying things youll remember i took myself off to breslau while you were working under the lion he used the more flattering soubriquet for sir almroth wright the pair were so close they were often compared in the department with father and son he mentioned fleming and his mould juice it was your fault wasnt it that the penicillium ever contaminated his petri dish did you know that professor raistrick tried to purify the stuff down the road from here at the london school of tropical medicine i had never heard of anyone interested in penicillin outside st marys that must have been in or thereabouts flem sent him a sample from that original sporeraistrick knows absolutely everything about moulds of course he tried growing it on a special glucose solution it produced a sort of mat on the surface but the potencys all in the juice underneath my chemists curiosity aroused i asked i suppose raistrick never isolated the active principle he hadnt much luck he ended up with a yellow pigment which he called chrysogenin and he tried extracting penicillin from it with ether but unfortunately the penicillin simply disappeared into thin air and you cant identify a chemical if its too unstable to stay under your nose for more than half a minute no of course not after that i fancy raistrick rather lost interest they had other bad luck one of his staff working on the mould juice was killed in a road accident another died they wrote an inconclusive paper about it in the biochemical journal towards the end of if youre interested coli agreed to supply me with a mixed bag of germs from his own laboratory the month of august passed a peace came to me which i had not enjoyed since cambridge i was doing useful work i was my own master reasonably well paid well housed among friends i was out of that damned basement i had put off calling upon my parents because sir edward was still abroad and i did not wish to encounter lady tip above all i wanted to shed rosie the first of september was a saturday about five in the afternoon i was sitting with david in archies flat when the doorbell rang the surly watson being off david answered it he returned after some time its your girl friend rosie i dont want to see her say im not in i know you dont i tried putting her off but it wouldnt wash oh god must i really talk to her its like entertaining a ghost all thats behind me now i think you ought to have a word with her boy advised david with an unaccustomed solemnity which alarmed me i did not ask rosie into the flat i took her to a nearby lyons teashop by st georges hospital at hyde park corner she was crying most of the way i did not want to talk about it until we were sitting down it would give me time to collect my thoughts i bought her a cup of tea and a shiny bun with lumps of sugar like broken glass on top she never touched either but went on crying why didnt you tell me before i demanded i couldnti couldnt be sure but you are sure are you she nodded dumbly the cheap pink handkerchief at her eyes thoroughly wet through how long has it been going on i havent had my monthlies since last june but how can you be sure there might be other reasons i can see it i cant when i has my wash i can see it plain as anything soon everyone will be able to youre sure its me for a moment she did not comprehend then she exclaimed how can you say that starting to cry again making me feel doubly guilty ashamed frightened desperate and confused you must pull yourself together i commanded she went on crying people at other tables were staring at us i felt all of them were in the secret weve got to look at this coolly i waited until her sobs had quietened listen rosieif either of us loses our heads we shall get nowhere ow jim you do still love me dont you of course i do now who else knows about it youre sure you love me of course i love you i told her fiercely who else knows about it no one not a soul not even lady tip she shook her head vigorously you must keep absolutely quiet about it for a bit not a word to my parents youll stand by me wont you jim she asked pathetically of course i shall i had no option rosie had to go back to help with the dinner i hurried to the flat desperate to put everything before david mellors i havent done my gynae yet he confessed unhelpfully but there must be other perfectly good reasons for a girl stopping her periods surely he frowned at the eggs and bacon he was frying for himself in the grimy kitchen at the back there must be theres more than one reason for everything in medicine though they say in the hospital if any female outside a nursery or a nunnery stops menstruating shes pregnant until proved otherwise i sat down on a hard kitchen chair david forked over the sizzling bacon the smell made me feel sick didnt you take precautions he asked of course i took precautions what sort iwell i pulled out he said impassively coitus interruptus the poor mans french letter thats safe enough surely i protested obviously it wasnt youre not being very sympathetic sorry boy i sat staring at the pockmarked linoleum of the floor in silence david slipped his meal on to a plate with a fish slice sat at the scrubbed wooden table and began to eat if she is pregnant can i do anything about it i asked you could find a witch in a back street with a knittingneedle i suppose i could end up in the dock though couldnt i i suppose you might youd have to take the gamble mind theres plenty of girls who come into casualty for the gynae department to finish off what theyve started themselves or someone else has the police ask questions but nobody tells them much do you want anything to eat no nobut if i dont want to run that sort of risk what can i do you can let her go ahead and have it theres plenty of unmarried mothers in marys sister keeps a store of wedding rings and issues them out but you dont understand the very idea of a person like rosie producing a child which ive fathered utterly nauseates me you might grow very fond of her ive seen that happen before down where i live theres plenty of chaps who wouldnt think in a blue moon of getting themselves hitched up before they put the girl in pod youre not trying to tell me that i should actually marry her are you thats something id never tell anyone there was another silence david went on eating of course youre trying to tell me something rather different i said that ive an overpowering moral obligation to marry her well thats unnecessary im already aware of it was i saying that well if you did marry her you might not be doing too badly shes a pretty thing whether shed make a good wife is a toss up with any woman but it generally works out all right but shes an ignoramus david wiped a slice of white bread in his mixture of egg yolk scarlet ketchup and fat its not the biological function of women to be brainy no more than for the birds of the air to ride bicycles now you sound like almroth wright i got up to leave the kitchen at the door i turned round shes common david made no reply he that doth get a wench with child and marries her afterward wrote samuel pepys on october it is as if a man should shit in his hat and then clap it upon his head i fulfilled pepys ludicrous picture archie declared that of course i must marry her to his mind one of the bourgeoisieeven the nouvelle bourgeoisieleaving a servant girl with a bun in the oven had no alternative but make an honest woman of her my father was refreshingly cheerful and encouraging he said it happened every day and she was a lucky girl knowing who the father was my mother implored with tears that i gave the child a name sir edward was back home and would of course know all about it he sent through my father a message to call but i stayed away not wishing to meet the eye of lady tip as for elizabeth i prayed the affair was too shocking to be allowed her ears it happened on saturday november at marylebone registry office in a red dress and with a little bunch of brownish chrysanthemums rosie was blooming and bulgingdispelling my hopes to the last moment that nature might put an end to my predicament we had a social difficulty she was a waif reared in a home in clapham mrs packer volunteered to give her away and appeared with a husband in a bowler and fringe of moustache looking like strubes little man from the daily express the registrar had a cold which i caught archie was my best man and gave me ј sir edward had charitably taken his family to the country we had our weddingbreakfast in the basement my mother made a superb cake my father made a speech and got drunk there was confetti as we took a taxi to the pair of furnished rooms i had found in corams fields round the back of the college and not far from doughty street where dickens used to live i completely forget how those days of early marriage felt i forgot whether i loved rosie or had any particular sensation about her i recall only an odd awareness of possessing her totally her plump body her cotton petticoats the prayer book she had kept from the orphanage her umbrella it was all mine she cooked for me every night my mother having relentlessly instructed her i cannot remember a word that we exchanged nor what we did to pass the time the unborn baby dominated us because of the baby rosie rested in the afternoons never went out in the wet never looked a cripple in the face because of the baby we shared the thinmattressed double bed every night without the solace of each other the baby was to be born in queen charlottes we were delighted to have within reach so famous a maternity hospital which had taken the name of george the thirds queen who had fifteen children in the mideighteenth century it was providing free lyingin for married mothers with a diet of brown and white caudle and infant baptism by the chaplain which was compulsory colebrook worked in the research laboratory attached to the isolation block which had shed its old walls for new in the suburb of chiswick above an elbow of the thames to the west i did not see him after my marriage until the end of february when he appeared one morning in the hall of arundel removing hat and damp raincoat and dropping his bag all in one movement as usual i hear your wifes having a baby in charlottes he greeted me whens she due in about a weeks time im sure everything will go splendidly i wondered if he was doing any mental arithmetic heres something which might interest you as you speak german he handed me a rolledup journal from his mackintosh pocket i got it this morning from a colleague in breslauhe must have thought it important posting it off in a hurry take a look at it while im in my meeting there would seem to be something brewing in the rhineland i unrolled it standing in the hall it was the last edition of the deutsche medizinische wochenschrift the german medical weekly published in leipzig the previous friday the issue contained special supplements on tuberculosis and medicine in sport i was wondering why colebrook should have recommended it my eye running down the list of main contents on the cover the first was aus den forschungslabatorien der i g farbenindustrie a g werk elberfeldfrom the research laboratories of i g farben elberfeld underneath came ein beitrang zur chemotherapie der bakteriellen infektionena contribution to the chemotherapy of bacterial infections the author of this modest title was professor gerhard domagk the following article i translated as prontosil in streptococcal disease i wondered what prontosil was it was written by professor klee and i remembered from domagks letter to dr dieffenbach that klee had been testing out streptozon in wuppertal i turned over the pages starting to translate domagks paper lips moving and finger running along the lines they seemed to have rechristened streptozon as prontosil but undoubtedly it was the same sulphonamide drug which had saved my hand the world was at last learning what i had heard from a parttime prostitute in a cologne slum the night they burnt down the reichstag i had no chance to discuss the german discovery with colebrook before we met in the hall of queen charlottes in marylebone road on the early evening of monday march he had just come through the door bag in hand and mackintosh flapping he greeted me hello elgarhad your baby yes this morning everything seems fine congratulations boy or girl girl im on my way to see them now i say those papers by domagk and co in the deutsche medizinische wochenschrift are causing something of a sensation in london coli strode along with me theyve even got into the newspapers i wrote to domagk for more information but i havent heard i expect hes snowed under with similar requests from all over the world and of course things are getting a little sticky in germany they do so seem to be turning in upon themselves its as though they were already at war with the rest of us in europe i wondered why they renamed it prontosil i had once mentioned to coli my being one of the earliest cases on streptozon or as i suppose the germans would pronounce it prontozeal oh i g farben register any number of trade markseuphonious labels for drugs as yet unsynthesized the name prontosil had been registered in with the intention of sticking it on some new sleepingdraught you know what someone in my lab suggested its an abbreviation of pronto and silentium coli gave his laugh which could fill a corridor he was a cheerful man behind his solemn manner and austere tastes i must say its strangeto say the leastthat domagk kept completely quiet about his discovery for more than two years wouldnt he want to be absolutely certain it always worked it would be cruel to raise the worlds false hopes youre being very christian the reason for the delay is simple i g farben wanted to be certain theyd got all their patents safely tied up and they wanted exactly the right moment to market the stuff i know my german drug industry remembering my past discouragement i felt entitled to complain perhaps some lives might have been saved had sir almroth wright seen the possibilities you cant blame the lion expectedly colebrook came to his defence this is chemotherapy of course but a different sort than weve been accustomed to since ehrlich first coined the word its not like the cure of syphilis or malaria or kala azar the drug is simple the administration is simple and the streptococcus is no rare parasite but flourishing upon all of us you mean its one of those concepts which stand out like mountains which nobody sees because were too busy staring at the toes of our boots you might put it like that yes we parted as i turned towards the entrance of the ward the baby had been born at seven oclock that morning rosie had started her pains early on the sunday when i had found a taxi at kings cross station and taken her into the hospital waiting in a room with two other husbands a wellstarched midwife had appeared after an hour or so to explain that my wife had gone off the boil and the baby was not expected that day i gathered that for the first child the labour pains provided a prolonged overture to the drama when i returned the next morning they had been trying to find me and i was a father after i left colebrook i found rosie still with the radiance of new motherhood an expression which can transform the most ordinary girl into a saint and which i do not believe has ever been accurately caught by painters of the madonna what do you think of her she asked squeezing the bundle against her breast she seems perfectly all right shes lovely do you still want to call her clare why not rosie wrinkled her nose i dunnoits a sort of stuckup name i dont think so st clare of assisi founded the order of poor clares are you sorry she aint a boy rosie was looking at me guiltily why should i be most men like a boy first its all the same to me well have a boy next time predicted rosie smiling and snuggling up the baby again when i returned on the tuesday evening rosie was not in such high spirits a little tired but well on the wednesday she was flushed with a temperature its nothing to worry about unduly said the starched midwife after all its hardly unknown for a mother to run a slight temp during the puerperium your wifes got a rather nasty discharge down below which would account for it weve already taken a swab for the lab do they know the infecting germ yet her reassurance had made me anxious theyll have the culture tomorrow with luck shell be on the mend by then the following evening a nurse asked me to wait outside the ward door the midwife appeared with the news im afraid your wifes rather poorly mr elgar i felt a pang of alarm her temps gone up and shes rather miserable because shes having a rigor or two the doctors just been with her and he thinks the infection is still localized to the birth canal i was even more suspicious of her optimism what was the organism ive had some training in bacteriology its a haemolytic streptococcus she said calmly oh i said rosie was seriously ill potentially gravely so i went into the ward to find her pale shivering and frightened i stayed only a few minutes distrusting too plainly my own reassurances the doctor wants to move your wife to the hospital isolation block out at chiswick the midwife imparted as i left shell be better looked after there can dr colebrook see her you know that im acquainted with him dr colebrook sees all the patients in the isolation block its puerperal fever isnt it i dont think we need quite say that its a severe infection but still not a generalized one lets hope for the best shall we can we get hold of you if we want to im at arundel college all day at night youll have to send a policeman or something the isolation block in goldhawk road at chiswick had been opened five years its forty beds gathered puerperal fever cases from the whole of west london the patients were nursed in separate cubicles off battleshipgrey corridors and the place reeked of antiseptic colebrook had instituted nursing with rubber gloves sterile gowns and face masks like a surgical operation but two or three out of every thousand women delivered at queen charlottes still died from childbed fever and twelve of the forty ill women in the cubicles would not leave them alive with characteristic kindness colebrook came from his laboratory to rosies cubicle as i was leaving on the friday afternoon she doesnt look too well coli the infection seems to have spread to the peritoneal membrane lining the abdomen he said in his solemn way thats not a good sign im afraid and of course your poor wife is suffering with the distention and tenderness we started walking along the corridors towards the door she was very distressed at leaving the baby the little girl will be looked after on the ward until shes better obviously we cant allow the babies here theres too much risk of infection i frowned where could this terrible streptococcus have come from perhaps from the midwifes hands the labour was rather long and she had a number of vaginal examinations perhaps from mrs elgars own nose and throat perhaps from the air we can never say though if our precautions of gloves and so on were more widely used the mortality rate might start to come down at last we walked a few more steps in silence i had of course felt concern for rosie while she was having the child but only as if she were suffering from some straightforward illness like influenza now i saw she might die i think for the first time in my life i began to develop fondness for her for centuries of course the disease was a complete mystery colebrook continued it was seen as a visitation of some particular town or parish which lifted after a month or two and let the women bear children perfectly healthily once more for which the local ecclesiastic doubtless took all the credit but in reality the streptococcus was simply being passed from case to case by the midwife or doctor that revolutionary idea was mooted at the end of the last century by an aberdonian obstetrician called alexander gordon who was ostracized for it and had to join the navya hard fate for a midwifery expert i suppose none of us likes being accused of possessing dirty habits didnt a man called semmelweiss come into it somewhere we pushed through a pair of frosted glass doors you dont want to go into all this elgar youve enough to upset you without my lecturing about your troubles im interested the doctor i lodged with in wuppertal kept a photograph of him in his surgery i remember he had a beautiful moustache and resembled a viennese opera singer or the man on the packet of gillette razor blades semmelweiss was at the allgemeines krankenhaus in vienna ninety years ago there were two obstetric wards there one used for training medical students the other for training midwives five of the students mothers died of puerperal fever for one of the midwives it was ascribed to the poor womens shame at being examined internally by young men but the students went to the labour ward straight from an obstetrical class in the post mortem room while the midwives were taught everything from models ignaz semmelweiss put the fever down to cadaveric particles made everyone wash their hands in lime water and knocked down the mortality by two thirds mind it took another fifty years before louis pasteur discovered bacteria and showed how it worked meanwhile semmelweiss was sacked went mad and died from septicaemia contracted at a post mortem semmelweiss was another man who saw the range of mountains which everyone overlooked most definitely agreed colebrook we had reached the front door whats my wifes outlook he considered this for a moment her infection may well localize itself as a pelvic abscess which can be drained surgically but it will be a long and debilitating illness theres no getting away from that and one which may well leave her sterile for the rest of her life i wouldnt mind i dont want any more children colebrook raised his heavy eyebrows but said only i expect youve informed her relatives my wife has none she comes from a home for destitute children shes completely anonymous shes a particle unconnected to anyone in the world except me the circumstances of my marriage were singular dont you think a little unusual perhaps said colebrook guardedly she was a housemaid why do you imagine i married her because i got her with child and on to her death bed you must not simply accept that she is going to die he told me severely of course she will i was anguished not through love but through guilt which are intertwined often enough im going to give her a blood transfusion in the morning ive already got a donor it will reinforce her own white scavenger cells in the best almroth wright tradition transfusion was then a complicated operation done directly with a syringe and yards of bright red rubber tubing the donor lying on the bed next to the chalkwhite desperately ill woman i suggested couldnt you try ehrlichs arsenicals sir edward once said something about your using them i was chasing a hare we thought they increased the ability of the blood to kill streptococci when injected for the entirely different purpose of killing the germs of syphilis but they dont were giving streptococcal antiserum naturally otherwise we must rely on the skills of the nurses as in any other severe infection but your wife has a sound constitution then what about prontosil the answers simple i havent got any but i have his eyebrows rose again how i stole them from domagk twenty tablets colebrook shook his head im afraid thats out of the question elgar i couldnt give any maternity patient an untested new drug but it has been tested one of those papers alongside domagks was specifically on its use in puerperal fever from professor max heinkels clinic in jena isnt that good enough no it is not good enough objected colebrook forthrightly i have been through those papers most carefully and a lot of the experimental and clinical work in germany was most slipshod as far as domagks lab work goes mice are not men surely you remember well enough the lions axiomexperimental infections in animals have no relevance to natural infections in humans i thought he was procrastinating only from blind loyalty to wright and to wrights hate of chemical remedies and chemists i can have the prontosil here in half an hour i counterattacked or are you going to let my wife die please elgar you should not put things like that you are a scientist you surely realize that emotion is a dangerous ingredient in the making of clinical decisions but why not try it in gods name i pursued arguing through rising anger against wright and his selfsatisfied bigotism surely it cant do any harm how can you claim that there was nothing to suggest illeffects in any single one of those german papers the cases reported were few and the enthusiastic research worker forgets his fatalities isnt it worth taking the risk just for once that the germans should not be bigger liars than we are do please try and contain your language elgar colebrook was embarrassed annoyed and impatient with me all at once i dont believe any german scientist would be deliberately misleading even in these days of dr goebbels but supposing i did give prontosil to your wife and supposing she did die you might well blame me or you might well blame yourself for insisting on it which would be the worse for you i do insist on it ill sign a paper indemnifying you colebrook said nothing for some moments very well he announced resignedly fetch the drug the paper wont be necessary but rosie died at ten oclock on the night of monday march colebrook gave her the prontosil a tablet every four hours but her blood and her body were already overwhelmed by the infection before he started rosies death was a shock to the harley street house i had told no one that she was so ill i had the impression that above and below stairs i was held to blame for it i felt penitent but it was penitence only through my suffering no true feeling of grief i am not heartless and the bell which tolls for all mankind can never make pleasant music but i did not know her very well i had been strongly attracted to rosie through the hot spicy smell of dirty petticoats i had married her because my upbringing left me with a raw sensitivity to the opinions of the world to be driven rather than pushing in short not through honour but through cowardice only my parents and myself went with her to kensal green but poor rosie had one valuable legacy on the saturday before her death her temperature steadied she sat up with her face suffused pink from the dye and said she felt much better she lived long enough for colebrook to set aside his doubts and even sir almroth wrights principles he searched germany and france for sulphonamide dosed his own mice and issued his own paper on the sulphonamide treatment of puerperal fever in the lancet in june a year after that the mortality at queen charlottes for the disease which killed my wife had dropped from thirtythree in a hundred to under five there was still clare i put my problem to colebrook the evening of the funeral i went to his home in chiswick mall which was bright with daffodils from his weekend house at farnham in surreywhich he had characteristically bought near sir almroth wrights puerperal fever is a triple tragedy he told me solemnly though ive no children of my own i do my best to sort out the domestic problems of bereaved husbands theyve sometimes two or three small ones to manage somehow or other and often enough financial troubles into the bargain do you want to keep the child no adoption may not be easy he remarked doubtfully a lot of people these days cant run to the luxury shell have to be put in a home like her mother as he said nothing i asked am i abnormal i dont feel particularly attached to the child i have seen too much of the relationships between husbands and wives and their newborn babies to find any variation whatever abnormal do you know of anyone who might take her not a soul the lady almoner at charlottes is of course an expert on this subject though im afraid she cant perform miracles any more than i can in the wards mrs packer saved her she called the next morning at arundel college jim i have something terribly important to say she began earnestly as i went down from my lab to the hall can we sit down i took her across to the refreshment room at euston station where clares fate was decided my husbands a solicitor you know and doing as well as anyone can these times she explained as i expect you noticed at your wedding heswell hes older than i am i mean jim wed love to have her and we can afford to look after her and weve a new house at hendon which is really very nice and of course whenever you want to come and see her theres one condition she swallowed her adams apple bouncing in her thin neck like a pingpong ball anything you say jim clare must never have the faintest idea who her father and mother were she looked flustered of course wed try if you really want us to but these things do tend to slip out and everyone in sir edwards house knows you must give me your promise your solemn promise i promise at least i promise ill do my best she did very well clare todayand mrs packers is the only false name i have used in this narrativebecame a bright young mp in the s but left politics to become professor of sociology at a university situatedshall we say between st louis and oklahoma city she is married for a second time to an american professor who smokes a pipe wears tweeds and goes fishing perhaps he wanted her to complete his english milieu she has had three children without even running a temperature i was once about to be introduced to her at a party in the house of commons but i left in tears that summer of was king george the fifths silver jubilee there were flags and teaparties in workingclass streets royal processions military reviews vibrantly choral services of thanksgiving in london st pauls was floodlit at spithead the fleet was beflagged clever fellows who saw it all as a carnival to boost the national government were quickly lost in the morass of emotion on june macdonald departed from no downing street baldwin returned on june two and a half million britons voting in lord cecils peace ballot stood against any military measures whatever to repel foreign aggression the following january had sir edward tiplady on the front pages again the king was suffering a recurrence of his old chest infection like leonard colebrook with rosie the doctors were against ransoming a kings life with an unknown german drug at half past nine on the night of monday january lord dawsons medical bulletin said only the kings life is moving peacefully to its close the bbc fell silent but for the ticking of a clock the nation dropped its head at five minutes to midnight the king died nobody was sure if his last words were how is the empire or bugger bognor tonight hitler sleeps in the hradany palace in prague it is time to redefine our attitudes archie said this without a shred of selfconsciousness all men become caricatures of themselves but he achieved it younger than most it was three years later the evening of march and the four of us were eating dinner in his belgrave square home since his fathers death he had combined the huge diningroom with the sittingroom in the modern flatdwelling fashion redecorating and refurnishing the rest of the place with pleasing extravagant plainness the ides of march are come said david mellors unusually gloomily ay chamberlain but not gone added elizabeth tiplady who had left school more recently than the rest of us so much for hitlers last territorial demand in europe over the sudeten germans i said do you realize the significance of whats just happened archie demanded of the table in general by now were sickeningly used to hitler invading neighbouring countries but for the first time hes enlarged the reich not simply to include expatriate germans like the austrians or sudetens hes gobbled up a foreign nation the czechs who knows whos next the poles david poured himself more clareta claimed by archie to be the best out of ten terrible years us suggested elizabeth whats chamberlain going to do i asked archie being a fount of political information more immediate if not always more accurate than the newspapers nothing absolutely nothing hes done all he can do already did you read what he said in the house this afternoon that the collapse of czechoslovakia was inevitable that the slovakia half of it simply declared itself independent so were no longer bound to guarantee its frontiers under the munich agreement fancy falling back on legal niceties with the gestapo already in prague chamberlain whines about a breach of the munich spirit as though hitler had omitted to send him a christmas card the whole business is utterly disgraceful poor old ill president hбcha has been horribly let down just as we let down president beneљ no wonder the tory partys looking sick if i was a conservative mp today id vomit over the benches whats this were supposed to be eating asked david stewed pheasant it couldnt possibly be pheasant shooting ends on february the first said archie severely for all his socialism he had the aristocrats disdain for ignorance of country matters its chicken i think elizabeth struggled to cut it i dont know the first thing about food remarked archie airily its a dish which watson seems to like cooking i suppose because he finds it one of the easiest do you think watson appreciates that instead of not having to call you sir he now doesnt have to call you my lord i enquired oh this title archie complained do you realize politically its like those concrete overcoats in which gangsters drop their rivals into new york harbour one simply disappeared without a gurgle of course none of us expected my father to die so suddenly last christmas i so much wanted to make some sort of impact on the commons before being shoved into the madame tussauds of the lords when i think of the constituencies ive nursed he ended pathetically archie had always seemed to be nursing a constituency since going down from cambridge though the foundlings were never grateful enough to elect him to parliament but he did good among them helping the inadequate and the inarticulate before they were lavished with the bounty of the welfare state cant you shed your title the way people do with their awful christian names asked elizabeth or sell it to the americans like all the nicest country houses archie you really ought to sack watson david advised hell give you a recurrence of your duodenal ulcer i dont eat at home very much im far too busy archie reached towards the cluster of wine bottles it is time to redefine our attitudes he repeated frankly admit that for a while i simply couldnt take hitler seriously ill admit that i thought him perfectly justified reoccupying the rhineland in for instance but wasnt i one of many who asked why he shouldnt be allowed to move his soldiers about his own back yard and after all he was doing a lot for the unemployed which nobody was here do you ever hear from your friends there jim david asked i shook my head i stopped writing to gerda when i married rosie i shouldnt care to provoke a letter returned empfдnger unbekannt addressee unknown has terrifying implications archie commented sombrely he went on it was spain which changed my mind about hitler darling it was such a pity that you never got there elizabeth told him sympathetically i couldnt help developing an ulcer it must have been terribly frustrating it all going on and you having to lie on your back in swanage instead i almost enlisted he told her irritably he had recounted the story that evening in the expectationwhich he should have known to be perfectly ridiculous it being elizabethof impressing my young lady id got as far as paris thats why spain decided me more than abyssinia because it was possible to get involved onself after all two thousand of us in britain joined the international brigade and five hundred of us wont come back thank god the whole thing seems almost over according to george orwell it was all a tremendous fiasco even for a war i observed i am your choice your decision yes i am spain he quoted w h auden raising his glass then of course theres the german jews our freud which art in hampstead said david we were interrupted by watson in his tail coat he had become fatter and even ruder and i thought in many respects resembled mussolini all right is it divine elizabeth said you havent cleared away the cocktail things archie told him sternly i cant do everything can i i dont think any of us want any more archie pushed away the halfeaten dish you may serve the pudding there aint none ive some fruit open a couple of bottles of cliquot archie commanded he added as watson withdrew do you know what i heard yesterday when halifax went to berchtesgaden a couple of months ago he was greeted at the front door by hitler in that usual ridiculous getup of brown jacket and dress trousers our lordly cabinet minister mistook him for the footman he was within an inch of handing over his hat and stick think how the course of history might have been changed hitler would have sent his air force to blow us up between the soup and fish i expect said elizabeth london may not be so beautiful as paris or prague said archie who had travelled to both but like any frenchman or any czech i dont want wakening at dawn to the crash of bombs thats why i was incredibly relieved by munich like everyone else i said the ironcrossed wings of hermann gцrings luftwaffe overshadowed europe no one had experienced mass aerial bombardment but after spain everyone could imagine it the german air force was the atomic bomb of the s its wednesday elizabeth jumped from the table to switch on the radiogram beside the fireplace i mustnt miss arthur askey it is time to redefine our attitudes archie declared once again i now commit myself to standing up to hitler whatever the cost with russia all the betterif europe hadnt been so neurotically afraid of communism hitler would never have got where he has if not alone with france and america i suggested america is only interested in the world fair on flushing meadow archie said irritably what about this champagne boy asked david i expect watsons forgotten archie reached his long arm for the bell the question remains what exactly can one do get your blood group registered suggested david practically theyre going to need the stuff by the gallon with spain it was easy one simply volunteered archie often seemed genuinely to believe that he had fought on the hardbaked bloodsoaked ridges of catalonia volunteer as an air raid warden i told him or a fireman i saw in todays paper that the government wants a hundred thousand of them id volunteer for the army but whats the point when the government are moving towards the utterly oppressive step of conscription in peacetime which i and every other socialist should have imagined unthinkable in this country whats the matter called watson from the doorway id like to listen to the wireless myself you know the cliquot watson you didnt mean it did you i didnt think this was a champagne dinner youll find some brandy in the cocktail cabinet archie told david help yourself darling i cant hear the jokes complained elizabeth her ears directed to band waggon on the london regional im having a serious political discussion archie told her severely you know that ive never been in the slightest interested in politics thats what some unfortunate french aristocrat protested at the guillotine which is precisely why you are here said the executioner strapping him down archies tart reply sprang from her teasing about spain and his ulcer elizabeth stood up pouting and strode from the room saying im going to powder my nose she left archie sitting gloomily at the table i knew that he would be instantly sorry for provoking her i had been living in the flat almost four years since rosie died i had discovered that archies was the tenderest conscience of any i dared to probe in a way he turned this conscience into a talent by which he might make a political career david handed him a balloon glass well filled with brandy by way of making conversation i said have you seen that travel poster put out by the reich tourist office a beautiful coloured picture of a schloss and underneath come to mediaeval germany either the nazis have absolutely no sense of humour or they flatter us with an uproarious one cant you turn that rubbish off archie scowled at the radiogram david obliged and sat down on the sofa picking one of the yellow jacketed volumes from the low table before the fire which had the times the daily worker apollo punch and other periodicals laid out in clublike precision whats this bloody rubbish the left book club archie told him shortly you get a couple of books cheap on current affairs every month surely youve heard of it its been going two or three years now who are the doctors prescribing such intellectual tonics well theres harold laski of course said david and john strachey archie swallowed some brandy he was at eton theyve fifty or sixty thousand members you know david sat frowning flicking over the pages what sort of people would those be i wonder not intellectuals particularly but people who regard themselves as intellectuals schoolteachers university students whove seen through their dons anybody who feels he cant make enough of himself whos frustrated by the political and social system exactly the people in germany who got the nazis going i said archie made a grimace i know what you mean steam escaping from a faulty boiler by one crack rather than another of course the left book clubs pretty communist it flatters a lot of people rather dangerously that theyre more intelligent and better educated than they actually are but i wish id had the idea it would have been more useful than going to spain and made a lot of money archie spoke with a bloomsbury publishers combination of idealism and salesmanship he had written a novel while recovering from his duodenal ulcerscrannel pipes criticized by james agate as the minutes of a rather decorous meeting of a committee comprising aldous huxley michael arlen and ronald firbank as nobody had leapt to publish it archie founded the urn press in a basement at the time of our dinner party he was losing a thousand or two a year in the business as comfortably as any other moneyed and cultured young gentleman down from the university he rose abruptly from the table saying he had some telephone calls to make i hope i didnt upset elizabeth he apologized in my direction lord meddish is in his selfanalytical mood tonight i observed smiling after our departed host he wants to stop hitler but he doesnt want conscription oh archies mind is always as confused as an old womans sewingbasket david sat sipping his brandy the yellowjacketed book on his knees do you suppose elizabeths having a good cry elizabeth dont be silly youre pretty thick with her arent you on the contrary she only lets me take her to occasions like this when there are other people about we never enjoy what norman douglas called a friendly teatateat i dont see very much of her at all really as she spends most of the winter on the riviera with her mother she maintains a relationship of steely flippancy i dont know how you put up with it i certainly wouldnt take that sort of selfishness from any woman even a stunner like her id take even worse from elizabeth i told him soberly surely you can understand my feelings for years she was the untouchable embodiment of everything i wanted not just in the feminine way but everything in lifemoney home savoir faire friends parents i was happy if she threw me a word like a fish bone to one of sir edwards damn cats lady tip hated me of course and still does she always treated me with the utmost contempt and i didnt see any reason why elizabeth shouldnt do likewise why didnt she asked david bluntly shes much more civilized than her mother ever since lady tip was once horrible to me in her presence shes felt guilty perhaps and of course my elevation to work with her father must have helped besides things are changing arent they our hitler makes class warfare look a silly game didnt you once say she wasnt his daughter that was the gossip below stairs personally i think shes just a highclass prick teaser elizabeth came in recovered from her pique and smiling noticing the book on davids lap she exclaimed dont say youve taken to mr victor gollanczs highminded publications is he supporting this thing in parliament to abolish flogging you know that he doesnt eat the day when anybodys hanged dont you not a thing daddys seen him in the savoy only a glass of champagne and a cigar david knocked back his brandy and stood up i must go if i want to slip into marys and see margaret before catching my train why is the last one to oxford so bloody early the dons like early nights i suppose david had been a doctor about three years he was then working as an assistant to one of the consultant physicians at the radcliffe infirmary in oxford i was to be best man at easter when he married a staff nurse he had met while doing his house jobs at st marys she had been denied the feast that evening through night duty whats archie up to david asked elizabeth talking to watson about the test match in durban apparently it rained just as england were winning that seems to sum up our national destiny in general doesnt it can i take you home in a taxi i asked her of course darling it was a cold windy showery night handfuls of rain rattling against the cab window must you go in yet i pleaded its dreadfully early i whisked you off because i saw how archie wanted to get rid of us all i promised daddy i shouldnt be late you mean you dont want to be alone with me longer than it is strictly polite to allow in reply she said it must be a dreadful strain living with archie i wonder youre not a nervous wreck i dont see a lot of him hes always out in the evenings organizing committees speaking at meetings engineering interviews or buying drinks for journalists hes a crusader with many banners archie seems to think theres going to be a war itll be a relief really wont it after having to run our lives from one of hitlers speeches to the next if theres a war i shall do something useful cut your hair and make munitions lots of girls did last time id be a nurse id be one now you know honestly but of course you have to be twentyone before they let you start can i kiss you she formally closed her eyes and pursed her lips i said ich liebe dich and du schlдfst whats that mean i translated please jim dont start getting pompous she protested much as gerda had but youre quite aware that i do love you dont be serious darling you know how being serious spoils everything we lay back in our separate corners of the taxi youre lucky that imwell not frightened of women but frightened of making a fool of myself over them that happened once after a moments puzzlement she said oh rosie rather bleakly and of course as far as youre concerned elizabeth im still the butlers boy why must you keep bringing that up she asked crossly its awfully unfair youre like archie trying to make us all feel utterly ashamed of ourselves because people in bermondsey have got less to eat for dinner than we have wasnt that chicken ghastly how long are you staying with your father i dont know mummy may remain in monte carlo though of course its dreadfully unfashionable after easter we arrived at the newlybuilt block of flats in mayfair where sir edward tiplady now lived alone lady tip had walked out about the same time as king edward the eighth abdicated as i reached to open the cab door she adopted again the ceremonial expression indicating that she would allow herself to be kissed come and see design for living tomorrow i asked temptingly diana wynyard and rex harrison darling theres simply no time for going to the theatre tomorrow i absolutely must go to a party with hugo mottram whos hugo mottram hes frightfully rich on the stock exchange im having an utterly passionate affair with him daddys so pleased good night good night darling youre really the most wonderfully saintlike man and of course i completely adore you the taxi drove back to archies unrequited love is painful enough love shrivelled by frivolity can be suicidal jim it was awfully good of you to waste your time with elizabeth last night sir edward tiplady came hurrying into my laboratory i had risen in the harley street house from basement to attic after lady tip bolted he had turned the whole place into consulting rooms which he let profitably it was simply a doctors shop our basement was now full of files and rubbish i tested blood and urine samples in the room where i had fathered clare my mother had gone as cook to a small hotel in eastbourne my father had died shortly after the old king knocked down by a taxi outside a pub the house itself then had barely eighteen months to live before being blown to bits early in the blitz i know that underneath shes terribly impressed meeting someone like lord meddish he continued whos always getting himself into the newspapers we were delighted to see her she livens us all up sir edward always placed me in an avuncular relationship to elizabeth it seemed sage not to rectify his impression im sure she didnt she bored you terribly i expect he was moving restlessly as ever round the whitepainted slopingroofed room he was growing grey but his figure was still spare and the lines round his blue eyes no deeper his happiness had much improved since shedding his wife i really do find it hard work chatting to bright young things these days they dont even call themselves bright young things any more do they there seems such an enormous gap in our ideas in the way we look at the world and of course elizabeth is really very naughty playing the enfant terrible shes really too old for that sort of prankish behaviour have you done mrs cockburns blood urea yes its normal good the old things kidneys are all right after all but i think ill play her along she needs a doctor to relieve her inner tensions by listening to her troubles her family got sick to death of them years ago and she always pays on the nail encouraged and financed by sir edward i had started a oneman biochemical and bacteriological service for neighbouring consulting rooms and the private nursing homes and clinics then multiplying in london mine were the coming sciences there had been little point in identifying the germs infecting the patient or the deficiencies of his blood and other body fluids when the doctor could do little to rectify either misfortune i was doing prosperously i dressed better i wore bow ties like alexander fleming much of my worklike mrs cockburns blood ureawas to save the doctors conscience rather than the patients life cronins the citadel had been published a couple of years and there were still plenty of physicians in harley street unscrupulous about treating an imaginary illness or overrating a real one and plenty of zealous surgeons who had to cut to earn their living it was domagks sulphonamide which opened an age when so many diseases thankfully became treatable that it was no longer necessary for the doctors to invent others i really came up with a complaint he stood smiling hands characteristically on loins black formal jacket tucked back monocle in eye you ruined my last nights sleep at the perfectly ungodly hour of sixfortyfive somebody telephoned trying to trace you urgently an american of course i frowned puzzled he called my number because he remembered me as the chap whod originally introduced you not jeff beckerman i exclaimed sir edward nodded hes at the savoynaturally apparently he got into southampton from new york late last night he wants to see you as soon as possible id get him to stand a good dinner if i were you i had heard not a word from jeff nor about him since leaving wuppertal naturally i was excited and intrigued by the summons and telephoned the savoy at once jeff sounded exactly the same he spoke heartily but briefly apparently distracted during his stay in london by business as multifarious as usual he invited me for cocktail time this apparently meant five in the afternoon when i usually took a cup of tea he had a suite it was on an upper floor overlooking the river he was redder in the face his dark hair had been allowed to grow and from my first impression he seemed twice the size he still wore beautifullytailored english tweeds there was a good deal of slapping hugging and kidding married yet i asked yeah but it didnt work out how about you old man yes but she died oh how terrible ive got over it now rosie had gone to wherever the damp souls of housemaids went i consoled myself that her continued existence would have meant misery for three have you been back to wuppertal i asked to keep off the subject sure i have before christmas and im on my way back ich bin ein wuppertaler nicht wahr the red crown brewery remains a monument to american enterprise and capitalism though the nazis can hardly keep their hands off it that cosmetics company in berlin has turned out a headache the nazis dont care for powder and scent natьrlich they put the girls in calflength uniforms and awful shoes and march them all over the country they regard women as inferior beings only necessary for breeding the whole of germanys got like one big stud farm whatll you have to drink sherry try a martini mind i quit living there about the time old man hindenburg died in the july of it was after hitler had his bloodbath at munich i guessed it was the hour to go i got to hear the detailssay do you know they took rцhm to stadelheim jail and a couple of ss men shot him in his cell the guy in charge was sepp dietrich who ran hitlers personal bodyguard ive seen the guy in berlin hes got big ears and a little moustache he looks as though frankenstein the monstermaker was trying to construct clark gable hell come to a bad endi hope jeff busied himself with the cocktail shaker do you know absolutely no one in the states would touch our fine pure spirits after they repealed the eighteenth amendment the whole country had got the taste for bathtub gin i gingerly sipped the first martini of my life hows gerda dieffenbach i had been wanting to ask since entering the room i saw her last year shes fine it seems still a schoolmistress i kept clear that game has become too dangerous but i was sick and i called in dr dieffenbach hes disillusioned with the nazis i guess he thought theyd bolster the middle classes but hitler isnt interested in the middle classes or any classes hitler was interested only in race and blood valour and fecundity warfare and slavery torture and death their boys gone to join the army did professor domagks daughters arm recover it was like talking about ghosts oh sure they didnt have to operate or anything we saw the start of big deal old man ive started up a pharmaceutical company in new york state were making this new one sulphapyridine against pneumonia i nodded the disease which used to be called the old mans friend but more frequently robbed him of his healthy grandson jeff topped up my glass from the shaker i decided definitely to give up sherry that guy you used to talk about professor hцrlein hes been to england a couple of times he was lecturing to doctors about domagk and his mice hes going great guns in wuppertal hes a member of the nazi party hes mixed up with the reich labour front and the reich health council as well as being on the i g farben board of directors a big bug in the present order of things do you think therell be a war people were asking that as they used to speculate politely about the weather jeff looked hard under his bar of eyebrow hitler wants his war and hitlers going to win it i could say nothing in face of this chilling opinion jeff flicked up a chesterfield theres only one man in the world who can stop him roosevelt me i stared in silence through the large window at the thames chocolate coloured with its spectrum of oil a string of barges heading downstream behind a tug billowing black smoke jeff seemed wholly serious i wondered whether his mind had become unhinged under the pressure of business in two continents lets take a short walk he added almost equally surprisingly ive got my secretary donna over here shes out shopping at harrods but shell be back and i dont want her to know a word about this the slightest whisper to a woman you might as well say it on the radio we took the lift down in silence leaving by the river entrance of the hotel we strolled in the small delightful triangular public gardens it was a fine evening the red doubledecker trams clanking along the embankment bearing the office workers home to camberwell and brixton you know gцrings been in london jeff asked abruptly i heard a rumour but i didnt believe it he was here less than twentyfour hours it was on may ii the day before your king georges coronation he just showed up at croydon with a few other nazis wanted to get into the royal act i guess maybe wave to the crowds from the balcony of buckingham palace ribbentrop was mad hitler already had an official representative for the ceremony general blomberg gцring spent the night at the embassy in carlton house terrace then they smuggled the reichmarschall out the crowds in the streets would have had him for dog meat whats this got to do with you stopping the war i told you about gцring so youd know a lot of things go on across the frontiers which never see newsprint have you heard of general franz halder therere too many german generals to keep count hes hitlers chief of staff and i guess busy this moment with his pencil and a map of the county of kent planning the best way up from dover say whos this he had paused at a bust among the shrubs sullivan of gilbert and sullivan oh sure jeff whistled a phrase from the mikado do you remember what i told you during that crazy show in cologne how the generals hated hitler as a johnniecomelately they reckon hes more likely to lead germany to ruin than to glory halder would be very very pleased to see the end of the fьhrer so would count von moltke greatgrandnephew of the famous one also von trott von schlabrendorff and carl gцrdeler who was over here last year with his wife ostensibly giving lectures but making contact with horace wilson at the foreign office do you know whats happening in london on july i havent the faintest its the international whaling conference jeff stopped to inspect the memorial to the imperial camel corps i had no idea where this strange conversation was leading but he seemed to be handling important german names with assurance i wondered how the international whaling conference came into it the german delegation will be headed by a guy called wohltat hes a civil servant from the economics ministry hes close to gцring and hes interested in bigger fish than whales hes coming to do a deal with wilson colonies cash for germanya thousand million pounds a free hand to act as they like in eastern europe in return hitler will guarantee the british empire halder could tear up his map of kent those are terms which britain would never accept they are terms which britain herself suggested through horace wilson i simply dont believe you i said forcefully have it your own way jeff told me airily but those terms could be a starting point this is my plan if your foreign office told halder theyd stick to that sort of agreement once the generals had kicked out hitlerthat theyd support the generals against the nazi machine right up to the hiltthat theyd support gцrdeler as the new chancellor which seems the fashionable ideathen wed be getting somewhere the germans would murder the rebellious generals not for one moment listenthe german people have been living for the glorious tomorrow since hitler first walked into the chancellery maybe the tomorrows getting nearer they feel they can almost touch it but they absolutely hate the idea of another war and so do the generals for the same good reason theyre afraid they might lose again im going on to germany in twothree days ive got a contact with halder right there in wuppertal its essential i meet someone from your foreign office maybe you can arrange it through sir edward tiplady in six months we could have hitler in heaven or st helena jeff paused lighting another cigarette i did not know what to make of it all jeff was not a vain man he did not seek importance he did not exaggerate he was practical a man who would set about making a million dollars or restoring peace in the world without fuss or selfdelusions and in the six years i had known him everything he had foreseen in germany had come sickeningly true i suppose i could try sir edward or lord meddish who i share a flat with but in the present temper of the country nobody wants to smell even faintly of appeasement it wouldnt be appeasement if the end result was hitlers head on a spike ill see what i can do i promised but hurry old man times short going up in the lift jeff talked about wuppertal livings tough in germany today everything ersatz coffee from acorns margarine for butter a stick of rhubarb pretending to be a lemon their clothes are made from zellwolle substitute their rubber from god knows what the germans are worse off than during the war dont they object under the nazis you must be crazy theres some sickening things happening behind barbed wire which even the nazis are ashamed of because they keep quiet about it we reached his floor you know hitler has to wear reading glasses jeff added hes never allowed to be seen or photographed in them it would spoil the superman image he has his speeches typed in special extralarge fьhrerschrift jeff was a useful repository of information which casually uttered could silence a london dinnertable his secretary donna was already in the suite she was short blonde and bubbling twentytwo or three with big eyes and big bosom as she ordered jeff to telephone about some theatre tickets i politely asked about her volume of work but it seemed she did not know how to type within the hour i was telling archie of jeffs scheme in the flat to my surprise he did not dismiss it as fantastic theres quite a traffic in unofficial diplomatic activity behind the scenes swedes and swiss and those sort of people they remind me of the mice busy under the floorboards at some tremendous diplomatic reception well sometimes the unexpected appearance of a mouse can make even an ambassador jump theres somebody i know from eton doing rather well in the fo ill give him a ring anything is worth trying in the countrys present straits but the foreign office seemed in no hurry to accept the services of the only man in europe who could prevent the outbreak of war the following evening jeff telephoned me at the flat cant you pep them up he complained i dont think one can pep up the british foreign office anyway on friday nights it disperses to its country houses that is why hitler always makes his most violent moves on saturday mornings id try calling the embassy but i guess joe kennedys never heard of me hes probably away with the astors anyway i hear his sons and daughters are well in with the cliveden set its at cliveden and not in the cabinet of course where british policies are formulated this was not entirely a newspaper columnists joke jeff put down the telephone he was not in the mood for kidding that friday neville chamberlain traversed the muzzle of british foreign policy so that it no longer aimed harmlessly at the sky or perhaps at the british people themselves but at hitlers head he had gone to birmingham where his family name shone like burnished brass instead of plaintively protesting again at hitlers perfidy he changed his mind and said britain would resist hitlers domination of the world to the uttermost of its power everyone cheered the last time they cheered him he was waving his piece of paper on heston aerodrome the following week president lebrun of france paid a state visit the weather stayed cold and showery on the wednesday hitler subdued lithuania by sailing in the pocket battleship deutschland from swinemьnde to memel his latest aggression at least had the singular variation of being committed by water jeff fumed expensively all that week in the savoy archie finally told me that his friend from the foreign office would see my man on the friday afternoon but not within official walls we were invited to take tea at the travellers club in pall mall at four oclock to jeffs visibly diminishing selfconfidence we were led by a porter in bottlegreen livery and brass buttons to a large oblong morningroom full of dark leather furniture on which a pair of elderly gentlemen sat asleep the windows looked across st jamess park to the foreign office for which the club was something of a canteen jeffs bounce expired more with our young diplomat who had chestnut hair a pink plump face an old etonian tie and a name not doublebarrelled but triplebarrelled would you prefer toast or teacake he asked politely the teacakes are rather good teacakes i replied for us both youve some contacts among our german friends suggested the foreign office man when he was leaning back in his deep armchair and lazily stirring his tea thats right the casual english grandeur of the club was too much for jeffs natural brashness his demoralization was completed by being presented for the first time in his life with a teacake he could explain only stumblingly the scheme which had appeared so exciting and straightforward in the embankment gardens the diplomat spread his teacake thickly with strawberry jam could you give me the name of this person in wuppertal whos the link between you and the reich general staff no sir well dont worry male or female im not prepared to say german jeff nodded i wondered for the first time if it was gerda more tea the diplomat invited us and what precisely would you wish his majestys government to do mr beckerman promise the support of the british empire for the german generals when they murder hitler and it is you who will bring them the british empires message thats right jeff agreed oh charles a tall bald man caught our hosts eye you are on the committee arent you the cottage pie at lunch was really rather dreadful i wouldnt have given it to my housemaid to eat the two members discussed the cottage pie then all four of us discussed the architecture of the club then jeff and i found ourselves out in pall mall i try to prevent a war jeff said bitterly and what do i get teacakes last weeklast week as i write this and can lunch in professorial dignity at the athenaeum club next door to the travellersi invited the same diplomat with the triplebarrelled name yes wed looked up that young american fellows background he remembered which wasnt very savoury his family were the biggest bootleggers in new york during prohibition hardly more than gangsters we were suspicious of him we were even suspicious of carl gцrdeler and he was a former lord mayor of leipzig both might have been catspaws giving hitler an excuse to shoot powerful but inconvenient generals as british agents without incurring the resentment of his army werent you wrong about gцrdeler he finished at the end of a length of pianowire after the bomb plot perhaps we were there was a halfhearted sort of plot in i suppose halder fussed about a bit during the final days of that august general von witzleben was supposed to collect some troops and chuck hitler out by marching them to his front door the other generals all posted themselves away from berlin you cant say the plotters lost heart their heart wasnt in it from the first place i heard about it all from a cambridge don who interrogated halder after the war the generaloberst told of an earlier plot for september but unfortunately that was the day chamberlain flew to munich when hitler called off the impending war his popularity went up in germany as much as chamberlains did here so my american friend did know what he was talking about jeff had a contact a surprising one in wuppertal whom he told me about in munich after the war possibly he admitted sipping his port what happened to herr wohltat and the whaling conference oh an utterly disgraceful episode sir horace wilson tried to buy hitler off a miserable failure he should have offered more do you still like teacakes my guest looked surprised yes i often have them at the travellers theyre not nearly so good as they were the following friday of march chamberlain offered colonel beck the polish foreign minister a guarantee of britains unqualified support should hitler attack poland colonel beck accepted between two flicks of ash from his cigarette that evening i was taking david mellors and his pretty redheaded fiancйe to dinner at kettners in soho to talk over the wedding arrangements for the following week as we sat down david asked have you heard of a chap called florey yes he was a don at caius when i was up an australian thats right you knew hed been prof of pathology in oxford since no i didnt the last id heard of him hed gone to sheffield what do you do boy when you move into a department as a new broom of a professor send your staff to the library to look out other peoples unfinished lines of research i told him promptly youre right get them busy picking brains which is quicker than scratching their own from all accounts the path department at oxford was in a pretty ropy state when florey blew in about the first item he gingered up his boys and girls to investigate anew was lysozyme old flems tear antiseptic i exclaimed thats as out of date as the charleston surely oh god exclaimed margaret in anguish we both stared at her i forgot to tell daphne the other bridesmaids have decided on pink hats she can buy some dye at woolworths dear said david helpfully next on floreys list was another of flems babies which never got past the toddling stagepenicillin you had something to do with it hadnt you apparently theyve now managed to isolate a grain or two of the stuff professor raistrick tried to isolate some at the school of tropical medicine i said sceptically but i heard the penicillin kept vanishing under his nose floreys got a pretty bright chemist working for him there chap called ernst chain halfrussian and halfgerman apparently he used to work at the charitй hospital in berlin i had heard of dr chain yes he escaped from hitler and went to work with hoppy at cambridge david grinned florey got him transferred to oxford like joe payne from luton town to chelsea i dont know what the transfer fee would be no ill tell the others they can all wear white hats like daphne said margaret thoughtfully where did florey get the mould from i asked as far as i knew the specimen at marys was the only one which actually produced any penicillin they had a culture of it already in the lab flem sent a bit to oxford years ago chain is able to grow it faster than flem did by lacing the broth underneath with yeast have they brought flem himself into the research no chain thought he was dead i laughed that would be taking flems habitual selfeffacement to an uncomfortable extreme we talked about the imminent wedding but more about the imminent war as two men we had a particularly keen interest in the possibility of conscription it arrived within a month one hundred and fortythree mps voted against it it is very dangerous to give generals all they want objected major clement attleebut he was thinking of the somme when the generals had more men than ideas the conscripts were afforded exceptional treatment unlike any previous soldiers in the british army they were issued with pyjamas neville chamberlain was a man of peace he even went to war peacefully he was followed by a nation of inoffensive shepherds cheerfully shouldering their crooks there was no nastiness there was no undue enthusiasm the war was very genteel we had the blackout and the evacuees everyone carried a gasmask in a little cardboard box the size of a brownie camera airraid trenches were cut among the flowerbeds of hyde park strips of sticky brown paper crisscrossed shop windows to prevent their breaking when a bomb dropped outside the only bloodshed was a doubling of road casualties by unlit motorcars meanwhile poland was smashed between two flicks of ash from colonel becks cigarette our lives were not endangered only changed archie was outraged to discover that volunteering for the army was officially discouraged he saw the chance of his duodenal ulcer returning and spending yet another war on his back in swanage i waited submissively to be gathered tidily by the harvester of conscription i had little work nor income because london was empty of patients and sir edward was busy evacuating his hospital from blackfriars by the thames to a vast redbrick victorian asylum sprawling across the south downs its london wards were left empty for the halfmillion airraid casualties the government secretly but confidently expected in the first week of the war towards the end of october when people were still saying it would all be over by christmas sir edward telephoned me one breakfast time at archies flat could i call that afternoon on a professor ainsley the address was near marble arch it was important mystified but flattered i presented myself at a small block of offices sandbagged to the first floor not far from st marys hospital behind a cinema in edgware road i waited in a bleak official anteroom while a smartlydressed blonde with a superior accent answered the telephone typed and received callers with impartial bored condescension ainsleys office beyond seemed a storeroom for battleshipgrey filing cabinets among which he had wedged himself at a cheap bare desk with three telephones each of a different colour he was small greyhaired knobblyfaced bushyeyebrowed middleaged solemnlooking a likeness to alexander fleming struck me he wore a plain blue suit and a red knitted cardigan which i later found that like fleming he abandoned only during the hottest weeks of midsummer i had during the morning taken care to discover that he was the wychart professor of biology at cambridge i did not know that this selfeffacing amiable overworked practical intellectual who was to control my life for the next six years came directly under professor lindemann the oxford physicist with enormous influence on churchill lindemann had just moved into the admiralty as the new first lords personal assistant should i make some joke about let slip the dons of war ainsley asked affably like a lot of my colleagues at cambridge i suppose im sitting here working for the government for the duration he looked round the room unenthusiastically i gather you were out in germany in and that you met gerhard domagk sitting on a hard chair opposite i told him i was in wuppertal working in a brewery yes we know all about that did you meet anyone else in the i g farbenwerke only professor hцrlein phillip heinrich hцrlein born june at wendelsheim ainsley recited reflectively and a nazi i heard him talk about sulphonamides to the british association at nottingham a couple of years ago very effective he was too anyone else only the lab technician a girl perhaps youd care to describe domagks lab and anything else you remember in the factory draw a plan if you like i sketched what i could remember of the factory layout had the british government been so interested i thought they could have sent a man that summer to ride up and down in the schwebebahn ainsley began to question me about the dieffenbachs i became aware that a dossier on myself lay somewhere in the battleshipgrey cabinets the dieffenbachs were a decent family who fell for the nazi line or thought it prudent to pretend as much i told him did you fall for it at the time not in the least i think i saw how dangerous the nazis were before a lot of people in england did youve no conscientious objections to killing germans nothing like that he added airily i shook my head nor how you killed them i dont of course mean resorting to torture and putting yourself on the nazis own level but killing them by the deliberate spread ofshall we saybotulism or plague or anthrax i hesitated no its the same principle as dropping high explosive im glad to see you are a realist mr elgar nor am i myself talking theoretical science the government intends to wage war with every weapon possiblewe are merely returning hitlers complimentwhich includes pathogenic bacteria he paused looking at me closely little or nothing is known about handling and distributing such pathogens or of their likely effect on the enemy population weve a few sketchy papers on germ warfare thats all your name was put forward by sir almroth wright no less sir edward tiplady and i both agree that your particular combination of biochemical and bacteriological skills make you the right man to direct our new unit of course bacteria may never be used as a weapon in this war neither may poison gas but i assure you that the enemy has for some time been investigating the possibilities of both and we should be criminally at fault not preparing ourselves for similar action i could say nothing for a moment i was amazed even more flattered i felt a flush of warmth towards wright for at last finding me a job if a peculiar one i had imagined ainsley wished only to interrogate me about the i g farben plant not to offer me a lever of the war machine perhaps they could find no one else to take it my students today might be appalled at my accepting such inhuman work without scruple but i had no qualms later over the americans dropping two atom bombs on the japanese you could not fight the nazis or the kamikazes with half a smile on your face my only feeling as i agreed was the job being preferable to peeling potatoes in the army where does this research take place in oxford at the fungus institute a small and admirably unobtrusive grey stone building just south of the parks the strictest secrecy is of course essentialyou will have to sign the official secrets act which proscribes the most alarming penalties as far as the university and the rest of the country are concerned you are performing research on making valuable foodstuffs from toadstools and lichens well before that snowy christmas i was installed on one side of south parks road at oxford secretly attempting to breed strains of germs so deadly they could wipe out the population of europe while in the large building opposite professor florey was attempting to develop penicillin and save the world from the deadly germs which already infested it thus science progresses i wore grey flannel trousers and a harris tweed jacket and i bought a secondhand bicycle i found lodgings in north oxford that area of redbrick family dwellings embraced by the woodstock and banbury roads where the lofty donnish intellect struggles daily with earthy domesticity i had david mellors and his new wife nearby for company i browsed in blackwells and drank in the randolph i have never enjoyed so gentle and agreeable a life as the time i was preparing unpleasant death for millions of my laboratories my colleagues and my work itself i may still write nothing the official secrets act has an infinite memory and the world is not yet peaceful enough for dust to lie undisturbed on my deadly experiments in that december when the strange war became weirder with the russians fighting the finns and the british about to fight the neutral russians instead of the germans i had a letter forwarded from the harley street house with a swedish stamp and an affixed strip of brown paper printed opened by the censor inside was an unaddressed undated sheet with a typed message dear jim god willing i shall arrive in london via stockholm firstsecond week december im trying to fix a passage with united states lines to be home in time for christmas but of course its tricky call me up at the savoy im still where the railway flies in the sky cordially jeff i was astounded to find jeff still in wuppertal even though the raf was dropping on him nothing more weighty than the prose of the ministry of information leaflets perhaps he was still trying to stop the war the savoy knew nothing of him but it was not the time to make bookings from one side of europe to another i left the fungus institute number and two mornings later he telephoned in high spirits i arrived in a swedish plane with the swedish ambassador which i guess is safe enough he explained hey what are all those blimps in the sky round london thats the balloon barrage the germans run their bombers into them jeff pressed me to have dinner the following night i asked if i could bring a girlfriend sure thing old man im lonely theres no girls i know left in london and donna sailed home early summer whats it like being a neutral in germany creepy the gestapo had their beady eyes on me round the clock i guess theyd have run me out if i hadnt jumped of my own accord how are the dieffenbachs are you crazy if id waved to them in the street theyd have ended in a concentration camp jeff had the same suite as in peacetime with blackout curtains which he claimed made opening the window like undressing a nun i knew that elizabeth was living in her fathers flat and imagined she would be impressed to meet a man hot from the enemys camp fires but it was i who felt staggered as she appeared through the door in uniform with a service gasmask in a haversack motor transport corps she explained do you like it i wish i was blonde khaki goes so much better with fair hair american cigarettes divine she murmured taking one of jeffs chesterfields where are you serving asked jeff dazzled by her im going to paris on monday there i should never have said so careless talk costs lives im driving ambulances and things at the british transit hospital because of the french i picked up with mummy on the riviera though everyone says i have the most ghastly midi accent mummy thinks that paris will be a much nicer place to spend the war in than london last time they had a few shells from big bertha but the food remained delicious mummy regards the war as a personal insult to her from hitler she added to me there was champagne and caviar canapйs on a silver tray jeff wanted to express either admiration of the fighting british or appreciation at escape from austere germany there was no food rationing in england until the following month and there seemed a shortage only of taxis and torch batteries as the longpromised bombs stayed off london had the gaiety of a fashionable gardenparty spared a threatening summer storm have you seen anything of archie i asked elizabeth while jeff was telephoning the head waiter yes hes dreadfully confused poor dear now that hitlers in bed with stalin he doesnt know if the war is an antifascist crusade or an anticommunist one he says the british working classes went to war quite ignobly only because they were fed up with hitler but fedupness is an incredibly powerful force isnt it with the british so in the end hes gone to join up as a guardsman this was news to me at least it will give him some peace from continually redefining his attitudes what are you doing at oxford im on war work at the fungus institute elizabeth looked nonplussed ive got it youre developing a mushroom like the caterpillars in alice eating one side will make our soldiers so small they can creep on the germans unseen and the other will make them so tall theyll frighten the enemy to death thats right i told her jeff explained to us how the germans were cockahoop after the polish campaign the wehrmacht and the dive bombers made mincemeat of the poles theyve a new tactic if the tanks run into trouble they radio the stukas to bomb them out of it i guess poland hadnt a combat plane in the sky after the first day and now theyve sunk your carrier the courageous and the royal oak right inside scapa flow youve got to take your hat off to the uboat captains i guess you forgot the athenia said elizabeth sunk without warning nine hours after the war started drowning a hundred and twelve people including children and including twentyeight americans she coloured im sorry anyway the germans believe that churchill sank the athenia to do another lusitania its a crazy idea but nobody dare deny it say you remember your professor domagk he was arrested by the gestapo i raised my eyebrows all i heard about domagk was his turning down the nobel prize ill give you the real story its all round wuppertal jeff produced a sheet of flimsy paper from his pocket with a triumphant flourish i had that sewn into my overcoat as i was travelling with a swedish diplomatic party i decided the gestapo wouldnt be too nosy it was the carbon of a letter from domagk at i g farben in wuppertal dated november to professor dr gunnar holmgren rector of the karolinska institute in stockholm it started with the appropriate academic greeting magnifizenz its twentyodd lines of german expressing domagks honour at accepting the nobel prize for medicine and physiology and his readiness to visit stockholm on december to receive it dont ask me how i got that letter jeff said proudly but mine werent the first prying eyes to read it the gestapo intercepted it of course domagk must have been overconfident or maybe didnt see what went on under his own eyes a lot of intelligent germans dont want to you remember karl von ossietsky the german who won the nobel peace prize in and promptly disappeared into a concentration camp jeff nodded to a mind like hitlers a nobel prize of any sort carries a political sting the story is that hitler ordered domagks arrest himself on a friday night in the middle of november a couple of guys in plain clothes knocked at domagks house near the zoo there and said they were gestapo officers they arrested him searched his place confiscated all his correspondence then they locked him up in wuppertal jail in the morning they ordered him to clean out his cell and offered him a cup of coffee to both of which our professor gave a dignified refusal a top ss man from dьsseldorf came across to interrogate him but by then there was a hell of a row going on the chief of the civil police was demanding to know why their distinguished citizen was behind bars with the gestapo he wouldnt get an answer thats right jeff poured more champagne into elizabeths glass she was sitting in an armchair with her gasmask on her knee listening in fascination they kept him there eight days they let his wife bring some food and they moved in a couch instead of a plank bed when one of the warders asked what hed done to get arrested domagk replied i won the nobel prize the warder went round the other prisoners saying weve got a madman in there we laughed then a week later domagk got himself arrested again jeff went on it was at an international medical congress in berlin you know how suspicious the nazis are of foreign contacts they wanted him to sign a declaration that he wouldnt make a speech or mix with the guests domagk refused so inside he went in the end the ss took him to the ministry of education and gave him another letter to sign addressed to the karolinska institute refusing the nobel prize he signed that asked elizabeth if he hadnt the world would have heard that professor domagk had suffered a fatal heart attack but do you know what the nazis did they sent the letter to the police at wuppertal so it would be posted to stockholm with a wuppertal postmark these trivial bits of thoroughness are what make me feel most frightened of the germans three waiters wheeled in a trolley with our dinner whens america coming into the war asked elizabeth who can tell whats in roosevelts mind jeff stubbed out his cigarette if joe kennedy here at the embassy had anything to do with it id say never archie says this kennedy chap has written britain off already elizabeth told him and i gather kennedy is highly delighted at the prospect you cant expect the boston irish to stroke the british lion jeff observed perhaps the germans will get rid of hitler themselves i suggested after all they nearly blew him up in that munich beer cellar last month that bomb was a putup job to put public sympathy right behind hitler but half a dozen germans were killed by it exclaimed elizabeth jeff snapped his fingers whats six or seven lives to the nazis even german ones lets eat it was the last good meal i had in england for fifteen years it occurred to me that elizabeth must have been seeing a good deal of archie of course it was dr and madame trefouлl working at the institut pasteur in paris who made sulphonamide therapy on any scale possible at all dr henri lamartine beside me on a deck chair in the afternoon sunshine early in a beautiful summer produced another blue and gold packet of weekend cigarettes it opened like a book he had been in oxford six days without exhausting his supply brought from paris he refused english cigarettes because they gave him la toux sиche isnt that a little sweeping no i dont think so mon cher confrиre he spoke excellent english in a dry precise way which matched his appearance and as far as i could tell from a weeks collaboration his character he was of middle height but lean his dark hair well greased and brushed back with a small woolly moustache and many thin lines round the angles of his mouth his complexion was yellowish and his longfingered hands had many moles on the back he wore a smart chalkstriped blue suit a dark shirt and plain silk tie he was ten years older than me my opposite number at the institut duhamel in montparnasse though his position in the french military and bureaucratic cats cradle was more complicated than mine he was ending a weeks exchange of information and opinions i was to pay a return visit to paris in the autumn oh well left alone sir i interrupted lamartine frowned deeply i do not understand why you acclaim a player for missing the ball that wednesday of may we were enjoying a cricket match in the oxford parks its simple the bowler made the ball veer at the last moment had the batsman not spotted it he would have been caught off the edge of his bat and sent back to the pavilion you see i think you have to be an englishman of many generations to comprehend this mysterious game its really simple but with delightfully subtle variations like a mozart symphony why could they not all have bats lamartine wondered it would make the game much livelier he resumed his argument i g farben waited two years before presenting prontosil to the world while countless millions continued to die from blood poisoning meningitis etcetera they wanted their patents watertight thats all well cest logique but it was the trefouлl with dr nitti and dr bovet who found the protosil dye was broken down in the body and only the sulphonamide part of it did the work of killing the bacteria as sulphonamide was discovered by gelmo of vienna in i g farben couldnt patent it we made the germans look fools farben must have known all the time that only the sulphonamide in prontosil was active they manufactured it with a red colour to mask the truth taking pure sulphonamide instead of prontosil at least saved the patients turning bright pink and passing alarming pink urine its over asked lamartine as the players abruptly trooped from the field no the captains declared declared what it doesnt matter lets have a cup of tea it was towards the end of the phoney war the drфle de guerre as lamartine called it a month previously chamberlain announced that hitler had missed the bus but unfortunately it was still being driven by the fьhrer in whichever direction he cared at an unstoppable pace denmark and norway had been swiftly overcome though lamartine assured me emphatically that the french expected little trouble from the germans for the rest of the yearhitler was forced to strike up north he will be somewhat more prudent before letting fly at the maginot line lamartine was returning to paris in the morning and i solicited professor florey to invite us that night to dine in queens college high table life continued as it had when charles i was conducting another war from oxford sitting on either side of florey in his longsleeved ma gown we inevitably fell into the argument whether chamberlain would go and churchill come in i am sure the change is very necessary lamartine gave his opinion just as it was very necessary for france to get rid of deladier as prime minister six weeks ago paul reynaud has brought a much more invigorating atmosphere you can feel it in paris already he seems a sprightly sixtytwo agreed florey guardedly indeed professor he bicycles and does the gymnastic daily i think barnacle chamberlain will survive tonights vote i said gloomily the conservatives will flock into the lobby behind him because its part of the public school spirit if labour has the guts to force a division at all with the prospect of exactly that happening in what research are you engaged professor asked lamartine politely directing the conversation to his host have you heard of a substance called penicillin never howard florey was then aged fortyone he had thick dark hair parted carefully just left of centre and an impassive deliberative look he often smiled but never widely he wore soft collars with plain ties and dark suits and rimless glasses his quiet voice still showed its salting in the air of adelaide he could be aloof he distrusted england and the english since arriving in oxford as a rhodes scholar in but he had mellowed like the oxford stone and was tipped to emerge from donnish intrigues as the next provost of queens i thought during the war that he bore a resemblance to the bandleader glen miller but perhaps it was only the glasses its the juice of the mould penicillium notatum which has been found to kill staphylococci in the lab florey explained staphylococci which are resistant to sulphonamides reflected lamartine might it be used on patients its wretchedly difficult stuff to extract all weve got is a few grains of brownish powder but weve found its completely nontoxic to animals which is encouraging might i be allowed a specimen of this mould lamartine asked it sounds quite interesting if you wish florey said amicably drop into my labs before you go and ill let you have some reprints of the published papers and a note on our work in progress the mould travels excellently that night in the house of commons labour found the courage to force a vote according to the oxford history a quarter of a century later labours mind was made up by the female mps of all parties who decided in their room to divide the house if nobody else would i hope the story is true i have long believed women more practical in misfortune than men i bade farewell to lamartine on the thursday on the morning of friday may the elderly maid in my north oxford lodgings brought early tea with the news that the wireless said germany had invaded belgium just like last time she added theyll never learn holland was invaded too that holland was conquered in five days was bemusing to britain we all thought the dutch needed simply to open the dykes for the germans to be bogged down or drowned prime minister churchill offered us blood toil tears and sweat but the fighting was still as chamberlain had said of the czechs comfortably in a far away country between people of which we knew nothing about eleven in the morning of wednesday may professor ainsley appeared at the fungus institute unannounced its this bloody man lamartine he began as i poured him a cup of tea we sat on laboratory stools alone amid sufficient germs to depopulate oxfordshire overnight elgar youve got to go to france this was hardly cheering news the fighting was then round the names graved on british war memorialsarras cambrai bapaume that very morning the wehrmacht panzers had reached the channel near etaples our base in the great war its geometrical grey forest of british headstones washed with the salty winds across the estuary of the river canche sugar i asked no thanks given it up for the duration my kids have my ration you seem to have dropped something of a danger elgar i passed on to sir edward mellanby at the medical research council what you told me about giving lamartine a specimen of penicillin mould obviously mellanbys interested in floreys work across the roadthough i must say he doesnt seem to give it much urgency but he doesnt want a bit of the mould plus full instructions for growing it and extracting the penicillin floating round france at this particular moment isnt mellanby being overdramatic i felt resentful because it was floreys fault lamartine had left with the specimen not mine but it seemed no moment to argue penicillin is hardly another sulphonamide yes but unlike sulphonamide its active in the lab against the staphylococcus and the causative organism of gas gangrene replied ainsley forthrightly so who knows its potential in war wounds anyway some highup politico has been informedmost foolishly in my viewand ordered us to get it back but cant you simply telephone lamartine or somebody at our paris embassy thats exactly what we cant do he seems to have disappeared how extraordinary things seem somewhat disorganized at the institut duhamel he continued drily i suppose we cant blame them if theyre at panic stations but you know about penicillin elgar and you know lamartine by sight youve got to cross the channel and stop the mould falling into the wrong hands german hands i looked even more surprised ainsley gulped down his unsugared tea his expression wry from more than its bitterness your friend lamartine is a bit of an odd fish weve just found out that he was once mixed up with the croix de feucolonel de la rocques outfit frenchstyle fascism lamartine should never have been allowed to reach the position he did he may have gone to earth waiting to hand over his little present when the nazis arrive they wont penetrate to paris surely i objected they didnt last time they did in and the parallel with the francoprussian war may be closer than with the last one ainsley glanced at me sideways a couple of days ago the cabinet decided we might have to pull gorts army out bring them home i was shocked the french didnt care for that surely the french dont know i was let into the secret because we may have to open our bag of tricks he nodded round the lab but what about the maginot line the maginot line is as irrelevant to the progress of this war as napoleons tomb ainsley replied shortly when ainsley had left in his official car i crossed the road to the sir william dunn laboratories there was an oxford variety as well as a cambridge one i had never before intruded on florey there i gathered that he was a good professor captaining his team as well as initiating its research understanding his staffs problems inside the laboratory and outwhich were often the most important ones for successful work he shunned publicity but enjoyed that sublimest of professorial gifts of being able to raise money easily and in large quantities i found him sitting in his room in his white coat doesnt look much like a weapon of war does it he said quietly when i had explained ainsleys visit he picked from his desk a conical flask stoppered with cotton wool the fluffy greenishwhite mould inside lying like felt on the dark fluid of its broth you havent even tried it as a cure for infected mice yet have you im going to this weekend fortunately i didnt let on to lamartine ive a difficult job judging the right dose did you know the americans gave sulphonamide with quinine for pneumonia at new rochelle university back in it didnt work so they abandoned it they fixed the dose too low i suspect we havent much penicillin here to play with but if i inject too little i wont get a decisive result then no one outside these four walls will have any further interest in penicillin and wont be prepared to give us hard cash to keep up the work on it domagk was lucky never to have that problem its a hard thing to say at this particular moment but without domagks sulphonamide our mental sights would never have been adjusted to see the potentialities of penicillin fleming certainly didnt see a future for penicillin in or he didnt think it worth practical steps beyond using it in a local way once or twice for an infected sinus and an infected eye among his colleagues at st marys are you working on it full time oh lord no penicillins only one of our research projects weve hardly had time to come to grips with it at all these past couple of years ive a depleted staff like everybody else with a war on and weve all the routine work teaching medical students and all that he paused to give a smile unlike you who can devote yourself to developing your edible fungi across the road i hope you can get a mushroom to taste like a turkey itll be handy at christmas florey understood perfectly well what i did in the fungus institute that he never acknowledged as much was one of his jokes he made few of them some people called him a cold fish but perhaps oxford professors lose the facility on appointment like trollopes bishops the ability to whistle i had two days before travelling to france during the friday night late on thursday i was summoned to the communal telephone in the hall of my north oxford lodgings it was an enormous house built for fecund victorian dons as the greyspired church of st philip and st james opposite had been raised for their family worship the hall always smelt of sour milk and cabbage and the telephone like everything else you touched was coated with a thin layer of grease it was sir edward tiplady he had heard from ainsley of my expedition i had discovered they were close friends serving for some years on a committee planning scientific warfare of which i had no inkling jim you know already dont you that elizabeths been posted to france i didnt know she was still there would you look her up shes billeted with a french doctor a professor piйry at no rue lascut thats near the bois he gave the telephone number just to see if shes all right dont you know things look a little sticky over there her mothers bolted back to london give her my love im sure you can look after her should she need it good luck jim he was trying to be his usual casual cheerful self but it did not work no more than when the old king lay under his care desperately ill i wondered if the below stairs tales of elizabeths parentage were false or inspired by lady tip from hatred of her husband i sailed from newhaven to dieppe in an ordinary crosschannel steamer painted grey blacked out and escorted by a destroyer there were crates lashed to the decks the only passengers a hundred or so servicemen of all ranks even a redtabbed general the journey proved less disturbing than my stormtossed crossing towards wuppertal there were no submarines no aeroplanes i found the french blackout lacked the puritanical gloom of our own where the narrowest chink brought an airraid warden banging on the front door with that already most tiresome enquiry dont you know theres a war on a comfortable express took me to the gare st lazare i arrived in paris shortly after eight oclock on the morning of saturday may about the same time as majorgeneral spears arrived on churchills instructions to put some heart into the french governmentand to convince them that the british army was not following its traditional tactics in trouble and making a dash for the nearest blue water i took a taxi past the madeleine to the british embassy in rue du faubourg st honorй i never forgot my first impression of paris the smell of coffee and gitane cigarettes the advertisements everywhere for dubodubondubonnet and the lugubrious nicolas wine man with his fistfuls of half a dozen splayed bottles the noisy traffic and shrillwhistling policemen the green buses with people hanging over the taffrail the pavement cafйs with everyone reading their morning papers the more important statues and doorways were sandbagged as in london there were a good many army lorries i noticed at once the sauntering lostlooking groups on the pavements with suitcases and bundles refugees which had been pouring into paris all the past week from belgium and northeastern france an embassy official with a retired soldierly air expected me but could offer little help i suppose you could try the naafi in the boulevard magenta he suggested gloomily when i asked about a bed what did you say youd come to paris for to collect a bit of mould he looked lost the war was becoming too complicated for him i decided to make straight for elizabeths billet another taxi took me between the green billows of chestnuts in the champselysйes towards the arc de triomphe the professors was one of the tall grey brownshuttered confluent houses overlooking the sunken railway line near the porte maillot as i went to ring the bell of the highlyvarnished front door elizabeth herself stepped into the sunshine in her uniform darling my god i had never before seen her disconcerted but what are you doing in paris were you just leaving on the contrary ive just arrived from england but everybody here is getting ready to fly for their lives surely it cant be as bad as that i asked though feeling abruptly uneasy havent you seen this mornings paper i cant speak a great deal of french the belgians are on the point of giving up the whole french government has been to notre dame to pray for divine inspiration thats a terribly bad sign isnt it some people say the panzers will be parked in the place de la concorde in a couple of days but of course paris has been buzzing with rumours for weeks the french high command tells people absolutely nothing i suppose theyre far too ashamed of themselves remembering sir edwards charge i asked how about yourself are you getting out i cant until im ordered to its such a lovely relief not having to make decisions isnt it where are you staying nowhere my arrangements seem a little disorganized then youd better sleep here i protested against such intrusion the professor and madame wont mind a bit she assured me airily being always lighthearted in the disposal of other peoples hospitality but what are you doing here instead of growing mushrooms at oxford its rather complicated but its to do with an experimental drug which mustnt fall into the hands of the germans how thrilling jim darling you are dressed rather peculiarly arent you i was wearing my harris tweed jacket with grey flannels carrying my flapping umbrella and a small suitcase this is my usual holiday outfit jim youre a darling i forgot to say how utterly wonderful it is to see you she came nearer and kissed me for the first time she did not make her ceremonial pouting face professor piйry had left for work at the franзoisxavier hospital madame was out i left my bag explaining to elizabeth that i must be at the institut duhamel before that saturday noon im walking across to my hospital in neuilly ill put you on the right bus at the porte maillot elizabeth told me its so much cheaper than a taxi and almost as quick get off at the jardin du luxembourg dinners at eight ill explain everything to the professor in french if the air raid warning goes you follow the arrows marked abri she had the calmly practical approach to the war of so many englishwomen it must have been a sizable national asset as we walked in the warm morning along the rue lascut she talked about her father and mother in england with the simple eagerness of a schoolgirl archies still in england she told me and hes a sergeant isnt that grand the bus took me along the arcaded rue de rivoli with its tiny expensive shops still selling articles of supreme uselessness past the sandbagged statue of jeanne darc then across the seine and the ile de le citй the institut duhamel was a small square brick and stone building overlooking the luxembourg gardens i had an introduction to a dr champier who had worked in the french hospital in soho and spoke good english he sat at an untidy desk in a cubicle of a room the tall window tight shut hot and stuffy and smelling of french cigarettes he was a short fat man with bushy black hair and a large moustache in a blue suit with a lйgion dhonneur rosette in the buttonhole he wore an expression of worry which i hoped was habitual why are you so anxious to trace lamartine he asked i must apologize for not being at liberty to tell you but surely among confrиres he spread his pudgy hands times are abnormal as you appreciate seeming to accept this he folded his hands on his paunch whatever your reasons i cannot help you much lamartine has left here between ourselves he should never have been appointed but there are political influences in this country which can put almost any man in almost any position he produced a packet of gitanes which i refused no the battle didnt start at dawn on may my friend he jerked his head in the direction of the front line its been in progress since the end of the last war never again should the germans invade us we said that was logical we had a million and a half dead a third of our country devastated and we were flat broke but unfortunately it became never again to war of any sort our nation has lost its soul therere plenty of frenchmen who wouldnt mind hitler in the elysйe palace if it would save their own skins take it from me i made some reassuring remark that hitler still had a long way to come has he mr elgar i hope youre right a hundred kilometres isnt much when we havent an army equipped or trained to stand up to him what can we expect after a couple of decades of changing our government almost every weekend of corruption and swindling of every man out for himself whether hes boss or worker of riots and indisciplineremember the stavisky affair he struck a pinkcoloured match stavisky was that devious financier supposed to have committed suicide any medical man could tell from simply reading the newspapers that the police shot him dead men tell no tales against people in high places so we had barricades in the streets the government did nothing but resign no wonder now les cartes se brouillent he blew out a cloud of pungent smoke ill tell you something lamartine has indiscreet contacts with the croix de feu thats one of those parties like action franзaise all admirers of nos chers amis hitler and mussolini i know champier grunted his home address is a top floor apartment in the avenue pierre premier de serbie by the trocadero but youd be more likely to find him at no bis rue des brouetteswheelbarrows street he translated for me thats off the boulevard de clichy in montmartre its where he has his mistress shes very pretty i saw her once when they were dining together at the mere catherine or perhaps he has gone on holiday to the cote dazur he ended with a smile you will understand that people have better things to do at this moment than look for errant bacteriologists is he spying for the germans champier considered this for some moments i dont think so but he might sell his secret knowledge of germ warfare for the conquerors favoursif they arrive he had extinguished my remaining doubts about the trouble and risk of my expedition should i not find lamartine in a day or two may i come back to you if i am here there are rumours that monsieur reynaud and his cabinet have already labels on their bags for tours we stood up and shook hands what is it that lamartine has of yours champier tried again some strains of botulism so deadly that the entire population of the world will be erased hitler included i conceded its an antibacterial drug which is very experimental and may never work in that case you would seem to be taking a lot of trouble to capture a mirage i consulted a map over the nearest mйtro entrance and caught a train from notre dame des champs station to pigalle it was noon and everyone was coming out for lunch apart from the speckling of uniforms it might have been a peacetime saturday i sat at the nearest cafй table and ordered a beer i managed to achieve sketchy directions from the waiter to the rue des brouettes the man drinking cinzano at the next table was reading an early edition of lintransigeant les allemands а ypres said the headline twentytwobis was a seedy looking building a small block of flats just inside the open front door i spied through a hatch the traditional french concierge in her black bombazine i had lost enthusiasm for my quest i was hot and hungry and i had no idea what lamartines mistress called herself i said earnestly dr lamartine and to my surprise she replied at once cinquiиme йtage holding up five fingers for my further edification i climbed a narrow stone stair amid tasty smells of cooking the door was opened by a pretty short woman in her early thirties fair haired with a snub nose and big green eyes she had a japanese kimono loosely round her she was untidy and unmade up and startled to see me i asked for dr lamartine as best i could she stared blankly clearly careful to hint no connection with him to a stranger i asked parlez vous anglais she shook her head sprechen sie deutsch ja ja ich lerne deutsch in der schule i am an english scientist from oxford i explained in german dr lamartine came to visit me earlier this month my name is mr elgar the dourness in her face disappeared lamartine had been talking about me yes you went to watch a game cricket i said in english henri very much enjoyed his stay can i see him please her glance wavered hes not here i said resolutely may i come in she had a moments hesitation all right the flat was small my mouth watered at the overpowering smell of simmering onions the livingroom was cramped and untidy the table littered with newspapers and popular magazines le figaro le temps match and marieclaire there were a good many books about in the bright yellow paper french covers on the wall was a picasso reproductionthen uncommonin the corner a treadleoperated sewing machine against the window a desk with a large typewriter surrounded by sheets of foolscap i got the impression of an intelligent independent woman of lamartine there was no trace not even a hat i explained that i had come from the institut duhamel and had urgent business with dr lamartine connected with the scientific work we both followed i wondered how much she knew of this i suspected from my assessment of her intellect a lot i havent seen henri for over a week ive no idea where he is none whatever she looked as though telling the truth though for all i knew he was listening behind the closed door of the bedroom if he should come here would you ask him to telephone me urgently i wrote down professor piйrys address and number she agreed readily though i felt only to be rid of me i shall be returning to england within a week or so to england i hope that youll be able to make it there are plenty of ports besides calais i told her confidently and the front will have to stabilize some time wont it she made a face as though tasting something disagreeable discouraged by this call i took the mйtro in search of lamartines family nest in the avenue pierre premier de serbie it was a tall grey building with well painted black shutters all folded back except for three pairs on the top floor these turned out to be the rooms of his flat after ringing and knocking without avail i returned to seek the concierge madame lamartine and the children had left for the dordogne а cause de la guerre it appeared i had not got far after floreys penicillin and the nazis seemed to be bearing down with their usual panache truly he that the devil drives feels no lead at his heels one still must eat said professor piйry gloomily in english it is necessary he was tall spare lined dyspepticlooking in his late fifties with thick grey hair brilliantined and brushed back a slim grey moustache and a grey suit with a black band across the lapel for a relative recently dead from peaceful causes he explained to me he was a physician a specialist on the liver i later discovered all french physicians to be specialists on the liver an item of the self which the frenchman is inclined to confuse with the soul despite his lean and sickly appearance professor piйry was a hearty and fastidious eater complemented by the most enthusiastic and finicky of cooks we sat in the large downstairs diningroom which was stuffy and full of second empire furniture it was relieved only by a large garish colour photograph in a gilt frame of their only son jeanbaptiste in khaki he was a lieutenant in intelligence liaising with the british army and nobody knew if he was captured in ramsgate or dead we started our potage aux lйgumes a frenchman who cannot start family dinner with soup imagines his world is coming to an end which indeed that monday evening of june it was the only british troops left in france were mostly prisoners about ten miles inland from dunkirk the colme canal flows parallel to the sea nearer the beaches the moлres canal forms an arc with its base a third canal the dunkirkfurnes to the east lies the river ijzer to the west the river aa these waterways made a box from which the germans were fended while of british soldiers and of french were ferried away in a week by freakishly variegated ships it was a box which could have been smashed had not hitler himself halted his panzers on may perhaps he wanted to spare from utter destruction the british empire he so admired and which might still be useful for him against the americans perhaps hermann gцring boasted he could do the job less costlily with bombs the notion would have pleased hitler because the german army may have been the royal infant of frederick the great the german navy the imperial child of kaiser wilhelm but the luftwaffe was the young hercules of national socialism luckily the crooked shadow of nelson was cast long in the empires sunset dunkirk was a british defeat but it was a defeat which defied disaster for our modern politicians eternally to invoke with clarion calls on their tin trumpets it also occurred during the week when howard florey found that penicillin kept alive mice infected with the staphylococcus germ which defied the sulphonamides paris was full of refugees everywhere in the streets pathetic and desperate sitting on their bundles with nowhere to go the air was flecked with the soot of burning oil tanks the fashionable area smoky with incinerated embassy secrets the airraid sirens had sounded during the night with a more tuneful gallic wail than the lugubrious london ones and there was still no trace of lamartine during the week i had no reply at his mistresss flatshe may have spied my comingwhile champier at the institut duhamel was plainly impatient at my adding to his more alarming problems he gave me half a dozen addresses of lamartines friends in paris but these achieved nothing but the absorption of my time i had no justification to call the police and i am no policeman myself i might as well have stayed in oxford it was harrowing to feel a failure particularly one which i knew might be held severely against me for the rest of my career yet those days of dunkirk were the happiest of my life my desires my fantasies with elizabeth were realized compatriots in danger we huddled like two children in a thunderstorm the defences of steely gossamer which she had wrapped round herself melted to nothing in a french professors house with a battle raging a hundred miles away she gave herself to me i use the now archaic expression deliberately because elizabeth could never be blown by the storm of her emotions from the course set by the compass of her mind and there was another factor she retained the tinselled glitter of her conversation but her determined frivolity had been shrivelled by the war in the morning she was to drive her little official austin two hundred miles to cherbourg where we were assured by the embassy that a ship of some sort would be ready to take british personnel across to southampton i was going with her i had no official permission but official permission for anything was becoming increasingly irrelevant meanwhile as professor piйry pointed out it was necessary to eat i suppose mussolinis going to declare war any minute now i observed hardly lightening the gloom over the vegetable soup the jackal on the heels of the redmouthed lion all is not lost professor piйry declared morosely the british soldiers which you took off the beach can surely remuster in england they will return to the fight through brest or st nazaire remember the germans got even nearer to paris in we must hope for another miracle of the marne i hear that madame de portes has already selected her bedroom at the chвteau amboise remarked elizabeth rather acidly referring to countess hйlиne de portes prime minister paul reynauds mistress the government sees no necessity to take a holiday among the chateaux of tours she was rebuked tartly by madame piйry darkhaired and sharpnosed sitting opposite her husband it is our duty to disbelieve pernicious rumours elizabeth smiled charmingly like the passengers aboard the titanic i suppose madame the captain and officers are incompetent but if they say we shant hit the iceberg we sleep happily in our bunks as two red spots appeared on his wifes cheeks the professor said even more gloomily it is not very pleasant of you to express such lack of faith in the french government mademoiselle tiplady we have surely passed the time for politeness returned elizabeth evenly all they have presided over so far is three weeks of headlong retreat well they shall be stopped as last time ils ne passeront pas he slapped the table as he used the words of marshal pйtain who had become vicepremier in may and who with the commanderinchief general weygand had a combined age of one hundred and fifty seven madame piйry busily rang a shrill little handbell for the ate de veau our conversation degenerated into perfunctory scraps we were laying our cutlery on the portecouteaux for the meat plates to be changed for the vegetables in the french fashion when our meal suffered an unimagined interruption the maid burst in wideeyed and open mouthed madame cest monsieur jeanbaptiste appeared in the diningroom on her heels i immediately recognized him though he was not in the bright colours of his photograph his uniform was dishevelled and caked with mud a tear in the sleeve he had his revolver and carried a steel helmet instead of his kepi he was pale faced haggard with several days growth of beard madame and the professor leapt to embrace him both weeping as we recovered from the surprise i tugged elizabeths sleeve but the parents insisted on introducing us saying we should stay we would have a party the son sprawled at the table while madame fussed with the maids to prepare him a meal meanwhile he cut segments of a large brie cheese lying in its mattress of straw gobbling them in his fingers and gulping down a bottle of burgundy professor piйry asked mais ton rйgiment ii est actuellement а paris in reply the lieutenant snapped his fingers mon regiment cest fini kaput the professor looked amazed alarmed and then horrified jeanbaptiste stared at elizabeth and myself and said bleakly in english you imagine ive run away i suppose i could hardly have done so even if id had the inclination i had no regiment to run away from to put it more explicitly my regiment had run away from me bien sыr the whole division had run away we left our artillery stores ammunition petrol everything the men threw their rifles in the ditches and set off for home he cut himself a length of bread digging up a blob of cheese with the crust our english friends look shocked he continued sarcastically had you been at the front yourselves you might have felt more charitable our soldiers didnt fight because they didnt see the point of it the germans were going to walk over us obviously whether they walked over us alive or over us dead was a matter of indifference to them it was also a matter of indifference to the outcome of the war it was not however a matter of indifference to us cest logique hein he had brought the horror of the battle into the room it was rifles against tanks an equation which does not offer much difficulty in the solving their planes were at us all the time messerschmitts strafing us junkers stuka divebombers we never saw a plane of our own he turned a harder look at me nor of the raf monsieur i returned the raf was operating in a different area doubtless the raf was not operating at all your planes were all sitting at home churchill would not send so much as a squadron to save us do you know why i am sitting here now instead of fighting honourably with my comrades he asked angrily because you english have run away faster than us we were expecting you to attack the enemy with us in flanders but lord gort marched his troops in the opposite direction and when they got to the sea the french had to hold off the enemy while the british embarked for home i just dont believe that objected elizabeth sharply you may not like to mademoiselle but that is the truth the british soldiers were taken aboard the ships the poilus left on the beaches kept there by the muzzles of british rifles the poor boy is distressed said the professor that must be untrue i insisted though it was not entirely untrue the welsh guards fixed bayonets against french soldiers scrambling towards british boats jeanbaptiste shrugged he said quietly we shall see after the war if any of us are left alive during this episode i was aware of the telephone shrilling in the hall as everyone in the house was too distracted to notice elizabeth slipped out to answer it she came back saying it was a madame chalmer wishing to speak to me urgently that was the name i had found from the concierge in the rue des brouettes of lamartines mistress the story of madame brigitte chalmars life was singularly uninteresting particularly when recounted in german and the french which elizabeth translated for me while driving early on the next morning of tuesday june we had picked her up near the bois de boulogne at porte dauphine mйtro station at the end of her line from clichy madame chalmar wore a smart flowerpatterned cotton dress silk stockings a widebrimmed hat and white gloves embellished by an umbrella a hat box and a bulging suitcase secured with a length of rope lamartine was at tours and she promised that she would face me with him in return for being taken safely from paris i was in hamburg and berlin after i had finished at the sorbonne she explained in german sitting in the back of the small car i was perfectly disgusted with the nazis so i wrote about them for such intelligent periodicals as la libertй in the end the gestapo expelled me that was before i married monsieur chalmar but of course the nazis would soon find me if ever they installed themselves in sight of the arc de triomphe if you are running a police state you develop a skill in keeping files on absolutely everybody my husband was a nincompoop she continued with the calm severity a frenchwoman can apply to men then i met dr lamartine who was of quite different character an intellectual a man i could talk to of course his views on the nazis are not mine but perhaps he is more sophisticated he sees how you must keep strict order in a country these days to have any order at all look at all the strikes and riots weve had in france henri always thought a dose of hitler would have done the french a lot of good and perhaps he was right vous permettez mademoiselle she took a packet of weekend from her large and shabby brown handbag henri was saying things like that at the time of the popular front and leon blum when everyone in france with a little money put by was far more frightened of the communists than of hitler i assure you in those elections of lйon blum was beaten up and spent the campaign in hospital but he won though everyone continued to go on strike nevertheless of course now i only write articles for the womens magazines ive changed its only natural a girl calms down and becomes a serene woman otherwise she would tire a man out in a fortnight nest ce pas and that swine lamartine has left me in the lurch she added with abrupt sourness he doesnt care if i end up on luneberg heath in a concentration camp she removed her broadbrimmed hat and fanned herself with it ah cest effroyable cette vague de chaleur but its preferable to the trains which are unbelievably crowded they were even more crowded the following week when crammed expresses whisked thousands of parisians from under the nose of von kьchlers th army with an efficiency commendable to the societй des chemins de fer nationale after the french government had fled down the same route nationale ten we were then negotiating our successors on the road were less fortunate it became choked to immobility with men women and children the sick the old the pregnant frenchmen foreigners who had once already escaped hitlers clutch all pouring from paris by car lorry bicycle on foot with barrows carts or perambulators without provision without destination we could still buy petrol though elizabeth had prudently stowed cans in the boot when a week later vehicles ran dry of fuel or crawled and boiled to a halt they were pushed by their desperately impatient followers into the ditch girls prostituted themselves in barns for food and the peasants sold water at a franc a bottle everyone then was illtempered frightened and crying the luftwaffe bombed the crossroads and strafed the unending pathetic columns as they wished every now and then police motorcyclists ploughed the way for a column of black limousines with horns blaring as officials raced for safety faster than the people they had left without it our traffic was already heavy and seemed to increase as we went along all the cars with luggage and bundles piled on the roofs several bearing belgian number plates at chartres the traffic was jammed right through the town everyone pounding their horn buttons in anguished impotence a gendarme slowly worked his way along examining all travellers papers jai mal а la tкte madame chalmar informed him bad temperedly through the window je suis а lagonie cest la guerre madame outside vendфme there was an airraid warning another gendarme on a bicycle blowing his whistle and waving at us furiously should we get in the ditch asked elizabeth halfheartedly coming to a halt far too dirty theyre always false alarms anyway je meurs de mort naturelle asserted madame chalmar holding her head resignedly tours is like a filleted fish its backbone filled the long straight rue nationale from which run short sidestreets it is only miles from paris but it took us twelve hours before we crawled in the unending line of traffic over the pont wilson which crossed the loire at its head madame chalmars excitement seemed to have expelled her headache and sensations of impending death she directed us to the house of her friend monsieur perronet a lawyer her informant of lamartines whereabouts we found him a fat affable gingery man with a puddingfaced amiable wife who at once offered to put us up he seemed still an enthusiast for the british or at least expressed no hostility or perhaps he was like the good soldier schweik with a placid nature proof against the cruel vicissitudes of europe lamartine had been in tours a week he assured madame chalmer staying at a small hotel behind the station he had come to perronet toucher un chиque i had the strong impression that the lawyer disliked him i wanted to beard the doctor there and then but madame chalmer declared herself prostrate elizabeth and myself were worn out and took the excuse to postpone an embarrassing confrontation we had planned to spend one night in tours before driving due north to cherbourg i felt no urgency the germans were no longer attacking but consolidating their front along the somme they were likely to be in the same place at christmas i certainly could not conceive their tanks shortly racing for the pyrenees with the speed of peacetime touring cars elizabeth and i shared the best spare bedroom which was full of massive oldfashioned furniture its curtains faded sharply where they had caught the sun and as inhospitable as a museum the sheets are damp said elizabeth as she got into bed there was an airraid warning during the night monsieur perronet banged on the door in agitation but we preferred to stay where we were we lay holding each other tight in the particularly intense blackness of french shutters that fleeing lieutenant last night she said when we had left that morning jeanbaptiste was still asleep do you suppose hell be shot as a deserter the french cant shoot half their army he didnt like us a bit did he the french think that we got them into the war they hadnt the guts to get themselves into it you know what the german propaganda leaflets make of the situationengland will fight to the last frenchman i suppose people will believe anything if its repeated often enough elizabeth decided even that bovril prevents that sinking feeling and skegness is so bracing newspaper readers can be divided into three groups i quoted those who believe everything those who believe nothing and those who examine everything critically the first group is by far the largest the third regards all journalists as rascals what nasty cynic said that hitler in mein kampf would you have imagined five years ago that we should be lying in bed in the middle of a french provincial town discussing the psychology of the masses would you have imagined five years ago that youd have taken my virginity thats putting it a little far isnt it its the principle of the thing five years ago i was the butlers boy its very strange darling to think that im in bed with the father of my housemaids baby was that remark necessary we had become aware of the drone of a plane we heard in the distance the unmistakable crump of bombs five counted elizabeth do you think hes carrying a round halfdozen no ackack fire i observed all the ackack guns are in the maginot line we lay silent both wondering in secret fear if the plane would turn towards us but it droned away like an irritating wasp will you promise me something elizabeth is there anything left she asked in a simple voice that youll never again treat me with that awful brightyoungthing manner that was my defence if id treated intensely any single one of the men who were after me then i should have found myself in love and desperately miserable because i felt bound to rebuff all the others im very sйrieuse you know i was the only one of your adoring little circle who did know that all along and if i had taken them all seriously i should have won the reputation of a nymphomaniac which would only have aggravated the problem i thought you were falling in love with archie oh archie good heavens no hes not nearly intelligent enough im assuming youre in love with me only assuming isnt that a rather indelicateeven an insultingremark in the circumstances i held her tighter your mother wouldnt approve of it nor your father i think either he isnt my father she said bluntly it was the first time she had mentioned this do you ever see your daughter never shes evacuated somewhere safely i suppose i could have kept in touch with mrs packer but i wanted to pretend the whole episode hadnt happened people at oxford think im a donnish bachelor she snuggled closer to me ill come to oxford darling just as soon as im given leave oxford looks lovely just now the all clear blew i wonder who got the sixth bomb asked elizabeth sleepily when we came downstairs in the morning the tsf was playing loudly in the salon maurice chevalier was singing ma pomme followed by advertisements for coffee hair tonic cream cheese and brassiиres ssh said madame perronet leaning close to the set finger to lips ici radio paris i could not understand the news bulletin but madame perronets expression served well enough at four oclock on that morning of wednesday june the germans had attacked with a vast flash of artillery from the mouth of the somme to where the river aisne met the river ailette miles away near reims les allemands on mis la balle en jeu she said grimly shrugging her plump shoulders i suppose we are going to get home all right remarked elizabeth well get back from somewhere even if its from st nazaire i told her confidently the whole of france cant simply collapse in front of the nazis madame chalmar was so devastated after yesterdays drive that she had to eat breakfast in bed she appeared about nine dressed as though going on her honeymoon she wore a small close hat with a feather a low cut green silk dress silk stockings and shoes with very high heels she still had her white gloves and umbrella she was brightly made up and the vivacity of her smile indicated full recovery from her exhaustion as she started on foot for lamartines hotel chattering feverishly to elizabeth and myself it dawned on me that she expected to find him there with another woman with luck in bed the rival would have to look pretty good that morning to bear comparison the small hotel was like so many in france an indistinguishable slice of a streetlong block of tall shuttered stone buildings in the hall a harassed porter in a yellowandblack striped waistcoat with alpaca sleeves guarded a bank of pigeonholes with dangling brass keys he was arguing fiercely with half a dozen travelworn men and women standing amid cheap suitcases and bundles desperate for a roof madame chalmar asked in a sweet social voice dr lamartine sil sous plaоt to which the porter shouted distractedly numero trentecinq we all three crammed into the rickety creeping latticesided lift lamartine responded to our knock at once he must have been expecting someone he was in trousers braces and a white shirt without its collar a towel round his neck and flecks of lather on his cheeks he stared blankly at us madame chalmar broke into sobs we held a confused conversation in french and english commendably recovering himself lamartine embraced madame chalmar whose carefully prepared face now had red blotches with the mascara starting to run he agreed to see me alone in half an hours time at the cafe next door he appeared punctually sitting down with an affable businesslike air as though we were still in oxford youve had some difficulty in finding me mr elgar he apologized well ive permitted myself some rather irregular behaviour when a man sees a risk to his life he becomes impatient with the influences which normally direct his movements i felt this excuse inadequate for my trouble but why should your life be in danger the lives of all frenchmen are in danger the germans must have thrown divisions into their attack this morning weygand has at the most ive good contacts in the war ministry and that leaves out of the calculations the nazi air force france is finished my friend we shall be asking for an armistice before summer is out he turned to order some coffee i suspected him of playing the alarmist for his own ends but even the nazis dont kill their beaten enemies i should have expected you of all englishmen to be realistic about the nazis my particular speciality would hardly endear me to them they know all about me i can be quite confident of that they know all about you too im equally sure i advise you and your young miss to get out of france before they come and arrest you this gave me a horribly sickly feeling though i doubt if they would shoot me out of hand he continued calmly the germans would want my knowledge and the ss would be only too happy to extract it from me i certainly couldnt guarantee sitting here in the sunshine that i would never give in to threats i knew were far from empty that i would never collaborate with the germans to produce bacterial weapons for use against you british and the russians the russians but nobody attacks his own allies the cup of black coffee appeared lamartine tore the paper off his cube of sugar wait and see as you say in england youve read mein kampf i believe hitler said then that an alliance with russia would be the end of germany if he has changed his mind since he wrote it he has certainly changed his mind about nothing else and the steppes of russia always have had an irresistible fascination for european conquerors but of course no sane man waits to be faced with the tormenting choice between his own painful death and treating with the enemy he continued more reflectively therefore i am shortly going to marseilles and then to africa i have friends organizing my arrangements i am speaking to you in the greatest confidence mr elgar i still hold a commission in the army i had never known this so i could be shot for desertion life is very difficult you havent asked why i put myself in such danger to follow you here brigitte said you wanted the papers given me by professor florey he jerked his head towards the hotel where elizabeth and i had left madame chalmer alone with him i destroyed them before leaving paris all i have is up here he tapped his forehead but have you the mould i insisted we simply cant give the germans a chance to develop it floreys penicillin is highly experimental but theres at least a likelihood that in a few years timeif the wars still going onit could be used on casualties i saw its possibilities at once lamartine said quietly well where is it i asked brusquely in a safe place not safe from the germans though he drained his shallow cup of coffee ill be frank with you cher confrиre in my desperation i had been looking upon that mould as my saviour with the germans i thought as much i was unable to keep disgust from my voice if youre prepared to hand over your bacteriological knowledge to the germans you might at least give the penicillin back to frances own allies he lit a weekend you can save your indignation i told you everything is changed i shall soon be across the mediterranean perhaps tomorrow night you shall have your precious mould i did not trust him i want it now this very morning i insisted we too must be on our way urgently you just said as much yourself it will take a little time to recover i shall have to use my car and my precious petrol a day will make no difference he gave a slight smile hitler is hardly in that hurry meet me at my hotel nine oclock tomorrow morning now i must hurry back to look after brigitte she is unhappily suffering from une crise de nerfs we spent not one night in tours but six madame chalmars crise de nerfs evaporated rapidly during the afternoon she called at the perronets for her luggage to move into the hotel with lamartine i dont really need my heavy clothes she informed me archly in german this winter well be sitting where its hot and safe i appeared at the hotel at nine the next morning in response to the porters telephone call madame chalmar came downstairs still radiant and overdressed henri says will you please come back tomorrow she announced in german dropping her voice to a whisper in the crowded lobby he has had to leave for the day on urgent business connected with our departure tomorrow i exclaimed impatiently but weve got to get back to england while the goings good ssh she laid a hand with long scarlet nails on my arm it doesnt do to be heard speaking german we could be taken for spies and lynched on the spot therere nazis everywhere you know how the wireless keeps warning us about the fifth column how do you suppose the german tanks would have got so far if there hadnt been plenty of agents to stop the bridges being blown up elizabeth asked when i got back do you think we should give up the idea of this beastly mould to be perfectly clearheaded i should be more use for the rest of the war in oxford than the mould would be we can hang on for another day or two i suppose she said sulkily i think we must i just hate the idea of lamartine and his awful girlfriend getting away with anything during the next two days madame chalmar reappeared several times at the perronets she was always smiling always calm always explaining that henri was occupied with urgent business that she would quite certainly bring the mould within twentyfour hours i had the depressing feeling that the safety of elizabeth and myself depended on the domestic arrangements of lamartine and his mistress its always me who runs his life she explained serenely henri is far too intellectual for practical affairs he has learned to do absolutely everything i tell him the germans were then attacking violently in the champagne area east of paris and general rommel had reached the seine south of rouenbut this time the bridges were blown up under his nose le bourget aerodrome was repeatedly bombed and tours was full of rumours that the government were leaving for the chвteaux of the loire i hope the chвteaux are on the telephone said elizabeth morosely but general weygand was full of confidence my orders are still for every man to fight without thought of retreat he declared the enemy will soon reach the end of his tether we are on the last lap tenez on the sunday morning the germans were in soissons miles from paris we decided to go mould or not we would make for st nazaire cherbourg being uncomfortably near the battle the germans already had their hands on dieppe incredibly i had sailed into it with perfect safety only a fortnight before we shared the feeling of everyone else in francewhen hitlers fingertips brush the nape of your neck you jump from the nearest window we went to the hotel in a last speculative unconfident chance of catching lamartine para snapped the porter in the striped waistcoat when elizabeth asked where he swore at her and said inconnu as he turned to defend himself against newcomers imploring accommodation elizabeth calmly reached across for the key of number the room was a mess and smelt of shaving soap face powder and feet there were newspapers everywhere full ashtrays an empty cognac bottle strands of madame chalmars blonde hair decorated the pillow of an unmade double bed our search revealed a forgotten jar of cotys face cream and a centime piece with a hole in the middle which i still have i suppose theyve bolted for marseilles said elizabeth as we stared at one another dourly well have to follow them wed never find them we could ask at the shipping offices really jim theyre not booking a mediterranean cruise i noticed a scrap of paper on the floor by the commode which bore on its cracked marble top the ancient decorative telephone in its spindly cradle pencilled in writing which i recognized as lamartines was bordeaux of course the number could be one of his relatives or another doctor or another girlfriend i suggested but surely its worth ringing just to find out well have to go a little carefully darling with everyone utterly hysterical about spies and even in peacetime the telephone system was not one of the glories of france we tried telephoning bordeaux from the perronets there was a six hour delay i think we should go to bordeaux decided elizabeth after listening to the news bulletin on the tsf the further we are from the front the better our chance of getting home all in one piece our bordeaux call came through madame at the other end announced herself to elizabeth as the hotel davignon elizabeth asked for lamartine no the doctor and his wife had not yet arrived elizabeth slammed the telephone back on its stand triumphantly we decided to start early the following morning a mile drive without headlights along a route nationale ten choked with traffic daunting even elizabeth during our next days crawling passage past garages chalked pas dessence mussolini announced from his usual perch in the palazzo venezia in rome that italy had declared war against the plutocratic and reactionary democracies of the west and the french government announced it was leaving paris for tours at midnight monsieur reynard and general de gaulle were sharing the same car to quit paris by the porte de chвtillon on their heels came several million of their fellow parisians elizabeth and i were somewhere between poitiers and angoulкme a hundred miles from bordeaux and the car had broken down we pushed the car on the verge between the poplars with a press of cars lorries carts bicycles and walkers in the darkness on the cobbles behind us the torrent which burst from paris forced trickles along every country road in france even those reserved as strategic highways by the army we decided to spend the night in the back huddled under elizabeths khaki greatcoat she discovered a monthold times and insisted on doing the crossword in the light of a torch about seven in the morning an army lorry came hooting importantly upon us elizabeth leapt into the road a pretty girl in a british uniform was sufficient to bring any military driver to a halt our only possessions in our pockets we were dumped at angoulкme station there were still trains to bordeaux all arriving crammed from paris then we shall have to travel on the buffers said elizabeth and i was not confident that she was joking we climbed on the train about one in the morning of wednesday june jammed rigid in an unlit corridor the engine puffed away from the station purposefully enough but soon halted with screeching brakes in the black countryside i do so want to leave the room complained elizabeth i thought of lamartine cosily in bed with madame chalmar we crossed the river dordogne about six in the morning and were shortly tipped relievedly into the bordeaux railway terminus against the banks of the garonne elizabeth and i had been almost isolated from news for two days though the train was crawling with unpleasant rumours like a beleaguered trench with lice we heard that the germans had already smashed into pariswhich was untrue for a couple of days and that mr churchill was in francehe was flown to briare on the river loire escorted by a squadron of hurricanes to tell the french government at the chвteau de muguet firmly even fiercely that the raf stayed on its airfields behind british coasts lamartines hotel davignon was between the famous esplanade des quinconces leading down to the river and the jardin public it was much like the hotel he had fled we arrived there about half past eight the woman in black behind the reception desk telephoned my name said daccord into the instrument and told us to go up lamartine was fully dressed waiting in the open doorway of his bedroom with a short bow he invited us inside it was larger than his last with coffeecoloured wallpaper and a big brass bed madame chalmar was sitting in the only chair upright attired as if about to grace some fashionable social function would you mind sitting on the bed invited lamartine lighting a weekend there would appear to be nowhere else why didnt you give me that penicillin mould at tours i demanded i was angry though biochemists are peaceable beings and i have the most placid of temperaments for which my wife continually expresses gratitude i would not seem very respectful of your intelligence mr elgar if i did not tell you bluntly that i have no intention of giving what you want madame chalmar sat looking closely at her scarlet nails you are going to give me that penicillin i was surprised to hear myself shouting mr elgar i must ask you to take a more compassionate view my situation has changed since i talked to you last wednesday in tours the situation of france has changed then i was pretty certain that brigitte and i had a clear run to algiers mussolini coming into the war rather upset thewhat do you upset in english shaw used it in a play apple cart said elizabeth exactly so i shall stay here with the famous mould mr elgar you would not leave me defenceless against the gestapo thats not very amiable of you elizabeth broke in we know youre mixed up with the croix de feu you can hardly wait until the germans appear to give them your loot theyll probably pin a medal on you i hope that mademoiselle is being more fanciful than offensive this remark incited me to grab him by the lapels give me that penicillin take away your hands this is no way to treat a colleague i shook him i had never been so furious with anyone in my life before apart from elizabeths mother merdehe snatched himself away madame chalmar gave a scream quickly choked lamartine produced from his armpit a small black automatic pistol pointing it alternately at elizabeth and myself that is certainly no way to treat a colleague i told him i was frightened the experience accepted without undue consternation in films and television is in reality utterly demoralizing it was horrifying to feel my life within a twitch of lamartines finger keep away from me he said his voice shaky i should not have expected a professional man to carry firearms i returned somewhat primly these are abnormal times jim stay where you are dont do anything dont move came elizabeths voice my brain resumed functioning you dont seem to think highly of your own neck lamartine if you shoot us youll be arrested by the nearest gendarme youd be guillotined the germans will be here long before the necessary legal processes could be completed the germans would hardly encourage frenchmen to be murderers you may safely leave the germans to me mr elgar he was still pointing the pistol it struck me that he was in fact a german spy or at least in their pay then to my relief he tucked the gun back in its holster i have made my point i believe you see that i am prepared to use bullets to protect my possessions now will you please leave us in peace i looked at elizabeth she was white but seemed as composed as usual i shall tell this tale when im back in london i said to lamartine the war cant go on for ever youll have some very nasty questions to answer at the end of it take my word for that je men fiche de cela he stubbed out his weekend and opened the packet for another if you have second thoughts you can get hold of me through the british consul if you give me back the mould ill keep quiet about whats happened in this room i promise that it is a great disadvantage of you english that unlike we french you can never see when you are beaten you are simply not realists he struck a match madame chalmar still sat staring in fright fingertips to lips hand in hand elizabeth and i escaped darling you were utterly wonderful you handled him perfectly she said hes not dangerous hes only frightened i said modestly everyones frightened just look round you we decided to make straight for the british consulate bordeaux was full of rootless people as paris had been the week before the streets were jammed with newly arrived cars in which the occupants had no choice but to sleep and live the cafйs were all crammed the food shops all sold out the consulate lobby was full of british civilians in the same plight as ourselves the weather had become oppressive and everyone strained to curb their temper there was no official in sight but from the conversation the chances of a boat home were slim we spent an hour leaning against the wall holding hands discussing the chances of being locked in the same cell with lamartine and madame chalmar then a voice came unexpectedly i sayelizabeth tiplady i turned to find a young pinkfaced man with the zigzag braid of a royal navy volunteer reserve lieutenant why its hugo she exclaimed the uniform suits you how sweet what on earth are you doing in france i was posted to the british hospital in paris really that must have been no end of fun until the balloon went up yes it was awfully then why have you come to bordeaux im trying to get home but what about your unit i seem rather to have lost it do you suppose im a deserter he laughed i say old thing can you do anything about a ship elizabeth asked under the shiny forged steel of this conversation which might have occurred in gunters tea room in mayfair i could detect her nervousness well im in a destroyer which is sailing tonight i expect i could get you aboard her oh super hows sir edward he seems very well jim this is hugo mottram dont you remember i was going out with him when you wanted to take me to the theatre hugo this is jim elgar whos coming to england with me sorry elizabeth the navy cant transport civilians dont be ridiculous hugo you cant fuss over red tape with the germans likely to come round the corner any minute kings regulations are hardly red tape anyway jim isnt a civilian hes a chemist on vital war work and were engaged to be married hugo stared hard at my crumpled styleless clothes my grubby semistiff collar my dusty shoes and grimy stubbly face i still had my umbrella which had become tattered im so pleased hugo said limply did you mean that i asked as he disappeared amid the crowd do you suppose id say anything as serious as that on the spur of the moment over this past fortnight ive simply assumed it to be the case i leant to kiss her darling please im in uniform shortly afterwards one of the consular staff appeared to announce that we should both be taken off that night and advised us to stay in the building for further orders our relief at this news rendered a day sustained by cups of tea and four squares of motoring chocolate perfectly tolerable i was too tired and uncomfortable to express elation at elizabeths admission i was dejected at leaving france like the british army in frustration and defeat but i was overwhelmingly comforted at the prospect of the pair of us reaching english soil the uboats and luftwaffe permitting about four in the afternoon i was amazed to see madame chalmar appear carrying a bulky foolscap envelope elizabeth translated for me excitedly she says the doctor is neither a fascist nor a traitor just very stupid in the practical affairs of life he should never have acquired a revolver hes never fired one in his life he doesnt even know how to reload it i did not believe this but asked quickly shes got the penicillin from her large handbag madame chalmar produced the flask i had last seen in floreys room at oxford i noticed at once that the mould was still alive the germans could simply have seeded out fragments and grown as much as they liked how awfully uninteresting it looks said elizabeth in disappointment we all shook hands madame chalmar said as she left enchantйe monsieur as though breaking up a party how did she manage to get it out of him i asked elizabeth looking at the flask unbelievingly she said she shamed him into it i always thought she wore the trousers in that mйnage lamartine is a weak character isnt he utterly puny you could tell that by all his lies when hed no intention whatever of giving you the stuff back even so she was forcing him to disgorge something which might have saved both their lives surely darling you know that women who suffer terrible crises de nerfs over trivialities can be absolutely indomitable over fundamentals i took floreys papers outside and burnt them on the pavement the passersby took no notice people were up to all manner of odd things in bordeaux during those few days i was desperate to destroy the mould completely as quickly as possible and without trace when i got back to the consulate elizabeth was pink faced and swallowing hard her khaki handkerchief to her lips ive eaten it she announced like a good spy with a secret message the broth stuff and all it tasted utterly horrible you said it was quite harmless darling didnt you our passage of miles was stretched by detours into two and a half days the weather broke for the first time since the sun warmed the armour of hitlers tanks as it rose on the morning of may behind us in france prime minister paul reynaud implored president roosevelt to declare war on hitler but without success so he resigned in favour of marshal pйtain we disembarked in plymouth on the sunday afternoon of june we went to a big hotel for tea sitting among the plants with elderly couples impassively reading their sunday papers while eating fingers of buttered toast and cress sandwiches and complaining about the shortage of sugar about seventhirty the following morning we stood under the clock at paddington station in london suddenly shocked that we should be torn from one another you do mean it i asked her timorously once again you dont surely imagine i should have abandoned myself like that in france if i hadnt already decided to marry you she said this in a hurt voice i told you jim darling im sйrieuse she promised to come to oxford as soon as she could though i shall probably get into the most frightful hot water about losing that car the red buses traversed piccadilly circus with an air of elephantine security policemen as stolid as suet puddings in uniform halted them for the march of men in bowlers armed with umbrellas the cinemas were opening for the afternoon performance and st jamess church was advertising its next sundays preacher the evening papers announced that the french were suing for an armistice a french delegation was escorted by general kurt von tippelskirch to the clearing in the forest of compiиgne where foch had dictated his terms in november they found hitler sitting in the same railway coach shifted by german army engineers to the same position on the rusty tracks such petty details made the nazis so frightening like sending domagks letter for posting in wuppertal i did not see my fiancйe for a month i reconciled myself that separations are the saddest undertones of war then elizabeth wrote from her transport depot near norwich that she was bored to death and would be coming to oxford on the saturday of july by the midday train it was awfully tedious but she couldnt spend the night the german jackboots which had trampled over france now seemed likely to crunch upon english shingle but the luftwaffe which had smashed or scared from the sky the air forces of six nations and paralysed european statesmen for five years was for the first time tasting a wellmounted and welldirected adversary in the spitfires and hurricanes which churchill had refused the dying prayers of the french i was working day and night developing murderous germs to spatter any invading nazis who themselves seemed the most pernicious bacilli on earth the technical details were exasperating you can turn loose wild germs as you can turn loose a wild dog but you cannot guarantee they will bite only the right persons the morning of elizabeths visit i fell in with florey as he was walking across the treedotted parks in sight of the jubilantly tractarian red brick of keble college he always walked to the dunn labs from his home in parks road if the germans do get as far as oxford which god forbid he said sombrely well destroy everything to do with penicillin in the department except just enough mould to smear on our jacket linings a few of us might escape to carry on the good work escape to where thats the question perhaps to canada ive heard that the fleet and the king and queen are ready to go there in the last resort floreys face lightened under the curly brim of his trilby as he began to talk about his successful experiment with mice during the week of dunkirk it was really most conclusive i used eight mice and you wouldnt have imagined that the ones injected with penicillin had ever been infected our untreated controls all died within twelve hours the problem now is production weve only enough penicillin for another twentyfive mice and when i ask the big drug manufacturers for help they explain theyre busy on war work its most infuriating whats the chance of being able to use penicillin on humans one day the step from mouse to man is a big one florey said warily literallya man is three thousand times mousesized at this rate i dont know when wed ever have our hands on enough to treat a single case have you written your work up yet theres a short preliminary paper appearing in the lancet next month i missed at the time the significance of this casual exchange we had reached the gate leading from the parks to the rear of floreys pathology department would you like a look at the national penicillin factory he invited ive ten minutes before lecturing the medical students still have to be taught and the rest of my time seems to be absorbed filling in forms he led me to a smaller building against the main laboratories the animal house florey explained were making use of its post mortem room it was small and filled by an extraordinary apparatus the height of a man in the middle four large upturned bottles on the top were connected by rubber tubes and glass pipes to half a dozen smaller ones below the whole cased in an openfronted stand of polished mahogany it resembled one of the preposterously logical drawings of heath robinsonsperhaps a machine for getting quarts into pint pots its the brain child of my ingenious young assistant norman heatley florey explained how it worked we suck out the brothwhich of course has all the penicillin juice in itfrom under the growing mould replacing it with a fresh supply you can do that a dozen times the mould doesnt seem to mind then we cool the broth with ice acidify it with phosphoric acid and let it drip from those inverted lemonade bottles on top through the glass columns of amyl acetate thats a good solvent for penicillin our final result is a few grains of brown powder an electric bell rang and a light flashed on a makeshift panel to the right of the machine one of the lemonade bottles needs replenishing observed florey mildly thats a beautiful piece of woodwork yes its one of the shelves from the bodleian library i asked him if he was still growing the mould on flemings original nutriment of meat broth we tried all manner of chemicals to increase the yield florey told me glucose glycerol thioglycolic acid in the end we found brewers yeast did the trick then we needed something bigger than the ordinary lab flask for growing the fell of mould but fortunately the right sort of receptacle was in good supply and near at hand pie dishes i guessed no bedpans he gave his slight smile its very improvised isnt it and very british it was largely improvisation from one end of the country to the other which that summer of saved our skins elizabeths train was as usual half an hour late she was in uniform running down the platform like a schoolgirl darling jim how wonderful how absolutely wizard id almost forgotten what you looked like i really must see round the colleges christ church and balliol and places id never been to oxford in my life the colleges are full of civil servants who were evacuated from london with the children and expectant mothers and the river i must see the river do you suppose we can still hire a punt i expect so stands the church clock at ten to three and is there honey still for tea that was cambridge we went to a pub there was only beer and sloe gin to drink we sat at a table in a dark beamed nook did you get courtmartialled or anything about the car i asked what car the one we abandoned at angoulкme oh that the whole french adventure seems just like a dream to me now doesnt it to you do you suppose theyve got any cigarettes it really did bring the war home to me not being able to buy a packet of fags when i felt like it i returned from the bar with ten woodbines elizabeth was slightly pink and staring straight ahead of her jim darling i was intending to be ever so flippant and stupid and pass off everything in france as a trivial joke which of course neither of us could possibly be expected to take seriously she paused she continued in a crushed voice but i cant it couldnt possibly be a joke to you i know it doesnt look very funny to me however hard i try i had already suspected her cursing herself as a bigger fool for giving me her hand after giving me her body are those your own feelings or are your mother and your father behind it she shook her head vigorously but i insisted im still the butlers boy god i exclaimed with hitler just across the channel nothing in this country is quite so indestructible as its snobbery well go down with the ermine ensign fluttering bravely on our stern jim its nothing to do with that i cant marry you because im going to marry archie archie i sat bolt upright almost cracking my head on a beam but you cant possibly marry archie i can she said meekly but archies a fool hes a very intelligent writer that doesnt make him more intelligent than i am you told me so yourself she made no reply but performed the extravagantly wasteful gesture of stubbing out her halfsmoked cigarette well im going to marry him and thats that she concluded in a matteroffact voice im sorry jim thats absolutely all i can say isnt it its his title i suppose it helps she answered frankly there was a long silence well if you love archie i do i do she said quietly ever since you first introduced him i think and if youve arranged to marry him soon now hes likely to be posted overseas any minute overseas theres nowhere left to go its terribly secret somewhere hot then theres nothing whatever i can do about it is there she laid a hand on the arm of my tweed jacket darling jim i knew youd understand i have never heard words uttered with more intense relief i was invited to the wedding i decided that my absence would afford archie more gratification than my presence embarrassment we gathered together in the sight of god in st giles belgrave square on the saturday of september it was an unhappy choice of weddingday hermann gцring had failed by a hairs breadth to eliminate the fighter stations amid the fair fields of kent and lost of his aircraft to the hurricanes and spitfires the previous week the feared stuka divebomber was a flop needing ten thousand feet of clear visibility with which the skies of britain were not generous gцring had not planned the luftwaffe for night bombing but to work with the army as the tanks came rolling over the rubble so he sent his heinkel dornier and junker bombers with swarms of protective messerschmitts to attack london in broad daylight the airraid warning sounded after a whispered discussion with the happy couple at the altar the vicar announced in canonical tones that the ceremony would continue archie declared that he would have elizabeth as his wedded wife the vicar asked her wilt thou have this man and a stick of bombs fell nearby i thought right on buckingham palace we shall adjourn to the crypt he said hastily in the stonevaulted crypt with sir edward and lady tiplady and a hundred people i did not know i found myself on a bench against the wall next to archie with elizabeth he was still a sergeant in the brigade of guards i honestly didnt expect you to come he said to me sounding offended leaning away from elizabeth he added in a lower voice im sorry about all this do you think we should shake hands like gentlemen no no not now he said in alarm another bomb fell i suppose this old church is safe youre not afraid are you of course i am im not then i congratulate you on your courage its not a matter of courage i dont care any longer if i die the reception was in a restaurant in sloane square there was an iced cake and champagne sir edward talked archly to me about fungi lady tip pointedly avoided me it came time for the happy pair to leave there was a hired limousine even confetti at the door i found myself in a knot of guests and relatives close to elizabeth she looked up at me with bright eyes it was because of the butlers boy she whispered im telling you that because its cruel but not nearly as cruel asas the other jim darling i love you they left for llandudno that was elizabeth my own wedding day was wednesday february i realized that i was getting on i had turned thirty in the new year we had only a few airraids on oxford but the previous summer after elizabeth had thrown me over we were taking the warnings seriously enough to troop down to the lodginghouse cellar at night in such informal halfdressed intimacy i made the acquaintance of jean she was a medical registrar at the radcliffe infirmary like david mellors she had qualified in scotland she was slim and sandy with delicate skin and freckles she had blue eyes and wore tweed skirts with a silver thistle brooch on her blouse she radiated homely comfort like prewar mr therm of the gas light and coke company how did you come to meet sir edward tiplady she asked we were engaged we were walking through the grounds of the radcliffe infirmary one of the most beautiful places to lie sick in it was built in the eighteenth century with a bequest from dr john radcliffe and a little on the side from the duke of marlborough you could still recognize the original country infirmary of thirty beds one operating theatre and its own beerhouse in the grey stone georgian building facing a quad with a chapel like a college during the war lord nuffield from cowley was following the duke of marlborough from blenheim by pouring his profits from motorizing the nation into its wards jean and i were passing wrens radcliffe observatory built to resemble the athenian temple of the four winds and providing the most charming view from any operating theatre in the world my father was his butler she stared at me why are you so surprised i asked i suppose one never thinks of butlers as having sons somehow she replied flustered i assure you they breed like other mammals she said nothing to this seeing that she had hurt me i added dont worry i was long ago reconciled to the butlers supreme unimportance in the society he moves among i suppose thats a quality he shares with the eunuch it doesnt mean a thing to me honestly she did not see how uncharitable this was im not a snob you know that and anyway nobody in scotland has a butler except the dukes i thought i should mention something i had overlooked by the way i was married once before she made an angry response this is a fine time to tell me im sorry its always rather embarrassing to bring out i was waiting for the right moment but of course right moments never arrive when we were laughing it was too serious and when we were glum it would only have deepened the gloom you seem to take a rather lighthearted view of matrimony it was over six years ago i excused myself it seems longer because the wars broken the perspective what happened to her jean began to recover her temper and enjoy a womanly interest she died jean looked shocked oh im sorry she said apologetically what was it from my wife died in childbirth at the beginning of she was the very first patient leonard colebrook treated for puerperal fever with sulphonamide but it didnt do the trick i had only a few tablets which id smuggled out of germany and when they ran out we just had to watch her die what about the child she survived all right i had her adopted so youve a daughter aged six about the place somewhere yes id never have thought it of you i wondered if she meant this as a compliment what was your wife like she asked inevitably she was rosie the housemaid i see we walked in silence until we reached the hospital rear gate leading to the woodstock toad do you want to call it off i asked oh no i dont suppose it makes any difference we were to marry in the radcliffe infirmary chapel my mother came from budleigh salterton when hitlers wehrmacht had appeared opposite eastbourne my mothers hotel closed down and she went as companion to an old lady in south devon though i had never thought of her as the companionable sort my mother had grown grey wrinkled and more religious than ever for which the war to date had offered much encouragement jeans family seemed all doctors and nurses and looked about them with scots severity david mellors was my best man we both wore hired tail coats the bride was late and david himself hurried into the church only when the organist had started repeating his repertoire where the hell have you been i asked in an angry whisper as he joined me on the front pew sorry i was giving a hand to charles fletcher dr fletcher was working at the radcliffe infirmary as a nuffield research student today hes trying some penicillin for florey on a patient david whispered this was clearly of greater interest to david than my wedding i didnt know florey had enough to treat a case i whispered back he may not have enough boy the patients pretty sick hes a middleaged policeman whos been in for a couple of months already with staphylococcal septicaemia all from a scratch at the angle of his mouth while pruning his rosebushes none of the sulphonamides touched it i suppose not a hope by now hes got abscesses everywhere osteomyelitis of the head of his humerus an abscess perforating his eye so were risking trying penicillin on him by intravenous drip he wouldnt have lasted much longer anyway you mean youre not absolutely certain that penicillin itself is nontoxic to the human the organist paused and changed his tune the congregation was shuffling and coughing fairly certain charles fletcher tried it on a volunteer last monday david informed me still in a whisper there was panic stations over thatshe threw a temperature luckily it turned out the effect of an impurity the organist broke off playing a triumphant chord my bride had arrived we stood up i realized that david had been working with his morning suit under his white coat floreys extracting the excreted penicillin from the patients urine of course he told me every drop helps we have to rush the bottles across to the dunn labs how on the handlebars of my bicycle i had to turn my attention to personal matters the policeman died as rosie had died after five days they ran out of penicillin a fortnight later florey tried again in a boy with an infected leg bone it brought his temperature down to normal my wife told me in the small awkward flat i had taken in north oxford floreys going to concentrate on treating children that shows a nice humanitarian approach oh no they need smaller doses between february and may four more cases of overwhelming infection with the sulphonamidedefying staphylococcus were treated with penicillin at the radcliffe three were children one died he had a brain infection which normally killed swiftly but the post mortem which my wife attended showed that penicillin was killing off the germs the others were cured of infected bones and infected urine so was a labourer with a carbuncle the hospital did not hold its breath and look on admiringly it was a busy place everyone had his own work to do and new drugs were always being tried and forgotten florey and the people in the dunn labs were anyway thought tedious academics curers of mice and guineapigs always an intrusive nuisance among the practical doctors as the forgotten father of the mould i was naturally interested that after years in the lumberroom of science it might after all have a practical useif florey could produce enough of it apart from recovering penicillin from the patients urine every flask and syringe was carefully rinsed while the heath robinson apparatus in the animal house was now complicated with milk churns milk coolers and a discarded domestic bathtub a bronze letterbox comes into the process somewhere florey explained to me when we met one evening in south parks road it was the end of june and the blitz had stoppedthough britain had by then lost more civilian dead than servicemen hitler had turned on his russian allies exactly as lamartine had foreseen ive at last persuaded a little chemical firm in the east end to grow the mould and send up the juice in more milk churns florey imparted were getting to look like prosperous dairy farmers but a single bomb any night could put an end to that contribution florey asked if i had read his penicillin paper in the recent lancet i nodded it was not overinformative florey and chain stated simply that after their work on flemings lysozyme penicillin seemed promising to investigate they described its purification as a stable brown powder its killing various germs in the testtube and more significantly its saving the lives of twentyfive infected mice the lancet had added a short and tepid leading article i suppose you realize that copy of the lancet will be opened in stockholm i could not prevent myself asking the conscientious german intelligence service will snip out your article and in a few days a translation will be sitting on gerhard domagks desk in wuppertal if the gestapo now feel they can trust him perhaps we should have done everything in secrecy but its difficult florey said resignedly wed no encouragement from the government to hush our work up if it comes to that weve had precious little encouragement from the government about anything they seem to have lost all interest since risking your life in france for it i suppose theyve plenty of other things to worry about did publication of your paper produce any result yes flem appeared in oxford i heard hed come up for the day at least hes proved that hes alive we had reached the science library at the top of south parks road florey was going to dine in queens i was going home i asked does flem really think that penicillin has possibilities oh yes he thinks it could oust the sulphonamides thats rather grandiose isnt it florey cautiously made no reply is flem bitter at all over your success with it i think hes envious that ive got chain on my staff here chain discovered how to purify it only after so many chemists had failed raistrick and so on but you know jim if flem really had faith in his discovery in the s hed have nagged the chemists or searched for one with the right trick up his sleeve after all flem wasnt working in some isolated lab in an attic he had all the resources of the inoculation department at st marys at his beck and call dont forget sir almroth wright couldnt stand chemists at any price well wright was getting doddery by then florey said realistically flan would have got his own way if hed pushed hard enough he missed the bus as the late chamberlain said about hitler i hope im not being vain but penicillin would be unknown today if i hadnt decided to reinvestigate it in that delay of ten years was perfectly inexcusable old flem missed the significance of his own paper we parted as i walked home a halfforgotten fact impishly tickled my memory i looked out my signed copy of the british journal of experimental pathology containing flemings paper i read again the list of editors they included h w florey he had missed the significance of flemings paper too the following morning i had a telephone call from ainsley inviting me to dinner at his london club clubland like high table was undaunted by the war he had never before issued a social invitation nor even offered me a drink i wondered what was up ainsleys club in st jamess had the lower floor sandbagged the roof blown off and the front windows replaced by boarding he led me to a small smokingroom in the rear where an oval table stood with glasses and bottles most of the club servants have been called up he grumbled so we help ourselves and sign for it were allowed one whisky a day but a lot of the members cheat particularly the ecclesiastical ones i asked for a glass of chablis thank god the wine committee had more sense than chamberlain in and anticipated a long war he sniffed i could swear thats a cigar someone must have found a box in the cellar we sat down inevitably discussing hitlers invasion of the soviet union did you know that hitler invaded russia on exactly the same day as napoleon ainsley passed a hand over the bald patch of his grey head a characteristic gesture june or obviously plus зa change plus cest la mкme chose applies equally to megalomaniacs do you suppose the russians will hold out everybody was asking this if they can hold out till winter they can hold out for ever but im afraid the wehrmacht will go its usual devastating way still it gives us a useful breathing space and it makes the tediously antiwar daily worker look silly or it would have done if morrison hadnt banned it and what do we do when weve drawn our breath god knows ainsley gloomily sipped his whisky of the day were not a great power any more churchill has to pretend that we are and everyone in the country believes him or has to pretend to believe him because theres no alternative we werent a great power before the war broke out but i dont think even hitler saw that the empire the empire is a bolthole for the fleet thats all what about the americans i was arguing to keep my spirits up like whistling in the dark roosevelts lendlease idea in march was surely a significant gesture not just a business deal to eke out our stock of dollars listen jimthis is very secret churchills meeting roosevelt some time this year i dont know where except itll be somewhere in the states probably boston some sort of grand bland declaration will be named after the venue the pronouncement came in august as the atlantic charter president and prime minister met afloat off newfoundland in placentia bay to have so named their joint statement might have given it an obstetrical ring ainsley glanced sadly at his empty unrefillable whisky glass ill tell you something else secret staff talks were held between us and the americans during last february and march and naturally there are unannounced contacts between various branches of both countries services the upshot for you jim is that lindemann wants you to fly to america for a few weeks on friday the abrupt news of churchills adviser directing me to escape from our beleagured island left me without speech i listened bemusedly while ainsley prosaically explained that i was destined for the small town of warsaw in colorado where there was a counterpart of the fungus institute you must keep this expedition dark even from your wife he added earnestly jean knew i was working with lethal bacteria not fungi but she let patriotism stifle curiosity it must have been the same for the wives of research workers on the atomic bomb how i asked tell her youre going on a months course rockclimbing with the royal marines the better to search for unusual variants of bacteria ainsley stood up looking at his watch wed better eat or therell be nothing left as we made for the diningroom i said so roosevelt doesnt intend to let the british empire disappear off the face of the map on the contrary i think thats precisely his object america will come out of this war as the only country to be reckoned with in the world plus russia if only she can manage to stave off the nazis till november and without america firing a shot if shes clever its much more sensible to step into the ring when all possible challengers have knocked themselves out i could not bring myself to believe this but supposing the japs attack america that would be interesting hitler might well inflict himself on the united states as an ally after all the japanese are hardly aryans are they after this horrifying prospect he speculated i wonder if therell be any meat tonight how remote seem the days when i used to cut all the fat off my roast beef i went to america on the friday i let my wife into the secret i instructed her to pass around that i was on a deepsea diving course with the navy too many of my acquaintances knowing that i had no head for heights an raf car driven by a pretty waaf took me through signpostless england to an airfield near salisbury where a small anson was waiting to fly me to another only when aloft it occurred to me that i had never flown before i could not identify the raf station i arrived at i still cannot today there were a lot of seagulls about i noticed at dusk i climbed with a dozen other civilians into an aeroplane with black paint on the windows someone whispered that we were bound for lisbon if we evaded the cannons of the luftwaffe i thought there was also the possibility of the device in my briefcase disrupting in the lowered atmospheric pressure and infecting us all with bubonic plague beside it lay a testtube of penicillin mould which i had cadged as an afterthought from florey before leaving south parks road we arrived in the early hours we saw a city street lit with lamps we marvelled i had two days in which my stomach enfeebled by british rations collapsed under the weight of peacetime menus like an old lady in a crush on the monday morning i left in a pan american flying boat for new york i found jeffs name everywhere beckerman beer beautifully brewed said the hoardings and electric signs the girl sipping her foaming glass with an ecstasy deserving more worthy stimulus i was to spend two wonderful days in this aladdins cave before travelling to warsaw colorado i telephoned jeffs office i was greeted with an explosion of delight that evening jeff appeared at my small hotel in a chauffeurdriven cadillac with two girls both of whom struck me as far prettier than the ecstatic one in the advertisement the car was stuffed with presentsa case of bourbon boxes of spam and peanut butter whole tinned hams bars of chocolate packets of chewinggum he seemed to think i needed feeding up jeff himself had grown much fatter in the eighteen months since i had seen him in the savoy he had also grown much richer im turning out about a quarter the sulphonamides used in the united states i got new plants opening every threefour months he declared proudly within a couple of minutes of our meeting chemicals textiles pharmaceuticals im operating right across the country even into california thats apart from the old brewery at white plains here in new york state im opening another brewery this fall in wisconsinyou see old man everyone in america just forgot how to make real beer during prohibition i asked about the red crown brewery in wuppertal the nazis grabbed it but they paid for it he exclaimed triumphantly i guess they didnt want to upset the neutrals i hope the raf have now blown it to bits i suggested cordially well it was still there last week despite the raf wuppertals a boom town you know german industry today is stronger than ever were led to believe that german industry is on the point of collapse then you can forget it jeff leant back in the corner of the limousine we were driving along fifth avenue he was dressed with commercial sobriety in a lightweight blue suit and white shirt i reflected that he must have burst out of his savile row wardrobe and noticed that he still wore handmade english shoes he had given up chesterfields but lit a cigar the two girls occupied the jump seats dutifully providing him with an air of adoring incomprehension the nazi economys in better shape than any time since gцring offered germany guns instead of butter jeff reasserted hell theyre getting all the butter they want from france and holland a lot of frenchmen and dutchmen are going to starve to death before the first german feels hungry but dont get me wrong old man unlike almost all my countrymen ive had the doubtful privilege of seeing the nazis close to im one hundred per cent for britain any sane man last summer would have asked hitler for the best terms he could get thank god that churchills insane just like the nazis say therell always be an england said one of the girls even joe kennedy sang a different tune when he came home for the election last fall that was after roosevelt laid hands on him i guess no one will hear of kennedy again once the wars over nor lindbergh im disappointed with lindbergh say did you ever meet the duchess asked the other girl eagerly i looked blank you know mrs simpson i apologized that our paths had not crossed have you got yourself married again jeff asked i nodded so have i but that didnt work out either was it that pretty dark thing in uniform you brought along to the savoy no she married a friend of mine whos been discharged from the army with an ulcer and works for the ministry of information hes one of the people who keep telling us that the german economy is finished why arent you in the british army asked the first girl i thought bluntly flat feet you must be hungry jeff said to me we arrived at a huge restaurant with a loud band exuberant chorus girls and enormous steaks jeff began reminiscing about our night out in cologne our two companions grew bored some time after midnight we shed them i went back to jeffs apartmentluxurious rooms apparently unending high above park avenue take anything you like from the closets he invited even your clothes are rationed now i guess i helped myself to a tie a negro in a white jacket brought highballs through the big window i could look down on the feverish lights of new york we talked about wuppertal and the schwebebahn hitler was crazy shoving domagk in jail jeff commented he should have let the professor go ahead and receive his nobel prize turn out the band when he got home and have goebbels proclaim the magnificent benefits to all mankind hatching from nazi germany thats why nothing nothing at all will ever come out of nazism he added in disgust its a nihilistic creed when the nazis have wiped out everything thats good and decent in the world theyll have nothing to replace it except more oppression when theres no one left alive on earth for them to oppress theyll start cutting one anothers throats for the simple reason that nazism cant exist without aggression imagine hitler snipping the tape to open a new hospital his remark made me remember the testtube in my jacket pocket i had left jeff mystified at the real reason for my mission to colorado and he had swallowed his inquisitiveness what in hells this he turned the testtube in his fingers sprawling in his chair his heavy bar of eyebrow puckered ever heard of penicillin never its a drug produced by that mould jeff did not find it an intriguing exhibit at that hour of the night it hits staphylococci and gas gangrene and diphtheria which arent touched by your sulpha drugs an extremely efficient oxford professor called florey started using penicillin on patients only eighteen months after beginning his experiments to find exactly what it was imagine even henry ford achieving that with the automobile jeff grunted he rolled the testtube round looking more interested i guess churchill knows all about this theyve hardly enough to treat a couple of kids with bloodpoisoning let alone an army they have to grow the mould in bedpans because they cant get anything else they have to extract the penicillin juice with lemonade bottles and milk churns fixed in a lovely bookcase from the bodleian library perhaps penicillin could be our secret weapon but its production is strictly a cottage industry i thought youd be interested to look at it the mould loves nothing better to grow on than brewers yeast brewers yeast you cant get your hands on jeff scratched his chin with his thumb you could grow it on cornsteep liquor i guess i had never heard of this when you crack corn to get the starch jeff explained you steep the grain in sodium sulphate you end up with thousands of gallons of stuff like molasses which you cant even give away out west theyre trying it out for fermentation processes of various sorts you could grow this mould on it like any other mould he fell silent continuing to revolve the testtube in his fingers supposing mr churchill came to me and said jeff old man we want penicillin by the ton and tomorrow do you know what id do id buy a few loads of cornsteep liquori wouldnt need to buy it theyd pay me for taking it away then id shut down a section of the brewery out at white plains and id grow penicillin in the vats you know how these contaminating moulds love to grow in breweries i laughed a brewerys an advance on lemonade bottles i suppose its imaginative anyway sure its imaginative he said seriously i finished my highball and sat tinkling the ice in my glass its only by being imaginative that ive made my money so whats the problem growing a mould and extracting a chemical from its juice florey used amyl acetate for the extraction process there you are the principles established its only a matter of nuts and bolts he got up to fetch a foolscap pad and pencil from his leather topped desk lets try sketching out the production line see here ive got the vat the interest of us both warmed glowed and broke into a flame the floor round jeff became covered with sheets of pencilled plans i watched over his shoulder giving a chemists advice and replenishing the highballs the new york lights were fading in the summer dawn when we plummeted down the elevator jeff picked up his cadillac from the sidewalk and we drove through the sharpening light to white plains beyond the city to one side of the highway stood jeffs chemical plant to the other the beckerman brewery he turned the car towards the brewery roused the watchman strode with the drawings under his arm towards the vast building with the fermentation vats and pacing distances with his feet began the plan which flooded a wartime world with penicillin all bad things come to an end the european war and my marriage finished on the same day it was never much of a marriage my second wife was perfectly correct the day i enlightened her about my first i did have a casual approach to matrimony but in wartime everyone seemed to be getting married with a desperate lightheartedness i still cannot walk through the front door of the radcliffe infirmary without a sickening feeling at my own foolishness the greater event of that wedding day is recorded just inside a plaque acclaims the first systematic use of penicillin which all medical people wrongly take as a misspelling for systemic there is another plaque outside the botanic garden at the foot of magdalen bridge fleming is mentioned on neither of them i had turned to jean as to the comfort of a glowing fire after the icy wind which had pierced me from elizabeth but a warm fire sends you to sleep when you wake up there are only uninteresting ashes jean had lived a narrow life of high teas and earnest conversation i had shared the easygoing amiable hardheartedness of archies circle i had been browbeaten by hitlers storm troopers our similar occupations were a disadvantage we were both more interested in our work than each other we were both rather duller than our jobs we had a large number of bitter rows though they were pardonably about socialism van gogh itma and t s eliot then a pinkfaced young doctor called fred appeared and she went to live with him i say i really am most frightfully sorry about this he kept apologizing as though he had inadvertently gone off with my umbrella on a friday morning a week after veday in may i had been called urgently to ainsleys office off the edgware road what do you know about fiat he asked at once its a make of italian car he gave an uncharacteristic gesture of impatience these damned initials are sprouting everywherealsos osrd tiic and so on now fiat has just been created by shaef i knew at least that shaef was supreme headquarters allied expeditionary force the others were a secret cypher to my ears osrd is the office of scientific research and development and tiic the technical industrial information committee ainsley explained i have completely forgotten what aslos stands for but its the brainchild of general marshall i believe theres also something called cios which must belets say combined intelligence objective subcommittee fiat is field intelligence agency bracket technical bracket he stared for some moments gloomily across his desk i imagined in my innocence that the war would become less complicated when the enemy surrendered rather than more so but we are now responsible for the entire german population as well as our own fiats an angloamerican show but of course the americans are running it building up an enormous staff in germany with secretaries dictating machines doubtless its own px and cinema were just sending across a few odd bods id like you to be one of them i was attracted at the prospect of escape from the rubble of my domestic life and i could not prevent an immensely selfsatisfied feeling at the notion of returning to germany as a conqueror ainsley continued by reading from a typed paper on his desk fiat is an intelligence service for identifying targets subjects and personalities which may be of technical interest to british government departments or firms in other words they want you to grab as many german trade secrets as possible and as many germans as might know how to make better mousetraps than we do its the ministry of supplys baby frankly im not interested in it youd want me to nose round the ig farben works at wuppertal thats right dogmaks still alive we found that out i wondered about gerda have you turned up any evidence of the germans producing penicillin i asked not so far hitler was flinging a few iron crosses about for penicillin research but that means nothing of course i hear montgomerys hq have just sent some phials of penicillin they discovered but they were probably one or two of ours picked up by the afrika korps nearly every molecule of penicillin used by the allied armies had been manufactured in america the penicillin from floreys animal house had been tried only experimentally in the summer of on fifteen wounded men in the north african desert the supply was so meagre that it was powdered upon the wounds themselves or injected into them through little rubber tubesa ghost of sir almroth wrights irrigation of wounds with salt solution in the boulogne casino the experiment was so successful that they wanted to make florey a general it was rather ridiculous that the germans could read all of floreys case reports in the lancet i complained the policeman who pricked himself on a rose bush the boy with the brain infection all appeared in the lancet of august embellished with a leading article of masterful caution which ran second to care for home guard casualties ainsley agreed admittedly we were a bit late officially suppressing information about penicillin but look at it another way if fleming had developed penicillin in the whole world would have been making it including germany as it turned out our valuable weapon was denied the nazis a point which most certainly escaped wright when he wrote to the times i commented when penicillin had seeped into the newspapers in the middle of sir almroth claimed forthrightly that fleming deserved the honour of discovering penicillin and of the first suggestion that it promised an important use in medicine the letter predictably had a latin tag stuck in the middle its a wonder to me that sir almroth didnt write to the times claiming he discovered penicillin himself ainsley gave his slow smile we all know wright dont we hed put his name to anything he possibly could while telling his sons in science their discoveries were far too important to be published by an unknown research worker and would create far more attention under the stamp of his own authority pretty cool of him i always thought i got the impression when i visited marys last month that fleming doesnt at all mind playing the greta garbo in the penicillin drama and i dont suppose st marys minds either ainsley said emphatically they want to raise money from the public like every other hospital hows wright reacting to flemings new knighthood he gave no indication of his feelings apart from persistently referring to him as doctor fleming i had another interview that day which held greater promise of fascination i was having lunch with archie i had not set eyes on him since he left on his honeymoon he took me to a small cheap restaurant near the ministry of information offices in bloomsbury where he said they understood his diet he still suffered from his duodenal ulcer and had a special ration book of which he seemed proud as some distinction amid wartime uniformity he had lost so much weight that his eyes seemed larger staring from a skulllike head he was pale and he stooped he wore a suit of brown corduroy hows elizabeth keeping i asked as we sat down shes very well shes stationed at the war office i heard youd got married it didnt last im sorry he sympathized briefly i know all about you and elizabeth in france by the way those were exceptional circumstances oh yes highly exceptional does it worry you of course not isnt it like our being members of the same good club i dont think thats quite the way to describe elizabeth he said quite severely archie had invited me because he was writing a propaganda article on angloamerican cooperation with penicillin he asked closely about jeff beckerman elizabeth tells me that she actually met this fellow with you before the war he seemed to her a rough diamond hardly the type of man to become a public benefactor jeff doesnt want to benefit the public he wants to make money out of it at first they thought he was crazy using profitable brewing capacity to grow the contaminants which all the other brewers were doing their damnedest to remove then floreys paper describing his successful cases at oxford got into the new york papers jeffs competitors quickly put two and two together and decided it made four or five million dollars havent the americans got some enormous penicillin factory out in illinois or somewhere archie sipped his glass of dried milk yes by accident the us department of agriculture had just opened a new fermentation research lab in peoria south of chicago that was about the time that florey himself was sent out to the states did you know i told archie proudly that until pearl harbor all the penicillin mould in the world were descendants from the blob i let fall on flems petri dish in the summer of but of course the americans do everything so much more thoroughly than we british they got their air force to fly samples of soil home from all over the world they analysed thousands and thousands of specimens at peoria until in the summer of they discovered an absolutely new superstrain of mould it was named penicillium chrysogenum and it produces five hundred times the penicillin of the old one where did they find it asked archie on a canteloupe melon in the gutter of the market in peoria but theres more to the process than growing a mould on molasses in a brewery vat surely indeed you have to grow it in completely germfree air which is a job enough in itself if florey got one of his bedpans contaminated with germs he just threw the penicillin down the sink you cant do that with a fifteen thousand gallon vat then they had to design agitators for the vats and invent a new drying technique we could never have managed it here especially with the bombs and the uboats but arent we in britain making a lot of money out of this too not a penny surely the professor in oxford could have patented penicillin like the sulpha drug you stole in germany i mentioned the possibility to florey he said that you simply cant patent medical discoveries in britain even in wartime it would be unethical he would be struck off the medical register as though he had committed adultery with a patient archie frowned towards his cottage cheese omelette made with dried egg i was enjoying a spam fritter thats something the governments got to change those profits shouldnt be pouring into the pockets of american capitalists they should be used for the good of the entire british people youre still a socialist more fiercely than ever did you know theres going to be a general election quite soon i was on the telephone this morning to blackpool the labour party conference was convening to replan the world in the empress ballroom clem attlees going to break up the coalition i know that for sure then churchill will have a walkover im resigned to that but labour will at least make some sort of impact on the country as a separate party instead as part of the administration running the war i intend to do some vigorous electioneering though its difficult for a peer the wretched public do seem to think that you live in a castle and spend every day foxhunting could i rope you in to help ive abandoned socialism in this country you are born either to work for other people or have others work for you no political doctrine can absolve you of either original sin archie seemed shocked when did you first think that the day you got married i shall of course return to publishing once the elections out of the way he went on hastily it was hardly my fault that my firm went bust a lot of london publishers were rather sharper than me getting their hands on a wartime quota of paper which they didnt deserve im off to germany on intelligence work archie looked puzzled i didnt think that was your sort of line dont you just mess about with fungi my job was singular in oxford to create disease not to cure it i have just invented a method of wiping out germany with bubonic plague now my five years work is completely wasted its very disappointing he stared at me halfdisbelieving you never gave the slightest inkling you were engaged in that sort of horrible war work elizabeth knew i told him airily didnt she mention it if labour should win the election archie resumed scraping up the last morsel of his leathery omelette at least weve men with experience of government attlee morrison bevin cripps greenwood all members of the war cabinet no one can lay the old charge of labour being short of ministerial talent if labour did win it would be a national disaster they would use their energy to institute heaven run on bureaucratic principles perhaps youre right he conceded looking gloomier than ever i could hardly blame myself for failing to see that in a couple of months archie would be a minister of the crown the problem of the nazi is essentially that of caliban said dr harold greenparish in his quarrelsome little voice to all intents and purposes your nazi has been raised in complete isolation from the rest of the world his standards are those of his dam sycorax his worship directed to her god setebosthe nazi state and the late adolf hitler he explained to me he has simply no yardstick of conventional morality to measure his behaviour none whatsoever i think thats rather an oversimplification he looked pained annoyed a little shocked it was the first time i had contradicted him since we had left london no i dont think so ive talked to some of these ss chappies in the prisoner of war camps theyre puzzledto say the leastsuddenly to find the world regards them as absolute monsters by their own lights they were simply doing their duty in war one is required to kill ones fellow man whether he is the enemy without or the traitor within the more of either category one disposes of the more patriotic one is esteemed to be surely you take my point thats how the ss people see it i assure you traitors jews slavs and czechs and a lot of other defenceless men women and children who did nothing wrong except to be themselves greenparishs expression indicated forbearance of my tediousness essentially yes in the framework of nazi doctrines one must be clearheaded about this elgar the nazis in their private dealings could be as cleanliving as honest as decent as religious as the rest of us your nazi mind was terribly shuttered they performed what we regard as utterly ghastly deeds because they saw them as perfectly natural and even essential under the nazi darwinism of survival of the strongest the fact that it was an insane doctrine is surely beside the point it was the only one they knew and of course the lurid light of war does rather tend to encourage human excesses what about the still small voice of conscience conscience does it exist in the popular sense i am strongly inclined to the freudian view of conscience pudgy fingertips together he leant back on the comfortable if worn upholstery of our firstclass wagon lit dining car in the immense selfsatisfaction of specialized knowledge freud explains conscience in terms of the superego equating it with the judgements passed down to the child from the parents but the allpervading nazis were of course the parents the german people were their docile children particularly of course the younger ones who did most of the damage im sure you must agree human morals are not bestowed by godabout whom freud is equally interesting and human behaviour is by and large instilled by the methods of conditioning you mean we learn to distinguish right from wrong as pavlovs dog learned to salivate at the sound of its dinnerbell fundamentally yes he said with crushing assurance i was beginning to dislike greenparish we had first met less than twelve hours previously on the departure platform of liverpool street station he had stuck out his hand and said im greenparish he was about my age short stout and balding standing amid a cluster of suitcases bags and boxes we both wore battledress without badges of rank i had a red fiat flash on my shoulders which seemed to set me above the red cross but below war correspondents greenparishs job was denazification dreadful word he would say with a shudder he was a psychologist who had written books and articles about the nazi mentality from the snugness of a cambridge college the only nazis he had met in his life had been sitting safely behind british barbed wire i made my second arrival in germany on the monday of august in the summer of everyone was wondering how to clean up the abattoir of europe while the sun warmed our delusions of permanent peace and promptly returning prosperity the war had ended in germany with a whimper in japan with a bang a tribunal was to sit in nьrnberg to try the important nazis whose photographs as shabby and sagging men i could still hardly believe in the newspapers only hitlers joke franz von papen achieved any style with a tyrolean hat and a wry smile under the eyes of a steelhelmeted american military policeman holland was flooded germany was flat large towns had vast open spaces with no wall higher than a man small ones had disappeared altogether people lived in the rubble like maggots in a corpse fraternization with germans just speaking to them was strictly forbidden us even the objective nazi albert speer thought this inhuman conduct in any victor but the concentration camps had been overrun and if hans frank hitlers governorgeneral of poland was to write before he was hanged a thousand years shall pass and this guilt of germany will not have been erased there would have been nobody that summer to disagree with him we reached cologne after nightfall i had heard that the cathedral survived and saw excitedly the twin spires soaring against the sky greenparish fussed over his luggage surely theres somewhere one can get a meal he kept complaining searching the ruined hauptbahnhof we had been given bully beef sandwiches and tea on the train after all the army is responsible for us and i dont see why i should be subjected to the inconvenience of hunger we set off in a jeep driven by a british corporal making a long detour to cross the rhine cologne in the darkness of its bumpy bombcracked cobbles seemed in reasonable shape and only when returning in daylight i found it a skeleton every building roofless and gutted the autobahn took us past the bayer pharmaceutical works at leverkusen once with the huge blue advertisement which i had noticed from jeff beckermans cord the factory was intact spared by the allied guns after field marshal model changed his mind about using it in the final scramble as an artillery base you gents got any cigarettes the corporal asked cheerfully over his shoulder neither of us smokes replied greenparish coldly youll be entitled to a ration or you can scrounge some fags is golddust in germany you can get anything for them listen governor the expert on the nazi mind winced you can get anything at all the corporal insisted a bike the family wireless a grand piano i have no necessity for such luxuries said greenparish length of cloth for the wife bottle of schnapps nice suite of furniture he drove singlehanded lighting one of his own inestimable valuables you can get a frдulein for ten woodbines i do not indulge myself with young women greenparish told him severely well her mother then if you prefer it the corporal returned accommodatingly best keep your heads down gents the ferries sometimes has the habit of stretching a steel cable across the autobahn its their resistance movement what they calls the werewolves though i dont think it adds up to much a lot of them is as glad to be rid of hitler as we are still a wire would make a nasty mess of your haircut wouldnt it greenparish glared at me uneasily we approached wuppertal from the dьsseldorf road the streets were unlit and shattered and i recognized nothing but as we turned right my excitement burst out with the cry why its the zoo i reckon theyve eaten all the animals said the driver jumping out as we were halted by a sentry that fellows not very respectful complained greenparish he probably fought his way here from normandy were only useless civilians i really dont understand why i should do without my dinner after all the war is over i discovered the next morning that wuppertal too was mostly demolished the brewery had gone the final airraids had created a hurricane of fire which had boiled the tar from the streets like other embattled towns parts of it were almost untouched the allied armies had commandeered the entire fashionable area where twelve years before i lodgedfurniture paintings grand pianos and allsimply evicting the inhabitants we messed with the british army in a stonebuilt mansion which i faintly remembered it had later belonged to the rich owner of an aryanized textile works everywhere now scratched by boots filled with the sound of american forces network from munich and somebody always playing pingpong i went eagerly in search of the dieffenbachs but their house was one of the unlucky ones blank eyed burnt out dead i stood wondering sombrely what had happened to the family then i noticed the centipedes legs astride the river wupper and one of the familiar cars sailing peacefully beneath them having survived the kaiser the schwebebahn had outlasted hitler i thought that greenparish might be able to draw some parallel with german politics and german technology the first man it was my duty to interrogate was gerhard domagk i had been in wuppertal a fortnight one of the nearby commandeered houses had been turned into offices with trestle tables and filing cabinets and metalframed chairs there were redcapped military policemen stamping about with revolvers but i managed to shoo them away domagk had not changed greatly his close cropped hair was no greyer and no thinner he still wore his neat triangular bristle of moustache he had lost weight but so had everyone in germany he was poorly dressed but he had worn old clothes even when the shops were full of new ones you are gerhard johannes paul domagk i started reading formally in german from a manilla file he stood facing me across the trestle table with understandable wariness you were born at lagow in the province of brandenburg on october your parents were paul domagk schoolmaster and his wife martha maiden name reimer he nodded silently i motioned him to sit you dont remember me i asked unsmilingly he stared but shook his head how is your daughter she must be about sixteen now domagk looked at me with even more suspicion it occurred to me that he imagined i was about to screw information from him by threatening his family it was a fear welljustified by the rule just lifted from germany in the last stages of the war the whole families of deserters were shot as a matter of course her arm recovered so i heard i continued yes i heard that after our countries were at war i heard at the same time that you were arrested by the gestapo his blank stare was followed by a look of amazement and a slow smile you and that american with the beautiful car you remember herr elgar i visited your labs i nodded in the direction of the i g farben works the factory had been bombed but the research department was almost intact i went in the americans car to fetch the protosil tablets for your daughter now i can make a confession i stole a second phial of the tablets which i happened to find there he was hugely relieved at being faced by an enemy he knew i dont think the loss was noticed in the agonizing circumstances he replied the atmosphere thawed as we talked for a while about his childs illness i offered him a woodbine i remember how i feared for my daughters life he reflected it still amazes me how the world now accepts complete recovery in such cases as a matter of course my loot ended in good hands yours was the first prontosil ever used by colebrook to treat puerperal fever though unfortunately without the success of your daughters case of course i read everything colebrook had to say about sulphonamide his work at queen charlottes hospital was most impressive the progress of his patients was closely checked by the bacteriological laboratory which we never achieved with our earlier trials here in wuppertal have you still your painting by otto dix domagk smiled again otto dixhe was called subversive by the ministry of propaganda though i heard he went away somewhere and continued to paint exactly as he felt yes i kept that picture from my laboratory it remained discreetly in my home even after my arrest though what has happened to the painting now he had been evicted from his house in walkьrieallee when i had strolled to inspect it half a dozen bored gis were amusing themselves playing football in the garden one of them wearing over his combat dress domagks evening tail suit domagk stared with interest round the room which he could not leave without my permission but before starting my interrogation i had a more pressing question is dr dieffenbach still in wuppertal the answer was a look of horror but didnt you know herr elgar dr dieffenbach and his wife were both taken away by the ss it was in about christmas time they both died in a concentration camp oh god and the daughter frдulein gerde kept her post in the school throughout the war but last march or april when everything started to disintegrate she disappeared where she is now who can say families are separated all over germany there are plenty of people here in elberfeld whose relatives are in the russian zone and theres no knowing if theyll ever meet again i heard a rumour that she had been arrested by the british but there are rumours everywhere about everyone the boy was killed you know in the attack on liege in i sat savouring these bitter dregs of war but why should dr dieffenbach be arrested i remember him as a nazi supporter i understood it was for behaviour prejudicial to the state and making subversive remarks they were common charges when the ss wanted to do away with somebody then what made him change his opinions about hitler like many professional men he found the nazis no friends of the middle classes the nazis wanted to create a society where all men were equalequal under the domination of their own officials the nazi party was a duplicate state in germany you know i was certainly never a member of the party i never supported hitler i acquiesced i agree through prudence and through fear you will understand that herr elgar domagk laid his hand on the bare table with a resigned gesture my country was at war and i backed the war patriotically my work was on drugs of no military significance drugs which may benefit all mankind i spent my time trying to extend the range of the sulphonamide drugs to tuberculosis though unfortunately without success so i turned my attention instead to the thiosemicarbazones which as you know are related to the sulphonamides have you heard of tbi i found that to have a definite action against the tubercule bacillus and all through the war i continued my work on natural and acquired immunity to tumours and on drugs against cancer do you know about penicillin oh yes a penicillin committee was set up in berlin last year we began to grow a little of the mould in the way described by florey had the war continued another year im sure that german chemistry would have produced plenty of it domagk stubbed out his cigarette i noticed that he had pronounced arthritis of the hands will you answer a question which i have been wanting to ask all the war professor why precisely did you concentrate on the sulphonamide dyes against streptococci in the i g farben works you had an enormous choice of chemicals to experiment with i was testing about three thousand different chemical compounds a year domagk agreed he thought for some moments his head inclined to one side as i remembered him i started with the notion that bacteria were destroyed by the natural defences of the body very much more easily if they were damaged somehow first that was in the reprint you gave me for sir gowland hopkins he told me recently thatrereading your paperit made inevitable your becoming the discoverer of modern chemotherapy domagk accepted the flattery with a smile hopkins is still alive a spry eightyfour he only retired as professor during the war my first attempt was to damage the invading streptococci with mild heatit was only for demonstrating the reaction to students using the living mouse then instead of heat i turned to various chemicalsgold acridines finally the azo dyes synthesized by dr meitzsch and dr klarer one of which damaged the streptococci so thoroughly that the mouse could completely overcome the infection that became our prontosil you have not entirely satisfied my curiosity who suggested to your chemist colleagues meitzsch and klarer that they turned their attention to these particular azo compounds after all as you just said there were thousands of different ones pouring through their hands every year to put it technically who exactly suggested introducing the sylphamyl group in the molecule and thus turn a dye into a drug that decision belongs entirely to professor hцrlein domagk imparted he was my superior in charge of the whole elberfeld plant my own position in the laboratories was not administrative but entirely technical professor hцrlein had made a comprehensive study of these azo dyes and he was convinced that they could have some medicinal effects he had noticed that similar dyes could arrest infection with the trypanosome parasite in mice so it is to professor hцrlein we must be grateful as the true originator of the sulphonamide drugs and so opening the eyes of florey that he might see the potentialities of penicillin well thats very interesting isnt hцrlein the real father of modern chemotherapy and the father of other and perhaps more remarkable drugs of similar sort yet to be created i noticed domagk stiffening in his chair and starting to fidget as i said this i wondered if i had perhaps offended his vanity though he had little enough of it i asked is hцrlein still alive domagks lip trembled havent you heard he was arrested last wednesday by the americans he is in prison somewhere i think in dьsseldorf charged with the most terrible things with killing people with mass murder domagk looked at the floor then suddenly back at me professor hцrlein was on the board of i g farben and on the board of its subsidiary company degesch that firm made chemicalspoisonous gases zyklonb youve heard of it the ss used it for killing their prisoners in the concentration camps killing them by the thousand upon thousand i assure you herr elgar that of these matters i knew nothing nothing we fell silent so the man responsible for modern chemotherapy was also responsible for the gas used in genocide a sickly paradox but perhaps hцrlein had not seen it as a paradox drugs to cure and drugs to kill are still only chemicals when to do either the one or the other is equally laudable who is the technician to object such moral autism was the secret of the nazi power i wondered if greenparish would have understood it have another cigarette domagk and myself had said enough for one day take the packet you must excuse me if i unashamedly accept your generosity defeat reduces us all to a common denominator as he inspected the gift i translated the name geissblatt he nodded they have a good taste more to my palate than the much prized lucky strike greenparish was giving a party i had been in wuppertal all autumn and i had grown dreadfully bored i had questioned over and over again all the scientists and technologists of the i g farben works most of whom i felt could be of no interest to the occupying powers and little even to their friends shaef had been dissolved fiat was under the british control commission cooperating with aslos osrd cios tiic omgus and jida we were all concerned in operation overcast and project paperclip to whisk five thousand top german scientists into the united states by way of detention camps near paris and frankfurt named somewhat savagely backporch ashcan and dustbin the bodies behind these initials naturally quarrelled fiercely with each other with the united states army and with washington by the end of november only three scientists had reached american soil and they were sneaked out for their own use by the united states air force which was thought most unsporting many i interrogated showed little zest for a new life across the atlantic so little they got on their bicycles and disappeared from official view for ever i was comfortable and well fed we lived isolated in an angloamerican town near the zoo protected by sentries and roadblocks we had our own shop cinema library and discussion group greenparish lectured the troops on the psychological background to hitlerism to their mystification and boredom but at least it was warm and they were allowed to smoke and there was nothing else to do i saw something of david mellors who had become a lieutenantcolonel in the royal army medical corps stationed at the british hospital in bad godesberg where chamberlain once met hitler beside the rhine on the far side of black cold ruined wuppertal at barmen the royal artillery were blowing up the enemys ammunition the grenadier guards were up the hill in a brand new german army barracks greenparish and myself and some uniformed nutritionists in unrra shared the mess of an armoured regiment his majesty george vi filled almost exactly the outline left by adolf hitler over the fireplace i had grown used to the clockwork of pingpong there were plenty of copies of life and look and we got bourbon from the americans in exchange for british dufflecoats but i grew uncomfortable playing a part in hogarths picture of calais gate his fat friar fingering the immense raw joint of english beef while the ragged and skinny populace enviously sup their bowls of thin soup i was forbidden to exchange a friendly word even with my german batwoman who cleaned my room polished my shoes laundered my clothes and neatly mended them she was a handsome blonde who reminded me of gerda and i discovered that she was a luftwaffe generals daughter glad enough to earn the wages of the conquerors it must have been the first employment of her lifetwo and a quarter million british misses and madams put their hair in snoods and went to work making tanks and aircraft but hitler refused albert speer at his ministry of war production to let nazi womanhood dirty her hands with machine oil the fьhrers notion that womans place is in the home helped lose germany the war i hear there is some fratting with the germans greenparish said to me in the mess among the other ranks they use the word to mean another very similar he wrinkled his nose at least the powers that be have taken my point sufficiently to relax the rules for my little conversazione ones problem of reeducating the nazis is of opening sufficient windows hitler was to them simply the idealized embodiment of their groupidentification surely you agree one must let them know that other standards prevailed outside germany not of course that there seems a single nazi left in germany today he added resignedly they would all seem to have vanished from the face of the earth like the swastika flags and ss uniforms and those ghastly muscular neoclassical statues of pagan dimwits the party was for the saturday evening of december greenparish had transported a don from his own cambridge college to lecture on english literature to be followed by greenparish explaining the relationship of man to society the don was a short jumpy birdlike man with large round glasses always shaking hands and smiling and apologizing for his presence our colonel recognized it all as the familiar politicians lunacy but allowed use of a room with crystal chandeliers and cream and gold moulded walls now badly knocked about greenparish had invited about thirty guests from the reemergent elberfeld literary circle they were mostly middleaged and elderly and uncertain whether to be submissive arrogant or frightened all arrived dressed in their best though everyones best right across europe was growing threadbare after six years on a long table against the wall were set bully beef sandwiches sausage rolls bottles of hock and cigarettes in glasses greenparish meant refreshments to be taken during the discussion of points raised by the speakers in the manner of those spirited sly chattering little parties of grange road boars hill and hampstead but the guests fell on the food at once slipping sandwiches into handbags and pockets for their families helping themselves to the wine baring the table in two or three minutes this isnt what i intended at all muttered greenparish crossly i honestly felt that tonight would see an achievement of mind over stomach look how those cigarettes simply vanished i stood in the corner neither eating nor drinking in those disordered times in germany you developed a suspicious eye for anyone who looked out of place i had observed aloof from the others a man with the double distinction of being young and having an air about him he was fair pallid sharp faced with pale blue eyes in a green highbuttoned sportsmans jacket check trousers and stylish brown and white shoes he caught my eye after a minute or two he approached and said in english mr elgar i believe how did you know my name a lot of people in wupertal know you mr elgar he spoke with the singsong precision of a man who has learned a language in a lecture room you were a visitor in an earlier age i noticed the thin hand which held his cigarette had fair hairs on the back and i thought his nails were manicured as the surviving young were all prisoners of war i asked curtly why arent you in the army a question which obviously needed asking i worked for the ministry of propaganda which first afforded exemption from military conscription later i was too valuable for cannonfodder i saw that he must have been at least thirty though he had a boyish look which i suspected he cultivated but i did not believe him there were plenty of ss men in germany who had thrown their uniforms into the nearest ditch may i introduce myself he continued herr von recklinghausen it should be count but i dropped it in boyhood the hitler reich not beingwell shall we say you never knew exactly where you stood with titles it was most amusing to see senior members of the nazi party exhausting themselves in a struggle between their natural envy and their natural respect for our aristocracy you noticed perhaps that i did not click my heels when introducing myself so teutonic a gesture would im sure be frowned upon in the state of affairs we now live in autres temps autres moeurs i try to adapt im generally called rudi i felt greatly offended by this selfassertive harangue if you worked for the reichspropagandaministerium you must be a member of the nazi party i said accusingly how could i deny it my file and party number will be among the others discovered on some country roadside by the americans but i have convinced dr greenparish that i am harmless what a charming fellow he is most cultured when i learned i was to be interrogated i expected to be confronted with a beeffaced man smoking a stinking pipe with his ridingcrop and revolver on the table the sort who would shoot a dozen indian natives before breakfast these national stereotypes well theyre the fault of us propagandists i admit but propaganda as a weapon of war has at least the virtue that it has killed nobody yet he offered me his own packet of lucky strike a gesture in the circumstances of nonchalant ostentation i have never been able to hate anybody for long even lamartine and archie i began to be amused by rudi he was probably a deserter perhaps a crook disguising himself in an elaborate but transparent garment of respectability what are you doing in wuppertal i asked in a less unfriendly tone i escaped from under the very moustaches of josef stalin my home is in schцnebeck on the river elbe which unfortunately is in the russian zone my family is extremely well known there i noticed greenparish talking animatedly in german to an elderly couple with a wellscrubbed looking pink checked plump daughter of thirty or so blonde hair in long girlish plaits down her back he was providing wuppertal with its first evening party of completely unafraid conversation since the advent of hitler but the others were not chattering about the intellectual treat in store rather about food cold queues transport and poverty like everyone else would you perform for me an act of mercy rudi asked unexpectedly i noticed he smelt of perfume i supposed germany was flooded with it after the fall of france it is to save the life of a sick child cant you get hold of a doctor things havent broken down to that extent in germany the greatest doctor in the world could do nothing she is the little daughter of an old friend of my familys who lives out in beyenberg that was the eastern district of wuppertal where jeff had taken gerda and myself in the cord for cakes and cognac that bright sunday afternoon he is a good man not a nazi who was congratulating himself on coming alive through both the war and the hitler reich though of course like all of us he is penniless his daughter has the meningitis rudi tapped his forehead she is infected with the staphylokokken you will understand i think mr elgar you were not sent to wuppertal to interrogate professor dr domagk for nothing i wondered how he had nosed out information about my duties the disease cannot be touched with sulpha drugs she must have some penicillin how did you get to hear about penicillin everyone knows about penicillin conversation buzzes about it in the foodqueues people have always grown excited over wonderful cures since the days of christ and his miracles but as you know we germans have no penicillin at all no more than we have chocolates or new shoes he ended in a tone of selfpity i supposed this angloamerican achievement had been paraded in the german newspapers before my arrival it did not occur to me then that penicillin would become one of the most valuable goods in the german black market i thought of it as a rare drug with a rare use outside the battlefield but i had the sagacity to reply i have formed the opinion mein herr that you are not wholly honest he seemed to take no affront honesty in present conditions has become a little hard to define so many day to day transactions necessary to remain alive are unlawful your soldiers dont mind going without a wash or a smoke to exchange soap and cigarettes for a bottle of brandy or half an hour with a pretty girl the woodbines so kindly provided by dr greenparish this evening will in the morning be bartered for turnips or sewingneedles or toothpowder or with luck a little butter how bizarre our times when cigarettes are far too valuable to smoke but without the black market we should have no hope of the most meagre comforts and many essentials and the problems of you people would be much greater i dont believe for one moment your sentimental story of the ill child i hardly expected you to he replied blandly i wished to afford you an excuse for selling me some penicillin i dont care for commercial affairs im a writer formerly an engineer but on doit travailler pour vivre i perform a useful function as middleman in various transactions if you let me have some penicillin i give you my word it would go only to the most deserving of sick persons i shouldnt like to make a pfennig out of such a commodity i can obtain penicillin no more easily than you but let me assure you that had i a kilo at my disposal not a milligram of it would get into your hands you can also take it from me that the rest of the british personnel would tell you exactly the same thing are the allies to continue their practice of killing german children into peacetime i do not think rudi calculated this as an insult that would have been against his interest but rather a way of shaming me somehow into scrounging some penicillin i replied by turning my back undaunted he said in case you should change your mind mr elgar he thrust a slip of pasteboard into the neck of my battledress it was an embossed visiting card with count rudolf ernst von recklinghausen in gothic print an address somewhere in barmen and in the corner ьbersetzer translator i wondered how he had acquired it getting printing done in germany was as difficult as getting a watch repaired or finding new bicycle tyres though for marks a german could buy a new identity card a new employment book and ration cards an army leave pass or even discharge papers a hungarian or italian passport in short a new existence for a frightened nazi i suspected that rudi knew his way to a forgers the don lectured apologetically about english literature ending by seeming to apologize for winning the war and even for starting it afterwards he sat with greenparish and myself in the mess apologizing for drinking our whisky it went very well greenparish said with selfsatisfaction i can even see this evening as the beginning of an entirely new phase in anglogerman relations though next time i shall take care not to bring in the food before ive finished i mentioned rudi oh yes a most interesting young man he was one of goebbels bright boys you know and however ruthless that mendacious propaganda machine one must admit it was tremendously effective your german was still believing it while his roof was being blown off by advancing troops and perhaps even his head greenparish was amused at the joke hes an interesting educational background before joining the goebbels outfit he took a degree in engineering at the university of wittenberg which is in the russian zone like his home town of schцnebeck and so neither can be checked hes perfectly above board i assure you hes far too intelligent ever to have been a wholehearted nazi i was aware of greenparish looking uncomfortably at the don who immediately apologized for keeping us up and went to bed when the pair of us were alone greenparish took my sleeve and whispered that recklinghausen chap is hot stuff youve heard of operation backfire these ridiculous names only confuse me thats the show at cuxhaven with the v rocket engineers you must have heard of a man called von braun never he was the top scientist at peenemьnde and was captured with about four hundred others on the launching site hes been in the united states since summer doing something important with their guided missile research at a place called fort bliss which appears to be somewhere in the middle of texas our count was sent to peenemьnde by goebbels himself to handle the propaganda side he knows absolutely everything about the place the americans are very interested in the count i suppose theres no chance the mans telling a pack of lies greenparish looked offended of course not he has the fullest documentation to back him up i decided to go to bed letting greenparrish make his own mistakes at the door i asked but why should the americans continue to be the slightest interested in missile research theyve won the war dear boy greenparish sighed you dont imagine the russians think theyve won their war yet do you i was to go home before christmas my nose had smelt enough of the putrefying corpse of nazi germany i had a career and a divorce to resume i was delighted with last minute orders to travel by way of fiat hq in paris the pulse of paris i learned from american officers had missed a beat or two during the occupation but was now bounding as joyfully as ever two days before my departure in middecember i found a pair of familiar faces on the front page of the british forces newspaper fleming florey and chain were in stockholm the karolinska institute had been suffering the same confusion as many oldestablished bodies gazing across the rubble of the postwar world penicillin was eminently worthy of a nobel prize particularly as its discoverers unlike professor domagk were on the winning side the swedes intention to award it to fleming got into the london newspapers raising so much academic dust the institute had to think again they gave half the prize to fleming and shared the other between florey and chain this raised the dust chokingly so they ended by splitting it three ways the trio were in tails and white waistcoats fleming looking like president truman chain with a groucho marx moustache and florey resembling the then vanished bandleader more than ever you know those fellows i suppose asked greenparish reading the paper over my shoulder in the mess i know fleming and florey quite well i was wondering how they were enjoying each others company in stockholm theyve never worked in the same lab nor collaborated in anything nor even shared the same lecture platform theyre strange bedfellows in the cradle of success people say theyre enormously jealous of each other though of course under a conscientious politeness it is a sad failing of us academics to gossip with the wellrehearsed and wellrelished maliciousness of beautiful actresses i suppose fleming was the discoverer of penicillin like a shiek who discovers oil in the desert and uses it to light his camp fires florey was the prospector who extracted it then how do the americans come into it they made the money with both products greenparish observed elgar i had a message to give you last night spotting a new issue of lilliput he grabbed it and took the armchair opposite it came in a roundabout way from an ancient medico i was interrogatinghes a perfectly clean record now the poor old things trying to cope singlehanded in whats left of the local hospital apparently hes got a patient in there he said someone youd remember one gerda dieffenbach i dropped the paper whats the matter with her a very common feminine complaint i fear shes had a baby i exclaimed but she must be at least thirtyfive really i had the impression she was a young girl like a lot of people in wuppertal she knows youre here and what youre about shed like to see you its up to you of course if you want to risk disobeying standing orders do you know anything of the husband alas she has no such encumbrance she was raped by some ss man when things began to break up earlier in the year i wouldnt go near her if i were you she obviously wants to get something out of you greenparish started reading his lilliput i was appalled at this casual revelation i knew that in nazi germany where personal feelings were as irrelevant as leaves blowing across a battlefield ss men who made any nordic type of female pregnant faced nothing but the congratulations of the state but a woman of gerdas sensitivity and intelligence and with her whole family killed i might warn you that we arrested her added greenparish without looking up from his magazine someone denounced her because she was a nazi schoolmistress but in the end we let her out she claimed she had to strike a compromise with her conscience under hitler dont all the women i expect even those blonde maidens who scattered rosepetals before the tyres of hitlers mercedes when he came home from the surrender of france so dreadfully vulgar the nazis i stood up and walked in the fresh air of the small garden i could not face greenparish a second longer but he was right why should i go against my countrys orders and risk seeing gerda she was cared for in hospital better off than the millions of germans living on bomb sites she had been raped but millions more had been killed but she had asked to see me and the war had left me perhaps the person nearest to her in the whole world that evening i put on my dufflecoat and walked to the same hospital where the earliest cases had been treated with domagks sulphonamide it had been bombed its windows replaced by boarding inside was dim and cold and you could see the marks on the wall where hitlers portraits had been removed im from the control commission i said to the middleaged woman in an oldfashioned folded nurses cap who was sitting at a table with neatly arranged piles of forms in the hall she gave me a hard look when i asked to see the doctor attending frдulein dieffenbach she clearly did not approve of unmarried mothers the doctor was wizened bent whitehaired in a patched white coat with a stethoscope sticking from the pocket i explained briefly who i was and what i knew yes frдulein dieffenbach was delivered safely of a daughter four days ago he clasped his bony hands together you knew about her parents that was terrible terrible dr dieffenbach was one of our most esteemed practitioners and did enormous good here in wuppertal may i see her i think that would be inadvisable she is very very ill i asked in alarm whats the matter puerperal fever he told me starkly we try to keep infection down as much as we can but it is difficult with the sterilizing plant worn out like everything else youre treating her with sulphonamides i asked at once unfortunately not with the effect i should have hoped he replied wearily she may be infected with the staphylococcuswe cannot tell with our restricted facilities culturing pus to identify the infecting germ is a luxury we must forgo and of course the sulpha drugs dont touch the staphylococcus i have to use my clinical nose he tapped his nostril what about penicillin he sighed ah that is not for us germans her lifes in danger thats undeniable of course much depends on her natural strength but none of us is bursting with health these days i must see her i knew her family well before the war it might put heart into her to fight the illness off i went up an illlit stone staircase in the company of the doctor and the memory of rosie gerda lay in a bed at the end of a small ward separated from her neighbour by a white screen she had not changed as much as i had feared her hair was two long plaits of pale gold tied by the nurses with a pair of bows made from bandages she was flushed with fever thin her face lined her mouth was a little open and looked as soft as ever oh she lay against a pile of pillows staring at me no expression on her face at all i smiled remember how we went to work together on the schwebebahn i asked in german herr elgar she stretched out her hand i clasped it hot and damp i suddenly recalled blondie of the follies you know why im here she said in a whisper i nodded i know all about it im enormously sorry for you it was something sudden unexpected i never thought it could happen to me she dropped her eyes the effort of looking up at me too much i often thought about you during the war hoping that you were all right and that american with the big white cari wondered if he was alive or dead he had so much money hes alive and has even more she made a feeble smile im not very well i have a fever which sometimes complicates this state but the child is all right thank god i felt simple astonishment at her affection for the cause of her pitiful state then it struck me that a man can never understand such emotions and that gerda was one of those women who long for motherhood but are frightened by its means youll get better soon she made no response turning her eyes to me again she said im not a nazi you know i never was i had to say and do certain things which i was ashamed of but the alternative mindful of the old doctor in the background i said you mustnt strain yourself ill come and see you again ill bring you some chocolate well have so much to talk about herr elgar for a second she had a shade of her old vivacity the war was such a pity such a pity the nazis spoiled life for everyone in the world not only for their own people i should have gone to england with you shouldnt i we went downstairs the doctor remarked perhaps we should try ehrlichs intravenous arsenicals thats useless useless i strode into the gloom of the winter evening fastening the toggles of my dufflecoat realizing that i was facing a choice more agonizing than floreys over the disposal of his meagre early supplies gerda needed penicillin it was denied the german population i could have tried squeezing some from david mellors but the drug was scarce carefully checked in the british and american military hospitals a serious offence to give away i had heard recently from greenparish of some ampoules stolen and fetching enormous prices on the black market it would be useless asking david i quickly decided and unfair forcing him to choose between the chance of a courtmartial and offending an old friend i returned to the mess and sat in my luxuriously furnished bedroom trying to decide where my obligations lay there were big risks and bigger principles involved i shied from making up my mind though i sensed my thoughts were irresistibly carrying me towards resolution i opened my file of personal letters and took out rudis visiting card the address was on the north edge of the elberfeld valley up one of the long flights of stone steps i climbed them countingthere were two hundred and sixtyfour at the top was a tall grey house falling like a cliff on the steep slope there were more stairs inside unlit i had to strike matches to read the number of rudis flat on the top floor i banged a brass knocker fashioned like a notre dame gargoyle there was silence then someone shuffling behind the door whos there demanded a german voice not rudis herr elgar from fiat im known to count von recklinghausen more shuffling more silence i waited patiently for several minutes bolts were slipped back and the door opened in the light of a further door standing ajar i found myself facing a fattish man of about sixty with a boyish red and white complexion and hair dyed bright blonde he nodded towards the other door rudis through there he said sullenly i entered a small room crammed with elaborately decorated antique furniturea dresser with carefully arranged pewter platters a cabinet of painted crockery a hefty pearshaped coffeepot the drцppelminna a local curio all indicated that the owner had come down in the world it was freezing cold like all german houses the paraffin stove reeking in the corner clearly newly lit for my reception rudi wore a red and black dressing gown of quilted silk over his sportsmans jacket this is a pleasure he greeted me in his singsong english though not an unexpected one would you like a cup of coffee its real no thank you as you suspected ive come on business i want to get it over as soon as possible rudi began to dissertate infuriatingly what do you think of the furniture it is in the baroque style created by count von berg who was once a big noise in the district the flat belongs to hans who let you in im lucky these disturbed times to find a roof over my head ive come about penicillin i want to buy some to buy but you of the master race have penicillin enough its for a german i see he offered a packet of lucky strike then lit one himself what are you prepared to pay whats your usual charge you can have five days supply for fifty pounds i havent got fifty pounds then i cannot help you i could have you imprisoned for these activities remember isnt that an empty threat you would not dare to implicate yourself im sure you can raise sufficient pound notes or dollars you know were not supposed to have any currency except occupation marks i know that is a regulation often broken there was silence rudi continued smoking unconcernedly your penicillins stolen i suppose i asked you do me an injustice it comes from a most respectable sourcethe kidneys of the americans the precious fluid is collected from the big army hospitals round frankfurt the penicillin reclaimed by a chemist from i g farben here in wupertal at first i thought the process utterly revolting then merely bizarre it recalls our name for the weak beer during the warhitlers bladder irrigation you steal the urine then you really have a low opinion of me mr elgar a man who steels urine cannot stand very high even in the fraternity of criminals the americans are glad enough to give it to my friend the chemist for official distribution only a little of the fruits of his labours comes my way the story rang true florey had used the same method with his first cases in oxford and the reextraction of penicillin needed apparatus no more elaborate than the heath robinson equipment in the animal house you see we nazis cant be as black as you paint us you still turn to us if youre in sufficient trouble my god youre conceited i told him rudi was unmoved you british are great preachers and so lay yourselves open to the suspicion of being great hypocrites such indignation in your newspapers but to paraphrase clausewitz genocide is the continuation of racial policy by other means you were well taught in the goebbels kindergarten i see goebbels himmler hitlertheyve all been exalted far too flatteringly in your demonology herr hitler was just another german statesman like bismarck or even bismarcks completely unmemorable successors caprivi and hohenlohe hitler was more unscrupulous than bismarck but no less opportunistic perhaps he was more skilful more adept at bluff that was hitlers game you know he did not want war i see that i bring the colour to your cheeks mr elgar but herr hitler got almost all he wanted by only threatening war and you must admit that a war won without fighting is better for both sides than victory and defeat he bluffed we called his bluff and the result lies all round you i told rudi shortly herr hitler miscalculated he believed that you would rat on the poles in after all he had reason enough you ratted on the czechs at munich in you are looking at me angrily mr elgar not because i am telling the truth but because i am the only german in a position to tell it to an englishman rudi reached for a black leather briefcase on the dresser with the pewter dishes he drew from it a sheet of paper we are yoked in the harness of an illegal conspiracy mr elgar so you shall see how much i trust you he said this without irony it was a letter from the wolfsschanze the wolfs lair hitlers russian front headquarters at rastenburg in east prussia it was dated july less than a week before the bomb plot misfired the brief typewritten text commended herr recklinghausen for his work at nordhausen in thuringia i knew that nordhausen had a factory for flying bombs that it was manned by slave labour and that the americans found so many of them dead their rows of bodies floored the huge barbedwire compound hitlers spiky signature at the bottom gave an icy feeling in my heart the man had actually touched the paper i was holding this wasnt anything to do with propaganda i told rudi in wartime you have to take many jobs and do as you are told he took the letter back that piece of paper could land me in nьrnberg but i know that you must keep the secret as well as i you british and americans cannot blame herr hitler for all that has happened in germany you know nor can we germans though naturally we make him our scapegoat hitler gave the german masses what they wanteduniforms processions marching soldiers order discipline and revenge for our shame in you may raise the jewish question but antisemitism in germany was not mobilized by adolf hitler it was another adolf stцcker a protestant clergyman wilhelm the firsts court chaplain he founded the christian social party in when the politics of the masses first began in germany the german conservatives soon joined in the game an enemy is necessary for any political party otherwise it starts looking responsible for its own mistakes what enemy more convenient than the jew who is everywhere and mixed up with everything besides there is malice in every human heart a cudgel for every human fist now it was rudi who had coloured as though speaking to a room of brownshirted cronies ignoble emotions are more easily exploited than noble ones your british cynicism must tell you so mr elgar and herr hitler had a knack for exactly that he assumed mock fury in dramatic speeches and flattered germany with spectacular leadership though in fact he thought the german people just as stupid as the masses of any other nation i know i told him coldly ive read mein kampf it is pleasant to think we share a common taste in literature rudi said calmly i wanted to escape from the room if i raise the money will you have the penicillin its urgent and anyway im leaving wuppertal for good the day after tomorrow come back at noon hans with the dyed hair was waiting in the hall i hurried back to the mess i had ten pounds in sterling notes hidden in my room the rest i borrowed from greenparish who i had suspected of hoarding currency from selling his cigarette ration i climbed the cascade of stairs to rudis flat again the following morning by then i was full of doubts over the unsavoury transaction the penicillin might be understrength or unsterile so worse than useless by augmenting the infection hans answered the door he told me that count von recklinghausen was out i waited until hans returned with a foolscap envelope which i tore open on the spot it contained a squat bottle with a screw top the sort used in laboratories the world over gummed across the stopper was a reassuring printed label saying unfruchtbar sterile it was half full of brownish crystals like the early penicillin i had seen at oxford i handed over the money which hans counted carefully he said danke curtly and shut the door in the hospital the nurse with the flowing hat was not at her post i walked up and down impatiently after some minutes the old doctor appeared still in his mended white coat how is frдulein dieffenbach he shook his head gloomily the news is bad she has suffered a spread of the infection to her blood i had hoped that it might have remained localized but in her present physical condition it was just too much for her we must hope that she has enough reserve of strength to overcome it i held up the bottle proudly i have some penicillin he took it silently turning it in his thin white fingers its not american penicillin american penicillin is impossible to obtain you know that there are ways ive had a few ampoules here stolen from the military hospitals might i ask where you got it thats out of the question i told him shortly it did not seem the moment to inspect the teeth of gift horses then i added it was extracted from urine yes i know of that technique but the source may still be of importance the doctor said musingly he held the bottle towards the light sometimes it is not penicillin at all but any sort of crystals perhaps brown sugar or water coloured yellow he abruptly broke the sterile seal tipping some of the powder into his palm no thats not penicillin he sniffed it it has a distinct scent it is bath salts ground up in the kitchen i had gone a couple of streets towards rudis flat before realizing the pointlessness of again climbing the flight of stairs hans would certainly not open the door to me i could do nothing against rudi without landing myself in the same jail he knew that i was leaving germany for good the next day he would just laugh at me which would be intolerable i hurried back to the mess i told the orderly sergeant that i wanted a jeep and driver at once it was not until midafternoon that transport could be produced it was dark when i arrived in bad godesberg it was a modern luftwaffe hospital serving the airfields scattered thickly across northwestern germany like everything else provided for hitlers forces down to their boots and braces it was of better quality than afforded german civilians a corporal on duty told me that colonel mellors was in the wards i sent my name with a message that my visit was urgent within a few minutes david appeared in battledress and carrying a stethoscope bubbling as usual can i have a private word with you i asked tensely youve chosen a fine moment boy weve just got a couple of cases of typhus which is putting the ddms into a fine flap typhus having been officially eradicated in this part of the world i expect theyre sitting up there saying im a bloody fool whos made the wrong diagnosis he led me down a long lowceilinged corridor into a room with his name on the door containing a desk a pair of metal and canvas chairs some filing cabinets and a refrigerator got the clap he asked amiably certainly not i imagined that to be the case from the secretiveness of your approach you remember i worked out here in wuppertal before the war i stayed a year with a german family the father was a doctor i told him quickly the story of gerda and of her present suffering you say shes got puerperal just like your wife i nodded david began to look uneasy what do you want me to do about it boy is she being treated properly i know a squadronleader whos a gynae man looking after the waafs at celle up near hanover i could get him on the phone i want some penicillin i wondered if david would be angry but he just said resignedly look boy im sorry ive put you on a spot im continually getting these pleas you know from the men whove been fratting with girls its always the old father or mother who are dying to tell the truth i dont believe one of these heartrending stories is true the girls want to sell it on the black market i cant get enough for my own patients he jerked his thumb towards the refrigerator thats half full of penicillin but i could use twice as much if i had it feeling deflated embarrassed and foolish i asked you cant spare an ampoule even for me he shook his head slowly i just cant break the rules can i i didnt really expect that you would thats flattering i suppose i shouldnt have come here it was all on an impulse this womans pretty sick the doctor said shed developed septicaemia shes likely to be a goner then youd know better than me david sighed its her bad luck to be born a german isnt it but we didnt start the war and we didnt lose it either no im sorry jim im sorry he got to his feet i must get back to those typhus cases and im sorry to make a nuisance of myself not a bit youd every right to bring me your problem its the army which doesnt allow me to help we exchanged a few commonplaces at the door david jerked his head and said ive got to go in this direction can you find your own way out i nodded shall i see you in london over christmas yes lets make a night of it david hurried round the corner i waited ten seconds or so i went back to the office and switched on the light inside the refrigerator were cardboard packs like cartons of american cigarettes each was labelled penicillin doses for the second time in my life i stole paris after germany was as delightful as offenbach after wagner its smell was unquenchable it still reeked of coffee and gauloise cigarettes though both were hard enough to come by the breath of the mйtro stations still blew as dry as a biscuit there were gis everywhere good americans having escaped death went to paris fiat had first gone into action in paris our vanguard of eleven scientists with an escort of three armed american officers landed in france just after dday they had entered paris in a pair of jeeps with the leading tanks of general leclercs liberating division there was good reason for the rush they wanted to question professor joliotcurie he was married to the daughter of madame marie curie and the couple had shared the nobel prize for studies in radioactivity fiat wanted to know if the nazis had the atomic bomb i had a room in a commandeered hotel on the rue de rivoli previously occupied by the gestapo i shared with two ebullient american officers who promised to show me the delights of pig alleypigalle i had orders to report without delay to an office near the place detoile but as often happens with military arrangements the officer in charge had no news of my coming no knowledge of me in his life and no interest in me whatever as i had travelled overnight i was in the street well before midday at a loose end at the next corner i found the road crossed by a narrower avenue pierre premier de serbie it was the home of the only man during the entire war to threaten me with a gun i strolled to the block of flats and saw with some excitement lamartine against one of the numbers displayed in the hall the lift was out of order like most in paris i walked upstairs full of curiosity my ring was answered by a plump middleaged woman in black sleeves rolled back on pink arms unwelcoming alarmed at confrontation with a stranger in british battledress she said in reply to my enquiry je suis madame lamartine so this was the wife he had deserted for the talkative madame chalmar i had taken her for the maid are you a british officer i speak some english i met dr lamartine during the war i have a friendly interest in his whereabouts thats all dr lamartine is dead she told me curtly i exclaimed what happened my husband was killed in the big air raid by the raf on march he was living across at montmartre he had sent me and the children away from paris when the war started im very sorry madame i consoled her cest la guerre she said briefly when did you last see him monsieur in bordeaux during the summer of she looked at me suspiciously what was your business with my late husband youve heard of penicillin i expect she nodded dr lamartine had a specimen of penicillin mould which i was sent from england to recover before the germans could get their hands on it henri would not have given it to the boches she said promptly he was not a collaborator whatever people say but theres no use talking about it now she started to shut the door you knew madame chalmar she was killed by the same bomb madame lamartine added with satisfaction to be exact the firemen found her with my husbands body very hysterical she died suddenly shortly after i do not think she was a very healthy woman you knew her well no i would not have wished to meet her i walked slowly back to the street i never had any liking for lamartine but i thought him stupid rather than sinister for him to be killed by a british bomb struck me as a rather unnecessary exaggeration of irony my experience stimulated my curiosity to call on professor piйry his house being not far away by the bois he had the same maid puzzled at being unable to place me he was at home and received me in the diningroom with the same lurid colour photograph of his son the fleeing lieutenant he looked much older and even thinner his cooks art had become the most pointless in france my dear mr elgar he shook hands powerfully but solemnly holding mine in both his what terrible experiences we have suffered since you last left this house with the young miss tiplady miss tiplady is very well and now married eh bien we wondered if you ever got home safely to england those days of brought no credit to any of the allies not to us french because we ran away not to you british because you snatched back all your planes not to the americans because they should have declared war on hitler there and then but you have heard of jeanbaptiste my son i shook my head he was shot by the germans as a hostage i was so appalled that i could say nothing i had noticed that the professor still wore a black crepe band across his lapel his was a suffering of which i had often heard during the past few months but never encountered face to face he waved me to a chair we are getting over it now we see him as dead for the honour of france like any other soldier killed in action but when did this happen in of course in my son had to report back to the army and was immediately locked up by the germans he had a hope they might release him because of his englishto interpret the broadcasts of your bbc something of that nature but the boches had enough interpreters of their own and werent inclined to trust a frenchman i got him out early in on what they called en congй de captivitй jeanbaptiste had been working in my laboratory at the franзoisexavier and the germans were releasing in a conditional way le personnel sanitaire as well as men to run the railways the electricity and gas and so on my god he was better off then than millions of others captured in the fields or even sitting in their barracks some of them kids just called to the colours whod never even had a rifle in their hands do you know what these were saying at the armistice that it obviously meant demobilization for everyone theyd be back in their homes in a fortnight instead they were marched off to germany without food sleeping in fields and kept for the rest of the war securely behind les barbelйs he paused leaving me to feel the pain of his silence for almost half a minute then in at the beginning of august things really started to become very bad in paris that summer the german general schaumburg had been killed a bomb was thrown at his car the nazis were getting nervous which was a very dangerous state as im sure you know of course they ascribed the attack to jews and communists but it was the work of the resistance jeanbaptiste was arrested by the ss why they should pick on him i dont know i dont know the professor sat in his chair slowly shaking his head still in tragic bewilderment perhaps it was because of my position in the medical faculty of paris there were plenty of my sons fellowofficers after the armistice who were left completely unmolested he was kept in the fresnes prison we never saw him nor heard from him then a german officer was shot dead in molitor mйtro station near the racecourse in the bois de boulogne the polizeifьhrer the ss general oberg announced that one hundred frenchmen would be shot if the assassin was not handed over by the population to the french police in ten days well the assassin was not my son was shot with the others on the morning of august by the little barracks at the carrefour des cascades in the bois he was allowed to write a letter first which i have in that desk as an additional punishment general oberg shut all paris theatres and cinemas for a week he added with a contemptuous snort which shows how the nazis equated the value of a hundred human lives we sat without speaking for some moments i could not console him because consolation is a charity which can outrun the power of words yes my son died in action professor piйry repeated wearily had that assassin been denounced do you know what would have happened all his male relativesincluding his brothersinlaw and all his cousins over eighteenwould have been shot yes shot all of them their wives would all have been sent to concentration camps their children all taken to a prisonschool this teutonic thoroughness was made completely clear to us by a proclamation from general oberg when he took up his job the general claimed his measures were necessary for the calm and security of the parisiens and they say the nazis had no sense of humour he ended bitterly that letter of my sons will be passed down in my family it shall never be destroyed i was relieved that a knock at the diningroom door broke the tension the maid appeared remembering me now and smiling she left on the table a brass tray with two minute glasses and a bottle of reddish apйritif which i noticed from its encrusted neck had been in use for some time we are still obliged to be frugal professor piйry explained pouring out two drinks but things are naturally better than during the occupation when we had alternate fours avec and fours sansof wine you know i asked something which had often been in my mind the past five years what happened in paris in the days immediately after we left for tours oh the germans showed their noses early on june they came along the rue de flandre from the porte de la villette in the northeast there was nothing in their way except unarmed policemen to direct their traffic i saw a column of them about sixthirty driving towards neuilly from the invalides soon we had posters plastered everywhere a kindly young fellow in fieldgrey without his helmet holding up three french kids who were eating his breadandbutter ration abandonnйes faites confiance au soldat allemand goebbels at his most expert goebbels graced us with a visit in july hitler appeared at once of course things resumed an appearance of normal the tide turned everyone came back from the roads to see if their belongings had been stolen a consideration hardly in their minds before departure i assure you i could never have left paris of course because of my patients the cinemas and cafйs reopened so did the maisons closes i remember we had faust at the opйra and the folies bergиre started again we even had sainte jeanne by your bernard shaw that winter there was a swastika flying from the eiffel tower and the germans took over the rue de rivoli completely from one end to the other at noon every day they paraded up and down the champselysйes with a brass band the professor took a tiny sip of his apйritif we had to settle down to some sort of life the germans requisitioned all our cars we had wooden soles to our shoes we had nothing to smoke and we went about on bicycles everybody kept rabbits and they dug up the jardin du luxembourg to grow vegetables there was a curfew and any retardataires who missed the last mйtro had to spend the night squatting in a police station didnt you manage to get any encouragement from the outside world listening to foreign broadcasts meant the concentration camp but of course most of us risked it the papers all presented the war after as a struggle between the european forces and the bolsheviks that was the pйtain line laval had the effrontery to make a speech here about the immense german sacrifices to this end on our own behalf they founded la gerbethe sheafwhich was supposed to be a balanced intellectual weekly pour les hommes de bon volontй de tous les partis but it was all nazi hypocrisy its disappearance was a minor joy of our liberation what about de gaulle they called him a tool of the jews whom they collected in the vйlodrome dhiverthe indoor cycle racetrackand deported to the concentration camps the door opened madame piйry appeared dressed in black she started crying as she greeted me through association with her son he was not alone she said now that everything has come out the germans shot french hostages the news of death never seems to come singly or perhaps the first blow makes us more sensitive to the others i reached london the week before christmas where i had booked a room at a small hotel in cavendish square among my waiting letters was a telegram sent the day before from budleigh salterton saying that my mother was seriously ill by the time i arrived there she was dead she had just turned sixty and had suffered a stroke she was so loyal so devoted and so hardworking the old lady kept repeating in a heartbroken voice one simply doesnt find servants like that any more my mother left me ј the savings of a lifetime it was useful to buy a secondhand prewar car my only emotion was a ghost of the liberation i felt so guiltily on the death of rosie i had a lonely christmas but i hate obligatory jollity in the new year i won my expected job at arundel college senior lecturer with the old professor only three years to go i should be when i succeeded to the chair exactly the age when florey had burst into oxford i had decided that like florey i should set my staff searching out unfinished lines of research but for the cure of cancers not infections that was the next exploration for mans restive mind i never had so much confidence in my science and myself as that new year of perhaps the millennium being enacted by mr attlees government had something to do with it but cancer is still uncured and i ended up as a professor as futile and frustrated as most of the others my divorce was more permanently rewarding i consulted a jolly chubby bearded solicitor just released from commanding a submarine who peppered his advice with expressions about surfacing crash diving and depth charging there are three times the petitions as before the war he said with satisfaction couples who married in the forces discover a terrible shock living together for longer than a fortnights leave at a time without the dutyfree cigarettes and drinks too got another target in your periscope the following week i opened my times to find that sir edward tiplady was dead i telephoned archie who seemed insistent that i join elizabeth and himself at the funeral it was a dull and drizzling afternoon at a crematorium on the edge of a vast estate of little redbrick council houses at shepherds bush i went by underground in my new utility suit i arrived as lady tip in a mink coat was stepping out of sir edwards angular rolls royce she had spent most of the war living in claridges hotel with several exiled kings and alexander korda archie was looking gaunter and gloomier than ever elizabeth lovelier she wore a smart black costume the straight skirt reaching half way down calves in black nylon stockings her dark hair in a small round black hat with a deep frill of stiff black muslin the packers were there but said nothing about clare though i saw how they were bursting to i barely remembered what my first wife looked like until i found among my mothers effects a small photograph album annotated in her copperplate hand with the dates of unmemorable outings it struck me how happy i looked but perhaps i was obliging the camera archie offered me a lift in their small car elaborately excusing his use of official petrol by some imminent meeting in the ministry i happened to come across one of your reports from germany on industrial intelligence not at all badly done he observed to me i thought most condescendingly cripps dalton and bevin are very interested in that particular exercise i hope you realize i had a special meeting with them at the board of trade last august how are you enjoying revolutionizing the country id be enjoying it much more if my ulcer didnt play me up its all tremendously hard work but tremendously exhilarating this time were setting methodically about building a just and equal society in britain instead of shouting vaguely about a country fit for heroes to live in like lloyd george you dont seem to have got very far yet i told him there was continued rationing of everything from bacon and butter to soap and shoes a scarcity of everything else and nightly gloom from street lights left unlit to save electricity of course we have weve already the date for nationalizing the coal mines he told me sounding offended he was dropping elizabeth in belgrave square come in and have a cup of tea she invited me archie did not seem to object dont forget were dining with mummy at claridges she instructed him as he drove off the flat was undamaged and much as i remembered it from the beginning of the war do you know who poor daddy called in when he had his heart attack elizabeth asked me she entered the kitchen at the back still with her frilled hat on lord horder he wouldnt have anyone else your father was immeasurably good to me she lit the gas under the kettle at heart he was a pansy wasnt he yes did he make advances towards you not physically he would never have dared and it would have repulsed him he was far too sensitive i thought that pansies had just as much sexual drive towards each other as men and women thats true but therere a number of men who love women and find physical sex repugnant hand me that teapot theres a darling archies left us alone in the flat without even a servant on the watch why shouldnt he isnt that typical of archie he always does what he thinks he should rather than what he wants its a form of selfhonesty i suppose and thats so much rarer than honesty towards other people its why he became a socialist because he thought he should he could have fulfilled himself much better by spending his money as dutifully as any other millionaire its why he let me play the parasite on him so long and kept that awful man watson very cordon noir wasnt he did you know that watson was a crook hed done the most awful things killed someone and escaped with his neck he learnt how to cook in prison i wonder what happened to him probably got a job as catering officer in the army she laughed pouring steaming water to heat the silver pot its why archie married me because he saw it as exactly what he should do as the best thing for both of us to save you from the unspeakable disgrace of marrying the butlers boy you should never have let me get away with it you should have carried me off and married me when we escaped from france id have gone willingly darling honestly i shied away because i was afraid of being hurt surely you of all people can understand how i grew up with an inferiority complex its kept me from a lot of delicious things in life perhaps even from claiming the fame for discovering penicillin i hope you dont take sugar weve used all the ration youve never been happy with archie of course not really if you would really have married me in why were you such a bitch to me before the war i was frightened dont forget id grown up with you as unattainable to me as i to you then my mother bolting and realizing that my father was a pansy i felt insecure so i played the bitch a lot of girls do that women appear to be unfeeling when theyre only frightened of their feelings during the war i wasnt frightened of anything at all it was the same throughout the country wasnt it everyone had something more important to think about than their complexes all the madhouses were empty whens archie likely to be back hours poor dear he thought he would spend every day bringing justice and light to the world instead he passes all his time in a beastly office at the elephant and castle arguing over details of pensions and things with lawyers hes left us alone because he thinks he should show how he trusts us oh jim you are exasperating he left us alone because he thinks i deserve a little adultery in the bedroom she threw off her hat and a pair of orange lacededged silk french knickers but we were both so eager she fell on the coverlet in the rest of her outfit i enjoyed sir edwards daughter while she was still in her mourning clothes from his funeral not bad for the butlers boy the fourth death could have been my own the next day i called at ainsleys office which had files stacked everywhere and a busy air of closing down this might interest you he said sorting through a sheaf of photographs on his desk and flicking one towards me it showed the page of a printed book a column of names and addresses each entry numbered resembling a telephone directory my own name struck me at once elgar john the entry started in bold type geb chemiker london w harley street rsha iv e statpoleit dьsseldorf thats from the gestapos sonderfahndungsliste gb special search list for great britain ainsley told me cheerfully our field intelligence unearthed it it contains about two and a half thousand names put together by one of himmlers boys called schellenberg youre in distinguished company theres noel coward david low the cartoonist rebecca west gilbert murray bertrand russellthose figures after your name are the number of your file in the reichssicherheitshauptamt that was the reich central security department he folded his hands across his red knitted cardigan with a smile they were going to establish gestapo headquarters in london liverpool birmingham and so on then for the first time i heard ainsley laugh just think of the people youd have to be seen dead with i think noel coward made that remark about it im flattered the nazis thought me so important in wuppertal ainsley tossed another photograph across the desk of a roundfaced bespectacled nonentity in ss uniform not unlike himmler himself thats ss colonel dr franz six former professor of economics at berlin university he was to have been in charge of the fun instead he had to content himself with the mass murder of russians with his einsatzgruppen at the moment thank god weve got him locked up at nьrnberg looks a nasty piece of work doesnt he and thank god hitlers operation sealion never came off i can console you that the invasion would have been an unmitigated disaster for the nazis because the raf won the battle of britain no my dear fellow he gave me a wise look because the fleet was anchored at scapa flow the germans had no ships and we could have blown their barges out of the water britain always wins wars by sea power i fancy that hitlers famous intuition told him that as the man didnt know a bowsprit from a barnacle it was almost two years later i was having dinner with jeff beckerman at munich in the middle of december he had been driven in a us official car miles from stuttgart to meet me seeing you heres saved two precious days he declared jovially now i can cancel the savoy and pick up the queen mary from cherbourg so britains not worth visiting any longer commercially no he replied frankly attlees government may be swell for the british working man but it doesnt exactly encourage anyone to try making any dough jeff lit a cigar between courses he was still fatter in a civilian suit like myself with a flashy tie we were both staying the night at a hotel run by the american government for the flock of officials and businessmen at the time gently cropping its way across germany it was a warm comfortable wellstocked oasis in a city still dark cold and damaged our table was by an upstairs window and i could look over the marienplatz by the munich rathaus where about noon on november hitler and his brownshirts picked up julius streicher on their way to the feldherrenhalle where the nazi revolution came to grief under the muzzles of the police carbines in his triumphal days hitler ceremoniously retraced the route gцring ribbentrop and the rest all marching in jackboots along the tramlines i recalled the official photographs ainsley had shown me taken at nьrnberg in the early hours of october the same nazis were lying on top of plain blackpainted coffins against a background of brick the cut nooses still round their necks each body neatly labelled with an adhesive strip ribbentrop wore a dark striped suit and stylish tie keitels face was a mask of blood frick wore the sporty tweed jacket he had affected during his trial and gцring having preempted the hangman lay on an army blanket with his right eye a little open looking at the camera with a wink of death we talked about prewar days in wuppertal i told him of gerda with a child from some unknown ss schьtze she could never know that i had brought her the penicillin but she had written effusively thanking me for the bar of chocolate did you really have a contact with the german generals before the war i asked jeff with curiosity you remember when you would have prevented the whole thing if the foreign office man hadnt fobbed you off with teacakes sure i had was it gerda herself i often thought so no but you know him herr fritsch i frowned the name meant nothing the manager of the brewery who always wore a wing collar but he was a nonentity hed have liked you to think so for safetys sake hed dropped the von he was related to werner von fritsch who was army commander in chief before hitler got rid of him in the spring of he resigned after some homosexual scandal had been cooked up by the nazis who knows if theyd taken me seriously in london you and i might be sitting here now amid scenes of peace and prosperity i was still mystified over jeffs urgency to see me im flattered you drove all this way i told him you neednt be its a matter of business i came to munich with a specific purpose to ask if youll work for me again but ive already got a job im going to be a professor professor he did not hide his contempt besides i cant possibly move to the states for domestic reasons the job isnt in the states its right here in germany im restarting operations in a big way you think im crazy of course i do germanys just a scrap heap from the north sea to the alps theyre even talking of demolishing whats left of the factories and turning the country into the biggest farm on earth sure but germany cant go on being the poorhouse of europe for ever germanys a country with a future look whats happened already we reestablished the lдnder putting back the calendar to the peaceful days of little kings and cuckooclocks before bismarck we found enough weimar politicians whod somehow kept out of trouble under hitlerthere werent any left alive whod stood up to him we even put up communists for gods sake then we let them have elections back in nothing like starting training in democracy early hitler was democratically elected i reminded him he would not be elected again when your guts are ripped out youre in no mood to try charging the enemy listen its going to be like this the fourpower council has been deadlocked for months right the russians would like to extend communism to the rhine wed like to extend democracy to the vistula those are two impossibilities so the russians will eat their share of the germans like cannibals we shall invite our share to sit down and halve the goodies the western lдnder will have to combine into a new republic sooner or later just to face up to the russians the german orderly in a white jacket brought our steaks and that german technology jeff murmured admiringly i suppose you knew the us division of your fiat collected pages of trade secrets from leitz optical alone and pages on dyes synthetic rubber plastics and so on from i g farben truman has ordered the information sold to us industry at nominal prices our fiat had a budget of almost four million bucks but i reckon it was money well spent you british didnt really get into it he admonished me i guess its your old trouble war is ok but trade is ungentlemanly i asked what the job would be organizing my interests i trust you you speak german you know the germans cant the germans organize themselves they couldnt under the nazis hitlers organization was terrible just a lot of overlapping agencies all at each others throats with no directives but a vague idea of carrying out the fьhrers will i expect theyll improve on it when they havent to worry about a knock on the door at four in the morning the salary could be about what your prime minister gets old man im sorry but id rather stay at home in the british empire jeff looked exasperated what british empire roosevelt wanted to see the end of it and he did you british have ended the war with no money no power and no influence only thousands of millions of coloured people who want to see the back of you as soon as possible and youre putting up a statue to roosevelt in grosvenor square thats gentlemanly to the limit like most britons i still did not see the truth which ainsley had prophesied in his club nettled i said well we still count in europe the whole of europes now just little kings and cuckooclocks theres only two powers in the world the russians and us and weve got the bomb besides im getting married i added as an unanswerable objection i thought you were married jeff grumbled i got divorced im marrying that girl with the soldiers gas mask i brought to the savoy the one who married a close friend of mine its all very gentlemanly think it over telephone me in new york if you change your mind honestly id rather be a professor jeff grunted suddenly remembering he took out his pocketbook and handed me a newspaper cutting did you ever come across that guy in wuppertal the cutting came from a recent new york times headed german scientist gets year term it was a short bald story of count von recklinghausen a rocket engineer from wuppertal who had been cleared of nazi guilt by the allied control commission and been flown to america with several hundred other scientists he was in trouble through selling new yorkers shares in his nonexistent family engineering business and found to be neither a count nor a scientist but a journalist from hamburg with a police record for swindling he had apparently reached the united states through forged documents and exploiting the rivalries between various allied organizations i hoped that rudis flattering letter from hitler was a forgery too i decided to post the cutting to greenparish anonymously what shall we do for the rest of the evening old man jeff asked me go find some women wrestling in mud i left early the next morning in a us army jeep for nьrnberg i was going to renew another old acquaintance since the previous may i had been following the trial of top men from i g farben it was an allamerican show in the nьrnberg palace of justice where the nazi bosses had been tried expediently if not entirely logically i recognized the courtroom at once from the photographs in the newspapers during to the left of the dock was a booth for three or four young men and women the interpreters every word spoken having to pass from microphone to earphones through their heads to their left stood the witness chair opposite it across a dozen yards of bare floor the desks of the lawyers facing the dock raised well above it sat the four american judges in their black gownsshake moms herbert and merrell everywhere stood armed american military policemen in their whitepainted steel helmets the snowdrops who had become as familiar in a hundred grimy and remote british towns as the bobby i spotted hцrlein at once among the darksuited prisoners fourteen years of war and months of imprisonment had scarred him less than i expected he was then he had lost some weight and when he turned his head i noticed that he had shaved off his moustache he still wore his round glasses the court was military tribunal six the trial the united states of america v karl krauch et al i had seen a copy of the indictment in london through archie our affairs being very gentlemanly indeed but his marriage was dead and he was relieved to keep the divorce between friends he would have found some stranger intruding into elizabeths affections deeply hurtful the charges were sweepingly formidable the first count was the planning preparation initiation and waging of wars of aggression and the invasions of other countries the second plunder and spoliation the third slavery and mass murder four membership of the ss five conspiracy to commit crimes against the peace professor hцrlein escaped only count four i had timed my arrival at nьrnberg for hцrleins own turn to face the music that was thursday morning december i found quickly that he had an excellent german counsel dr otto nelte his first point to the judges was of hцrleins relative ignorance about his fellowdirectors business the administrative structure of i g farben was so decentralized as to render it virtually impossible for an individual member of the board to be informed of the activities of the others the lawyer insisted the judges were not overimpressed ever since professor hцrlein was in opposition to the party dr nelte asserted especially to streicher who supported the fanatical adherents of treatment by natural remedies in their attacks upon pharmaceutical firms moreover he became a victim of a campaign of defamation because he took part in the fight for freedom in the field of science against the plans of hitler and gцring to prohibit vivisection for scientific purposes i did not think the judges were impressed with this either but it rang true to me the nazis were fervent health cranks that hitler was appalled by vivisection was another paradox matching that being untangled before me it was strange next to hear the lawyer refuting the charge i had first heard from colebrook in of i g farben withholding the sulpha drugs from the world until certain that the lining of its pockets was safely sewn up with patents through the discoveries made in the elberfeld works which were organized and managed by professor hцrlein he declared for good measure every year millions of human lives were saved and through drugs like the antimalarial atebrin health restored to hundreds of millions of human beings then he came to the zyklonb the defence was simple hцrlein did not know what was going on degesch was a subsidiary company of i g farben at frankfurt its full title deutsche gesellschaft fuer schaedlingsbekaempfung but hцrlein did not know that degesch was supplying zyklonb to the concentration camp at auschwitz he did not know that zyklonb was for the gassing of human beings hцrlein was admittedly a member of the degesch verwaltungsratits management committeebut several links were missing in the chain of evidence the assertion that the management committee knew of the business transactions involving zyklonb is unsupported no transcript of such meetings has been submitted no evidence has been introduced to prove that hцrlein had obtained knowledge of it in any way whatever he did not take part in any meetings of the management committee at the critical time he did not receive reports disclosing that zyklonb had been supplied to auschwitz or the terrible use made of it at birkenau these missing links were a year later to stimulate the curiosity of the new york times domagks name came up for the first time dr nelte was arguing that new drugs were never allowed to leave the elberfelt works until exhaustively tested by the latest scientific methods from my knowledge of domagks character and talents this was transparently true but his reason for labouring the point soon became clear professor hцrlein had no influence in and therefore no responsibility for the selection of doctors to whom the elberfeld drugs were given for clinical testing there was no correspondence or direct association between professor hцrlein and dr vetter who at one time worked in dachau where the prosecution accused him of experimenting with various preparations concerning allegations of experiments in the buchenwald concentration camp the prosecution has linked professor hцrlein with the therapeutic experiments with methylene blue supposed to have been carried out by dr ding there in january i knew this to be another dye used as a urinary antiseptic the prosecution state that in september the defendant hцrlein urged the testing of methylene blue on typhus but no evidence has been produced dr nelte ended by stressing hцrleins good character i shall submit numerous affidavits from german jews and persons of foreign nationality he promised the result will be a picture of a man who during the bad years after preserved a courageous and noble heart a man to whom great injustice is done if one calls him as did the chief prosecutor a sickly spirit and an architect of the catastrophe he ended with a curious irony which had already occurred to me in the neue zeitung i read yesterday of the ceremonial award of the nobel prize in stockholm dr gerhard domagk director of the pathological laboratory of the elberfeld works appeared for the presentation of the nobel prize awarded to him in for the discovery of the medical effects of sulphonamide professor domagk worked with and under professor hцrlein in the elberfeld i g farben plant whereas the world pays tribute to professor domagk and thus also to the elberfeld plant by presentation of the highest scientific award professor hцrlein who was given honourable mention together with professor domagk by north american newspapers for work on the sulpha products stands at the same time before this tribunal as a defendant the story on which hцrleins life depended took more than a day in the telling i was billeted on the americans spending my spare time in munich watching the mending of its fragmented university when it came hцrleins turn to testify in his own defence he spoke with dignity with respect and with effectiveness mr president your honours as a layman in legal matters i believed that the prosecution would give facts whichat least in their own opiniongave them the right to claim individual guilt instead they merely mentioned my name in connexion with the general charge of criminal medical experiments it is so simple to make charges but it seems to be very difficult to acknowledge errors he talked about a life spent solving health problems of the whole world i worked for humanity for the honour of german science for the benefit of the german economy for my firm and for my family there was no conflict of interest and no conflict of conscience in all these goals hцrlein claimed that he would never have changed his job of running the comparatively small elberfeld works he had once refused a bigger one in i g farben because his task at elberfeld was directed to humanitys greatest benefithealth hundreds of thousands of soldiers of all nations he emphasized in this war have had their lives and health preserved by atabrine that was the drug discovered under his influence at elberfeld as an improvement on quinine millions of people may in the future be saved from death by malaria a disease from which a third of mankind is suffering by this invention of the elberfeld laboratories which can be produced in any quantity desired he ended i am proud that before this court many scientists of international reputation have paid tribute to my work that was all in dr neltes affidavits the prosecution however in their opening statement called me and others of my colleagues a damaged soul they accused me of crimes against humanity and tried to prove this monstrous statement i hope that the tribunal has been convinced by the presentation of evidence by my counsel that these charges are unfounded i am therefore awaiting your decision with calm and confidence the decision was long coming the judgements were not given until the last days of july by then the berlin airlift had been flying a month the german currency reform had laid the foundation stone of a palace of prosperity i was married and elizabeth was pregnant life in postwar britain was still threadbare but it was enlivened for me by the delightful gilbert and sullivan situation which had developed between fleming and florey they seemed to know as vaguely as the karolinska institute or anyone else who deserved the credit for penicillin sir howard florey took the heath robinson apparatus in the oxford dunn labs as a ladder which raised him to become provost of queens college in oxford and chancellor of the national university in australia to a peerage and the order of merit sir alexander fleming used his interpretation of the penicillin mould in st marys to savour the adulation of a film star the inaudible diminutive shy deadpan scot was taken equally to the warm heart of american lecture audiences and the icy one of the american press from the whole world he gathered academic medals and academic gowns he was particularly fond of the spanish one so gorgeous that he was said to be mistaken in madrid for the new cardinal madrid named a street after him where appropriately parade the putashe suspected that he would be remembered as the man who made vice safe for the masses he would distribute small medallions of the famous mould to his eminent new acquaintances such as the pope god wanted penicillin so he invented alexander fleming he was supposed to have told an american lady but it was an impossible utterance from a man like fleming he never used a sentence of more than half a dozen words in his life i was too busy at arundel college to revisit nьrnberg that summer i only read a transcript of the military tribunals verdicts from archie again the presiding judge g c shake had declared the defendants now before us were neither high public officials in the civil government nor high military officers their participation was that of followers and not leaders if we lower the standard of participation to include them it is difficult to find a logical place to draw the line between the guilty and the innocent among the great mass of german people we find none of the defendants guilty of the crimes covered by counts one and five of preparing and waging war i skipped through the typewritten pages until i found hцrleins name we cannot impute criminal guilt to the defendant hцrlein from his membership of the i g farben board of directors he is acquitted of all the charges under count two of the indictment that covered plunder and spoilation the judge continued with count three slavery and mass murder the evidence does not warrant the conclusion that hцrlein had any persuasive influence on the management policies of degesch the organization proved to have supplied zyklonb gas to concentration camps or any significant knowledge of the uses to which its production was being put we are of the opinion that the evidence falls short of establishing his guilt on this aspect of count three concerning the evidence of inhumane experiments we may say without going into detail that the evidence falls short of establishing guilt on this issue beyond a reasonable doubt applying the rule that where two reasonable inferences may be drawn from credible evidence one of guilt and the other of innocence the latter must prevail we must conclude that the prosecution has failed to establish that part of the charge so hцrlein was free but one of the four judges dissented judge p m herbert had said the responsibility for the utilization of slave labour and all incidental toleration of mistreatment of the workers should go much further and should in my opinion lead to the conclusion that all the defendants in the case who were members of the board of directors are guilty under count three in the new year of judge herbert told the new york times the destruction of important farben records at the direction of certain of the defendants probably deprived the prosecution of certain essential links in its chain of incriminating evidence and leaves one with the feeling that the result might have been different if the complete farben files were available to the war crimes prosecutors the new york times unearthed that one of the defence lawyers had been charged with improper action over the disappearance of records but had been cleared some of hцrleins fellow defendants had sentences of imprisonment finally confirmed by the military governor of the us zone on march hцrlein himself went back to wuppertal perhaps he was doubly lucky for being in a position to know and nevertheless shunning knowledge creates direct responsibility for the consequences wrote the ghost who stepped from spandau albert speer hцrlein enjoyed for five years a life of expanding prestige and prominence as chairman of the new farben company to run the works which i had first entered on the cold saturday of january last summer i went back again like all slim blondes gerda has not aged too emphatically she still coaches a few private pupils she is still unmarried her daughter is another pale blonde busily running an advertising agency with her husband in frankfurt gerda told her she was the daughter of a gallant army officer whom she had met loved and lost without trace in the explosion which blew the nazis into history in wuppertal i heard one bat squeak in the black caverns of the past i came across the affidavit sworn by gerhard domagk for hцrleins defence at nьrnberg when in october i was awarded the nobel prize professor hцrlein called to my attention that hitler had prohibited that german scientists accept this prize he advised me to approach the ministry of culture i took the warning by professor hцrlein that serious difficulties might arise for me out of this matter not seriously enough it did not prevent me from writing several letters of thanks which i considered necessary the result was that in november i was arrested by the gestapo when professor hцrlein learned about this incident through my wife he went to great pains to obtain my release domagk signed that in wuppertal on january six weeks after he had at last been presented with his prize in stockholm his evening tail suit essential for the ceremony was never the same after the gis had played football in it domagk wore the ancient tail suit he had been married in twenty years before which through the privations of recent years still fitted him he refused the offer of a new suit tailored in stockholm he wanted to appear a true representative of postwar germany he received the medal and the decorative folder signed by king gustav but under the nobel regulations the additional dollars if unaccepted at the time of the award returns automatically to its funds he never got the money today i retired the afternoon of my sixtyfifth birthday saw a pleasant little ceremony in the great hall of arundel college where i was presented with a leatherbound book of congratulatory essays from my colleagues the affair was managed by hargreaves both efficiently and enthusiastically elizabeth looked charming and even our two sons managed an air of amiable sufferance the swords forged in the decade of the thirties were sheathed or shattered in the next now we have much better ones i have seen only three truly significant happenings in my lifetime the nazis and the toppling of their horrid king besmeard with blood of human sacrifice and parents tears secondly the invention of drugs to kill the germs which have prowled so dangerously round man ever since he evolved to intrude into their atmosphere on earth and atomic fission which keeps the world alive by frightening it to death there is nothing like war as a stimulant of technical progress in bunyans day tuberculosis was the captain of the men of death but whenever their captain falls he is replaced by another malignant fever carved on old tombstones has been replaced in our ignorance by malignant disease i might myself have achieved the fourth significant event by producing the cure for at least some cancers but i lost my enthusiasm for cancer research it was replaced by doubt that the prolongation of life in our overcrowded and quarrelsome planet was an activity as saintly as we thought dogmagk felt the same about sulphonamides in the days of hitler florey did about penicillin in the war the cubs of hitler now purr in wellfed contentment himmlers death mask has a glass case in the black museum of scotland yard we british become our old selves again when an excavator discovers a forgotten nazi bomb when we can evacuate our houses drink tea together and sing songs of happy cheer like william blakes child on a cloud and what do i conclude who have been close enough to kiss the smiling and murderous faces of our century i can only agree with a voice of the s susan stebbinghuman beings are too fine in their highest achievements to justify despair leaving the hall afterwards david mellors came up to me grinning do you remember in germany after the war when you desperately wanted some penicillin you pinched it from my office when i left you alone for a minute i did that on purpose you know im not such a fool as i look boy
