michael palmer the fifth vial prologue the beginning is the most important part of any work plato the republic book ii hold still now this wont hurt a bit those were the only words lonnie durkin had heard for hours this wont hurt a bit vincent always said the same thing just before he stuck the needle into lonnies arm and drew blood vincent lied the needles didnt hurt much but they did hurt take me home please take me home please please please lonnie leapt up from his bed jammed his fingers through the metal wire fencing and kicked the locked gate he knew what a nightmare was his mother had explained bad dreams to him when he was a boy and had begun waking up every night screaming but he could tell that the cage was no nightmare the cage was real please at that moment the van swung a turn that threw him hard against the wall banging his head and his shoulder he cried out fell then crawled back to the bed the van was a house on wheels like the one uncle gus and aunt diane had but instead of a cage in the back theirs had a nice room and a big bed and some closets five years ago for lonnies sixteenth birthday they had taken him to yellowstone in the van and had let him sleep in that bed at night for the whole trip the bed in the cage was too small for him and the mattress was too hard beside the bed there was a chair a pitcher of water in a holder on the wall and some paper cups on the chair there was a magazine called mad which had lots of weird cartoon drawings but way too many words for him to read and finally there was the clicker for the tv that was attached to the wall outside the cage that was everything lonnie couldnt stop thinking about his mother and father and the men who worked on the farm the guys knew how much he loved m ampms and always had some for him when he walked down to the fields to visit them and sometimes even help them out let me go please dont hurt me just let me go three sides of the cage were the walls of the van the fourth side was the fence made of chicken wire just like the coop behind the barn at home it completely filled the opening to the rest of the van and had a gate with a lock on the other side there was a light in the ceiling just outside the cage but no windows beyond the fencing was the bathroom and just past that was a folding wall that pulled across the passageway to where vincent and connie were frustrated lonnie rose and kicked at the fence he guessed that he had been in the cage for three days maybe four the van had been moving almost the whole time he wasnt really cold but he felt that way cold and frightened and lonely please please take me home his voice was almost gone except for the needles when they gave him a shot or drew blood neither vincent nor connie had hurt him so far but lonnie could tell they didnt like him either they looked at him just like mr and mrs wilcox in the house down the road from the farm looked at him and once while he was on the toilet he had heard vincent call him a fucking retard let me go i want to go home please please this isnt fair the van slowed and pulled over to a stop moments later vincent opened the door beyond the bathroom he was a big man with yellow curly hair not fat the way lonnie was just big he had a tattoo of a battleship on each of his arms right above his wrists vincent had been so nice to him at first connie too they had stopped the van where lonnie was walking to the rec center and had asked him directions to the farm cousins of his mother they had said they were otherwise he would never have gotten in the van with them his mother had taught him about going with strangers but these werent strangers they were cousins who knew his name and his fathers and mothers but had just never been up to the farm his hands on his hips vincent stood by the bathroom door lonnie could tell he was angry before he even spoke what did i tell you about yelling nnot to do it then why are you doing it iim scared in spite of himself lonnie felt his eyes filling with tears just the other day his mother had said she was proud of him for not crying so much anymore now here he was about to cry again i told you that you didnt have anything to be frightened of one more day and well let you out ppromise okay i promise but if theres any more hollering or you give us any trouble at all the promise is off and im going to take away the tv remote the tv doesnt work good anyhow what nothing nothing no more noise i mean it vincent spun around and left before lonnie could say any more after wiping his eyes with the back of his hand lonnie pulled the blanket over himself and drew his knees up facing the back wall one more day and well let you out vincents promise played over and over through his head he should have made him do a pinky promise one more dayfor a time the tears came even though he tried to stop them then gradually lonnies sobs gave way to a troubled sleep when he awoke the van had stopped moving his shoulder hurt from where he had fallen and there was a sore lump just over his eye as well he rolled over slowly aware that he had to return to the bathroom soon to pee a woman was standing outside the fence looking at him she was wearing the kind of blue hospital clothes that the doctors who fixed his hernia wore and over them a white jacket her hair was pulled back and covered with a blue paper hospital hat vincent was standing behind her tapping a short black club against his hand the door behind him was closed hello lonnie the woman said adjusting her glasses and looking down at him my name is dr prouty did vincent or connie tell you i was going to be here lonnie managed to shake his head no well then dr prouty went on you neednt be afraid im going to take your temperature under your tongue and check you over the way doctors do do you understand this time lonnie nodded despite the doctors quiet voice and smooth skin there was something about her that seemed to make it impossible for him to speak something cold good now i want your word that if i open this gate and come in there with you youll be cooperative cooperative lonnie do you know what that word means lonnie answer me iknow good dr prouty nodded to vincent who unlocked the gate and pulled it open all the time keeping the club where lonnie could see it okay now lonnie dr prouty said im going to give you a shot and then im going to examine you first i want you to get undressed and put this gown on with the strings in the back do you understand i have to go pee very well vincent will help you then hell help you get changed first though let me give you this shot then i can go pee then you can go dr prouty said somewhat impatiently lonnie only moved a little when the needle was jammed into his arm then he went into the tiny bathroom and peed when he had finished vincent took him by the arm and led him back into the cage to change into the gown even with it on he felt naked the fear that had been building inside him tightened like a band around his chest dr prouty returned from the front of the van closing the door behind her as she examined him he began to feel his eyelids grow heavy hes going out he heard dr prouty say lets get him up front while he can still hold most of his own weight vincent helped him to stand then dr prouty opened the door it was the first time lonnie went to the front of the van since the day it had stopped for him things there had completely changed a bright saucer light was attached to the ceiling and beneath it was a narrow bed covered with a green sheet beside the bed stood a tall doctor wearing a blue mask over his mouth and nose get him up there while i scrub in dr prouty said lonnie looked toward her voice and saw that she too had a mask on he felt wobbly barely able to stand vincent helped him to lie facedown on the bed and pulled a strap across his back a sheet was lowered over him then the tall doctor put a needle into his arm and left it there lonnies eyes closed and refused to open his fear subsided now lonnie the tall doctor said im going to put a special breathing mask over your faceperfect okay just breathe in and out in and out this wont hurt a bit the body is that of a wellnourished white male in his twenties height five feet nine inches weight one hundred ninetyseven pounds hair brown eyes blue no tattoos or pathologist stanley woyczek used a foot pedal and overhead mike to dictate as he worked he was in his second term as medical examiner for florida district which included st lucie martin indian river and okeechobee counties all located north and west of west palm beach he loved the intricacies and puzzlesolving that went along with the job but was still not at all inured to the human tragedy cases often stayed with him for weeks if not years he had no doubt that this would be one of them a young man carrying no identification had run out of a grove of trees and onto a sparsely populated stretch of route where he was blasted out of existence by a tractortrailer the driver of the semi estimated he was going sixtyfive when the man suddenly appeared as if out of nowhere right between his headlights gratefully woyczek reasoned the pain of the impact couldnt have lasted more than a second or two preliminary screens for alcohol and drugs of abuse were already back and were negative assuming the more extensive toxicology was also going to be unrevealing there would probably still be two glaring questions when this postmortem was completed who and why there is a wellhealed scar over the left inguinal canal presumably from the surgical repair of a hernia there is a seven inch laceration and compound fracture of the skull above the left ear and a twelve inch long vertical tear through the left chest through which a severed portion of the aorta can be seen woyczek motioned to his assistant that it was time to turn the victim over they did so with care posteriorly there is a deep abrasion across the right scapula but no other the pathologist stopped speaking and peered down at the top of the mans buttock just above his right hipthen at an identical area on the left chantelle what does that look like to you the assistant studied both areas puncture wounds she said no doubt about it no dr woyczek there are six on each side maybe more well do a microscopic on some of them to set the age but these punctures are recent im sure of it i think we have something here he stepped back and stripped off his gloves hold the fort for a couple of minutes chantelle i want to get the detectives to come over i might be wrong but i dont think so sometime in the last day two at the most john doe here was the donor for a bone marrow transplant chapter the partisan when he is engaged in a dispute cares nothing about the rights of the question but is anxious only to convince his hearers of his own assertions plato phaedo go ahead and sew him up ms reyes natalie stared at the slice down darren joness forehead across his eyebrow and down his cheek until this moment the largest knife wound she had ever seen was one she had accidentally inflicted on her own finger treatment then had been a couple of bandaids she forced herself not to make eye contact with cliff renfro the surgical senior resident in charge of the er and followed him out to the hallway in her three years and one month as a medical student she had sutured countless pillows several varieties of fruit some ragged stuffed animals and recently at what she considered great peril the seat of a pair of her favorite jeans renfros order didnt make much sense she was only two hours into her second day on the er rotation at metropolitan hospital of boston and although renfro had checked her diagnostic skills out on several patients he had yet to see her sew dr renfro iumthink maybe i should go over things with you before not necessary when youre finished write a scrip for him for some antibiotic any one ill sign it the resident turned and was gone before she could respond her classmate and good friend veronica kelly who had already finished her surgical rotation at metropolitan had told her that renfro was in his final year before taking over as chief surgical resident at white memorial the flagship of the medical schools many famous teaching hospitals after years of training he had the air of one who had seen it all and was burnt out on what he considered the lowlife patient population of metro renfros smart and damn competent veronica had said and hell take the really messy trauma cases but he couldnt care less about the routine stuff apparently he considered a black teenage loser in a gang fight to be routine natalie hesitated outside the boys room wondering what the fallout would be if she chased renfro down and asked for a demonstration of his skill you okay nat the nurse a gravelvoiced veteran of years in the er had given a portion of yesterdays student orientation including the tradition that in a hardscrabble place like metro almost all the staff used first names hers was bev bev richardson i asked for this rotation because i heard the students got to do a lot of procedures but sewing up a kids face on my second day is a bit more than i had expected have you sutured before nothing that was ever alive except a few unfortunate oranges bev sighed cliffs a darn good doc but hes a little immature at times and can be hard on people and the truth is i dont think he cares all that much for our clientele well i do natalie said stopping short of a litany of the many times earlier in her life when she had been wheeled or carried or dragged into this very er we like having people working around here who care the patients have it hard enough everyplace else their hospital ought to be something of a sanctuary i second that well dean goldenberg has told me that hes heard im going to be accepted into the white memorial surgical residency maybe dr renfro has heard the same thing and hes just testing me or maybe he senses that youre not like him and he wants to see if youll back down from the challenge he wouldnt be the first natalie replied already setting her jaw and mentally ticking through the pages of the plastic surgery text she had reviewed during the week before this rotation youre the runner arent you the question didnt startle natalie in the least her tragic accident during the olympic trials was chronicled on the local and national news and the cover of sports illustrated from the day she started med school as a thirtytwoyearold firstyear student people knew who she was past tense she said her terse response requesting a change in subject think you can do this boys face at least hell have someone working on him who gives a hoot if that means anything it means plenty bev said go ahead in there ill get you set up with some sixoh nylon suture even though most of them arent we assume everyone down here who is bleeding is hivpositive so best wear a gown and plastic face shield if i think youre going wrong in any way ill clear my throat and you can come away and we can talk keep your fingers away from the needle straight instrument ties double overhand knots about an eighth of an inch apart dont pull them so tight that the skin edges bunch and dont shave his eyebrow because they never grow back right thank you welcome to the er bev said you doin a good job doc natalie looked up at bev richardson who nodded proudly that she was from the moment nat had numbed up the skin edges darren jones had been talking nonstop nerves she guessed if he only knew that he was hardly the only one the procedure had taken probably three times what it one day would and natalie was still just through the forehead and eyebrow with the cheek yet to go but the repair looked quite decent yes im doing a good job she replied matteroffactly m i gonna have a scar every time skin is cut theres a scar women like scars theyre mysterious besides im tough so why not announce it right doc you seem pretty smart smart is more important than tough tough men like me scare you the guy who cut you would probably scare me natalie said smiling beneath her mask you still in school i have a year to go but i quit you should think about starting up again fat chance darren laughed you wouldnt know about such things doc but where i come from the only thing that matters is being tough again natalie grinned matched up against this boy in almost any measure of toughness she would win hands down she reminded herself that it wasnt the first person who had suggested she get back into school that had led her to the edith newhouse academy for girls or even the second but somewhere along the line thanks to those who had tried before someone had finally been able to breach the ramparts of her own toughness tough is swimming against the stream and having the courage to be different she said tying off the last of the sutures tough is realizing that this is the only life youre going to have so you might as well do what you can to make the most of it ill keep that in mind doc the teen said with little sincerity natalie glanced over her shoulder at bev who gave her technique a thumbsup and mouthed the words steristrips motioning at the packets of paper stitches she had placed on the instrument tray after ineptly fumbling several of the strips into useless balls natalie figured out how to cut and place them across the incision to reduce scarring by taking the tension off of her suture line five days bev mouthed holding up one open hand these stitches will probably be ready to come out in five days natalie said grateful for the hedge inherent in the word probably at least for the time being you got soul doc darren said i can tell natalie stripped off her face protector and gloves another milestone she was thinking it was a huge advantage to be thirtyfive and a med student especially one who had seen more than her share of life decisions came easier to her than to most of her classmates many of whom were a decade younger or in a few cases even more her perspective was often more finely honed confidence in her convictions was stronger dont sell yourself short my man she replied stick around darren bev said i have a tetanus shot some instructions and some medication for you pain meds darren asked hopefully sorry antibiotics hey you claim youre tough natalie said heading out the door tough guys dont need no steenking pain medicine she wrote her note at the nurses station feeling very pleased with the way she had performed under pressure renfro had issued the challenge and then had walked away but she had more than measured up she had set high school college and national records on the track and had made it to within one unfortunate step of being on the olympic team along the way she had dealt with any number of cliff renfros bent on feeding their egos off the insecurity of others well she was still the same woman who had run meters in let this particular cliff renfro keep trying she hadnt knuckled under to any of the others and she wasnt going to be intimidated by him either bev materialized at her elbow saralee just came over from room four you know what that is yes for the alcoholics and other street people bev added patients are put there when theyre particularlyumgrimy i know i worked in there for a while yesterday it wasnt so bad well apparently the er got a little backed up while you were off suturing and a code was going on in the other wing so much to his chagrin cliff is holding down the fort in room four he wants you to take over in there as soon as youre done im done now good you handled that kid well nat i think white memorial made a good choice youre going to make a fine doctor that hospital may be the best of the best but theyre still a decade or two behind when it comes to accepting women into their surgical programs so ive heard well like i said youll do great take it from one whos seen them all come and go at that moment they turned toward the sound of a commotion coming from down the hallway im telling you doc youre wrong theres something the matter with me something bad right here behind my eye i cant stand the pain a man was being escorted out of room by an orderly even at some distance there was no doubt that he qualified to have been there grizzled and worn he was in his forties natalie guessed or maybe even his fifties he had on a tattered windbreaker stained chinos and sneakers without laces an oily red sox cap with its brim pulled low still failed to hide the sad hollows of his eyes hands on hips cliff renfro appeared in the doorway and glanced to where natalie and bev stood before addressing the man whats wrong with you charlie is that you need to stop drinking i would suggest you get yourself over to the pine street inn and get them to show you to the shower theyll probably have some clothes for you too doc please this is serious ive got lights flickering in this eye and the pain is killing me everything keeps going black clearly irritated almost beyond words renfro ignored the man and stalked down the hallway past where the two women were standing youve got to move faster down here dr reyes he paused long enough to say now please take over in four im going to get washed up and he muttered maybe fumigated natalie caught the briefest spark of anger and frustration in the patients eyes before he turned and allowed the orderly to lead him toward the waiting room and beyond that the street ill bet renfro didnt even examine him natalie whispered possibly but he usually theres something seriously wrong with that man i just know it horrible pain flickering lights lost vision i just finished six weeks on neurology that guy has a tumor or maybe a leaking aneurysm or even a brain abscess these people deal with pain and discomfort every day if his symptoms are bad enough to have him drag himself in here somethings the matter did renfro order any tests i dont know but i dont think listen bev i want to check that guy over and then get a ct scan can you arrange that i can but i dont think its such a good and some bloods a cbc and chemtwelve ive got to catch him before he gets away believe me if he were a welldressed businessman at white memorial hed be over having a ct scan right now maybe but before bev could finish the sentence natalie was off she checked the waiting room then hurried out the doors to washington avenue the man was a dozen yards away shuffling slowly toward downtown charlie wait the derelict turned his eyes were bloodshot but he held his head erect and met her gaze evenly perhaps even with some defiance what is it he growled imdr reyes i want to check you over a little more and maybe order a test or two then you believe me natalie took his arm and gently led him back toward the er i believe you she said bev richardson was waiting just inside the door with a wheelchair room six is empty she said in a conspiratorial whisper hurry i have no idea where renfro is lab is on the way hopefully we can get his blood drawn and get him over to ct without anyone seeing natalie helped the man out of his clothes and into a blue johnny renfro was right about one thing she was thinking charlie really did smell she did a modest neurologic exam which disclosed several definite abnormalities in strength eye movements handeye coordination and gait any and all of which could be due to a brain tumor abscess or leaking blood vessel a technician had just finished drawing blood when bev backed into the room hauling a stretcher i pulled some strings she said theyre ready for him in ct he has some clearcut neurologic abnormalities ill get him over there and then get to work in room four ill clean up in here natalie wheeled the stretcher into the hallway thanks bev ill be right b what in the hell is this cliff renfro livid stormed toward her from the nurses station i believe there is something seriously wrong with this man natalie said maybe a tumor or a leaking aneurysm so you chased him down after i had discharged him renfros voice was raised to the point where staff and patients alike stopped and stared several people emerged from the examining rooms several more from the nurses station natalie held her ground i wanted to do the right thing he has some neurologic findings well this isnt the right thing the findings like everything else about him are the result of alcohol you know i had heard from a number of people that you were too arrogant and hardedged to be a good doctor just because you had fifteen minutes of fame doesnt mean you can step in here and act as if youre in charge of the place and just because you like to keep your clinic coat from getting soiled doesnt mean you can brush off patients like this man natalie shot back bev richardson quickly inserted herself between the two combatants it was my fault cliff she said was worried about this man and thought it would be a good learning experience for thats nonsense and you know it dont protect her he stepped to his left to get a clear line of sight at natalie there is no place in medicine for anyone as selfabsorbed and conceited as you are reyes natalies jaws clenched she was furious at being rebuked so publicly and anxious to have all the witnesses know why renfros prejudices had led him to do an inadequate job in evaluating this downandouter at least i care enough about people like charlie here to do a complete evaluation on him five years as a doctor have made me perfectly capable of deciding what is and is not a complete evaluation i intend to make sure that anyone at the medical school who will listen learns about you and whats happened here well i think before you do that you should see what this mans ct scan shows renfros glare could have melted block ice he looked as if he were going to say something else then turned and stalked off toward x ray two exquisitely tense minutes later a ct tech came and wheeled charlie away natalie sighed her relief whew i was certain he was going to cancel the test out of spite she said as she and bev walked back to the nurses station the seasoned nurse looked at her and shook her head im sorry i couldnt get him to calm down she said there was probably a better way to have done this renfro could have admitted he was wrong natalie said the fact that he went ahead with the scan says as much when they find a tumor behind poor charlies eye hes going to be grateful i saved his bacon tumor abscess leaking aneurysm in her mind natalie was already projecting the reactions of renfro and the staff when her approach to the man was vindicated hopefully whatever the poor guy had would be operable she thought about how her mentor surgeon doug berenger would react to her coup midway through her undergraduate years at harvard well before the incident that tore her achilles he had sought her out and offered her a position working in his lab a job she still held later he had brought together the best sports medicine people around to aid in her recovery and still later he had talked her into attending med school berenger perhaps the foremost cardiac transplant surgeon in boston if not in the country was already talking about a fellowship in his department when her surgical training was complete he had a framed sampler hung on the wall behind his desk chair believe in yourself he would be damn proud of the way she had believed in herself and held her ground against renfros unnecessary onslaught especially when charlies diagnosis became known natalie went into room and worked up the three patients waiting there her pulse continued to race in part fallout from the acrid exchange with renfro and in part from the excitement of soon getting the re suits of the lab work and scan on her patient finally through the doorway of room she saw renfro pass by wheeling charlie on his stretcher a manila xray envelope was tucked under the thin mattress moments later the resident called out her name dr reyes staff he said quite loudly could i have you all out here please a group of perhaps a dozen stepped quietly into the hallway renfro waited until it seemed there would be no more and then continued holding up the envelope with the ct scan for emphasis you were all here a little while ago for theurndiscussion about patient care that occurred between ms reyes and myself well i have all the lab work and the ct back on our patient i would like to inform you that there is nothing abnormal on any of them nothing charlie here has just what i said he had just what he always has ms reyes an alcoholinduced headache he had a blood alcohol of one hundred and ninety when he came in and i dont suspect its much lower now since he just managed to get at the pint of thunderbird in the jacket in his clothing bag bev please discharge this man for the second time be sure to fill out an incident report ms reyes go home i dont ever want to see you on my service again chapter until philosophers are kingscities will never have rest from their evils no nor the human race plato the republic book v early afternoon was clearly one of the better times to shop at the whole foods market natalie would have had no reason to know that fact until today with her mothers grocery list in one hand and hers in the other she made her way up and down the uncrowded aisles in no particular hurry it had been three hours since she was booted out of the metropolitan hospital er by cliff renfro and for the moment at least she had more time on her hands than she had things to do tomorrow she would make an appointment with her advisor and maybe with doug berenger and together they would straighten things out it wasnt as if anyone had gotten hurt compared to a hemostat being left in an abdomen or a lethal medication error or the wrong leg being amputated the events in the er were small potatoes if she was guilty of anything and in truth she didnt believe she was it was a crime with no victim as bev richardson had said even though renfro was well along in his training he was still immature for the time being natalie and he were destined to be enemies at least until she got the chance to prove to him what a dedicated driven caring physician she was at the worst she would have to complete her er rotation elsewhere ideally after a day or two of cooling off perhaps the two of them could meet and patch things up on the spot and with her promise not to repeat what she had done she could resume the rotation where she left off the foods natalie picked up for herself were the freshest and healthiest whole foods markets noted for their produce and seafood were the only places she would shop the ridiculous hours of medical school were unavoidable but in her soul she was still an athlete she worked out as much as possible often at absurdly early or late hours her repaired achilles tendon would keep her from ever coming close to the worldclass times that were once routine but as she got older she could see the day approaching when her times for various distances in her age group would be competitive if not among the leaders goals always goals having them pushing toward them reinventing them along with the care she gave her body never being without welldefined goals was the secret to her success in school and in sports she grimaced as she scanned down her mothers list dictated to her last night over the phone steak frozen fries pecan rolls cherry garcia ice cream trail mix hot dogs and buns whole milk whipped cream pringleshalf of the items whole foods wouldnt even deign to carry hermina reyes was a piece of work beloved by so many yet as abusive of herself and her body as natalie was meticulous a bigger concern for natalie however was her niece jenny hermina was responsible for most of the girls meals with that fact in mind she added some broccoli yams cheese and salad to her mothers order at the bottom of the list natalie had reluctantly penned in winstons one carton after it she had written a note to herself optional she laughed ruefully more often than not in what she knew was a futile gesture of protest she refused to buy her mothers cigarettes it didnt matter hermina had a car and didnt hesitate to leave jenny at home for brief periods plus there were others the woman could call on plenty of them who knew an unbreakable bond when they saw it they also knew that if there were ever justification for smoking the death of ones child was it hermina would be wedded to her winstons until the day she died more than likely at the hands of her beloved cancer sticks natalie spent a leisurely half hour selecting her own fruits and vegetables with the vast summer selection she felt especially fortunate to care about such things particularly today with a few hours of unexpected free time on her hands she really had to try harder to be more tolerant of people like renfro she was thinking as she squeezed then tapped then shook a honeydew testing for ripeness first thing in the morning she would do whatever was necessary to straighten things out with him whole foods was far too responsible to sell cigarettes so after loading eight plastic bags of groceries into the trunk of her subaru natalie trotted across the street to a pharmacy it wouldnt be a problem showing up at her mothers place earlier than expected the time when hermina knew the details of her life and schedule had passed long ago so there wouldnt be any but the most cursory questions about why she wasnt in the er nor was there much chance that hermina would be out with jenny to care for she tended to stay pretty much close to home when the girl wasnt at school dorchester a rapidly aging gritty community directly south of the city was just a few miles along route from natalies quaint brookline apartment but sociologically and demographically the two towns were widely distant small pockets of elegant wellmaintained homes still survived in dorchester but they were islands in a sea of poverty inv migrants drugs and too often violence natalie pulled to the curb and popped the trunk in front of a peeling gray clapboard duplex with a small dirt lawn and a sagging front porch she had left home shortly after her mothers move to this place but her younger sister elena who was eight at the time had grown up there and until the accident lived there when she wasnt in detox or rehab natalie doubted there was anyone in dorchester who didnt know that hermina reyes kept her house key under a withered potted plant by the door theres an advantage to having nothing to steal her mother liked to say as always the pungent odor of burnt and burning cigarettes hit natalie the moment she opened the door health inspector ditch the butts she called out hauling five bags at once down the hall and into the kitchen the flat was as always neatly kept and clean including herminas decadesold fenway park ashtray which she ritually emptied and washed down after every second or third smoke mom hermina was usually ensconced at the kitchen table with a cup of halfconsumed coffee a box of vanilla wafers her winstons the ashtray and a book of sunday new york times crossword puzzles in fact all of her accoutrements were in place but not the woman herself natalie set the groceries on the floor and hurried to her mothers room mom she called again shes taking a nap jenny called out natalie followed her nieces voice to her prim and feminine room lace curtains pink walls jenny dressed in shorts and a floppy sweatshirt sat in her wheelchair a book propped up in the apparatus that made it easier for her to turn the pages the ankle braces that enabled her to walk with crutches lay on the floor by her bed jennys official diagnosis was mild cerebral palsy but elena had used and drank and smoked throughout her pregnancy and now that natalie knew what fetal alcohol syndrome was that diagnosis had taken the top spot on her list of the possible causes of the girls disabilities hey babe natalie said kissing her on the forehead whats happening staff day today no school jenny had the creamy skin and wide engaging smile of her mother gram was awake for a while doing her puzzle then she just went to bed if i ever ever catch you with a cigarette let me try let me try this time youre going to break both of my lips actually i like the sound of that what are you reading wuthering heights have you read it a while back i think i loved it but i also think i had some trouble following it youre not having trouble with the way time and the scenes bounce all over the place oh no its so romantic i would love to visit the moors someday if theyre still there oh theyre still there well go i promise natalie stepped to where her crippled niece couldnt see the sadness in her eyes jenny you make everyone around you a better person including me now whats that supposed to mean nothing that serious listen you want to come in and help me wake gram no thanks i want to read a bit more heathcliff isnt very nice to people as i recall when he was young people werent very nice to him either its like a vicious cycle precisely are you sure youre ten almost eleven hermina wearing a print housedress had dozed off on the bed a cigarette burnt down to the filter was still smoldering in a saucer on the bedside table the kitchen was still her favorite spot but more and more over recent months this was the scene that greeted natalie either here in the bedroom or on the sofa in the living room the cigarettes were taking their toll on her mothers oxygen levels and stamina before too much longer a green oxygen tank on a roller would be accompanying her wherever she was hey you natalie said gently shaking the woman awake hermina rubbed at her eyes and then propped herself on one elbow i expected you later she said somewhat dreamily natalie was bothered by the unnatural depth of her sleep when she had been awake enough to light up a cigarette that was still burning at fiftyfour this once vibrant and entrancingly beautiful woman was aging rapidly and growing more leatheryskinned with every butt her cocoa complexion was much darker than natalies understandable given that natalies father whoever he really was was white but unlike her deteriorating skin herminas wide hazel eyes were playful intelligent alluring and virtually identical to natalies ma youve got to stop smoking in here natalie said helping her up and into the kitchen i almost never do it anymore i can tell youre not attractive when youre cynical hermina was cape verdean she was brought to the states by her parents when she was jennys age and still retained more than the hint of a portuguese accent by the time she was nineteen she had graduated from high school and was a certified nurses aide with plans to go to nursing school that was when she became a single parent for the first time jenny seems okay shes doing fine thats good there was a brief uncomfortable silence to hermina jenny was elena and no matter how many rehabs had given daughter number two the gate no matter how fast the police said she was driving when she slammed through the guardrail hermina always considered her to have been the victim of external circumstances daughter number one who had run away from home at fifteen was another story if hermina reyes knew nothing else she knew how to harbor a grudge and in this household elena was still and always would be the child of choice the grocery shopping the monthly checks the trophies the harvard degree and soon the one from medical school still didnt balance off the hurt natalie had brought on her mother so help me out here hermina said picking up her pencil and pointedly turning her attention to the crossword puzzle in front of her eightletter word for nervous no idea im never nervous ma its wonderful that youre taking care of jenny the way you are but youve got to try not to smoke when shes in the house secondhand smoke is no different than firsthand when it comes to so what about you you seem tense there were many including natalie and her late sister who equated herminas remarkable intuitiveness with sorcery im okay she replied putting the groceries away just tired is all that doctor you were seeing hasnt worked out rick and i are still on good terms let me guess he wanted a serious relationship but you just didnt love him sorcery the demands of the surgical residency im about to start make it hard to be available to someone else what about that terry who you brought over for dinner hes so nice and so very handsome hes also so very gay thats why i like him so much he doesnt want anything from me except my friendship and my company theres never any talk about commitment and moving our relationship to the next level ma believe me almost every one of my friends who is married or living with someone is miserable over it a good deal of the time just trying to make their relationship work absorbs ninety percent of their energy in this day and age love is temporary and marriage is unnatural the product of madison avenue advertising executives and television producers daughter i know youre long past listening to me but youve got to break through that hard shell of yours and let love in or youre going to be a very unhappy woman let love in natalie kept herself from speaking too soon or worse laughing out loud with two children born of different swains both long gone hermina reyes wasnt exactly the poster child for true love in her case at least from natalies viewpoint physical beauty had proven to be a mortal enemy still her enduring sense of romance trust in men and unflagging enthusiasm for life were as unfathomable as her inability to put away the winstons right now i dont have time to be unhappy you sure youre okay im fine why do you keep asking that no reason sometimes when i came to watch you run you would hold yourself before the race in a funny way an awkward uncomfortable way almost always when you did that you didnt run well and you lost youre sort of doing that here well nothings the matter ma trust me at that moment natalies cell phone announced a call the caller id displayed a number she didnt recognize hello natalie reyes yes this is dean goldenberg natalie stiffened then walked into the front hallway out of earshot from her mother yes natalie i wonder if youre free to come over to my office to discuss the incident this morning at metropolitan hospital i can be there in twenty or twentyfive minutes that will be fine please call my secretary when you are ten minutes away ookay goldenberg waited until natalie had a pencil then gave her the phone number of the medical school and his extension throughout their brief conversation she had tried unsuccessfully to get a read on his voice and now was stifling the urge to ask for the details of why she was being called in over the years dr sam goldenberg had expressed any number of times what a fan he had been of her running and also of her performance as a medical student whatever was up now they could work out she felt certain of it trouble hermina asked as she returned to the kitchen nothing that drastic just some problems with my schedule at school but i do have to rush off sorry thats okay ill be back to see you both before long that would be wonderful take care of yourself you too ma jenny ill see you again soon i love you aunty nat i love you too babe panicked hermina said what that eightletter word for nervous its panicked natalies teenage years had been written up in a number of publications her tumultuous struggles on the streets of boston ended after almost a year when workers at an agency called bridge over troubled waters managed to convince her and the edith newhouse school for girls in cambridge that the two of them were potentially a good match it then took many months in the school before an uneasy truce with the teachers and administration enabled her to discover her talent for track and for academic success three and a half years later she started at harvard after her graduation from college in addition to training and racing natalie worked in the laboratory of dr doug berenger then and now a huge booster of hers and of harvard track by the time of her injury at the olympic trials she had her name as coauthor on half a dozen papers for research work performed with the cardiac surgeon and his team she had also taken all of the required courses for medical school admission sooner or later she probably would have applied anyhow but the accidental step onto her achilles tendon by the woman running in second place definitely sped up the timetable for as long as natalie had been affiliated with the medical school dr sam goldenberg had been dean an endocrinologist by trade he was as kindly and concerned a man as he was brilliant clearly dedicated to the principle that getting into medical school should be much harder and more stressful than staying there as requested by goldenberg natalie had called his office when she was ten minutes out now she sat in his comfortably appointed waiting area and tried to work out phrasing by which she could underscore that no one had been hurt by her ordering the tests she did but that she understood there might have been better ways she could have handled the situation all she wanted now was to make things right with cliff renfro and get back to work she had been there just a few minutes when goldenberg came out shook her hand with an uncharacteristic lack of warmth thanked her for being so prompt and escorted her into his office standing by chairs at his conference table their faces grim and troubled were her closest allies on the medical school staff doug berenger and terry millwood and her friend veronica kelly cherubic exceedingly bright and often more intolerant of pompous selfimportant professors than even natalie herself the sudden chill through natalies spine had nothing to do with the temperature of the office both surgeons shook her hand formally veronica with whom she had traveled to hawaii and once to europe smiled tensely and nodded the two of them enjoyed boston together as often as busy med students could manage and veronicas stockbroker boyfriend was responsible for fixing natalie up whenever her resistance slipped below the im fine really i am level goldenberg motioned everyone to sit and took his place at the table natalies expectations of charming the dean and making whatever reparations were necessary toward cliff renfro began to evaporate ms reyes goldenberg began i want you to read the notarized statements submitted to my office at my request by dr clifford renfro and mrs beverly richardson the nurse who was present at the time of this mornings incident then i would ask if your account of the events would differ substantially from theirs still astonished that things had moved forward so swiftly and forcefully natalie read through the statements aside from a word here and there both were in concordance and were accurate bev richardson did her best to explain what she felt natalies mindset was at the time however she also stated nearly verbatim the clash with renfro on paper the statements were cold and damning natalie felt the earliest grip of fear and flashed momentarily on the eightletter word in her mothers crossword puzzle both of these are substantially accurate she managed but i dont think they capture the motivation behind what i was trying to do nat berenger said i promise you that we understand that there was nothing overtly malicious in your motives seated next to berenger millwood nodded his agreement ill be more than happy to admit that what i did was wrong and to apologize to dr renfro im afraid its not that simple ms reyes goldenberg said dr schmidt who as you know is dr renfros chief of surgery has insisted that you are unfit to be a physician and he has demanded that you be expelled from the medical school the words were a dagger thrust into natalies chest i cant believe this my grades have been honors level and as far as i know my clinical work has been strong actually goldenberg said while there has never been anything negative reported about your work with patients there have been several complaints suggesting a consistent lack of respect for authority an intolerance for some of your residents and even some of your classmates and an arrogance that one faculty member has suggested could be a source of serious problems in the years to come i just cant believe this natalie said again my only incident with a classmate that i know of was when i refused to partner with him because he was throwing cadaver parts around the anatomy lab excuse me dean for breaking in here veronica said but i feel as if i need to back natalie up on this one when dr millwood called and told me what was happening i asked him to find out if i could come i appreciate your allowing me to the student natalie was speaking of was to tally inappropriate and deserved her response natalie and i have been close friends since before we started med school i wanted to make sure you knew how wellliked and respected she is among almost all the students men and women and also how difficult dr renfro can be at times he and i clashed more than once during my surgical rotation but you never ended up being reported to me goldenberg said no veronica said clearly deflated no i didnt thank you ms kelly nat millwood said didnt you stop to think about the trouble you were asking for by bringing back a patient that a senior resident had discharged without even consulting him natalie shook her head i know now that it was wrong but i was upset with dr renfro and all i was thinking about was the patient a poor old drunk whom i felt was being booted out of the hospital without a complete evaluation of his problems millwood turned to goldenberg as did berenger natalie watched her future unfold in an unspoken threeway conversation battling back the kneejerk urge simply to say oh screw this i quit veronica probably sensing that subtly raised a calming hand finally goldenberg nodded that he had reached a decision and turned to natalie ms reyes there are a number of faculty members including your two biggest boosters here who have written glowing evaluations about your potential to be an exceptional physician i also appreciate the effort your friend ms kelly has made to be here today as well as the things she has had to say i know for a fact that you are being seriously considered for selection into the alpha omega alpha medical honor society i can assure you now that will not happen you are an unusual person with many fine qualities but there is an edge to you call it hardness call it arrogance that will contribute nothing toward making you the sort of physician we want to graduate from this school with the help of your supporters here i have decided that expulsion is too severe a punishment for what you have done but not by much as of today you are suspended for four months if there are no further incidents after that you will graduate with the next class after yours other than a legal challenge in court there is no mechanism in place for reconsideration of this decision do you have any questions my residency nat well go over the possibilities for you later berenger said i can tell you that your place in the surgical program at white memorial will be filled by someone else jesus what about my work in your lab berenger got tacit approval from goldenberg before responding you can still work for me and even attend grand rounds and any other conferences you wish making this decision doesnt please any of us goldenberg said it seems too harsh to me natalie said coolly much closer to an angry outburst than to tears possibly possibly so but it is the hand you have dealt yourself tell me one thing dean goldenberg would we still be sitting here if the ct scan i ordered on that poor man had shown a large clot pressing on his brain across from her terry rolled his eyes and sighed veronica shook her head sam goldenberg seemed almost ready for the question he fixed some papers in front of him then leveled his gaze at her since part of the issue here is your assault on dr renfros clinical judgment i feel the need to remind you that there was no such clot the ct scan on which you staked your medical school career was normal ms reyes absolutely normal for nearly ten seconds after the final passage of beethovens violin sonata in f had drifted through queen elizabeth hall there was absolute silence then as one the audience erupted leaping to its feet drowning out the quivering echo of the last note with shouts and applause bravo huzzah wunderbar the seventeenyearold beauty cradling her twohundred and ninety year old stradivarius as if it were a newborn babe beamed as she gazed out across the throng she looked too small for the stage but everyone who knew music and that was most of those in the hall knew she was a titan her accompanist took his bows and then left the stage so that she might bask in her return to performing the moment many had felt might never come standing in the tenth row center an indian man resplendent in his tuxedo continued applauding as he turned to his taller companion well i am very proud of her and very proud of us the other man square jawed and elegant said the scar down her chest has barely healed and yet there she is beautiful just beautiful i dont think ive ever heard the spring sonata played with more feeling or technical brilliance as was the guardians policy the men never spoke one anothers names in public and even on their frequent conference calls used only greek pseudonyms which each of their members was required to commit to memory the tumultuous applause continued and the young virtuoso destined now to enthrall the world for decades to come took one curtain call after another those roses she is carrying are from us the indian said nice touch i agree thank you you know it is amazing what the minor addition of a new heart and lungs can accomplish in the right body chapter the unexamined life is not worth living plato apology nailed ben callahan set the stack of fivebyseven glossies on his desk then popped two zantac antacid pills into the back of his throat and washed them down with his third cup of coffee of the morning another shitty beginning of another shitty day maybe it was time to give his friendly neighborhood career counselor a try outside a chilly vertical rain was snapping against the grime on his office window yesterday it had reached with a humidity of like a thousand today fiftyfive and pouring summer in chicago you just couldnt beat it ben spread the photos across the desk in two rows god but sometimes he detested earning a living this way he would have detested it even if the living he was earning amounted to anything substantial which it most certainly did not well at least katherine de souci would be happy she had demanded that ben nail the bastard and now robert de souci had in fact been nailed although not quite in the way katherine had expected so what if robert was active on the board of a dozen or more charitable foundations so what if he was from all ben had been able to ascertain a terrific father and enlightened corporate ceo katherine whom ben had come to think of as something of an amalgam of lizzie borden and his exwife had her suspicions of infidelity and now thanks to crackerjack private detective make that private eye benjamin michael callahan she had her proof and soon she would have her gazillions in settlement as well as her husbands surpassingly handsome head on a platter there were just two problems roberts secret lover was a he not the she katherine had expected and the significant other in question was a man ben knew well caleb johnson a pillar of the black community was arguably the finest fairest most intelligent criminal judge in the region it was possible the judge could survive this looming scandal but not without a significant reduction in his influence on the bench and around the country and this was a man who had earned and deserved all the influence he possessed ben flipped the edge of a small stack of unopened bills with his thumb katherine de soucis check would make every one of them disappear like david copperfield with enough cash left over to actually buy something he slid the photos back into their manila envelope and prepared to call katherine who in the hell cared what the fallout might be he had been given a job he had taken it he had spent the advance and most of the per diems he had done the work case closed admittedly this career had been something of a miscalculation on his part but when he chose it he was legitimately excited about becoming a detective in the mold of his fictional heroes knightserrant like mike hammer travis mcgee and jim rockford he knew hed have to start slow at first taking whatever cases came in unfortunately those cases chasing bail jumpers philandering spouses and deadbeats of one kind or another remained his primary source of income and with few exceptions had never amounted to anything approaching noble not a single mysterious alluring dameindistress in the bunch now he was about to take a pile of money from someone he didnt like in exchange for ruining the lives of two men he respected de souci and johnson should have been more discreet he tried to reason there were all those under funded charities and all those africanamerican kids looking for role models who were counting on them they should have thought things through a little more there were ways the guys could have stayed undetectable or at least more undetectable but for whatever reason maybe just the blindness of love they had chosen not to take them now there were photos ben picked up the phone dialed katherines number and as usual went through her private secretary to speak with her you have something for me the socialite asked without even deigning to say hello her voice grated over the phone ben flashed on her perfectly madeup face so proud so tight so haughty in a life already boringly full of possessions privilege and victories he had uncovered the evidence that would make her day katherine de souci come on down youre a winner and youre next on the price is right for several moments there was only silence well she persisted urnactually i dont have anything mrs de souci nothing i think your husbands clean but and the truth is i dont think i can take any more of your money if you want to keep pushing this matter i would recommend you find someone else but goodbye mrs de souci please be more careful judge roberts wife is vengeful he wrote on a blank piece of paper then he signed it a friend slid it in with the photos addressed the envelope to the judge with no return address marked it personal and confidential and set it aside until he left for whatever would pass today for lunch just in case he decided he would send it by registered mail outside the rain continued pelting the city within minutes any glow ben felt at so gloriously disappointing katherine de souci had given way to his usual baseline state of numbness and ennui it was hard to believe a life once marked by enthusiasm and a spirit of adventure had come to this it was even harder to believe that he really didnt care the phone had rung five or six times before he noticed and picked it up lo mr ben callahan a womans voice said yes the detective yes who is this this is professor alice gustafsons office calling okay department of anthropology at the university of chicago okay mr callahan you had an appointment to meet with professor gustafson fifteen minutes ago i had what ben shuffled through the papers on his desk until he found his appointment book optimistically containing a full page for each day of the year the name alice gustafson an address office number and the time fifteen minutes ago were written in his uneven scrawl on the page for today beneath the time were two words organ guard only now did he remember taking the call a week or so ago from a secretary who didnt exactly bubble over about the wonderful opportunity the job presented for him he had agreed to the appointment without bothering to tell the woman he still had absolutely no idea what it was about now it appeared he had missed it after four or five years in college and a stretch as a highschool social studies teacher he had rolled the dice and decided on life as a private detective now it seemed it was time for something else perhaps he would learn that he was better suited for life behind a hotdog pushcart or maybe his true calling was as an animal trainer iim sorry he said something came up and ive been delayed i guess the woman replied well professor gustafson says that if youd like to reschedule the interview she can see you at one today ben scratched at the reddish brown stubble of five oclock shadow that seemed to be appearing on his face earlier and earlier of late and stared down at the words in his book organ guard still no bells he really had to start paying more attention this appointment he said can you refresh me a little even over the phone he could hear the woman sigh you responded to an ad we placed in the papers about a year ago requesting your services for organ guard at the time we informed you and those others who responded that we were putting together a database of investigators for future jobs you encouraged us to include you this has to be bullshit ben was thinking he couldnt remember the last time he had encouraged anyone to do anything so what is this interview about again a sigh mr callahan i believe professor gustafson has some work for you and money to pay for it i believe so yes so will we see you at one ben pulled his keyboard over and moved to go online to search for organ guard then remembered that his browser service had been disconnected for the usual reason well at least this didnt seem to be another stalkandgawk infidelity job after lady katherine de souci he might not have another one of those left in him one oclock he heard himself say ill be there ben was certain he had an umbrella someplace but never used it after checking the closet off his small deserted waiting room he gave up looking a cab was a possibility but also an expense and one of the remaining spoils of his years as a teacher was a decent trench coat head down wearing the belted coat and a cubs cap he pushed twelve blocks through a penetrating rain ducking into entryways for relief every minute or two haskell hall on fiftyninth was an expansive powerful stone building with deeply carved openings anchoring a wellmaintained treelined quad alice t gustafson phd medical anthropology was on a small brassembossed plaque beside the door of her thirdfloor office beneath it a smaller plaque letters mechanically carved in white into black plastic read organ guard international the door was locked ben knocked softly and then a little louder it was just as well he thought what he really needed to do at this point was to hunker down in his apartment with his cat pincus and figure out what he wanted to do with his life if in fact he wanted to do anything at all what about sales everybody needed a mazda or a vacuum cleaner he moved to knock again then thought the hell with it and turned to go a woman arms folded was standing just a dozen or so feet away appraising him her plaid longsleeved shirt was tucked into carpenters chinos and cinched around her narrow waist with a broad leather belt and heavy silver buckle she was sixty or so with goldrimmed glasses a narrow intelligent professors face and graying dark hair fixed in a short ponytail bens take on the woman especially after three weeks of katherine de souci was decidedly positive mr callahan im professor alice gustafson she said sorry if i startled you only a little i guess i just flunked the catlikesenses part of my professional evaluation ben shook her narrow hand which it was sadly easy to tell had the firm swelling of chronic arthritis in the knuckles years of walking places where i didnt want to disturb the people or startle the wildlife have given me a fairly soft tread she understated opening her office with a key and ben noted with some difficulty the space was surprisingly roomy but also cluttered and cozy one wall held two eightfoothigh windows and opposite them were floortoceiling bookcases piled to overflowing with academic tomes bound and loose journals and even a few works of fiction in one corner a tall glassenclosed case held dozens of artifacts of various kinds unlabeled and arranged in no discernible order on the back wall were a number of framed photos of people mostly men and all of them brown or black skinned most of the men were displaying scars on their sides and none of them looked either prosperous or happy coffee gustafson asked gesturing to a mr coffee in the corner as she settled in behind a busy massive antique oak desk and in front of a sixfootwide world map festooned with pushpins ben shook his head and took the chair opposite her there was an odd appealing mix of intensity and serenity in the womans face iim embarrassed to say that i dont really remember answering your ad he said so libby our department secretary told me well no matter youre here ben looked about im here he said but you have no idea where here is is that right i suppose you could say that the professor studied him for a time and ben sensed that she was close to thanking him for coming and sending him back to whatever rock he had crawled out from he wouldnt have blamed her in the least and sadly it wouldnt really have mattered to him was he in a depression midlife crisis probably both but that didnt matter either maybe instead of the friendly neighborhood career counselor he should pay a visit to the friendly neighborhood psychopharmacologist i think you should know gustafson said finally that youre not the first detective ive interviewed for this job youre the third why did you reject the first two i didnt neither of them wanted it not enough money ben asked knowing from his experience with others in his clan that there was little likelihood of any other possibility a year or so ago it looked like we were going to get a grant to expand the investigative enforcementoriented portion of our work thats why i placed the ad i did to try and line up the right people for the job then the source of our grant decided to spend their money elsewhere now another foundation actually has delivered its not much but it is something congratulations would you like to hear what this is all about thats okay whatever it is im not up for it ben was thinking go on his voice said gustafson took a small pile of twicefolded pamphlets from her drawer and handed one over it was entitled underworld organ trafficking and subtitled the worlds problem trafficking in human organs is illegal in most countries in the world she began as ben scanned the pamphlet yet it continues to happen at an alarming rate the donors of these illicitly procured organs may be dead in that deadnot quite deadmiddle ground or very much alive but what almost all of them have in common is that they are impoverished there are buyers sellers brokers hospitals clinics and surgeons involved and believe me mr callahan the amount of money changing hands in this secret outlaw world is considerable millions upon millions of dollars ben set the pamphlet aside tell me something dr gustafson he said an impoverished person is desperate for money and a person with means is desperate for a kidney or liver or whatever yes if it is a crime for someone to broker the exchange of an organ for cash who is the victim of the crime and perhaps just as importantly does anyone care ill answer the second of your questions first mr callahan we care seldom do any of the donors end up with what they expected as usual they are the needy taken advantage of by those with more if you need an analogy think of a poor young woman who is encouraged by a pimp with money to sell herself as a prostitute organ guard is one of just two watchdog agencies of its kind but our membership is steadily growing countries around the world are beginning to see the need to commit some of their resources to this problem and as you will see even here in the states situations are arising you say governments are committing resources to the problem ben said but i have this feeling there may be at least some exaggeration in that claim again gustafson studied him progress in this area is slow she acknowledged grudgingly ill give you that but it is happening when we provide authorities in any number of countries with hard evidence of illegal organ trafficking arrests are made congratulations ben said again not knowing what else to say and hoping he didnt sound cynical or insincere in a world rife with disease terrorism dictatorships drugs prostitution political corruption and corporate vice alice gustafsons cause was fringe she was dona quixote an idealist tilting against the injustice of a crime in which there were no victims and aside from an occasional investigative article in the times precious little interest if you dont mind my asking mr callahan what made you become a private investigator im not sure i know anymore i used to teach school but the principal thought my classes were too unstructured and i didnt discipline the kids enough the kids loved me and i loved them well most of them but he said that really didnt matter nice i never read his reference letter but the results of my search for another teaching job suggested it wasnt exactly glowing reading detective novels was always a passion of mine so i thought id give it a try i sort of saw myself as the best parts of each of those guys that would be quite a man john d macdonald is my personal favorite author i think ive read almost everything he ever wrote his travis mcgee was the man as far as i was concerned gustafsons laugh was natural and uninhibited well who wouldnt want to live on a houseboat in florida and rescue beautiful women in distress ben flashed on katherine de souci the problem is i forgot that all of my role models and their beautiful women were fictional living in the real world is often a daunting task for all of us the professor leaned back in her chair tapping her fingertips together clearly trying to decide if it was worth continuing or whether she should simply move on to detective number four so she said the decision apparently made speaking of florida are you still interested in learning about the job because thats where we would be sending you professor gustafson i would be lying if i said i have any real interest in your cause i admire your owning that mr callahan candor is always appreciated here theres a fine line between candor and just not caring professor i seewell take a look at these photos they were sent to me by a coroner in fort pierce florida named stanley woyczek who used to study medical anthropology with me he knows all about organ guard you may be right about illicit organ trafficking being a victimless crime but then again over the years ben had seen a number of coroners photos in black and white and as these were in color still these images caused him to inhale sharply the cadaver a man in his twenties had been bludgeoned to a pulp he was wandering across a largely deserted highway at three in the morning when he was hit by a tractortrailer gustafson explained according to stanley death was instantaneous i imagine so when youre ready take a look at the bottom three photos his buttocks actually the area just above the buttocks stanley writes that he is absolutely certain this man was a bone marrow donor within a day of his death so so hes called every hospital and clinic and hematologist in the area and as far as he can tell this man was a patient of none of them identification none fingerprints no match goodness and there is no doubt in the coroners mind about him being a marrow donor for the moment you can make that unwilling marrow donor ill bet theres a simple logical explanation perhaps but take a look at this gustafson passed across a file folder with a single word ramirez handwritten on the tab the contents included a tape cassette typed transcript several photographs and two newspaper articles one carefully cut from the hallowell reporter in hallowell maine and the other from the national enquirer both articles were from about fourteen months ago ben chose to start with the more spectacular of the two vampires sucked my body dry modernday vampires use rv to scoop up victim needles to sock out blood the brief article complete with photos recounted the claim of juanita ramirez a fiftyyearold motel housekeeper that she had been drugged blindfolded kidnapped held prisoner in the back of a mobile home then experimented on by vampires claiming to be doctors a physician who examined ramirez after the alleged abduction found evidence that her bone marrow had been sucked out through large needles twisted into the bone of her hip one of the photos from the paper allegedly a shot of the skin just above her buttocks bore a striking resemblance to the one sent by gustafsons former student stanley woyczek didnt know anything about this other case when he sent me the photos gustafson said how on earth did you learn about it ben asked gustafsons smile was enigmatic some people read newspapers when theyre not working some watch television some play around on ebay i google things lots of things it relaxes me that other article the smaller one quotes an osteopathic doctor in the north woods of maine as saying that this womans bone marrow may have been taken i went up and interviewed both juanita and the doctor she describes a big gray mobile home with some sort of dark decorations on the side even before this packet from stanley i believed someone had in fact kidnapped this woman aspirated her bone marrow and subsequent to her procedure blindfolded her and dropped her off someplace but why that mr callahan is why we need a detective i would do this my self but i have courses to teach and besides my arthritis is giving me a devil of a time sneaking in disguise into hospitals in turkey or moldova or south africa in order to expose organ traffickers may be a thing of the past for me i truly hope not professor why thank you so why florida i thought your interest was focused on third world countries mostly because thats where the action is right now if we can come up with something organized in this country anything at all i suspect we wouldnt have to worry nearly so much about funding and even though having bone marrow taken might not be as debilitating as losing a kidney or liver or heart its still organ theft the womans story and flimsy evidence didnt leave ben any more taken with organ guard or its mission nor did he believe there was anything more sinister surrounding the young mans death in florida than the grille of a tractortrailer but he was absolutely impressed with alice gustafson and in truth jealous of her passion as well im afraid the foundation grant we have is not very large mr callahan that sounds ominous would you be willing to go to florida and see if you can find the identity of the unfortunate man in that photo and perhaps piece together what happened to him im not licensed in florida that shouldnt get in your way im sure at one time or another you have followed people into other states i have besides my former student stanley knows the police in his area well he has promised to put me in touch with them i dont think hell have trouble doing the same for you havent the police been working on the case technically there hasnt been a crime committed so i dont think they are devoting too much energy to identifying the victim besides they have many cases going on at the same time you will have only one are you interested ben was about to say something about how busy he was but there was nothing about this woman that suggested shed believe him in anything but the truth how long do i have he asked instead we can afford your plane fare coach and eight days at one hundred and fifty dollars a day plus expenses make that reasonable expenses ben tried to keep his black humor in check katherine de souci had been paying him a hundred and fifty an hour i understand why youre having trouble getting someone he managed i would think that anyone who would work for that little wouldnt be someone youd want you are someone i want gustafson said you have the honesty to tell me you dont care for our cause and the intellect to have succeeded at least by my standards as a teacher what if i need more time i doubt the organ guard committee on enforcement would authorize any further expenditure on you whos the committee on enforcement ben asked alice gustafson grinned modestly that would be me chapter there can be no doubt that the elder must rule the younger plato the republic book iii the st clements high school track a quartermile banked cork oval was natalies favorite in the city because it was neither near her apartment nor the medical school she didnt run on it as much as she would have liked today though reexperiencing the pleasures of working out on such a nearperfect surface she promised herself that situation would change from as far back as she could remember she had known that she could run fast and at times over the year before she entered newhouse when she was putting herself in one unsafe situation after another the ability was lifesaving a gym instructor at the school timed her at several distances and quickly referred her for training to a friend who just happened to coach track at harvard by the time she was accepted into the college she had broken several highschool records and had established herself as a star at the middle distances sometime in her junior year following publication in the globe of an article about her doug berenger came to watch her train he had been a decent runner at harvard though far from a recordbreaker after lunch together the following week he invited her to work in his lab provided she could do so without interfering with her running the two of them had been a team of sorts ever since at eleven in the morning the air was warmer than she would have preferred but the track seemed to absorb the heat and hold it at bay after just ten minutes of easy jogging her achilles was already thanking her for the relief from running on the roads wearing maroon warmup pants a narrowstrapped tee and a white sweatband around her forehead and ebony hair she loped effortlessly through a turn searching for terry millwood she was almost three weeks into her fourmonth suspension from school an unmerited punishment she believed that effectively moved her back a year from the class with which she started and ended her residency appointment at white memorial not a day had passed without recurrent sparks of anger directed at cliff renfro his surgical chief at white memorial or dean goldenberg at thirtyfive she had precious little time to waste getting to where she wanted to be professionally now thanks to them she had no choice but to hurry up and wait up ahead millwood slipped through the gate and onto the track waving when he saw her at six feet he was four inches taller than she was but whereas her physique was willowy wiry many would say his was burly and almost overly muscled millwood was a better than decent tennis player and good at most other sports as well but what he really excelled at was surgery at doug berengers urging natalie had begun hanging about the or even before she entered medical school her mentor was urbane and composed in almost every circumstance and was respected and revered as a cardiac transplant surgeon but during especially tense times in the or he could be a madman hyper and quite tough on the surgical crew millwood berengers protege on the transplant team was quite the opposite calm and positive even in the most critical gutwrenching crises natalies first case observing the man was the twelvehour replacement of a leaking aortic aneurysm and dysfunctional aortic valve he sang opera softly throughout the grueling eventually successful procedure not once raising his voice or losing his composure in her heart natalie knew she wanted to emulate millwood when make that if now it was her turn in the number one position at the table but in her head she suspected she would be more like the flamboyant volatile berenger so how goes it millwood asked moving in next to her midway down one of the straightaways ever had road rage maybe once well i have it all the time now whether im in a car or not and its directed at virtually everybody its a wonder i havent ground my teeth down to nubs have you seen someone you mean like a dentist at least youre still funny i love that you appreciate that im funny youre like the only one if you mean am i seeing my therapist dr fierstein and i are having miniappointments almost every day ten or fifteen minutes theyre all the same i tell her i feel like im going to kill someone anyone and she tells me that would probably only make matters worse sadly im not sure shes right when its appropriate doug and i will go to bat for you with one of the other surgical programs i promise you that but first ive got to come to peace with what ive done wrong in school and what i did wrong in the metro er she held up her hand to keep him from reiterating that in fact if she had done nothing wrong she would still be in school i know i know she said used together like that those are two of my least favorite words millwood said i know on your left a voice from behind called out two boys wearing the purple and white of perennial track powerhouse st clements flashed past them on the inside forcing them to move to the right then in unison the youths glanced back their expressions scornful condemnation of the policy that would allow just anyone onto their track easy millwood muttered they jail people for what youre thinking of doing you dont have a weapon anyhow dont be so sure so doug tells me youre spending quite a bit of time in the lab what else do i have to do the other techs want to kill me for making them look bad by being the first one in and the last one out only they dont appreciate that i dont have anything else to do they also dont know that just on general principles i want to kill them more what time did you say your shrink appointment was today you think im too angry i wouldnt be much of a friend if i just kept telling you that you were right all the time you know i adore you nat but i have to agree with what goldenberg said about that hard edge of yours getting in the way i am who i am you of all people should appreciate that you mean because im gay thats what i am i wouldnt want to change that even if i could which i cant the kind of person i am is another story and as wonderful as you are you have a chip the size of minnesota on your shoulder thats getting in the way of on your left once again the st clements runners rudely forced them to the right hey guys natalie called i dont think i want to see this millwood muttered up ahead the boys stopped and turned they were older than natalie had first thought probably juniors or seniors one of them curly blond hair some residual acne kept trotting effortlessly in place while the other swarthy and utterly selfassured took a step back toward them hands on hips head cocked natalie had no doubt that this was hardly the first time the youths had asserted themselves this way with recreational joggers she felt millwoods mute plea to forget the whole thing but there was no chance he was right that she didnt have a gun to shoot them with or a knife with which to carve them up but she did have her legs why didnt you just go around us she asked because were serious runners in training and youre joggers who could be running anyplace wrong answer natalie saw millwood step back arms folded is that so she said ill tell you what serious runners if either of you can beat this old brokendown lady jogger back around to this spot my friend and i will leave and go trot about someplace else but if you cant beat me in a quarter mile well keep our spot here and you two can move way to the outside or better still go sit down on the grass and watch until were finished the youths exchanged looks and smiled knowingly they were both good natalie realized maybe very good but hopefully not good enough she was a distance runner and a quarter mile was a sprint but at that moment she needed nothing more than to beat them no she needed to crush them natalie stepped out of her warmups as millwood moved aside ill call the start he said helpless to alter history in advance as she lined up on the outside of the two teens natalie felt the familiar fierce rush of competition course through her you are not going to beat meyou are not going to beat meyou are not going to send that man out of the er without a ct scan readyget setgo the youths were fast and arrogantly warm to the challenge of a race especially against an older woman jogging on the track with a middleaged man still within the first twenty yards natalie knew that unless they each had rockets strapped to their legs in reserve they were in for a rude surprise the two of them seemed about equal and ran that way shoulder to shoulder for a time natalie stayed back drafting in the twin shadows but a quarter of a mile was just that and she was in no mood to nip these rivals at the finish they both needed a profound attitude adjustment nothing close the blond was cliff renfro the darker one sam goldenberg hey fellas she called on your left the two looked back clearly startled that she wasnt far behind it took only that instant for her to burst between them and accelerate away whether or not the teens could have run better had they known how fast she was didnt really matter in a hundred races they would lose to her a hundred times only perhaps never again as badly as they did this day millwood had started the race halfway down one of the straightaways now he watched in some amusement as natalie pounded around the final curve and sprinted in not letting up until she had passed him the st clements boys were just finishing that last turn without looking back and battling not to show that she was even breathing hard natalie took her friend by the arm and led him down the track in a brisk jog happy now millwood asked less miserable she said it was early afternoon when natalie finished dropping off groceries for hermina and jenny and at her own apartment and arrived at the lab jenny upbeat as always had finished wuthering heights and started in on oliver twist as far as natalie was concerned unless her niece suddenly leapt out of her wheelchair and ran to play with the other kids god had some serious ground to make up even with berengers lab to go to empty time was weighing heavily the latest of what passed for a romantic relationship for her had ended quietly nearly three months ago and in truth she really hadnt missed it until now berenger and millwood had promised to help her land another residency spot but so far what preliminary inquiries she had made had produced nothing she had signed up for more time at the womens shelter where she had volunteered since college and had even enrolled in a knitting course at boston adult ed still having been forced to shift in an instant from fourth gear down to first her life felt as if it were moving in slow motion in addition to the track and the roads the lab was a godsend a place she could stay productive she was one of a team of three assigned by berenger to a project examining the side effects of a new immunosuppressant drug still in the early phases of animal testing if the evaluations were encouraging somewhere down the line the drug might replace or augment one of the toxic medications currently in use to reduce the frequency and severity of transplant rejection natalie changed into light blue scrubs and a lab coat and took the elevator up to berengers impressive research suite on the ninth floor of the nichols building the two other members of the team spencer green and tonya levitskaya greeted her with their typical lack of enthusiasm given berengers intellect charisma variety of interests and superb surgical skill it was a wonder to natalie that either of them was still on the pay roll green a cadaverous dour phd who had never mastered the knack of getting grants had been with berenger for ten years and levitskaya a russianschooled resident on the transplant service now doing a sixmonth research fellowship seemed to have a deeply ingrained opinion on almost everything usually negative married in her late thirties and absolutely humorless levitskaya almost certainly had a crush on their mentor and so treated natalie as a rival berenger himself seemed oblivious to the continuously smoldering acrimony among his research team entering the lab natalie checked to be sure that the small animal procedure room was available then went to the holding area and returned with a cage of twelve specially bred white mice im using the animal room levitskaya said her dense accent vintage count dracula not already natalie sighed to herself the little lift that remained from putting the st clements boys in their place vanished i just stopped by there tonya she said with artificial cheer the rooms empty well i am about to use it tonya ill be done in twenty minutes just do it later tonya please dont do this im having a very tough time and or better still do it tonight while youre in here working until midnight and making the rest of us look lazy people skills natalie reminded herself thats what the dean and terry had said she needed to work on people skills tonya she said smiling sweetly if you dont back off and stop giving me a hard time im going to flatten your nose across your face there hows that for people skills levitskaya stepped forward she was a stocky woman a little taller than natalie and heavier by thirty pounds or more her crooked smile suggested she had faced challenges like this one before and wasnt even considering backing down damn natalie thought well whats the worst thing that can happen the last time she had been in a fistfight had been in her junior year at the newhouse school she had come away with fractures of her nose and one knuckle loudly claiming victory over the other girl who was virtually unscathed would she ever learn to pick fights with people she actually had a chance against how about in the hallway where we cant wreck anything she said resigned to taking a pounding ladies spencer green called out from across the lab ignoring the conflict he couldnt have helped but hear that was doug on the phone he says both of you are supposed to be in the followup clinic with him right now levitskayas eyes narrowed as if she were calculating whether she could finish natalie off and still make it to the clinic with minimal delay finally with a shrug that said some other time she headed out the door natalie debated staying with her mice but then put them back and followed berenger clearly considered her part of his service regardless of her standing in the medical school a gesture that was worth respecting the clinic space used by various services on different days was four examining rooms a consultation office and a small waiting area on the sixth floor of the hobbs building this afternoon was given to berengers transplant patients probably five or six of them he was averaging about two transplants every three weeks but the number would have been much higher had there been more donors as things were the number of people dying for want of a donor heart far exceeded the number saved by a transplant by the time natalie arrived at the clinic levitskaya was already in the consultation room mooning at berenger natalie was surprised to note that the womans respiratory rate was normal knowing she had to have sprinted over from the lab seated behind his desk berenger was every bit the med school professor of cardiac surgery squarejawed and steelyeyed with wonderful long fingers respected by patients students and faculty alike he was a worldrenowned lecturer and researcher yet most of the time as humble as such a man could be natalie had met his wife and teenage daughters on several occasions and knew enough to believe that if berenger cut any corners in his remarkably complex existence it was with them so he said there was some misunderstanding in the lab green we have straightened things out levitskaya said quickly smiling around nearly clenched teeth ready to go natalie added with exaggerated cheer i appreciate being included you both know this is all about teamwork right right the two women answered in unison well mr culver is in the next room hes three months postop tonya you know this man so brief natalie and bring her in to observe your evaluation natalie lets talk afterward the cardiac surgical resident led natalie to the hall then gave a thirtysecond totally unenthusiastic presentation of a fortysevenyearold truck driver who had developed cardiomyopathy heart swelling of unknown cause and managed to get a lifesaving transplant after two years of progressive cardiac failure with profound shortness of breath and massive fluid retention medically he had done quite well since the surgery culver first name carl was a husky swarthy man with thick brows a wide pancake face and disconcertingly small eyes but there was something even more unappealing than his appearance he reeked of cigarettes in her presentation levitskaya had made a point of saying that he was once a heavy smoker but had kicked the habit as his breathing deteriorated and he was made to see that his continued smoking would all but eliminate him from the transplant list clearly he had fallen off the abstinence wagon without so much as a greeting or a handshake the russian exploded goddamn it carl she said in a near shout you stink of cigarettes well i got laid off and my daughter got sick so no excuses do you have any idea how many hours and how much money went into putting that new heart into your chest to say nothing of the poor man who gave it to you or the many many others who did not get a chance at it and here you are smoking like a chimney doing your best to destroy it but no buts i am going to see if dr berenger even wants to speak with you if not then i want you to get out and only come back when you have stopped smoking again what a waste this is of a heart that could keep a nonsmoker alive for years she brushed past natalie and stormed from the room leaving carl culver bewildered frustrated and angry im sorry about your job mr culver natalie said thanks im sorry about the cigarettes doc i really am but its hard especially when things arent going well is your daughter very ill she had a seizure they thought she might have a brain tumor but it turned out to be migraines honest doc ill try to stop i really will you really need to keep trying natalie said moving forward and putting her hand on his shoulder your daughter needs you more than ever now i know its hard but youve really got to keep trying at that moment the door opened and berenger entered followed by a still crimsonfaced levitskaya over the ten minutes that followed natalies mentor put on an instructional clinic on how to be a doctor making constant honest eye contact with his patient reasoning not chastising asking about his family and his situation at home calming him down touching him reassuringly on the arm yet all the while counseling him on the dangers of continued smoking quiet stern concerned empathetic understanding unwavering i hear some wheezes carl he said after examining the trucker thats bad very bad now its time for you to go to work on this problem im going to refer you to our ssn program thats stop smoking now but the doctors and social workers there can only go so far youve got to do the rest i will dr berenger i promise i will you need to exercise more do you have a y near you ii think so i want you to stop at cardiac rehab on your way out of the hospital ill call and have them go over your exercise program again if there is a y theyll call the people there and sign you up if money is a problem talk to the ssn people they have some funds available now i did a beautiful job on you no more messing it up thanks doc ill do better i promise your family needs you the two men shook hands warmly and then berenger left culver in the room as he made calls and wrote out referrals finally he sent levitskaya back with the paperwork and instructions to move to the next patient when she was finished tonyas a very good surgeon he said when he and natalie were alone i believe she is did you really threaten to flatten her nose across her face i wasnt using my people skills sorry this isnt the time for me to act smart it was my fault i was feeling angry at the world and sorry for myself and i goaded tonya into fighting i see well youre both too valuable to my work to have you duking it out im paying you to do battle with the mysteries of science not with each other no more incidents no more incidents natalie echoed besides i suspect ol tonya would be a real brawler natalie grinned i was thinking the same thing so how would you like to get away from all this for a while excuse me away but not away as in im fired youre going to have to do a heck of a lot worse than threaten tonya to get me to fire you hows your portuguese third grade maybe possibly fourth im half cape verdean but i was infamous for never doing anything that might have pleased my mother and she desperately wanted me to speak the language you probably wont need it anyhow theres an international transplant meeting next week in brazil rio to be exact have you been there i raced in the university games in sao paulo but i never made it over to rio well i was planning to go and deliver a version of our graft versus host paper but my disc has been giving me a devil of a time and paul engle my neurosurgeon has recommended against long airplane flights or car rides i thought maybe you had some things you might want to get away from for a while and that was even before i caught you about to mix it up with my research fellow you want me to go to rio business class youre not just trying to keep me and tonya from killing each other firing you would be a lot less expensive natalie felt a surge of excitement the past three weeks had been worse even than those following her injury in the olympic trials her unnecessary humiliation of the highschool runners and the angry encounter with levuskaya were symptoms of her unraveling she was a pressure cooker plugged up and about to blow there was nothing she could use at the moment more than a change of scene when do you need to know she asked when can you let me know berenger responded how about now chapter the true physician is also a ruler having the human body as a subject and is not a mere moneymaker plato the republic book i the child was failing her name was marielle and despite the antibiotics and the iv fluids the oxygen and tiny feeding tube the six yearold was slipping away malnutrition was fanning the flames of infection in her abdomen and now her nervous system as well dr joe anson brushed some flies from her parched cracked lips and looked up helplessly at the nurse working in his hospital in an impoverished area thirty miles north of the capital city of yaounde anson had seen more than a few children die each one pained him worse than the last and even though there had been many victories they never seemed to balance off the defeats at that moment though four oclock in the morning the frail malnourished girl was not the only thing upsetting anson over the past hour there had been a steady increase in his own air hunger the sensation at its worst a horrible strangling claustrophobia was never completely gone anymore after almost seven years his primary pulmonary fibrosis progressive lung scarring was nearing the end of its course ppf cause unknown course inexorably downhill effective treatment none it was a rotten debilitating disease and sooner or later anson knew a transplant would be his only hope claudine he said in fluent cameroon french would you please get me a tank of oxygen and a mask the nurses eyes narrowed perhaps i should notify dr st pierre no let elizabeth sleepi will be fine with the oxygen he had to pause between sentences for an extra breath i am worried the nurse said i know claudine so am i anson strapped the polystyrene mask to his face and leaned forward so that gravity would pull his chest wall down and help expand his lungs he closed his eyes willing himself to calm down as he waited for the oxygen to banish the dreadful hunger five interminable minutes passed with no change then another five the situation could not get much worse the episodes of breathlessness were occurring more frequently and taking longer and longer to abate at some point some point soon it seemed the oxygen simply wouldnt be enough at some point unless he consented to a lung transplant and of course unless an appropriate donor could be found in time his heart would be unable to force enough blood through the scar tissue in his lungs medications would work for a short while but then his heart would weaken even further and he would begin quite literally to drown in his own fluids by then even if an appropriately matched donor could be found the transplant would almost certainly be a waste breathe inslowlydont stoplean forwardlet gravity helpthats itthats it though a selfproclaimed agnostic anson began praying for relief he still had work to do here great important work clinical testing of sarah was well under way with astounding results the drug he had created from a soil yeast unique to this area was still experimental but it was clearly at the forefront in the field of neovascularization the rapid development of lifegiving new blood vessels the new circulation had already shown the potential to cure conditions as diverse as battlefield wounds infection heart disease and various forms of cancerbut ironically not pulmonary fibrosis it took more than fifteen minutes but finally anson began to draw in more air moments later though just as he felt the attack was over a slight tickle in his chest led suddenly to a racking painful cough damn it in the minute or so it would take him to gain control of the cough the air hunger would again take over he had once been able to play hours of rugby without slowing so much as a step it was hard to believe that half a thimbleful of sticky mucus in one bronchial tube was now enough to bring him down on the narrow bed beside him marielle breathed sonorously anson stroked her forehead their battles were painfully similar would either of them win he flexed his neck and savored a few blessed gulps of air although he was beyond exhaustion and hadnt had more than a few catnaps for almost twentyfour hours he wasnt even considering sleep his patients were what mattered sleep as always was secondary born and educated in south africa anson had once been handsome and dashing enough to have run with some of the most beautiful women in the world and unfocused enough to have forsaken all but the most superficial connection to medicine but that was long ago another fifteen minutes of oxygen and anson sensed the insufferable band around his chest begin to loosen claudine unable to stay and witness his anguish had gone off to check on their twenty or so inpatients many of whom children and adults were suffering from the complications of aids thanks to the londonbased whitestone foundation and their appointed administrator dr elizabeth st pierre the small hospital was well maintained and equipped with almost anything that anson and she could think to ask for fearing another relapse anson waited before setting the oxygen aside the effort of pulling in enough air had left him lightheaded and nauseated it wasnt supposed to have come to this in nearly fifteen years he had never taken time away from work nor had he ever wished to after a particularly exhausting and depressing weekend on the party circuit enmeshed with people he no longer cared about doing things he more and more abhorred ansons life as a dilettante and playboy ended abruptly he used his legacy and whatever else he could borrow and brought his vibrant wife and child into the jungle on a mission to save the people of his continent now at fiftyfive he was physically a specter of the man he once was and constantly frightened of having his work taken from him before it was ready but even with diminished oxygen levels his mind still processed information and solved problems at a torrid pace there was no way he was supposed to stop now as long as there was work to do there was no way he could expose himself to the vagaries of a lung transplant and the antirejection treatments surrounding it silently promising that as soon as sarah was perfected he would relent anson fit his stethoscope in place and did a careful reevaluation of his patient the child might last a day or two but without some sort of divine intervention three days was a stretch divine intervention the words went right to the heart of the matter anson did not acknowledge the power of god but he totally embraced the power of sarah named after his only child in the hopes that someday she would understand the choices he had made even though marielle didnt fit into any of the current clinical protocols she might well benefit from treatment with the wondrous drug there was however a major problem in doing that elizabeth st pierre controller of the purse strings supporting the whitestone center for african health was also in charge of the clinical testing of the drug she had vehemently forbidden random use of sarah before the researchers at the whitestone foundation had completed their evaluation the edict restricting use of the drug seemed unreasonable on the surface but anson knew the problem was one strictly of his own making until he relinquished his total control of its manufacture sarah would be in precious short supply anson felt his pulse quicken at the notion of stealing his own drug he was doing everything possible for the girl but her disease was deeply inc nrin tmt entrenched he needed to increase the circulation in the area of the infection in order to deliver more oxygen and more antibiotics sarah was just the ticket perhaps he could broker some sort of a deal with elizabeth he wondered now his secret notebooks and cell cultures in exchange for enough sarah to treat his patient no he decided they could call him unreasonable or even paranoid but he simply wasnt ready to turn over his research to whitestone at this juncture it would be better to ask forgiveness than permission the bamboo and cinderblock research facility a series of laboratories and sleeping quarters fifty yards north of the hospital was impressively outfitted with stateoftheart incubators two mass spectrometers and even an electron microscope with refrigeration units and both yeast and tissue culture lines to protect there was also a phalanx of mammoth generators automatically backing up the power that had been brought out from yaounde through the towering trees along the sanagra river doing his best to mask the weakness and uncertainty in his steps anson caught up with claudine as she and the other evening nurse were medicating the patients in addition to anson and st pierre two physicians from yaounde and several residents worked at the hospital they rotated nights on watch but in truth claudine and the other nurses were experienced and competent enough to handle most problems so how is our flock doing claudine he asked subtly bracing one knee against a wall the woman appraised him you are feeling better much thank you i am going to go back to my quarters to wash up and change then i will return you should stay there and get some sleep later this morning after the others arrive i will catch up on sleep believe it or not i am quite wide awake at the moment we worry about you i appreciate that claudine and i need you to please hold down the fort i will be back shortly anson paused to assure himself that his little patient was stable and then left the hospital a uniformed security guard was waiting outside the door good evening jacques good evening doctor long night sick child listen you can stay there if you want i am just going to my apartment to wash up sir i know i know unaccompanied walks at night were forbidden where there was poverty there was inevitably crime the security force each armed and former military was there primarily to thwart kidnappings and any form of industrial espionage the commercial potential of the formulas and notebooks protected in ansons massive safe was quite literally unlimited the dirt and stone path between the hospital and the research compound was weakly illuminated by groundlevel lighting it wound through lush jungle growth and ended at a bamboo vestibule off of which there were five wings three of them containing research facilities and the other two residential quarters posted by the doorway to the vestibule was another security guard well over six feet tall broad shouldered and quite imposing in his starched khakis good morning doctor he said formally good morning jacques francis the other guard replied with a curt nod the doctor wishes to wash up before returning to the hospital then so he shall thank you jacques i can handle things from here the guard hesitated clearly trying to recall if there was a regulation covering the transfer of hospital personnel from one security guard to another finally he shrugged nodded at the two men and headed back along the path before anson could speak francis ngale nodded minutely at the security camera mounted in a waterproof housing midway up a palm tree facing the door there was no need for such a reminder anson was well aware of the electronic security throughout the compound the system had been put in place by whitestone once their deal with him was finalized with ngale at his side anson started down the corridor to his two room apartment halfway there at a spot safe from the cameras they stopped pardon me for this observation doctor ngale said but your breathing seems quite labored tonight it was bad a little while ago but now it is better i have been battling to keep a little girl alive nobody fights that battle better than you thank you my friend i was quite relieved to find you on duty tonight i need to get at the medication for the girl yes you know the rules prohibiting this of course and you are willing to risk helping me that question does not need asking like almost everything else at the whitestone center for african health the security force was hired and supervised by elizabeth st pierre now although she and anson were still as close as ever there were times when she was forced to remind him that according to the pact he had made it was the whitestone foundation that paid the bills and the whitestone foundation that made the rules st pierre had brought francis ngale on board but she was unaware that anson had once saved the mans father from a nearly fatal episode of meningitis of all the security guards ngale was the only one anson could completely trust after a brief stop in his apartment to shower and change into a fresh set of scrubs anson met ngale back in the corridor the first blush of dawn had begun to dispel the dense night side by side the two men crossed the vestibule and proceeded toward the cinderblock room containing two vaults both set in four feet of concrete the timing was as good as it could be the security man assigned to the banks of video monitors would be halfasleep and easily distracted anson checked his watch fiveohtwo he said fiveohtwo ngale agreed i will need three minutes no more begin at fiveohseven three minutes i will get you that my friend joseph djemba is on watch he loves nothing more than talking cameroon indominable lions football the team is very good again yes they must play to their potential doctor as must we francis anson whispered pointing at his watch and motioning ngale down the hall to the security office as must we access to the vault room was by keypad the combination to the vault on the right containing ansons notebooks and other research materials was known only to him and an attorney in yaounde in the event of his sudden death the contents of the vault would be turned over to st pierre along with the information to break the code in which they were written the other vault the one to the left was refrigerated and contained vials of sarah each carefully labeled numbered and catalogued it seemed bizarre that he was forced to steal a drug that he had developed but the process of synthesizing it from viral packets and yeast was complicated and extremely slow and until whitestone was allowed by him to develop mass production it would always be in preciously short supply anson stayed back just inside the entryway until exactly fiveohseven then approached the vault just thirty feet away in the security office was a bank of twentyfour monitors three rows of eight hopefully at that moment francis was seeing to it that joseph djemba was looking somewhere other than at the screens anson fished a folded piece of paper from his pocket knelt by the safe and whispered the combination as he dialed he exhaled audibly when the tumblers clicked into place and the heavy door swung open through a waft of cold air he could see that there were eight vials of medication the product of two or three days of laboratory work each vial sealed with a rubber stopper contained enough sarah for a week of intravenous treatment in many instances though positive results were apparent in as little as two or three days hopefully he would be able to keep his patient alive that long as he slipped one of the chilly vials into his shirt pocket anson wondered how closely elizabeth kept count knowing the woman as he did it was doubtful the missing vial would go unnoticed deny deny deny that would have to be his strategy if he was firm enough elizabeth would at least have to consider the possibility she had miscounted with a minute to spare he silently closed the vault door and returned to the corridor a few seconds later francis left the security office and joined him you are safe doctor he said at least for the moment the security video is a loop that erases itself every twentyfour hours if you can keep dr st pierre at bay for that length of time the proof you were inside the safe will be gone anson returned to the hospital his breathing much easier than when he left whether it was changes in blood flow to his damaged lungs mucous plugs or a bronchial spasm it was unfathomable even now how much better he could feel from one hour to the next or sometimes even from one minute he used the increasingly rare periods of minimal symptoms to convince himself that there was still time plenty of time before drastic measures would be called for marielle was as anson had left her although her spiking temperature was for the moment at least down to near normal she could respond to a loud voice or to being moved about in bed but otherwise remained almost motionless her mother from a village on the river to the north of the hospital had lost two of her three children to the fallout from malnutrition hospital social workers had been doing all they could to prepare her for marielles return but the one time anson had met her it was clear that although she was hoping for the girls recovery she was expecting the worst it was five thirty when anson slid the vial from his pocket and drew up the first of ten doses which he would administer over a week if the child managed to survive he might have to find a way to get a hold of another vial the clinical trials were progressing so well that the optimum dose and administration schedule for several conditions had been worked out pinching off the childs iv he slid the needle into one of the rubber ports and injected the bolus of sarah he was flushing the medication through with the iv fluid when he became aware of another presence in the fourbed ward the instant of warning kept him from a major shock hows she doing elizabeth st pierre asked she was standing behind anson and to his right there was no way for him to be certain how long she had been there but he gauged the angle to where he had held the vial of sarah and knew there was a possibility she could have seen shes in bad shape he said i suddenly went from deep sleep to being wideawake so i decided to drive out here and see how you were doing want me to take over so you can get some rest st pierre a native of yaounde had returned home after receiving her md degree and training in london she worked with anson and his team for two years in the hospital and in the lab and then brokered the agreement with whitestone to exchange the rights to sarah for their unrestricted support of the center for african health through the dim light st pierre studied anson with undisguised concern she was a fullfigured woman in her early forties with aquiline features and smooth ebony skin her tortoiseshell glasses always seemed too wide for her face but somehow managed to underscore the sharp intelligence in her eyes she was fluent in half a dozen languages in addition to several tribal dialects of her homeland i have a full day scheduled in the clinic he said searching for some hint of whether she knew what he had just done but perhaps i could sleep for a couple of hours before then considering the years of their association anson knew surprisingly little of the womans personal life other than that she had been married briefly to a businessman in yaounde and still had a home on a hill overlooking the city he also knew that she was a dedicated incredibly wellread physician certified in renal diseases and an acknowledged expert in the medical aspects of kidney transplantation joseph do you wish to tell me what is going on she asked switching from french to english anson froze pardon earlier this morning claudine tells me you had quite a difficult time of it for a while ansons jaws unclenched he swept his hand across the pocket of his scrub shirt to ensure the vial was not obvious i have a little bronchitis he said nonsense joseph this is the natural progression of pulmonary fibrosis and you know that as well as i do anson became aware of some renewed tightness in his chest just what was not needed he gripped the seat of his chair and willed himself to breathe slowly st pierre was a sharp clinician it wouldnt take too long for her to discern that he was in trouble once more im not ready yet for a transplant he said with determination joseph youll be as good as new once you have the operation im doing fine most of the time as is is there nothing i can say to convince you not at this moment listen elizabeth i really could use a little sleepbefore the morning clinic do you think you could take over for me here marielle has gotten all of her meds of course still battling the surging air hunger anson pulled himself to his feet thanked st pierre and

we will get the details to you shortly please extend my warmest regards to the rest of the council chapter the justice of the state consisted in each of three classes doing the work of its own class plato the republic book iv mrs satterfield what do you mean pincus is gone bracing the receiver between his shoulder and ear ben bunched the thin pillow beneath his head he wanted to go out dear so i let him go out and he hasnt come back ben groaned and stared up at the ceiling of room in the okeechobee motel it was just after eight in the morning of yet another day that was going to be cloudless and hot the motel fiftytwo dollars a night for a single was just off the highway twelve miles from where glenn had been hit faceon by a speeding tractortrailer although ben had no more idea of the mans identity now than he had when alice gustafson first presented the case to him he found it easier to motivate himself with a name than unknown white male or even john doe he chose glenn because of the vanity plate glenn on a black jaguar convertible that cruised past his rented saturn as he left the melbourne international airport on floridas atlantic coast perhaps that glenn won the jag in a raffle maybe he had won the lottery whatever the case the man had to have had some good luck along the way and ben knew he was going to need more than a little of that so far though over his five days in okeechobee county and several counties surrounding okeechobee good luck had been in depressingly short supply dogged by a lack of enthusiasm he had nevertheless worked long hours every day still he had come up with absolutely nothing that would shed any light on who glenn was or what had happened to him the unpleasant conclusion persistently nagging at him was that despite some modest successes in stalkandgawk domestic cases as a real private eye he left much to be desired and now his cat had gone missing mrs satterfield remember what i said about pincus being an indoor cat and not having any claws and how he couldnt climb trees to get away from things like dogs but he wanted so desperately to go out dear he was crying ben sighed althea satterfield his nextdoor neighbor was poptart sweet and as kind as st francis but she was also on the north side of eighty and a little shaky on details her voice reminded him of comedian jonathan winters doing ancient maudie frickert its okay mrs satterfield he said pincus is a really fast runner besides its my fault for letting his claws be removed in the first place and he reflected ruefully it was he and dianne were still a few years from the big split when she caught his longtime pet having its way with the hem of one of her slipcovers all right ben either that cat of yours gets declawed or im out of here as always the memory of her words brought a bittersweet smile it could never be said that she hadnt given him a chance to take the initiative so how is your latest investigation going mr callahan my only investigation i havent cracked the case yet mrs satterfield you will i wont alice gustafsons former student coroner stanley woyczek had been as helpful as he could be but the police in port st lucie and fort pierce as well as those in the sheriffs office and for that matter the state police had a serious resentment against a private investigator whose very presence suggested they were not able to do their job there wasnt a single question he could ask nor a single way to ask it that didnt sound condescending or patronizing after five days of repeated visits to the various stations and substations attempts to chat about the marlins devil rays buccaneers jaguars and dolphins and several dozen doughnuts he had failed to cultivate even one dependable source of information ultimately he was forced to conclude that had he been one of the policemen he would probably have reacted and sounded just like they did mrs satterfield dont worry about pincus im sure hell come back i wish i shared your optimism dear even your plant is sad my plant its the only one in your whole apartment i know that mrs satterfield it used to have such a big beautiful pink flower used to im afraid its fallen off the plant an aechmea was a gift from a violinist in the philharmonic his significant other for ten weeks before she took up with a french horn player claiming quite correctly that ben simply had no direction to his life not surprisingly over the intervening two years a replacement significant other for him had simply failed to come forward mrs satterfield you have to water that plant every d he stopped himself midsentence imagining jennifer chin stretched out naked on red satin sheets with her french horn blower you know what mrs satterfield what dear just give the cats food to the plant and everything will be fine anything you say dear and dont worry about your case youll solve it im sure i will just start with what you know what pardon never mind mrs satterfield youre doing great ill be home in a few days ill see you then dear start with what you know with althea satterfields oddly cogent words roiling about in his brain ben pulled up in front of a modest beige stucco house on a quiet side street in indrio just north of st lucie a small red neon sign in one window read simply readings the door was opened by a tall slender woman in her forties with bronze skin and straight jetblack hair down to the small of her back a colorful artfully done zodiac was tattooed inside a halfmoon across her forehead the arc extending from the ends of her brows to just below her hairline madame sonja well mr callahan she said in a dreamy voice come in come in i couldnt remember if you were to be back this morning or tomorrow you could have just read the future ben said careful not to stare at libra his sign which he knew from his last visit was just above her left brow it took a few seconds for madame sonja to gauge his expression then she grinned that was funny im relieved you think so sometimes most of the time in fact i say things that are meant to be funny but im the only one who thinks they are that is a curse she led him past a heavily draped reading room complete with a card table tarot deck teacups and nearly as many arcane artifacts as were in alice gustafsons office into a cluttered den with overfilled bookcases several computers scanners banks of electronics and a professionalgrade artists easel except for a computer workstation and a small desk chair there was no furniture but in one corner was a potters wheel well used and splattered with dry clay any luck he asked perhaps im quite pleased with what i have for you as i mentioned dr woyczek spoke very highly of your work he knows i appreciate his referrals i only wish that his regard for me carried over to his friends the detectives at the police department im afraid they think im something of a quack they have their own artists and even with numerous examples of my superior accuracy they refuse to send their business this way woyczek had understatedly described madame sonja as something of an eccentric who used the latest in computer graphics to create or recreate faces but often then modified her renderings with something she just saw in her mind three days before ben had brought the hideous photos of glenns nearly obliterated face to her for a time she sat across the table from him in her reading room studying the pictures sometimes with her eyes totally closed sometimes open just a slit he sat patiently although he considered her actions a complete charade despite woyczeks glowing endorsement of the woman ben had confessed his heavy cynical bias against clairvoyance mental telepathy telekinesis fortunetelling and the supernatural ive done one set of renderings in color and one in black and white madame sonja said as you will see the sets are somewhat different from one another i cant explain why she sat down at her computer with ben studying the screen over her shoulder here is your man the first image faceon in full color materialized on the screen it was essentially threedimensional done by a remarkable program and clearly drawn by a woman with talent the man depicted had a round youthful face pudgy ruddy cheeks rather small widely spaced eyes and somewhat lowset ears there was little about the face that ben found interesting but it did have a certain childlike aura madame sonja rotated the electronic bust degrees she allowed ben a couple of minutes to study her handiwork and then put the blackandwhite drawing on the screen few would have said the drawings were of the same man the face was narrower and more intelligent the eyes fuller how do you explain the differences ben asked i dont try to explain anything i draw what i see on the photos and up here she tapped a long scarlet fingernail against gemini i wonder if this man has make that had diminished intelligence perhaps i have drawn him as he was at the time of his death and then as he might have been save for some accident of birth another strikeout ben was thinking woyczek might be right about this woman but as far as he could tell her uniqueness began and ended with the zodiac on her forehead he wondered how many customers had paid how much money for her wisdom i have hard copies of five views in each of these envelopes my charge would usually be a thousand dollars per set but because dr woyczek sent you ill give you both of them for five hundred shocked ben hesitated about to refuse when the woman added as you are thinking you can refuse to pay and leave these here but i tell you mr callahan these renderings are what you are after bens eyes narrowed anyone could have known what he was considering he finally decided it was logical and obvious pure deduction from his hesitation and probably his expression anyone could have known reluctantly he took his checkbook from his briefcase im afraid i only take mastercard and visa she said with no sheepishness whatsoever and of course cash an entrepreneur with a tattoo across her forehead what happened to the simple carefree antiestablishment types he had hung out with in college a little grass a little beer a little rock and roll ben checked his holdings and handed over the cash it was extremely doubtful that alice gustafson and organ guard would reimburse him in full for this one but what the hell then in a move that totally surprised him madame sonja reached out and took his hand mr callahan im sorry you feel as uncomfortable about me as you do you have a wonderfully kind face and i can tell that you are a good man if you will please come and join me for a cup of tea ben wanted nothing more than to hit the road he had visited every hospital within twenty five miles of the accident site as well as every police station now as long as he had sprung for these pictures of glenn he might as well use what time he had left before returning to chicago to show them to some people perhaps starting with the hematologists but there was something compelling about the womans touch reluctantly he followed her into the den and took a seat a minute later she was pouring a rustcolored aromatic tea into two oriental cups each with a different asian symbol on the side please drink it down she urged i assure you there is nothing in it but tea when you have finished please pass your cup over to me ben did as she asked madame sonja stared into the cup for a few seconds then wrapped her hands around it and looked intently across at him finally she closed her eyes im not getting much she said since when is five hundred dollars not much im sorry he replied i keep hearing the same words over and over though ive got to get out of here what words just start with what you know ben stared across at her in stunned silence althea satterfields words precisely aa friend in chicago just said those exact words to me not an hour ago they did come in loud and clear i dont believe this anything else madame sonja shrugged and shook her head nope some days are better than others for me this one isnt much you think that was justluck coincidence do you she led ben to the door well thanks for your drawings and your help he said shaking her hand and heading down the walk i hope you find your man she called after him so do i and i hope you find your cat too with no feeling for where he was headed or what he was going to do ben found himself on a small road that deadended at a grassy patch overlooking what his map said was the inland waterway madame sonjas parting reference to pincuss disappearance had shaken him as had her reiteration of altheas odd suggestion start with what you know the phrase wasnt all that unusual he reasoned and maybe the words werent precisely the same ones his neighbor had used and as for pincus he was focused on his failure as an investigator and on handing over five hundred dollars in cash but in addition the disappearance of his strongest connection to the world of the living was very much on his mind he must have said something about the cat that had to be it in all likelihood he had said something in passing and just couldnt remember having done so there was no other explanation for what had happened no other explanation of course except the obvious was it possible that a woman with a zodiac tattooed on her forehead living in a tiny house on an undistinguished street in florida had somehow tapped into his thoughts if there were people running about with that ability why didnt everyone know how many times had he walked right past a tent at a county fair offering readings for five dollars he remembered talking with gilbert forest a physician friend whose foundation of medical beliefs had been badly shaken by a traditional chinese doc who had cured an inoperable cancer in one of gilberts patients using only acupuncture and what he called vitamins since ben believed in very little at this point in his life the biggest danger posed by alice gustafson and madame sonja was to those many things he didnt believe in start with what you know as the sun rose higher and the wet heat grew more intense ben set his case file on the ground beside him and started going through it a page at a time searching for some angle he had missed perhaps the renderings of glenn would stir some memory in one of the hematologists he mused not likely he quickly decided okay okay callahan aside from the fact that youre not much of a detective what else exactly do you know bens gaze drifted out over the glistening water when it returned to the papers in his lap he was looking down at the article about the woman juanita ramirez the three photographs accompanying the text typical of the tabloids were grainy there was one of the woman one of the puncture wounds above her buttocks and one of a likeness of the mobile home in which she had been kidnapped held prisoner and operated on the mobile home ben pulled out the transcript of the interview gustafson had with the woman the parts he considered important were highlighted in yellow the part he needed at that moment was not ag can you describe the mobile home where you were held prisoner jr i only saw the outside once when they stopped to ask me directions and then pulled me inside it was big real big most of it was gray or silver and there was like a maroon or purple design on the side sort of like a swirl pattern or a wave the womans description wasnt much ben acknowledged but it was something he had done the police stations and the hospitals and the hematology offices and the surgicenters all the while searching for the man he called glenn his plan now that he had madame sonjas renderings was to make the loop once again hoping against hope that someone might connect with the face insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results who had told him that all right callahan he muttered youve been calling yourself a detective so detect two hours and four mobilehome dealerships later he was losing faith beaver alpine great west dynamax road trek winnebago safari simba the list of rv makers seemed endless damon forest river kodiak newmar cypress thor colorado almost every one of them had a model or more with a design on the side that could have been the one described by juanita ramirez by midafternoon his feet and back were aching and the superstuffed burrito he had eaten at taco bell usually a staple in his diet was making more encore appearances than the rolling stones a hundred and fifty dollars a day maybe ten dollars an hour for the time he had put in he had done quite enough alice gustafson should have found some other way to spend organ guards money even though he didnt care much about her miniscule organization and its arcane mission he really had tried his best now it was time to give up and go home three hours later through lengthening lateafternoon shadows he swung the saturn up the short driveway to the schyler gaines mart and gas the fifteenth gas station he had visited since deciding to quit the case and return to chicago he had managed to add a pounding headache to the persisting miseries in his feet and back callahans syndrome he decided to call it cs for the purposes of fundraising the brainstorm that kept him on the road long enough to develop the syndrome was a circle he had drawn on his map ten miles around the spot where glenn had been killed armed with catalogues from the rv dealers and the pictures of glenn he had decided to go down fighting visiting every gas station he could locate within the circle given the singledigit miles per gallon of the largest rvs the one he was searching for had to spend as much time at the pump as in the trailer parks perhaps he decided pigheadedness should be added to the symptoms of cs the station three miles off the highway in curtisville might as easily have been on the other side of a time portal it was a ricketylooking red clapboard structure with a peaked shingled roof and a small porch complete with two rocking chairs the handpainted sign over the door was faded and peeling out front was a single gas pump that while modernized at some point from the glasstopped esso pump standing off to one side of the tarmac still looked outdated it was to the good that the active pump was a fair distance from the porch because the man ben assumed was schyler gaines was seated in one of the rockers smoking a pipe with his bib overalls plaid shirt dirtstained caterpillar cap and gray beard he might have been teleported to the mart from lil abners dogpatch ben pulled the saturn to a stop not far from the corner of the porch and approached the man who eyed him with some interest but said nothing the smoke from gainess pipe was cherryscented and not at all unpleasant good afternoon ben greeted him with a halfwave mounting the first step to the porch and leaning on a rail that he guessed was a fiftyfifty bet not to hold him gaines pulled out a gold watch on a chain and checked the time spose you could still say that he replied sounding exactly as ben might have predicted my name is callahan ben callahan im a private detective from chicago and im looking for a man who was run down and killed on route seventy south of here he uz killed an yer still lookin for im lets try that again actually im trying to learn about him no one even knows his name let alone what he was doing out on route seventy at three in the morning big peterbilt threeeightseven hit em head on back cab sleeper contoured roof cap you know the truck stops by here for gas from time ttime i got a diesel pump out back charge a dime less than the stations on the turnpike but it adds up when yer pumpina hunnert gallons guy named eddies the driver eddie coombs i spoke to him hes still pretty messed up over what happened ill bet its a crackerjack rig he got sixhunnert horsepower cummings engine fella who got hit couldnt a had much time to knowed it happened i think thats the case ben said well here are some computer drawings of what the guy might have looked like he passed the renderings over suddenly feeling strangely foolish and impotent what was he doing here what could he possibly expect to learn from this laconic old man why had he ever said yes to alice gustafson in the first place rocking and puffing gaines studied the pictures for a time then handed them back shaking his head dont mean nothin t me i didnt think they would ben said you got some cold coke in there i do just short a havinice in the can if you know what i mean oh i know exactly ben used the back of his hand to wipe a sheen of sweat from his forehead cans are in the cooler jes leave a dollar on the counter im enjoyin this bowlful too much tgit up the coke icy as advertised washed away a bit of bens consuming feeling of futility he left a five by the antiquated register took madame sonjas renderings and headed back to his car would alice gustafson accept oh well i tried doubtful more likely shed want her money back just start with what you know ben opened the drivers side door then stopped and returned to the porch with the brochures and his absurdly long list of rv models mr gaines im also looking for a mobile home he said a what a mobile home you know like an rv would have been here somewhere around the time this fellow was killed maybe from up north maybe really big maybe gray with darker gray or maroon markings here are some brochures of possible candidates that would be a thirtyninefoot winnebago adventurer gaines said matteroffactly without bothering with the brochures ohfour or ohfive i would guess ohio plates pulled in fer a fill took moren seventy gallons ben felt his heart skip a beat tell me about it not too much ttell the couple drivin her didnt seem like the rv type how so oh you know too young not country enough movin about quickern most rv owners move bought three sandwiches and three chips even though there uz only two of em can you describe them i got a memory for cars n trucks not people she uz quite pretty though i do remember that cute bottom on her pardon me for sayin that i may be old but i aint dead its perfectly okay mr gaines is there anything else you can remember about the rv or the people i didnt notice until it was pulling away but i dont think there uz windows in the back as youll see from them brochures that aint the usual no windows are you sure ifn i said it then im sure what is it you deal with people that sez what they dont mean ive been known to yes ben was aware of his pulse snapping in his fingertips this whole business about the adventurer could be nothing but in every fiber he believed it was the rv described by juanita ramirez he began rapidly processing ways he might use the limited information he had just gathered how many people in ohio buy a thirtyninefoot winnebago mobile home did the manufacturer keep records how far would seventy gallons have taken such a beast the questions werent much but after nearly a week of abject frustration they were palm trees in the sahara mr gaines he said youve been very helpful is there anything else you can think of about this rv anything at all nope except except what i spose it might help ifn i gave ya the license plate number the what they paid for their gas an supplies with a credit card a visa i think twuz i got burned once real bad by a trucker with a stolen card so now i always write down the license number on the credit card slip and you still have the imprint a course i do gaines said you wouldnt think much a me as a businessman ifn i didnt chapter and will not the bravest and wisest soul be least confused or deranged by any external influence plato the republic book ii time is a flexible concept in rio unless you are talking business meetings and serious business meetings at that half an hour late means perfectly on time i love it natalie whispered to herself smiling at the description in the varig magazine if anyone ever needed eight days away in a city where half an hour late meant on time it was she images of dancing with a mysterious stranger at an allnight salsa club and running on the spectacular blackandwhite mosaic sidewalks of copacabana had dominated her thoughts since the invitation from doug berenger to replace him and present a paper at the international transplant congress now it was about to happen for a time she had flipped through the air shopper and made a mental list about what she might buy for her mother and niece and a few of her friends for her girlfriends and hermina it had to be jewelry made of brazils legendary precious and semiprecious stones for jenny and terry polished agate bookends for doug perhaps a highend replica of the christ the redeemer statue she set the guidebook aside and peered out the window of the trying to catch a glimpse of the city through scattered clouds night had settled in but even after fifteen hours of flying she wasnt particularly tired out of daylight savings time for their winter rio was just two hours ahead of boston and thanks to the luxury of business class she had been able to get plenty of sleep the married heavy equipment salesman sitting next to her a veteran traveler had made several illdisguised forays into forming a connection had been politely rebuffed each time and finally had retreated into a grisham novel which it looked like he might finish before they landed because of what they had been told was a problem of dense traffic the plane had been circling antonio carlos jobim airport for most of an hour of all those on the flight natalie decided she probably cared the least about the delay with the help of a couple of glasses of merlot her type a personality had been downgraded to possibly an a minus antonio carlos jobim what other city in the world had an airport named after a composer and a jazz composer at that the girl from ipanema goes walking natalie checked to ensure that her travel documents were in order and was debating between opening her laptop and closing her eyes when the plane banked to the right then leveled off she felt the landing gear grind into place and then engage moments later the orders for landing were given in english and portuguese her ear felt tuned to the language thanks largely to nine days of study tapes and as many conversations with her mother as she could handle there were differences between brazilian and cape verdean portuguese some of them striking but she had always had a knack for languages and had made quite a bit of progress eight days in rio she had always believed that living well was the best revenge maybe she should send postcards of thanks to cliff renfro and dean goldenberg the landing was flawless and customs was much better organized than she had anticipated from her experience in sao paulo her guide to rio had prepared her for winter temperatures in the mid to high fifties and also suggested that she buy a cab voucher inside the airport rather than trust the meters she pulled on a light leather jacket as she entered the main terminal and easily found the taxi kiosk as she was putting the change and the voucher into her wallet she began to feel lightheaded and vague the sensation was unpleasant and disturbing but easily explainable by the long flight and the merlot outside the terminal the air was cool and fragrant despite the chaotic traffic the jobim airport was twenty miles north of rio she had been looking forward to her first encounter with the magical city but all she could think of at that moment was getting inside a cab and getting to her hotel her presentation wasnt scheduled for two more days so there was no reason at this point to be rested besides according to the guidebook nightlife in rio didnt even begin until the early morning after a few hours of rest she would be ready to try some of it out the red dress she decided mentally choosing one of three she had brought she had no intention of being foolish in a city known for punishing such behavior but she was adventurous and she loved dancing especially to latin music the concierge at the hotel would direct her to a place that was both fun and safe near the taxi queue a uniformed attendant took her bag checked her voucher and led her over to a yellow cab with a blue stripe around it her feeling of disconnection intensified as she slid into the backseat intercontinental rio hotel she heard herself say the driver a dark man in his thirties turned and smiled at her but said nothing his features were indistinct and as the cab pulled away natalkie tried unsuccessfully to focus on his appearance the ride toward the city was also a blur more than once she thought she might be close to getting sick sooner than she had anticipated the driver pulled off of the highway in a short time they were driving through a poorly lit slum natalkie felt a jet of adrenaline drive much of the uncertainty and vagueness away where are we going she asked in portuguese you said the intercontinental came the reply this is the quick way i dont want the quick way i want to go back on the highway she demanded sensing that she had gotten a number of the words wrong you are a very beautiful woman the driver said over his shoulder in decent english take me back to the highway this minute she insisted very beautiful the man accelerated slightly the area through which they were passing was even more dilapidated what streetlights there were had been smashed and most of the rickety houses and tenements were shuttered almost nobody was on the streets except for an occasional furtive shadow skulking around a corner or down an alley natalie glanced at the cabbies license in the gloom she could barely make out anything and so what if she could this was serious serious trouble she mentally inventoried the contents of her purse was there anything there she could use for a weapon thanks to airport security the answer was almost certainly no goddamn it she shrieked pounding on the thick plexiglas that separated front seat from rear take me back to the highway the customers at the house of love will adore you you will be very happy therevery happy there the words echoed eerily icy panic took hold her dizziness never really gone had begun to worsen the drivers words seemed sharp and clear one instant thick and repetitive the next natalie scanned the dark uninviting slum it seemed like they were going thirty or forty could she possibly escape by jumping out of the cab then rolling and scrambling to her feet and running if she could somehow get out and get upright provided her leg wasnt broken she could outrun anyone with the alternative of being made a narcotics whore in some brothel it had to be worth taking the chance she slipped her wallet and passport from her purse and jammed them into the pocket of her jacket money she pleaded ill give you money to let me out right here three thousand reais i have three thousand reais just let me go she inched toward the righthand door and eased her fingers around the handle trying to visualize what she should do with her body as she hit the pavement around her the scene seemed to fade then sharpen then fade again she shook her head trying to clear her thoughts it had to be now at that instant the cab screeched to a jolting stop and natalies door was ripped open by two men both wearing black stocking masks before she could react she was pulled out and forced onto her belly the cab roared away a needle was thrust into the muscle at the base of her neck and the contents of a syringe were emptied into her a narcotic she thought a disabling dose of some sort of narcotic probably heroin her situation was absolutely terrifying but she felt oddly detached from it detached yet at the same time determined not to give in to her attackers without a fight they each had one of her arms now and were dragging her facedown into what seemed like a narrow unpaved alley fetid with refuse she screamed for help but sensed that in this neighborhood such cries happened often and would nearly always go unheeded still on the ground she twisted her body and pulled her arms instantly the man holding her right wrist lost his grip natalie spun that way pushed herself to her knees and slammed her fist as hard as she could into the other mans groin his grip on her other wrist vanished and he dropped to his knees before either man could react she pushed to her feet this time punching one of them flush in the face in a second she was on her feet and sprinting away from the men down the alley ahead of her through dim light she could make out two rows of darkened buildings some of them two stories high some three ahead and to the right she thought she saw a light wink on from behind her one of the men cried out in portuguese tenho uma pistola parejd ou eu atiro i have a gun stop right now or i will shoot ahead of her the alley was completely blocked by a pile of trash barrels boxes and refuse propped against some sort of fence and extending up well over her head stop the voice from behind her cried natalie had scrambled up the trash heap and was reaching for the top of the fence when a shot rang out from behind her nothing she grabbed the coarse wood and swung her leg over another shot snapped off then another both times whitehot pain exploded from the shoulder blade on the right side of her back she was slammed forward her arms flew off of the fence grunting against the pain and gasping for air well aware that she had been shot more than once she toppled backward and fell helplessly into the pile of garbage chapter and who is best able to do good to his friends and evil to his enemies in time of sickness the physician plato the republic book i yaounde was just four degrees north of the equator joe anson had never handled the heat and humidity of cameroon as well as those who were born there but this day with monsoon season just a couple of weeks away was the worst he could remember the airconditioning units in the hospital were fighting a losing battle the odors of illness were intensified throughout the building flies were everywhere and worst of all the air was just about too heavy for him to breathe if there was a bright spot in the oppressive day it was the girl marielle who had responded remarkably to her clandestine treatment with sarah and was now sitting up in a chair by her bed taking fluids and nourishment the drug was an absolute miracle just as he had known from the beginning it would be another day perhaps and the whitestone center for african health van would bring her back to her mother along with enough rice and other staples to improve the health and wellbeing of the village until the monsoons hit after that the cycle of malnutrition and illness would begin anew okay dear one anson said placing his stethoscope on the girls back breathe in breathe outyou are doing so well so well maybe tomorrow you will go home the child turned and threw her arms around ansons neck i love you dr joe she said love love love love love and i love you too dear peanut the few words took more out of anson than he would ever care to admit to anyone he handed marielle a picture book and inched away from her bedside to the small office he shared with whichever doctors were on call what in the hell was going to happen to him what should he do after thirty seconds with his air hunger mounting he used the emergency twoway radio he always carried to summon help this is claudine dr anson the nurse said where are you doctors officein the hospital you need oxygen yes one minute it was half that when claudine raced in pulling a green liter tank of the precious gas dropped into a frame on wheels she was a tall woman nearing fifty with a regal bearing caring eyes and a smooth richly dark complexion she had been at the hospital almost since its inception you are working the day shift anson managed as she set his mask in place and started the oxygen flow at maximum just breathe she said iumone of the other nurses got sick i am working for her anson missed her deeply troubled expression he withdrew a cortisone inhaler from the top drawer and took two deep breaths from it followed by two puffs from a bronchodilator it is good to see you he said you are feeling better the humidity makes it hard the humidity is only going to get worse until the rains start then it will be worse still a hundred percent humidity i do not know how i will ever deal with that again a shadow crossed the nurses face you are going to be all right she said with more than casual determination of course i am claudine you are scheduled for your wednesday lunch with dr st pierre should i cancel that no no i do not cancel things you know that anson once no more reliable than the wind had become a creature of absolute discipline and unwavering habit on wednesdays at noon every wednesday he met with st pierre in the small hospital dining area where he ate conch chowder and a green salad drank a bottle of guinness cameroun brewed in yaounde and finished his meal off with a scoop of chocolate ice cream it was there they informally discussed the business affairs of the hospital clinic and laboratory as well as his sarah research and over recent years his health excuse me for saying so doctor claudine said but your breathing is as labored as it has been for some time it isunpredictable and there is no other treatment i can get for you iamon so muchmedication iam jitterymost of thetime please just relax and breathe perhaps i should get dr st pierre or a respirator anson motioned her to stay calm and wait the nurse backed off to one side of the room but her dark eyes moist with caring and concern never left him unseen by anson she reached into the pocket of her uniform and nervously fingered the vial of clear liquid that was there exactly onepointfour ccs no more no less that was the instruction exactly onepointfour lunch was scheduled for noon but it was a quarter after before anson had enough breath to set the oxygen aside and make his way to the dining area the room was empty save for st pierre who was seated at one of the three small tables eating a tuna sandwich drinking a tall iced tea and going over some ledgers she wore khaki shorts and a white tee that accented her alluring breasts for a few moments anson was actually diverted from his respiratory difficulty over the years he had often felt their relationship was about to move beyond a close friendship but that had yet to happen he settled in at the table and moments later the cook reverently set his meal in front of him a reminder that there was no one in the hospital or lab at the center whose life had not in some way been touched by the man ill never know he said to st pierre in english pausing once for air how you manage to look so fresh in the face of this humidity i suspect you would look fresher if you were breathing at something better than an oxygen saturation of eighty percent i have managed to put in a full days work i fear that wont last much longer who can say lungs adjust not with pulmonary fibrosis they dont joseph and you know that as well as i do anson picked at his salad and as was his habit took a lengthy pull straight from the bottle of his guinness cameroun elizabeth was right he was thinking she was always right when it came to his health still it just isnt the time for me to submit to a transplant the monsoons are almost upon us our work in the lab is going so well i simply have too much to do you are risking death every day from sudden heart failure or even a stroke she reached over and placed her hand on top of his her expression left no doubt that her concern for him was personal as well as professional you have done so much for so many joseph i dont want anything more to happen to you your breathing is getting worse and it is destined to get even worse still if matters deteriorate much more any operation will become far more risky perhaps the recovery from surgery wont be nearly as lengthy as you think the doctors with whom i have been working are some of the greatest transplant surgeons in the world they are standing by to ensure that you get the best care possible anson drained his bottle hoping for at least a little fortitude in the battle to convince elizabeth that the medical indications for a transplant were not overwhelming and the timing was poor ive had several good days in a row he tried i beg you to get honest with yourself just because you havent stopped in the middle of the day for therapy on a respirator doesnt mean youve had a good day look at you now you are an intellectual a scholar yet you dont say half the things that are on your mind because you dont have enough breath to get the words out again she took his hand in hers joseph listen to me please the doctors at whitestone have learned of a donor a twelve out of twelve donor joseph a perfect tissue match for you its what weve been searching the world for you will be on virtually no antirejection medication that means no debility or side effects you will be back here at work before you even know it anson stared across at her this was the first time a donor had actually been located let alone one who was a virtually perfect tissue match elizabeth and the others with whom she had been consulting had just increased the ante in this highstakes game how long have you had people looking for someone ever since we tissuetyped you and realized that your profile was unusual and rare anson slumped back shaking his head where is this match he asked india amritsar india its in punjab state north and west of delhi a man lies on machines in the hospital there he is braindead from a massive cerebral hemorrhage his hospital wants to move forward with the harvesting of his organs but we have begged them to wait anson stood and walked across the room the short distance strained his breathing but he rationalized to himself the humidity was intense i cant do it he said finally i just cant theres work to do here and sarah to notify andand please joseph st pierre said firmly please stop if this is something youre not ready to do then thats the way its going to be why dont you go on back to your apartment and rest for an hour until afternoon clinic ill cover for you here ookay anson said his tone almost a babys im glad youre not angry with me im worried for you joseph and im worried for our sarahnine project but i am hardly angry let me get the security guard to accompany you to your room would you like a wheelchair no anson snapped as he turned away a sudden wave of weakness and profound fatigue swept over him on second thought maybe a wheelchair would be best he capitulated by the time the guard entered the dining area and helped anson into a wheelchair his fatigue had intensified and he was barely able to take in any air at all he strained to breathe but it was as if his mind had decided it could no longer be involved in such an effort he tried to speak to call for help but no words emerged the room was whirling as the guard wheeled the chair out the doorway and onto the path to the living quarters just a few feet into the journey anson realized his breathing had stopped altogether the scene around him dimmed then grew black helpless and rapidly losing consciousness he toppled forward out of the chair landing facefirst on the gravel the guard a stocky man with massive arms scooped anson up as if he were a rag doll and raced back into the hospital crying for help in seconds the physicians limp form was supine on a stretcher in the critical care room and claudine had readied the wellequipped crash cart st pierre a cool head in even the most dire medical emergencies ordered a cardiac monitor urinary catheter and iv then positioned ansons head chin up and began inflating his lungs with a breathing bag and mask one of the medical residents from yaounde offered to take over for her but st pierre declined no matter how proficient you are daniel she said i will never trust your technique in situations such as this as much as i trust my own without this man we are all lost check his femoral artery for a pulse claudine prepare for me to intubate a sevenpointfive tube be certain to check the balloon on it before giving it to me there was a momentary silent spark between the two women unseen by anyone else in the room he still has a pulse the resident said faint at onetwenty help get the monitor running and see if you can get a blood pressure st pierre continued breathing effectively for anson whose color had marginally improved although his level of consciousness had not claudine inflated the balloon used to seal the breathing tube in place inside the trachea and found it to have no leaks then still as composed as if she were selecting fruit at the market st pierre crouched at the head of the stretcher had the resident hold ansons head steady in the chinup position set a lighted laryngoscope blade against her colleagues tongue and in just seconds slid the tube between the delicate halfmoons of his vocal cords a syringeful of air inflated the balloon and sealed the tube in place st pierre then replaced the mask on the breathing bag with an adapter that hooked to the tube and breathed for anson until the tube could be taped in place and attached to a mechanical respirator with six people working so closely and intensely the heat and humidity in the small room was staggering only st pierre showed no external signs of being affected although once she removed her glasses and wiped them on the hem of her shirt for fifteen minutes a tense silence held sway there was no change in ansons appearance but his vital signs steadily improved then with obvious effort joe anson opened his eyes one by one st pierre thanked her assistants and the nurses and asked each to leave the room then she bent over the stretcher and positioned her face just a few inches from his easy does it joseph she said when they were at last alone the heat and humidity were too much for you you just had a complete respiratory arrest do you understand dont even nod if you do just squeeze my hand good i know that tube is uncomfortable ill give you some sedation in just a few minutes as long as the tube is in place the danger of disaster is greatly lessened joseph please please listen to me if this had happened in your apartment we never would have gotten to you in time we need you joseph need you sarahnine needs you the world needs you we cant have this happen again please please consent to the transplant minutely at first then with greater force he squeezed her hand oh joseph she said kissing him on the forehead then on the cheek thank you thank you were going to move quickly do you understand whitestone has a jet to fly you to india its waiting in capetown right now i will be with you all the way well keep you sc dated and on the ventilator for the whole trip understand good please dont be frightened this is what is needed soon all your troubles will be over and you will be back here making all of mankind better i ask you one last time do you understand all right joseph i will make the call soon we will be on the way to yaounde airport to meet our jet st pierre mobilized the team who would be caring for anson while she was off arranging the ambulance ride to yaounde airport and the subsequent flight to amritsar international when claudine moved in to take over the nursing st pierre shook her head and motioned the woman outside you almost killed him st pierre snapped before claudine could get out a word the nurses eyes glossed over at the rebuke elizabeth st pierre was a person a yaoundeborn woman whom she had respected for many years had she not thought so much of her she would have never agreed to add the mixture of tranquilizers and respiratory depressants to dr ansons beer i did nothing wrong she said you told me to add onepointfour ccs to the bottle and that is precisely what i did st pierre was at once fire and ice nonsense she said all i wanted to do was force him into more difficulty so he would opt to go ahead with a transplant before it was too late and while we had a perfect donor i formulated that preparation based on his body mass and oxygen levels if you had given the proper amount he would never have stopped breathing but it is extremely hot and humid today and just imagine if that had happened five minutes later in his quarters if he was unable to call for help then he would be dead right now and we would have lost one of the greatest men who ever lived clearly you misread the dose admit it dr st pierre i cannot admit to something i did not in that case i want you packed and out of here by two ill have one of the guards drive you back to yaounde if you wish a positive recommendation from me let there be no talk of what went on here today without waiting for a reply st pierre whirled stalked to her office and placed a longdistance call again the man who called himself laertes answered all right she said in english set the team in motion if this tissue match is all you say a should be renewed and working for us for as long as is necessary we have accomplished so much agreed has the donor been certified braindead do you care aspasia no st pierre said without hesitation no i dont chapter and from being a keeper of the law he is converted into a breaker of it plato the republic book vii let me get this straight mr callahan your source for this information about a recreational vehicle was an old man in an outoftheway garage and you found him after being encouraged by a psychic not to quit your investigation urni suppose you could put it that way yes you believe the old man i do i think the rv he described is the one were looking for and the psychic with the zodiac tattooed on her head she knew my cat was missing and i dont remember telling her that but she didnt tell you where to find him no no she didnt but you found him anyway he was in the bushes right in front of my building i think he got enough mice and rats there without ever having to move gustafson suppressed a grin but not before ben saw it so she said after a week of near futility in florida where we still dont know who the man was you were investigating or why he had a bone marrow done you want me to pay you to go to cincinnati its only three hundred or so miles each way i know that ben leaned toward her conspiratorially dont tell anyone doc but im going to cincinnati whether you pay me or not alice gustafson leaned back across her desk and mimicked his gesture well then she said in that case youd better get a move on ben made the drive from chicago to cincinnati in a steady raw drizzle for much of the trip he listened to a john prine cd with most of the songs dealing with imprisonment either behind bars or within the walls of ones life when he wasnt listening he was singing the chorus of his favorite cut on the album which he had decided would be his theme song until something better came along father forgive us for what we must do you forgive us well forgive you well forgive each other till we both turn blue then well whistle and go fishing in heaven using the information provided by schyler gaines some software he had bought from a private detective catalogue and could use only after paying off the overdue account with his internet server and a cop who owed him a favor ben had relatively little trouble pinpointing the location of the winnebago adventurer and its owner faulkner associates a laurel way cincinnati there was no such business listed in the cincinnati phone book and none in any search engine online now as he cruised around a curve on and saw the city stretched out ahead ben tried to make sense any sense at all of an rv that would scoop victims up perform bone marrow aspirations on them against their will and then release them nothing came to mind he knew that alice gustafson liked him and was going to pay him for his time no matter what but he was relieved he hadnt yet brought up the five hundred dollars he had paid madame sonja for the renderings of glenn in fact rather than try to explain the variation between the two sets of drawings he had only shown her the real one altogether adding the five hundred to the cost of reactivating his browser paying off a few people in florida for what proved to be useless information and assuming that he had lost at least some work while in the sunshine state he had probably not come close to breaking even on this gig if this sixhundredmile junket to the queen city and back proved to be a bust he decided he was through finished he would ignore the hideous photos of glenn and the tabloidworthy account of juanita ramirez and he would put the mystery of madame sonja behind him organ guard could go back to guarding organs and he would go back to stalking and gawking father forgive us for what we must do you forgive us and well forgive you with its emerald necklace of parks stunning concert hall art galleries universities bohemian section sporting venues and zoo ben had always considered cincinnati a littleknown jewel among cities after checking his mapquest printout he eased off the highway and toward the ohio river he had been driving most of eight hours and his balky back was demanding some relief regardless of what happened on a laurel way there was a motel and a hot shower in his near future the dense overcast persistent rain and cincinnatis place on the western edge of the eastern time zone made the early evening almost midnight dark mapquest took him east past the downtown area and down into the flats by the ohio river an area of gnarled little streets narrow alleys and warehouses that was just begging for some sort of urban renewal unlike most of the truncated dimly lit streets laurel way had a sign ben parked just around the corner and then stared at his locked glove compartment wondering if there was any sense in bringing along his smith amp wesson except for a single session at a range a couple of years ago he had never once fired the thing and given his woeful aim he hoped he would never have to the vote was a decisive onetonil to leave it where it was his soft leather bag was another story a sale purchase at marshall fields it now contained a hooded flashlight crowbar skeleton keys digital videocam digital still camera laser listening device rope string duct tape and as many varied tools as the zipper would allow traffic in the area was extremely light aware of the pounding in his chest ben slipped the drawings of glenn into the outside pocket of his bag and pulled on his cubs cap brim low then he turned off the interior light of his aging range rover and silently opened the door for one of the rare times in his years as a private investigator he was actually investigating scattered cars were parked on the street in front of a featureless melange of autobody and welding shops garages and warehouses some concrete some corrugated metal and some wood the buildings themselves were separated from the road by narrow sidewalks in ill repair and from one another by narrow alleyways potholes most of them filled with muddy rainwater were as much a part of the roadway as the pavement was staying on the sidewalk and in the shadows of the buildings ben turned onto laurel way having visited an rv center just south of chicago to get a look at a thirtyninefoot adventurer ben was relieved to find that the street was wider than most of the others in the area he was still questioning whether or not a bussized vehicle could swing into any of the structures when he noticed a vacant trashstrewn lot across from a faded peeling woodframed building the place was two stories high maybe even three and somewhere in its history might have been a barn facing the road was a massive pair of sliders on a metal track quite large enough to admit an rv if there was a a on laurel way and if it housed a thirtyninefoot mobile home this really had to be the place also he reasoned someplace around the building there had to be a pedestrian door ignoring the persistent drizzle ben cautiously made his way along the threefoot space between the building and the one to his left there was a single eyelevel window midway but a curtain of some kind was drawn on the street parallel to laurel way there were no doors or windows just a broad shingled facade rising twentyfive feet to a sharply peaked roof he checked the street then started back toward laurel way on the other side of the building using the hooded flashlight to illuminate the dark narrow alleyway halfway along that wall he found the door he sensed had to exist it was solid paneled wood with a lock and knob that had clearly been added recently shortly after his decision to become a pi ben had attended a detectivesonly class on identifying and negotiating locks of all kinds included in the pricey tuition was a syllabus some credit cardlike slabs of plastic cut in various shapes and a ring of twenty heavy wires bent at odd angles and named taggert wires after the man who invented them for a while after the course he practiced on the locks of his apartment as well as those on the doors of many of his friends and neighbors and actually became quite proficient at selecting and manipulating the right wire but that was it for the grand adventure over the ensuing years he hadnt had cause to use the wires even once until now virtually invisible in the dark passageway he crouched by the door and listened with his stethoscope against it for several minutes not a sound finally he set to work with the taggert wires it took tries with three different wires before he felt the tip of one catch and hold a turn to the right and the lock gave way even before his eyes adapted to the neap perfect darkness ben knew the thirtyninefoot adventurer was there just ten feet away stretching nearly from one end of the building to the other he slipped inside silently pulled the door shut behind him and dropped to one knee on the concrete floor trying to will his heart to beat slower and at least a little softer when the din had finally lessened he once again eased the flashlight from his bag and panned the beam around the gleaming kv door closed curtained windows dark was in sharp contrast to the cluttered roughhewn space in which it was garaged ben noted that schyler gainess recollection about there being no windows in the back was accurate the fifteen or twenty feet above the vehicle were open to the barnboard ceiling save for several beams crossing just above its airconditioning unit antennae and what looked like a satellite dish to bens left was a tall set of shelves packed with brushes rags and a dozen or more gallon and spray cans of paint to his right were stacks of cleaning and automotive supplies beyond the supplies though was something much more interesting a short staircase which led up to what looked like a small enclosed office with two large glass windows facing inward he headed for the office trying to ignore the niggling thought that the more intelligent of his fictional role models probably wouldnt have elected to be alone here in the first place clutching the leather case he made his way quietly up the stairs which felt surprisingly sturdy through the glass he could see a desk and chair twodrawer filing cabinet fax machine copier and a computer the two walls without windows were unadorned and the office door was locked ben shut off the flashlight and knelt in the darkness on the topmost step waiting again for his pulse to slow and the paralysis of his limbs to let up he had always wanted to view himself as adventurous but he knew that compared to most of his friends over the years he had really never been that much of a risktaker so what in the hell was he doing here the lock on the office door was no match for the taggert wires and in less than a minute he was inside using the hooded flash in short bursts and trying to convince himself that the precaution of turning it off and on was unnecessary finally he gave in and kept it lit albeit below his waist there were a few papers on the desk but none was any more interesting or incriminating than a fantasy baseball league score sheet and a few bills related to the rv the file cabinet standard office max or staples was locked rather than waste time with the wires ben took a heavy screwdriver and popped the drawers open the top one of them was completely empty except for several old sports page sections from the cincinnati enquirer and a dogeared copy of hustler the bottom drawer was something else again it was virtually filled with guns revolvers pistols and one snubnosed submachine gun plus a dozen or more boxes of ammunition and three hand grenades for a full minute ben stared down at the cache his sensible self screaming that he was in well over his head and needed to get out of the place and far away as quickly as possible perhaps some sort of anonymous tip to the police about guns and terrorists would get a response or maybe one of his friends on the chicago force would have an idea of what he should do next but neither of those actions was likely to address the stillunanswered question of whether in fact this rv had something to do with illicit bone marrow theft or anything else in which alice gustafson might be interested ben flicked off the light again and stared down through the window and the darkness at the silhouette of the massive adventurer assuming the door to the rv was locked was there any percentage in trying to get inside there had to be a security device of some sort in play perhaps the best move was to leave and return with someone who could handle that offhand he could think of two men he knew who were skilled enough to fill the bill having made his decision he turned and was about to leave the office when as almost an afterthought he pulled the single wide desk drawer open and shined his flash inside there were more invoices relative to the winnebago and some offcolor printouts from the internet he was flipping through the invoices when he noticed still in the drawer a threebyfive file card clipped to a photo a small threebythree color headshot slightly blurry but totally distinguishable ben caught his breath although there was no need to confirm the identity of the man he did so anyway the likeness to the first of madame sonjas renderings was remarkable from a mass of shattered bone and torn flesh she had reconstructed this mans face almost perfectly written on the file card in a heavy masculine hand was lonnie durkin little farm pugsley hill road conk idaho bens tense smile was bittersweet after so many days and so many miles the man he had dubbed glenn now had a real name and an address but for a family in idaho there was great sadness in store ben slipped the photo and card into his pocket and quietly exited the office at the bottom of the stairs he hesitated then approached the mobile home and stood in the silent darkness in front of the door debating he had what he had come for his sensible self reasoned why push things even if there was a security system and he tripped the alarm his suddenly emboldened self countered he could race out to his car and be headed out of town before anyone responded to it he opened the door to the alley just a crack and set his tool bag beside it feeling vaguely detached from himself he returned to the adventurer and gently tried the handle the door opened but not in the way he expected it was viciously kicked open from the inside striking ben square in the face and driving him back dazed onto his butt momentarily blinded by the interior light all he could see was the silhouette lit from behind of a large narrowwaisted man whose shoulders virtually filled the doorway you were right the man said to someone inside the rv there was someone out here laughing the man leapt from the stairs and in the same motion though barefooted kicked ben viciously in the chest and up to his jaw snapping his teeth together with the sound of a drummers rim shot ben who had just made it to his knees slammed back into the shelves of paint scattering the cans noisily across the concrete stunned he rolled to one side catching enough of a look to see a man in shorts and a black tee with shoulderlength blond hair before he could take in any more he was kicked again this time in the side of his chest his breath burst out as pain exploded from his ribs from within his body he was certain he heard the snapping of bone the agony in his chest was nearly disabling and blood was cascading from his nose into his mouth and down the back of his throat his tumbling illfocused thoughts searched desperately for something he could do some weapon he could use or some convincing story that would fit the circumstances and at least slow down the onslaught that was the instant his hand hit against a spray can of paint the top of the can had apparently been knocked off connie get the fuck out here and turn the lights on the bull hollered bending down grabbing bens jacket and pulling him up like a puppet praying at once that there was paint in the can and that the nozzle opening was pointing in the right direction ben was still being hauled upright when he swung the can to within six inches of his assailants eyes and fired the results were all that he could have hoped for instantly thick dark paint filled both of the mans sockets shouting obscenities he reeled backward pawing at his eyes ben had already reached the door when the behemoth slammed onto the steps of the rv jesus vincent a womans voice cried out but ben hauling his bag along was already in the alley hobbling painfully toward laurel way chapter no human thing is of serious importance plato the republic book x the first thing joe anson became aware of was the steady swoosh of the respirator gently forcing air into his diseaseravaged lungs the second was the white noise thrum of the jet engine they were airborne and on their way east more than four thousand miles from cameroon to a surgical team awaiting him in amritsar india his yearlong worsening struggle to breathe was very nearly over anson knew the endotracheal tube was in place down his throat but it didnt bother him much it had to be medication he reasoned some sort of narcotic with a little sedative and just a pinch or two of memory eraser thrown in psychopharmacology was becoming more and more like the militarys smart bombs able to pinpoint targets in the brain with everincreasing accuracy whatever the nature of the drugs the combination he was being given was working he was experiencing none of the choking strangulating sensation so many intubated patients complained about what he was experiencing at that moment were overriding feelings of relief wrapped around a profound sadness relief that the ordeal of his pulmonary fibrosis was almost over and sadness that it required the death of a man for him to reach this point it was then that he realized that elizabeth st pierre was sitting quietly beside the stretcher her hand wrapped around his he turned his head slightly to see her and nodded that he was aware of the situation her expression was more peaceful than he had ever seen it almost beatific hello joseph she said softly in french then she continued in english the language in which he was more comfortable i have tapered the sedation down just for a little while so you could wake up and know everything is all right in fact everything is going perfectly were more than halfway there well before we arrive everything will be in place the pulmonary transplant surgeons who are being brought in to perform this operation are the best in the world do you understand anson nodded and then made the motion of writing oh yes of course st pierre said how foolish of me i have some paper right here she handed him a clipboard and a pen have you learned any more about the man who is soon to save my life anson wrote no more than we already know the man is was thirtynine a week or so ago he suffered the rupture of an aneurysm in his brain bleeding was massive and there wasnt anything that could be done to save him he has been pronounced braindead by the physicians at the central hospital in amritsar and has been maintained on life support pending the donation of his heart lungs eyes liver kidneys pancreas and bone many will live because of this gallant man including you does he have a family i know he has a wife it is she who has given permission indeed who has requested that these transplants go ahead children i dont know i will find out good i wish to do somethingor the family all in due time joseph if they will accept our gratitude in any tangible way i will be certain they are well compensated i will wish to meet my saviors widow if that is possible i shall make it happen now please my friend you must rest wait yes has sarah been notified not yet contact her before i go into the operating room tell her i love her i will do my best to locate them and tell her i am afraid of dying before my work is done that is nonsense you were facing death in fact as you remember your breathing stopped altogether but now you will live and be healthy we have a perfect match joseph a twelvepoint match that is one in a million no no given your unusual protein pattern and blood type one in ten million you will not die i will not die he wrote now rest joseph rest and dream of a life where the air is sweet and fragrant and rich with oxygen as only jungle air can be and you can get as much of it into your body as you want elizabeth took away the clipboard and kissed him tenderly on the forehead then anson saw her take up his intravenous line and inject something into the rubber port in just seconds he felt a wave of warmth and serenity sweep over him anson opened his eyes and saw the gleaming giant saucer lights of the operating room shining overhead the scent of disinfectant was in the air the temperature in the room was rather cool and involuntarily he shuddered dr anson a reassuring male voice indian speaking fluent accented english said i am dr sanjay khanduri you are doing very well and so are we your new lung is here and we are ready to put it in place we will transplant only one lung the other will go to a person also in desperate need in a very short time the volume of your new lung will expand in such a way that you will be able to function as if you had two i assure you dr anson that i am very very good at performing this procedure in fact if i were going to have this operation done i would be sad because it wouldnt be me doing it khanduris laugh was highpitched and merry okay then dr anson he went on just close your eyes and in your mind count with me backward from ten when you awake you will be a new man ready tennine chapter some of you have the power of command and in the composition of these god has mingled goldothers he has made of silver to be auxiliariesothers again who are to be husbandmen and craftsmen he has composed of

myself to hit the pavement at forty miles an hour but before i can move the cab screeches to a halt throwing me hard against the back of the passenger seat what is happening again the scene blurs the movement around me is indistinct suddenly the door is ripped open a large man reaches in and grabs me i fight but he is very strong a black nylon stocking covers his face i try tearing at the mask but a second man is on me his face is also covered his breath smells terribly of fish and garlic before i can react a syringe appears in his hand the heavier man tightens his grip on me no please no dont the needle is jammed down into the muscle at the base of my neck i scream but hear no sound heroin it must be heroin this cant be happening to me the cab peels away spraying dirt and stones i feel weak and disconnected from the two men my mind is spinning trying desperately to sore things out but that effort confuses me even more it is still too soon for any drug to take effect dont let this

open your eyes yet we have them covered natalie could understand enough of the womans portuguese to interpret it still she felt unable to speak dr santoro she hears us well well our dove begins to

me iamamerican natalie heard her strained hoarse voice say in somewhat awkward portuguese ido notspeakportuguesevery well she felt extremely vague and hungover but one at a time her senses were checking in there was a pounding in her temples and behind her eyes that was extremely unpleasant but bearable the smell of isopropyl alcohol and disinfectant was distinctively hospital the institutional texture of the sheets supported that conclusion then she became aware of the oxygen prongs in her nose the message from her senses blended with the alltoodear memories of being assaulted nearly escaping and then being shot in the back actually it sounds as if your portuguese is quite good the man said in accented english but i will try and accommodate you i am dr xavier santoro you are a patient in the santa teresa hospital in rio de janeiro you have been a patient here for a number of days the lights have now been turned off i will take the pads from your eyes but i will have to replace them soon your corneas were quite scratched the right more than the left they have responded nicely to treatment but they are not all better after i remove the pads please open your eyes intermittently to allow them some time to adjust if you have any significant discomfort we will immediately replace the patches the tape holding pads over natalies eyes was gently pulled away she kept her lids closed for a minute as she tested her hands and feet then her arms and legs her joints were piteously stiff but they all seemed to be working no paralysis her hand brushed across a urinary catheter which suggested she had been in santa teresas for some time cautiously she opened her eyes the room was dimly lit from fluorescent light flowing in from the corridor outside her door the glare was unpleasant but objects quickly came into focus an iv was draining into her left forearm there was an ornate crucifix over the doorway there were no windows on the three walls she could see dr xavier santoro wearing scrubs and a surgical coat gazed down at her benignly his face was scholarly long and narrow with a prominent nose and wirerimmed glasses and from where she lay he seemed quite tall ii was shot she said am i all right here let me help you up in bed a bit santoro pulled her up toward the head of the bed then raised it fortyfive degrees im a medical studenta senior medical student in bostonmy name is natalie reyesa taxi driver took me from the airport to an alley andam i all right santoro inhaled deeply and exhaled slowly you were found in an alley with only your panties on miss reyes no bra as you said you had been shot twice twice in the back on the right we estimate you were there lying unconscious beneath a pile of trash in the alley for two days you lost a good deal of blood this is midwinter here in brazil the temperature at night has been less than ten degrees celsius not freezing but cold enough what day was i brought in here santoro consulted her bedside chart the eighteenth i flew in on the fifteenthand was attacked on the way from the airport so it was three dayswhat day is it now it is the twentyseventh a wednesday you have been in a coma since your arrival probably from the prolonged exposure shock and infection we had no idea who you were nobody called the policelooking for me not as far as we know the police have been here though they will want to come back and get a statement from you i feel short of breath santoro took her hand that is understandable he said but i promise you that symptom will improve with time with time santoro hesitated you were quite ill when you were brought in he said finally badly dehydrated and in shock your right lung had collapsed completely from the gunshots and the bleeding into your chest there was lifethreatening infectionim sorry to have to tell you this but with the bullet wounds and infection we could not reinflate the lung and your vital signs were slipping the decision was made that to save your life the lung had to be removed removed natalie felt a sudden wave of nausea sweep over her she began to hyperventilate bile swept up into her throat my lung we had no choice santoro was saying no this cant be but on the positive side you have made a remarkable recovery to date i was an athlete she managed to say aa runner pleaseplease let this be a dream images of herself dragging ahead using a walker swirled through her brain my lung she would be a pulmonary cripple forever never to run again always short of breath she tried chastising herself for not responding to the fact that these people had saved her life but all she could focus on was that life as she had known it was over an athlete santoro said well that explains your response to the surgery i am sure this is a terrible shock to you but take it from a chest surgeon miss reyes having this operation does not mean you will no longer be able to run with time your left lung will compensate and your breathing capacity will increase to the point where it could come close to equaling what you could do with both lungs oh god i cant believe this perhaps you would like us to contact someone back home oh yes yes i have family who must be frantic with worry dr santoro im sorry for not sounding more appreciative to you and everyone for saving my life i just cant believe whats happened it is normal in situations like this believe me but your life will not be altered nearly as drastically as you think ihope so thank you when you are able we have some hospital business to attend to you were in the intensive care unit for several days but because the hospital has been filled to overflowing you have been moved to the building we call the annex it is not connected to the actual hospital estella will be in to take some information for billing and for our records i have insurance that will cover everythingi can get the policy number when i call home we do a great deal of charity work here at santa teresas but we certainly appreciate it when we can get paid we have a small rehabilitation room here in the annex and we would like to get you up on the treadmill or the bicycle as soon as possible natalie recalled the countless hours she spent in physical therapy rehabbing her torn achilles would this rehabilitation be as bad it was probably normal after a trauma like this but she wasnt able even to consider the prospect of recovery first the suspension from school now this how could this have happened a phone she asked of course ill have estella take care of that also i wonder if you could stay aroundim going to call my professor dr douglas berenger maybe you could speak with him the cardiac surgeon in boston yes you know him i know of him he is regarded as one of the very best in his field i work in his lab natalie had neither the desire nor the wind to go into the reason for her illfated trip to brazil all she really wanted in fact was to get home as soon as possible you must be a very brilliant student santoro said wait here well get the phone also the police have asked to be notified if when you woke up they would like to take a statement from you as soon as you are strong enough to give one and i must replace those eye patches i dont feel any pain we have used numbing drops i will tell the police what i knowbut it isnt much contrary to what we brazilians often hear when we travel our military police are quite efficient and effective even so natalie replied i doubt theyll have much success with this case i reach for the door handle and prepare myself to hit the pavement at forty miles an hour but before i can move the cab screeches to a halt throwing me hard against the back of the passenger seat what is happening again the scene blurs the movement around me is indistinct suddenly the door is ripped open a large man reaches in and grabs me i fight but he is very strong a black nylon mask covers his face i try tearing at the mask but a second man is on me his face is also covered before i can react a syringe appears in his hand no please no dont as in the past natalie was at once both a participant and an observer in the events that were so radically altering her life she was a prisoner of her memory watching and feeling terrifyingly involved yet strangely detached and above all powerless to escape the scenario or to alter the outcome as always the cab drivers voice was as distinct as his appearance was blurred he might be sitting next to her and she wouldnt have recognized him but if he said just one word she would know the alleys blocked with trash and garbage and cardboard boxesand a fence an unwilling captive natalie as always ran from her masked pursuers and clambered over the boxes and trash and heard the shots and felt the pain and collapsed into blackness then as had often happened a voice wedged itself into the hideous experience this time the voice was a familiar one nat its me doug can you hear me oh thank god thank god youre here youre at the airport nat ready to fly home they gave you something to knock you out for the transfer and the ambulance ride out here it should wear off in just a few minutes howlong since i called you its less than twentyfour hours since we spoke i came down on a medevac flight to get you the school has consented to pay for whatever your insurance doesnt thank youoh thank you this is terrible i know nat i know it is but youre alive and your brain is intact and take it from me your body will improve more than you can imagine emily trotter from anesthesia is here with me just in case shes waiting in the plane terrys here too nothing could keep me from coming nat millwoods comforting voice said we have to get you home so we can go running again ive told everyone who would listen about how you ran away from those arrogant highschool track stars now i need some more stories he stroked her forehead and then squeezed her hand nat were all so sorry for whats happened berenger said weve been worried sick the policeman who came to interview mesaid that no one had called thats nonsense i even had one of the boston police whos originally from brazil call them the one who interviewed mecouldnt get away fast enoughit was like he just didnt care well we certainly called and called thank you dr santoro says youre strong and your recovery has been astonishing a miracle he calls it he says your left lung is doing incredibly well and your body is compensating beautifully for the loss of the other one my eyes i spoke to the ophthalmologist theyre covered because youve had some temporary damage to your corneas from exposure in that alley he said that if your discomfort isnt too bad we could remove the patches for good when we have you settled on board well have someone from the eye service go over you as soon as we get home natalie felt the stretcher begin to roll across the tarmac in just a few minutes she had been transferred to one inside the plane moments later her eye pads were removed berenger stethoscope in place was listening to her chest doing great he said natalie reached up and touched his face i never got to present our paper thats okay you can do it next year that depends wheres the meeting berenger grinned paris he said now get some rest everythings going to be all right as always the conference call of the guardian council took place on tuesday at precisely noon greenwich mean time this is laertes simonides here themistocles greetings from australia glaucon polemarchus the meeting is called to order laertes said i have heard from aspasia the operation on a has been a complete success the match was twelve out of twelve so only minimal drugs will be required if any at all aspasia expects a to be back at work within two weeks his prognosis is for a full recovery and unimpaired life span well done marvelous other cases polemarchus here we might as well start with me this coming week we have two kidneys one liver and one heart scheduled the recipients have each already been certified as worthy of our services and all necessary arrangements logistical and financial have been taken care of in the case of kidneys the procedure would usually result in the transplantation of both kidneys into our recipient the liver would result in transplantation of the largest organ segment anatomically possible lets consider the kidneys first twentysevenyearold male laborer mississippi united states approved all five called out in unison fortyyearold female restaurant owner toronto canada what sort of restaurant chinese approved they all said as one and laughed the liver a thirtyfiveyearold male teacher from wales glaucon here i thought we agreed no teachers have we any options none that i know of polemarchus said although i can check again this is a perfect twelvepoint match for l number thirtyone on your lists as you probably know he is one of the wealthiest men in great britain i do not know what he has agreed to pay for this procedure but knowing the way xerxes negotiates i would guess it was substantial in that case glaucon said approved but let us not make this a precedent approved the others echoed chapter a statearisesout of the needs of mankind plato the republic book ii aithea satterfield bustled around bens small kitchen to the extent that her years allowed would you like lemon with your tea mr callahan you dont have any in your refrigerator but i do in mine ben was impressed that his neighbor chose not to remark on those other food items that he also did not have in his refrigerator virtually all in fact it had been three days since his return from cincinnati and the octogenarian had interpreted his two blackened eyes as a call to action along with his swollen nose just a crack at the tip dr banks had said nothing to do for it but dont get hit there again and unremitting pain in his chest just a crack in one of your ribs nothing to do for it but dont get hit there again the truth was that as frustrating as the woman could be sometimes ben was grateful for the help the headaches he was experiencing which banks was attributing to a concussion nothing to do for it but dont get hit there again had diminished from an eight to somewhere around a four and from present all the time to present only when he moved he had never been very macho when it came to dealing with any sort of pain and at the moment he was exhausted from coping with his various discomforts and more than a little annoyed at being inactive there were things he needed and wanted to do ill take the tea straight up mrs satterfield i really appreciate your help i only wish i could find a way to repay you nonsense dear just wait until youre my age youll be desperate to matter to somebody dont bank on it ben thought the quixotic dedication of alice gustafson the draining week in florida the remarkable encounter with madame sonja the surprisingly lucid schyler gaines the close call on laurel way and finally the identification of lonnie durkin granted each had made a dent in his armor of detachment and ennui but he saw those dents as insignificant he had done what he had been hired to do and mostly he still planned to crawl back into his cocoon until the next call came along before he did that however there was one final loose end he wanted to tie up this one involving a family in conda idaho well mrs satterfield he said if you really mean that i could use another favor just name it dear i have to go away again i need you to feed pincus and water my what i mean is i need you to feed and water pincus pardon me for saying so mr callahan but youre in no condition to travel probably not but travel i must anyway the continuous stabbing pain in his side made worse by even minor movement he could handle but until today the headaches had made a trip to idaho impossible after his return from six hours with dr banks and the radiologists a concerned alice gustafson bearing a vase of wildflowers had visited him at his apartment over tea and danish courtesy of althea he recounted in minute detail the findings and subsequent assault in the garage on laurel way i knew it she exclaimed when he had finished i knew that woman in maine was telling me the truth you can tell these things her grim expression held an odd mix of vindication and toughness the guns worry me greatly she went on but they do not surprise me where there is illegal organ trade of any kind there is very big business with very high price tags many of those involved in the trade are little more than gangsters most of the gangsters i know would be envious of the weapons in that garage there is really no estimating the money involved in certain countries those who go abroad to receive illegal kidneys are reimbursed up to one hundred thousand dollars by their health ministries they ultimately save the system much more than that in dialysis fees and other medical costs and also make the transplant waiting list for kidneys that much shorter thereby lowering the dialysis expenses even more i would imagine those needing a bone marrow transplant would be in even more desperate medical straits exactly its always under the sword of life and death that the procedure is done and of all the organs the one demanding the closest tissue match between donor and recipient is bone marrow i cant help but wonder if these people are dealing with other organs as well i wouldnt be surprised whatever they are into those guns i saw say theyre deadly serious about it speaking of deadly why do you think the rv people didnt just kill lonnie and the woman from maine gustafson shrugged maybe they draw the line at murder she said or maybe they keep these people alive in case they have to repeat the procedure remember the woman said she was blindfolded or drugged most of the time she recalled few details of what happened to her so maybe there was just no need to kill her or maybe they purposely choose people whom the authorities arent likely to believe thats a theory except that if these rv people know what theyre doing the completeness of the tissue match is all that matters how many perfect matches does each person have perfect not very many especially if the recipient has type o blood and an unusually rare protein or two on their white blood cells initially gustafson wanted to call lonnie durkins family on the spot but ben insisted he be allowed to go there in person i feel like i need to do this was all he could say youre not fit to go anyplace i will be give me three or four days why the sudden zeal mr callahan i really dont have much left to pay you with its not about money professor its i dont really knowmaybe its about closure i seewell please dont be embarrassed by those feelings mr callahan many of our supporters find that the more they understand of what is going on in the world the more their fog of skepticism burns off she handed him an envelope youve done an excellent job someday maybe well be in a position to keep you on a retainer now what do you want to do about the winnebago i dont think the guy in the van who did all this to me could be certain whether i was a detective of some sort or just a runofthemill burglar ben said in fact i dont think he even got a good look at my face before i blacked out his eyes it was quite dark in that garage if cops show up there now thats it the people who own that winnebago will be alerted that i wasnt just a petty thief but lonnie durkin is dead because of them if we chose to do nothing and someone else got hurt oror worse i for one would be terribly upset okay okay point made ben thought for a time then offered how about if i go online and also make some calls to people i know and see if i can locate a pi in cincinnati who has some connections on the force he can make sure the rv is still there and then bring the cops in with a warrant to search for weapons or some such im afraid we dont have any money left to pay him gustafson said ben held up the organ guard check i do it took a painful trip to the office and more than twentyfour hours for ben to connect with a pi in cincinnati who was willing to do what they needed for what he could afford the mans name was arnie dolan and it didnt take long for him to complete his investigation its gone he said calling back after just a couple of hours the van that too but i mean the garage burned to the ground yesterday the charred remains are still smoldering took another building down with it three alarms do the police know its arson clumsy arson theyre calling it apparently they found a gas can that would be just a bit suspicious ben said wondering if the response meant the people in and around the van knew he wasnt just a burglar or if they were merely taking stringent precautions either way when he found the photo of lonnie durkin he knew he simply should have tiptoed out of the garage and driven off even in the stable cocoon of his range rover there wouldnt have been enough tylenol and motrin in the state to enable ben to drive the sixteen hundred miles from chicago to conda idaho the town was just north of soda springs which was fiftyseven miles south and east of pocatello which was in the southeast corner of the state not a hundred miles from both wyoming and utah instead he flew into pocatello via minneapolis and rented a blazer the money from organ guard had already melted like spring snow and his bills remained virtually unchanged at least until the mailmans next delivery perhaps when he got back to chicago he would put some sort of ad in one of the local papers for the moment though he was where he should be doing something that in truth he wanted to do throughout the trip he continued to wonder why the inventor of the elastic rib belt had never been awarded a nobel prize his headache had become manageable and his nostrils had actually begun to admit some air but the rib fracture was something else again dr banks had assured him that only one rib was cracked and that there was no displacement of either of the two pieces but after almost six days ben still refused to believe it even with the miraculous rib belt strapped on most movements were still broadcast to his pain center in dolby surround sound but without the elastic splint even shallow breaths were a challenge no matter what the pain though it did not measure up to the emotional ache at the prospect of having to sit with a mother and father and tell them that their son was dead not wanting to upset lonnie durkins family for too long but also unwilling simply to show up unannounced at little farm ben called from the airport in pocatello lonnies mother karen did not press him to say over the phone that her son was dead but it was clear to ben that in her heart she knew they set a time when he would meet with her and her husband and she gave him directions to their farm then after a brief stop in soda springs to compose himself take a few motrin register at the hooper springs bedandbreakfast and pass some time joylessly viewing the impressive geyser at hooper springs park ben turned onto route and drove north to the hamlet of conda sleepy peaceful and very small conda reminded him eerily of curtisville florida home of schyler gaines and his gas station he tried to imagine the massive adventurer with vincent at the wheel and connie perched on the thronelike passenger seat gliding through the town like a hungry great white on a reef searching for pugsley hill road and the man whose cells they somehow knew were a nearperfect match for those of a person twentyfive hundred miles away karen durkins directions brought ben onto a long dry dirt road that knifed through a vast tableland of grain fields he wondered where in the flatness pugsley hill could possibly be after nearly two miles the fields gave way to corrals stables and some horses beyond the corrals was a large rustred barn and across from that a prim white twostory home perched on a modest rise a wooden sign arching over the drive announced it to be little farm karen durkin and her husband ray were waiting anxiously on their narrow front porch both were in their fifties but might have been a decade older their faces were weathered and honest and spoke of years of hard work in an often harsh and unpredictable profession rays handshake was firm and his hands callused but the soft sadness in his eyes was inestimable lonnies dead he asked before they had even entered the house ben nodded im truly sorry he managed karen led them into a bright homey kitchen with print curtains and a worn round oak table that was almost certainly handmade he paused by the door to scratch the family dog behind the ear thats joshua karen said a blackandwhite pit bull ben replied hes just beautiful thanks hes our second one just turned four woody our first one lived to be sixteen lonnie named them both totally gentle and totally loyal maybe if joshua had been with lonnie that day she stopped speaking and dabbed at her tears with a tissue off to one corner of the kitchen was a builtin desk and on it were several framed photos of a young boy and one of a young man all of them ben felt fairly certain were of lonnie he was always a very good boy karen said after she had placed mugs of coffee and a platter of brownies on the table they said the cord was around his neck in the womb and he didnt get enough oxygen to his brain so he wasnt much in school but he loved animals and all the people who work on the farm loved him ben flashed on madame sonjas explanation for making two sets of drawings one was clearly the lonnie depicted in his photographs was the other the man he might have become he wondered that as he went through the details of lonnies death there seemed no need to expose them to the coroners photos and madame sonjas renderings unless of course they asked to see them here are the numbers of the police in fort pierce and dr woyczek the medical examiner theyll tell you whether or not you will have to identify him in person or whether you can send down something with his fingerprints on it and possibly some dental records the state police here should be able to help you deal with them and whatever mortician you choose should be able to help you out too especially in making arrangements to bring lonnies body back i told you karen ray said stonily i told you he was dead im just glad he didnt suffer none his wife replied mr callahan i think we both want to know everything you can tell us about how our son ended up in florida and who might have done this to him i think i know why in a general sense and even how but as for who and why specifically lonnie well believe it or not you might help me answer that question over the next hour with very little interruption from the durkins ben recounted his involvement from the first meeting with alice gustafson through his decision to visit conda and personally deliver the sad news of lonnies death so thats how you got them black eyes ray clearly impressed said when he had finished it was kind of you not to ask before believe it or not i still think i got the best of him you havent told us why these people chose our lonnie karen said thats because i dont know i can tell you this much it makes no sense that they would have come all the way up here for lonnie unless they already knew his tissue type but how would they get that theres only one way through a blood test except he never had that sort of test has he had any blood test at all the durkins exchanged inquiring looks two years ago karen said suddenly when he had those dizzy spells ray added dr christiansen ordered them do you think he would speak with me ben asked she karen said dr christiansen is a lady doctor i would think so especially if i come into soda springs with you can we call her today i dont see why not shes a very nice doctor even i go to her ray said proudly hopefully after i speak with her shell agree to see you without us i dont mind driving down to soda springs if i have to but with what youve told us today we have quite a bit to do oh yes im sorry for being so inconsiderate nonsense youre a fine man theres nothing you can do about whats happened except to get to the bottom of things and thats what youre doing ben sat quietly for a time looking at the woman and her husband trying to comprehend their inestimable emptiness could there possibly be anything worse than the loss of ones child in that moment studying their strained worn faces he sensed something else as well something that he now acknowledged had been percolating within him over the weeks since he first met alice gustafson he cared he cared about this couple now without their son for the rest of their lives he cared about a frightened confused ridiculed motel housekeeper in maine whom he had never met he cared about bringing some sort of justice to a remorseless killer who was responsible at least partly for so much pain and suffering so is there a hospital in soda springs he asked finally caribou memorial hospital it isnt very big but folks say its a terrific place thankfully we havent any need for it what i mean is in spite of herself karen durkin began to cry ben sat quietly sipping absently at his coffee swallowing against the fullness in his throat he had always thought hed be a father two or three times over in fact since the breakup of his marriage and his gradual dc scent into ennui and detachment he hadnt cared much about the time that was slipping past now despite the anguish of his hosts he found himself wondering what it might be like to have kids im staying at a bedandbreakfast in soda springs he said why dont i go there now and we can talk about things tomorrow no no karen said regaining her composure im okay lets call dr christiansen now if youre sure youre up to it caribou memorial is that where lonnies blood test was done i suppose so she said no twasnt ray cut in that new lab had just opened right by the pharmacy i took him there myself new lab thats right brandnew building it opened maybe six months maybe a year before we went there i cant remember its name i dont think i ever knew it karen said let me call dr christiansen to see if shell meet with you ben shes gonna be very sad about lonnie even though he never had to see her all that much he was one of her favorites she made the call from a phone on the builtin desk while ray and ben sat in silence both staring down at their coffee no problem ben karen announced when she had finished the doctor will see you in her office at ten tomorrow morning thatll give you time for a good breakfast and maybe to see the geyser in hooper springs park ill do that ben said rising and shaking their hands he turned patted joshua and was reaching for the door when karen said oh by the way its the whitestone laboratory pardon the lab where lonnie had his blood drawn its called the whitestone laboratory i think it may be part of a chain only the largest chain in the world ben said chapter can you see except with the eye plato the republic book i there was blood everywhere splattered across a roadway exploding from the ground flowing down his own face ben seldom remembered dreams but he awoke at four thirty in the morning knowing that his fitful night of sleep at the hooper springs bedandbreakfast had been full of very violent ones a string of macabre scenarios held together by a blooddrenched winnebago sometimes he was driving other times it was vincent the wrestlersized denizen of the now extinct laurel way garage twice during the night ben woke up in a panic from something in his nightmare then quickly forgot what it was both times he used the small bathroom and returned to bed only to immediately become immersed once more in the dream and the blood and the terror finally he willed the images to be over turned on the bedside lamp and propped an old travis mcgee paperback on his chest trying to make some sense of the lurid dream when he felt himself drifting off again he took a long shower and left the bedandbreakfast for a walk around the stillsleeping town how big he wondered as he wandered past the sleeping shops and paused briefly by the soda springs apothecary assuming that the winnebago adventurer was the means by which unwilling donors were brought to anxiously awaiting recipients how big was the scope of the business just a few more steps brought him to the front of the modest redbrick building that housed the whitestone laboratory in chicago it seemed that there was a whitestone lab on almost every corner some of them like the one he had gone to a few years ago were no more than phlebotomy centers blooddrawing offices the vials of blood were then brought by courier to an area lab where most of the tests were run the whitestone lab in chicago where he had had his blood taken was a storefront not five blocks from his office he remembered dr banks remarking on the speed efficiency and dependability of the lab and also the military like precision with which they had transitioned from a small littleknown operation to perhaps the number one clinical laboratory in the world soda springs according to the sign west of town had a population of just more than thirtythree hundred apparently that was more than enough for whitestone at the moment the room beyond the plateglass streetside window was dark but peering inside ben could make out a warm waiting area with several large plants a police cruiser rolled up the street and slowed enough for the lone occupant to check him over then smile and wave before driving on ben wondered if someone might have called in about the oddlooking stranger making his way up main street through the gloom in no particular hurry welcome to smalltown america with several hours still to kill before his appointment he wandered back to his bedandbreakfast had a betterthanaverage breakfast of poached eggs and homemade corned beef hash and then checked in with his office answering machine mr callahan a mans deep voice said i have been referred to you by judge caleb johnson who says youre the best detective in the city if johnson knows who i am ben thought then hes afar better detective than l am the voice went on to say that his was a case of possible spousal infidelity and that there would be millions of dollars hinging on the results of bens discreet investigation whatever bens usual rate he would triple it in exchange for having this matter be made his top priority triple ben did some quick mental math and realized that even if the stalkandgawk case resolved quicker than usual and he suspected that it might not he would be able to make up several times over for the organ guard check he had already nearly spent or the money he had turned down in the katherine de souci case triple the rich bass voice was a ladder out of the deep red hole he was in ben hummed a chorus of prines fish and whistle father forgive us for what we must do for the immediate future there would be no wolf at his door what goes around comes around he thought smiling bad or good what goes around comes around dr marilyn christiansen an osteopathic general practitioner was a kindly woman in her midforties practicing out of an old victorian house on the east edge of the town the antithesis of the always rushed and harried dr banks she was bereft at learning of the death of lonnie durkin and stunned at the notion of his being used as an unwilling bone marrow donor this is very sad she said he was the durkins only child is there any other possible explanation for what happened to him she asked not according to the medical examiner in florida the holes of a bone marrow aspiration were present in the bone in each hip how bizarre well i didnt see lonnie in the office very much he was seldom sick but i certainly knew him most everyone in the town did very sweet boy i say boy even though he was in his twenties because as you probably know i do know ben said sparing her the explanation his parents told me you saw him for dizziness two years ago even though i never suspected anything serious i ordered a routine laboratory panel the results all came back normal and his dizziness simply went away some sort of virus i guess the tests were done at whitestone yes i could have used the hospital lab but ive found that white stone is just a bit well more efficient do you know the director of the lab shirley murphy i dont know her well single woman with a teenage child a girl do you feel comfortable calling her to see if she could meet with me today of course but i suspect you wont have any problem getting in to see her how do you know christiansen hesitated smiling enigmatically i see that you dont wear a wedding ring she said finally divorced well as i said shirley is single and shes educated and soda springs is well pretty much of a small family oriented town ben had never been very intuitive or aware when it came to women but even he could tell that shirley murphy was coming on to him she was an attractive enough woman about his age with streaked hair large breasts and full hips however whether it was the introductory phone call that marilyn christiansen made to her or the way she actually came to work every day shirley was wearing some sort of highly aromatic perfume in addition to a great deal of makeup neither of which he ever found pleasing in any way still as long as she might be of help to him there was no way he was going to rain on her fantasies the real question was how much information to share with her if she knew anything about what had happened to lonnie durkin or mentioned bens visit to someone who did he would have made a mistake as grave as trying to open the rv door it was time for some creative flirting and some creative lying neither of which he was particularly skilled at gratefully dr christiansen had agreed not to mention his real profession i dont think we needed to concoct too elaborate a story around who you are mr callahan she had said when she finished her call to the lab it didnt seem like shirley heard too much beyond the words single and goodlooking i told her that you came in because of some blurred vision after your auto accident and mentioned you were interested in the whitestone lab howd i do murphys office was tidy and businesslike with framed french impressionist prints on the wall along with some diplomas and two awards for being a whitestone laboratories regional employee of the month the volumes filling the small bookcase didnt look as if they had seen much use as the doctor had predicted shirley was much more interested in the teller than in the tale i own a small company that does hla you know human leukocyte antigen typing for transplants ben had said watching her closely for any reaction whitestone is on the verge of buying us out but keeping me on as director they want to move our headquarters from chicago and one of the places theyre considering is pocatello another from what they told me is soda springs something about a smaller town having more employee loyalty and longevity thats certainly a fact most of our people have been here since we opened three years ago funny i havent heard anything at all about this its only now being made public im sure that after they narrow their choices down to this area youll be brought in i suspect youre right she had said and that was that so ben she said now clearly taking pains to hold her shoulders back her eyes locked tightly on his and her head at just the right angle tell me about chicago oh its a great city he replied wanting to bring the subject back to hla typing but not wanting to appear to ignore her vibrant and very alive museums symphony great music and of course lake michigan sounds exciting and romantic i think you would love it oh i definitely think i would especially with the right guide perhaps that can be arranged wellperhaps youd like a tour of beautiful downtown soda springs first my daughter has cheerleading practice after school and wont be home until six i think i can get off early wait what am i saying im the boss i know i can get off early after i finish here i have some calls to make so i can only say that id like aumtour very much but well have to see the implied promise brought her shoulders back another half inch so ben tell me what i can do to help you learn about our operation were doing half again as many tests as the hospital lab and as i said weve only been open for about three years only three years impressive very impressive what do you do with your hla typing now to tell you the truth we dont get much call for it transplant candidates from here usually have been worked up in one of the university medical centers what little we do get we send out to pocatello do you keep a record of those you tissuetype not specifically we do have the capability in our quality control program to pull up a list of those who had a specific test drawn including tissuetyping but id have to think a bit about sharing our patients names oh heck i suppose if its really important to you ben i could make an exception i mean you are about to become one of the whitestone family so to speak she favored him with intense eye contact and an expression that spoke of many long lonely idaho nights he knew that given his imminent position with whitestone her willingness to share patient data with him wasnt all that unprofessional just desperate she was asking him to take advantage of her there was strong reason for his wanting to get a printout of those whose blood had been drawn for tissuetyping finding lonnie durkin on that list would mean that marilyn christiansen for all of her kindly concerned ways would have some serious explaining to do still listen shirley he heard his voice saying thats really kind of you to offer but ill be okay just taking a look around the lab and about getting together later id love to take you out for dinner and some conversation but i need to tell you that ive just gotten into a relationship with someone back home thats starting to get pretty serious so conversation is all i can do all right thats it if youre going to succeed in this private detective business no more rockford reruns or travis mcgee books for you shirley murphys expression reflected something other than disappointment oddly enough ben thought it might be relief thank you ben she said thank you for being honest with me come let me show you the lab as he followed the director around the busy operation a surprisingly vivid scenario began running through his mind he was in an ornate courtroom of some sort pacing back and forth as he crossexamined a fidgeting woman his minds eye could not see clearly he felt certain though that the woman was shirley lets assume he was saying that lonnie durkin would never have been used as the donor in a bone marrow transplant unless his blood had been tissuetyped and yetand yet we must start with the reality that such a transplant did in fact take place could blood have been drawn on mr durkin without his understanding that it was being done after all the man has been acknowledged by his parents and his physician to have been somewhat slow perhaps someone drew his blood then threatened to harm him or his parents if he told anyone it had been done does that make sense to you it sure doesnt to me why would they have chosen him in the first place no maam it really couldnt have happened that way the only place it could have happened was right here in bens imagined rhetoric was cut off abruptly he was standing behind shirley as she was extolling the virtues of a new machine whose name and function he had missed completely over her shoulder he could see a young technician slightly built with a strawberry blond ponytail she was removing a large number of tubes of blood from a freezer and gingerly placing them into racks in several styrofoam shipping coolers filled with dry ice thats a wonderful machine shirley he said hoping she wouldnt ask even the most elementary question about it tell me what percent of the tests that are ordered do you actually do here and how much do you end up sending out good question actually the equipment has gotten so sophisticated accurate and efficient that just a couple of techs can run virtually all the chemistries and hematology we get we still send the more obscure and difficult to run tests out to the larger more regional whitestone labs and also to specialty labs like yours but on the whole what we get in we run here excellent those tubes that are being handled over there are they being sent out for a specific test murphy laughed when i told you we send some things out i wasnt talking about that sort of volume she took him gently by the arm and guided him over to the tech sissy this is mr ben callahan from chicago he owns a lab that does tissuetyping for transplants hazardous duty sissy said motioning to the bruises still enveloping his eyes hey ben replied with candor he hadnt planned you should see the other guy sissy shirley went on mr callahan is interested in these vials youre packing up these theyre backups backups in case a sample gets contaminated or the results get questioned or in case we need to do a retest for any legal reason as far as we know murphy added proudly whitestone is the only lab that takes such precautions perhaps thats why were number one by such a wide margin im sure it adds some to the expense of the tests but from what ive been told whitestone covers that and doesnt pass it on to the consumer or their insurance company bens mind was whirling so every patient you draw has extra tubes of blood frozen and put in storage just a green top murphy said weve been told that thanks to new technology thats all they need we draw an average of four vials of blood on each of our clients red tops gray tops purple tops black tops the colors of the rubber stoppers refer to the chemicals that are inside the vials we refer to the green top as the fifth vial even if we only draw two on a given patient but you have to ship those green tops out oh yes sissy said wed run out of room in no time if we didnt theyre flown to a storage facility in texas and kept there for a year shirley added amazing ben muttered wondering if it was even legal to draw such a tube without the patients knowledge and deciding in the same moment that it probably was so long as the blood was only used for quality control casually he glanced down at the fedex shipping label whitestone laboratory john hamman highway fadiman texas it was so simple yet it fit the facts of the case so powerfully at a lab possibly in a place called fadiman texas lonnie durkins tissue type had been run and undoubtedly recorded ben wondered if a tube containing his own blood had also made the trip to fadiman if so it seemed quite possible that his and lonnie durkins tissue types were two items in the same database a very massive database at that it took a while and the promise of dinner on his next visit for ben to extricate himself from shirley murphy but when he finally had he hurried to a phone and called alice gustafson with a summary of the news from soda springs and a single question what kind of vial is drawn to do a tissue typing on someone her reply though made in a second seemed to him to take an hour that would be a green top she said chapter no physician in so far as he is a physician considers his own good in what he prescribes but the good of his patient plato the republic book i unbelievable the physical therapist and pulmonary therapist stood back from the treadmill and watched in absolute amazement as natalie passed thirty minutes of brisk uphill walking miles per hour with an elevation of four gradually natalie had felt her breathing becoming more strained and a burning beneath her sternum but she was determined to hang on for another few minutes it was little more than two weeks since her medevac return from brazil and little more than three since her right lung had been removed at santa teresa hospital in rio she had spent the first three days out of the hospital at her mothers and might have stayed longer were it not for the pervasive odor of cigarettes present even though out of respect for her daughter hermina was limiting her smoking to the porch and bathroom jenny delighted in having her aunt around and especially in having the chance to be the caregiver for a change the two of them spent hours talking about life and standing tall against adversity as well as about books jenny had reluctantly tried the first harry potter and was now devouring the series movie stars opportunities in medicine and even boys arent you a little young to be interested in boys dont worry auntie nat the boys are young too natalies progress and her attitude had astounded her physicians and rehab specialists the scimitar scar on her right side was still sensitive but there were no other outward signs of the massive operation she had undergone and with each passing day each passing hour her left lung was accepting more and more of the responsibilities for gas exchange that once two lungs had shared hey millwood she said i think tomorrow we should hit the track the surgeon trotting briskly on the adjacent treadmill looked over at her incredulously just dont hurt yourself he said you know time is natures way of keeping everything from happening at once you dont have to totally rehabilitate in a single session before this is all over im going to run a triathlon thats going to be my new sport i think you should stop now nat the physical therapist said i promise well add something tomorrow as natalie started a cooldown millwood turned off his treadmill and hopped off thank you ladies for allowing me to take up your machine like this but i had to see for myself if the rumors about superwoman here were true are you a believer natalie asked believer hell im a disciple in that case you can disciple me over to friendlys for a hot fudge sundae if you can stand my grubbiness ill wait and shower after i get home i have to do a little grocery shopping for my mom anyhow and friendlys is sort of on the way we can meet there natalie finished the short cooldown and performed a set of pulmonary function studies under the guidance of her pulmonary therapist the numbers are okay the woman said but your actual performance is much much better i honestly have never heard of anyone making this sort of progress after a total pneumonectomy you just watch if it can be done im going to do it natalie toweled off and changed into a floppy sweatshirt macabre and disastrous as losing an entire lung sounded the recovery at least to this point had been nothing like the agonizing ordeal of rehabilitating her surgically repaired achilles she had bounced back from that ordeal and she was determined to make it through this one her phenomenal recovery so far had been marred only by recurrent flashbacks to her attack which were disrupting her sleep and sometimes even occurring during the day they were almost identical to the ones she experienced at santa teresas distorted indistinct and emotionally detached in some ways utterly detailed and viscerally terrifying in others one minute she was a frightened participant in the horrific cab ride from the airport the next she was little more than an observer to her assault and subsequent shooting she had discussed the phenomenon with her therapist dr fierstein who spoke to her of the many faces of posttraumatic stress disorder your mind chooses to remember what it can handle she had said much of the rest is dummied down if you will put in a form that your emotions can deal with its a matter of preservation and sanity and when those defenses begin to break down the true emotions connected with the precipitating event can be quite overwhelming we would both do well to watch out for that for the time being it was decided not to treat natalies ptsd with any medications unless and until the symptoms began to interfere with her life but except for some lost sleep to this moment at least that was hardly the case fiersteins belief was that natalie was meeting the challenge of her rehabilitation so successfully because she functioned best when she had something to push against millwood met her in the parking lot of friendlys a seventyyearold chain throughout the northeast that had survived inconsistent food and service largely because of their matchless ice cream i cant totally explain whats happened to me since i woke up from the operation she said to millwood after they had settled into a booth and begun quickly replacing the calories they had burned off on the treadmill with hot fudge sundaes but something inside me has changed she grinned pointed to her thoracotomy scar and added i mean something besides the obvious ive seen the changes in you millwood said so has doug we expected to bring home a morose selfpitying bitter woman and to tell you the truth that wouldnt have surprised us in the least i suspect that if i were in your situation thats the way i would have responded i did feel that way for a while but then something started happening to me it began after i moved back to my own place from my moms i found myself thinking about how this whole business would never have happened if i hadnt gotten suspended from school and i would never have gotten suspended if i hadnt decided that i needed to show cliff renfro what being a good compassionate doctor was all about you had a neardeath experience millwood said different people react to that sort of trauma in different ways some enter a life of fear and hesitation others are absolutely liberated dr fierstein thinks i might just be in denial but i dont its like what happened in rio has begun opening my eyes about myself my own intensity and the effect it has on people around me you know sometimes its possible to care too much about some things over the years ive sort of been caring too much about everything passion is wonderful when its focused but applied without any filter it can be crazymaking for all concerned millwood reached across the table and put his hand on hers i cant believe im hearing this he said natalie made no attempt to wipe aside the tear that had broken free on a course down her cheek ive always taken such pride in being as tough as i was smart especially in my belief that whomever i might be dealing with was lacking because they didnt care with as much energy and commitment as i did its always been like this is who i am take me or leave me but dont expect that im going to change now at thirtyfive with one lung and every reason to pack it in i dont care anymore if im tough or not believe me nat even at your most difficult you still bring more to the table than almost anyone i know your friends love and respect your passion for things although ill admit that sometimes were a little scared of you going off like a roman candle well im going to try like hell to be a little gentler on people and if you catch me going off on anybody you can rub the bridge of your nose or something to tell me to back off got that got it millwood practiced the maneuver perfect thanks until i really get it down you can be my jiminy cricket count on it speaking of consciences terry youll never guess what i did the other day i wrote letters of apology to dean goldenberg and also to cliff renfro there was nothing in it for me but i really wanted to do it to go on the record that i finally know what i did wrong and why it was wrong i also wanted to thank the dean for not kicking my butt out of school for good millwoods expression was enigmatic but there was a spark in his eyes you said there was nothing in it for you to write those letters but you did it anyway thats what i said yeswhy he leaned back in the booth arms folded his gaze fixed on her because youre wrong he said simply there was everything in it for you especially since you didnt think there was i read the letters nat both of them dean goldenberg asked for my opinion about them dougs too they were powerfully written and undeniably from your heart you can say all day and all night that youre changing but those letters say it better he paused a moment for emphasis nat the deans going to recommend that the committee on discipline allow him to terminate your suspension natalie stared at him wideeyed youre not messing with me im cruel millwood said but im not that cruel hes also going to have a talk with dr schmidt about the possibility of reconsidering your residency no guarantees but he sounded somewhat optimistic i really wanted to be the bearer of the news so sam gave me permission to tell you welcome back pal oh man this is just ii dont know what to say you dont have to say anything that you didnt already say in those letters on the track that day you raced the st clements kids we talked about how who you are should always be more important than what you are but there is a balance we all need to find and it appears youre in the process of finding it so he reached across and shook her hand congratulations hey thanks terry thanks for hanging in there with me anything else yeah just one are you going to finish the rest of that sundae nearly airborne with excitement natalie managed to make it through the whole foods market when it happened she had chosen not to tell her mother that she had been suspended from school sooner or later though especially as graduation time approached she knew she was going to have to say something now thanks to the dean and doug and terry and whoever else had stepped in to speak on her behalf that wouldnt be the case best of all was that what she had told terry was the absolute truth she had written the letters taking complete ownership of her actions without any consideration that things would change for her externally during their secondyear course on addiction medicine her class had been required to attend at least two aa meetings and to read in detail about the famous twelve steps the tools for changing the person in various programs who found it necessary to drink or drug or overeat or gamble or sleep around the eighth of those steps had to do with making a list of those the addict had harmed by word or deed the ninth required making amends to those people without any adherent agenda or expectation of forgiveness perhaps she was thinking now it might be time for her to expand her list beginning with her mother a detour and subsequent fourblock tieup made the drive to dorchester twice as long as usual natalie noted proudly that her profanities traditionally xrated in all traffic situations would barely have made pg who is this woman and what have you done with the real natalie reyes humming softly she pulled up in front of herminas house and looped two plastic bags of groceries around each wrist then set them down and retrieved the key from beneath the planter on the front porch she turned to the front door and at that moment smelled smoke and noticed that grayblack wisps were floating out from beneath the door oh jesus she muttered plunging the key into the lock and grasping the ornate doorknob which was hot to the touch fire she screamed to everyone and no one in particular fire call she slipped her hand under her sweatshirt to hold the knob and turned the key then she lowered her shoulder and slammed it against the heavy door with all her might chapter the people have always some champion whom they set over themselves and nurse into greatness plato the republic book viii the front door flew inward and natalie plunged ahead into a wall of black smoke and heat the thought flashed through her mind that somewhere she had heard that it wasnt wise to open the door to a fire because the conflagration would be worsened but she really had no choice her mother and her niece were inside the heat was bearable but the smoke grew more intense with every step stinging her eyes nose and lung halfway down the hallway to the kitchen sputtering and coughing she was forced to pull her sweatshirt over her mouth and nose and drop to her hands and knees to her left the living room was filling with smoke and the flowered paper on the wall by the kitchen was smoldering but there was no sign that the fire had started there the real trouble was ahead of her mom she screamed as she reached the kitchen mom can you hear me the curtains on the windows were ablaze as was the wall behind them the wall adjacent to the living room the oak table and parts of the floor acrid smoke lit eerily by the flames was swirling through the room tongues of fire seemed to be shooting across the ceiling and flickering up from an area of floor by the table momjenny natalie inched her way toward the bedrooms the fire had to have started here she was thinking her mind forming a vivid image of hermina nodding off at the table hunched over the times crossword puzzle a pencil in one hand a glowing winston in the other but where was she the heat was intense now and natalie began worrying about the gas stove there were pilots going all the time without flame finding its way backward into the pipes and she had never heard of a massive explosion from a stove unless unlit gas was actually leaking into the room the pipes to the stove must offer some protection she decided it really didnt matter she wasnt leaving until she found her mother and jenny the heat and swirling smoke were building natalie dropped to her elbows to get more relief from both now in addition there was noise a crescendo of snapping wood falling plaster and hissing flame she was squinting ahead peering through nearly closed eyes when she spotted her mother lying facedown no more than five feet away she was wearing a housecoat and no shoes and was lying motionless in the doorway that led to the bedrooms jenny unless hermina had become disoriented she had to have been trying to get to her granddaughter operating off a surge of adrenaline natalie grabbed her mother by the ankles stood up as high as she could tolerate and began hauling her six inches at a time back into the kitchen the air was significantly hotter than it had been just a minute or so before breathing it was like standing in front of an open furnace there was no movement from her mother no reaction to being dragged facedown across the floor natalie fought the urge to check for signs of life maybe a heart attack had precipitated all of this instead she pushed backward some more she had to get hermina out of the house then get back inside for jenny the back door just beyond the blazing table was engulfed in a sheet of fire there was absolutely no way out except back down the hallway to the front door had anyone called the fire department smoke must be billowing out of that door by now would anyone be out there waiting to help twice natalies hands slipped and she fell backward gagging and coughing trying to clear her throat and chest each time she regained her composure and her grip and dragged her mother another few feet she was nearing the open front door when ramon santiago the seventyyearold upstairs tenant appeared at her elbow trying to help as much as he was able be carefulramon natalie sputtered knowing that the man had arthritis and some sort of heart problem as well i dontwant yougetting hurt is she alive idont know if anything ramon was slowing down her progress to the door finally he let go i think people have called the fire department go besure it was her cigarettes wasnt it ramon goget thefire department okay okay he turned and ran off just as natalie reached the porch she was coughing nonstop now and gasping for breath the burning in her chest was intense there were several neighbors on the front walk only one of them a fiftyyearold man who she knew wasnt working because of some sort of illness or injury was young enough to be of much assistance help me she cried now wondering what she would do if in fact her mother wasnt breathing trust a neighbor to do effective cpr and go back in after jenny or pray the girl was at school and tend to things with hermina together she and the neighbor rolled her mother to her back and halfdragged halfcarried her down the stairs to the front walk she was covered with soot and grime and her long ravenblack hair was badly singed quickly natalie knelt beside her and checked for a carotid artery pulse at the moment she felt one the woman took a rasping minimally effective breath thank god natalie pinched her mothers nose shut with the thumb and forefinger of one hand slipped her other hand under her neck to tilt her head back and gave her three rapid mouthtomouth breaths after the third hermina inhaled again this time more deeply ma can you hear me is jenny in there herminas head lolled but she made no response natalie scrambled to her feet working for every breath keep an eye on her she yelled to everyone and no one in particular dont go back in there the man cried out as she raced back up the stairs and into the smoke from somewhere behind her she thought she heard a siren but there was no way she was going to turn back and wait unless she absolutely couldnt move ahead her niece had gotten an incredibly raw deal in life as it was she couldnt be left to die this way the smoke heat and noise were magnitudes greater now but close to the floor there was still breathable air with her eyes nearly closed and her nose and mouth covered natalie drove ahead toward the kitchen the small neat living room was ablaze now flames had opened a rent in the wall by the kitchen and embers had set the couch and carpet ablaze holding her breath as much as possible natalie risked standing the kitchen was a conflagration the heat almost unbearable the noise hideous she tried to gauge whether she was in more immediate danger from the ceiling collapsing or the floor giving way halfway across the kitchen her legs buckled and she pitched forward onto the linoleum she could no longer see and couldnt seem to inhale enough of the hyperheated air it was at that instant prone on the floor that she heard jennys voice help me oh please help me grandma aunty nat someone please help me driven by the girls cries natalie pushed to her hands and knees and willed herself forward she was on the last hundred meters of a fifteenhundredmeter race elbow to elbow with another fierce competitor her lung was on fire and her legs were screaming that they could give no more than they were but the finish line was closing and she knew she wasnt going to lose no matter how much the runner beside her had left she was going to have more blinded and smothering she hurled herself through the doorway to jennys room and struck heads with the girl who was lying next to her toppled wheelchair and whose unbridled hysteria kept her from even registering what was happening hi babyits okay nowitsauntynat jennys only response was a whimper of nats name compared to hermina the tenyearold was a feather but she was also virtually deadweight and natalie was spent she pulled jennys tee up to cover her mouth and nose hooked her hands under the girls arms and pushed back just as she had done with her mother six agonizing inches at a time but before she had crossed a third of the kitchen her legs and her lung would respond no more with flaming embers raining down she pulled her sobbing niece close to her and shielded the girl with her body then she closed her eyes tightly and prayed that the inevitable wouldnt be too painful chapter if you could imagine anyone obtaining this power of becoming invisible and never doing any wrong or touching what was anothers he would be thought by the lookerson to be a most wretched idiot plato the republic book ii socrates welcome back to the council thank you laertes my next term actually doesnt begin for another two months but i assure you i am looking forward to it is everyone on they are the four members of the council speaking at the same time from three continents greeted one of the founders of their organization so socrates asked so laertes said we are calling you about h client number fourteen on your list with little warning his health has begun a fairly rapid deterioration he needs his procedure done within ten days his physicians estimate sooner if at all possible as you can no doubt extrapolate from his name there is a great deal at stake politically and financially we know you have been very busy on our behalf but we need to know if you can take this case i will make it my business to be available donor we have three possibles fortyyearold male baker from paris elevenpoint match information on him some hes a pretty typical producer doesnt own the bakery never will two children people in his neighborhood say he makes excellent bread themistocles here it seems to me that to remove even one good baker from the world would be a sin i vote we look elsewhere the next two are from the united states first is an actor from los angeles thirtyseven years old elevenpoint match what has he been in grade b horror films mostly hes already been married at least four times has a gambling problem and is loaded with debt credit rating is poor doesnt seem to have much respect in the industry no matter glaucon said however untalented he is still an actor and that makes him an auxiliary and furthermore hes an eleven i vote last resort only i agree polemarchus chimed in producers before auxiliaries that is our policy besides im sure socrates would be first in line for a twelve if we can get him one that is true socrates said even though our work has shown that the difference in outcome between an eleven and a twelve is minimal still all else being equal i would certainly prefer a perfect match an adult producer negative health history the younger the better i am pleased that we have such a match laertes said thirtysix yearold female lowerlevel producer works waiting tables in

the honor of selection objections none none good choice okay then socrates as of now you are on standby good day gentlemen chapter you remember what people say when they are sick what do they say that after all nothing is pleasanter than health but then they never knew this to be the greatest of pleasures until they were ill plato the republic book ix alright nat its time your blood gasses are back and theyre pretty a good your oxygen saturation is ninetyeight i see no reason we cant pull that tube out you ready natalie nodded vigorously to her doctor rachel french the head of pulmonary medicine at white memorial for many hours she had been on a ventilator in the intensive care unit drifting back and forth across the line separating awareness from the beyond and often when she awoke frenchs kind intelligent face was looking down at her it was probably whatever medication they had her on but the endotracheal breathing tube wasnt nearly as bad as she had often feared it would be she had no memory at all of the one that had kept her alive in santa teresas and doubted she would remember much of this ordeal either god bless the pharmacologists after blacking out on the kitchen floor her first indication that she wasnt dead was the siren of the ambulance that was speeding her up the southeast expressway to white memorial apparently her oxygen levels were bad because according to rachel the tube was immediately inserted by somebody in the emergency ward but of that turmoil she had no recollection whatsoever according to the clock on the wall across from her bed it had been about twelve hours since the sedation and painkillers had been cut back to where she could hold on to a thought for more than a few minutes altogether nearly fortyeight hours had passed since the fire she had to be told several times before she had finally retained the news that both her mother and jenny were alive and doing well in another hospital and that she was being given full credit by the fire department and in the press for having saved their lives word was that only minutes after the firefighters pulled her and jenny from the kitchen the ceiling in jennys room collapsed and the house went up completely a total loss the main unanswered question now in her mind was what if any damage had been done to her it was one of those situations common to medical students and physicians where she simply had too much knowledge of the possibilities french the mother of twins as well as one of the youngest department heads in the hospital was the sort of dedicated widely regarded female physician that natalie herself had hoped one day to become assertive and effective without ever compromising her femininity and compassion during natalies brief hospitalization following her return from brazil french had become her physician and the two of them had spent hours sharing philosophy life stories and thoughts about the future a few crackles at the base french said after a prolonged examination with her stethoscope but thats not a surprise dr hadawi is here from anesthesia just do what he says and that tube should be out in a few seconds you understand that if things arent perfect were not going to wait too long before we put it back yes natalie nodded her deep trachea was suctioned out a totally unpleasant sensation for her then as instructed by the anesthesiologist she coughed and just like that the tube was out for several minutes all she could do was lie still a mask in place taking in humidified oxygen in slow deep grateful gulps a pervasive quiet tension held as she adjusted to the change waiting fearfully for signs that her breathing was deteriorating and a new tube needed to be inserted french examined her several times and then finally thanked the anesthesiologist and sent him away natalie continued almost motionless gauging her degree of discomfort anxiety and air hunger something wasnt right even after two days the odor of smoke was still present probably coming from within her nose and sinuses although her vision was unclouded her eyes still felt gritty and uncomfortable despite an ointment that was being layered under her lower lid every few hours but the real trouble she sensed was in her lung thanks to her intense workouts during therapy her breathing had come to feel essentially normal now de spite being able to inhale deeply it felt as if not quite enough air was getting in with each breath not enough to be called air hunger or even to cause panic but she knew her body as only an athlete could and something wasnt right a look at rachels expression and natalie could tell the pulmonologist knew as well you okay french asked i dont know am i youre doing fine natalie could see the concern shadowing her doctors face youre doing fine isnt that what they told marie antoinetteright before they dropped the blade the midsentence pause she took to breathe wasnt natural believe me your outlook is significantly rosier than hers was french replied smiling at the image but even though i thought you were well enough to have the tube removed your oxygen saturation is still a little low and you still have some edema fluid in parts of your lung i think thats what youre feeling right now you expect that to go away much of it has already but were the alveoli in my lung burnedis that why i have the edema and the low oxygen nat you did inhale a lot of smoke and hyper heated air natalie felt a knot of fear materialize in her chest and french raised the head of the bed past fortyfive degrees then sat on the edge the lining of your trachea bronchial tubes and alveoli were damaged there can be no question of that i see damaged that edema fluid is not just a reaction tomy lung having been irritated by the smoke some im sure but a lot of whats happened is from the heat you know how someone in a fire might have first second and thirddegree burns on his skin well thats what your injuries are first second and thirddegree burns to the tissue in your lung first and second degree tend to heal completely natalie said exactly but thirddegree burns are fullthickness through the epidermis the dermis and the subcutaneous tissue rather than heal as it was tissue burned to the third degree generally heals by scarring scar tissue offers some physical protection but little in the way of natural function in your case gas exchange so the question here is how muchof my lung has thirddegree burn and at the moment we dont know that was an amazingly heroic thing you did nat ive been praying since they brought you in that the damage isnt too extensive but you dont know natalie murmured as much to herself as to french i dont know nat with what happened to you in brazil and now this youve had a real raw deal i dont want it to get any worse but it might french seemed to be searching for an answer that would skirt the statement we dont know how much damage has been done or how much of what may be seconddegree burn turns out functionally to be third jesus is there anything i can do wait a week or so and then well get some pulmonary function studies and also get you back into the therapy room ii dont know if i can the woman who crawled back into that burning house to save a tenyearold girl can do it i dont know natalie said again trying a deep breath that seemed only marginally to fill her lung what if its bad what if theres too much damage for me ever to breathe normally french looked at her evenly nat you mustnt project like this youll end up getting so wrapped up in what might happen that youll paralyze yourself wouldnt you want to knowwouldnt you want to know if you were ever going to be able to run againor even walk without having to gasp for airisnt there anything i can do easy does it nat please there must be something okay there is french said reluctantly ive taken the liberty of having your blood sent off for tissuetyping a transplant im not saying youre going to need one but as you probably know the process can be a complicated and drawnout one get on the list there is a regional list yes but for the past year or so its not like the kidney list which is sort of a firstcome firstserved deal the lung waiting list involves a pretty complicated mathematical evaluation called the lung allocation score but listen this is probably not the time to talk about all this i only started the process because its so timeconsuming you are a long way from needing a transplant if i cant be normal or close to normal natalie said i dont think i want to live french sighed nat i really should have waited to bring all this up im sorry im blood type o you know thats the most difficult blood type to match for a transplant nat please no way im going to take immunosuppressant drugsevery day for the rest of my lifethey cause a list of side effects as long as my arminfection osteoporosis diabetes renal failure honey please take a deep breath and get a hold of yourself youre running way ahead with this thing i dont even know if youre ever even going to im never going to be right am ino matter what im never going to run againand a surgical residency takes stamina so does standing in the or for hours at a timetheres no chance im going to make it as a surgeonwhen i cant even walk to the damn corner grocery without getting winded how much can a person take instead of recoiling from natalies projections and verbal onslaught rachel french did what came naturally to her as a physician moving forward and putting her arms around her patient easy she whispered easy does it nat natalie momentarily felt herself about to break down instead she stiffened and stared stonily at the opposite wall her tears unshed the next twentyfour hours did not pass pleasantly even though natalie sensed some small improvement in her breathing she certainly felt grateful at having been able to save her mother and niece but still the depression that accompanied news of her lung damage continued to deepen her psychotherapist stopped by several times and finally succeeded in getting her to try a mild antidepressant rather than give the medication a chance natalie convinced a friend to bring in her laptop and spent much of her time awake and online reading about lung transplantation tissuetyping histocompatibility and the newly adopted formula for deciding who would receive one of the very limited supply of lungs the lung allocation score heavily weighted in determining the score was the survival probability for the upcoming year very little emphasis in the complex mathematical equations was given to the extent of disability only to the likelihood of death natalies already deflated mood became even more somber as she realized that the rather remote possibility she would die in the near future actually mitigated against her even being considered for a transplant she could drag herself around indefinitely working for every breath but that didnt count quality of life mattered little when measured against quantity but what difference did it make she didnt want a transplant anyway she didnt want the preparation and the waiting and she didnt want the surgery and she didnt want the damn antirejection drugs and their hideous side effects and she didnt want to spend her life under the damocles sword of organ rejection and emergency rehospitalization live with all the energy of a vegetable or live on toxic medications designed to make someone elses lung keep her alive great choice to make matters even worse the vivid recurrent visions of her horrible experience in rio continued without warning seizing her thoughts usually at night but sometimes in the day as well the scenes were not memories they never had been they were powerful and terrifying at the most primal visceral level having them continue with this intensity a month after the actual incident was something that dr fierstein could not explain other than to invoke the old ptsd catchall natalie was hanging from the fence in the squalid alley when movement and shuffling pulled her from the ghastly terrifying situation she opened her eyes slowly half expecting to see another reporter even though she had expressly requested that security and the nurses keep them away what she saw instead was her mother holding open the huge twopage article in the herald about the daring rescue behind her were doug berenger and holding some sort of a small plastic bin terry millwood both of them frequent visitors to her room hey mom youre out natalie said flatly jenny too they discharged us both last night were staying at your place until we figure out what to do my friend suki is with jen until i get back thats fine i think im getting sprung tomorrowtheres room for the three of us at least for a while ive been so worried youre doing good fine mom im doing fine you remember dr berengerand terry of course we were all just talking in the hall natalie tried to keep her anger at hermina in check but the news about her lungs and the possibility of a transplant was just too raw well theyre both chest surgeons mom she said and i hope they read you the riot actthe house is gone everything you owned is up in flamesand you and jenny nearly died for what so you can suck in just one more winstoni know what the courts have determined about the cigarette companies and i know how horrible it was to lose elena the way we did but i also know how little effort you have put into trying to stophere you do everything you can to make jennys life as good as it can be then you nearly kill the poor kid natalie was breathless from the effort of her verbal onslaught hermina recoiled from the force of the attack iim sorry nat really i am natalie refused to let up sorrys not enough mom hermina held her right hand out and rotated it back to front for what its worth she said sheepishly ive been clean for three days now no nicotine stains see berenger and millwood muttered words of approval but natalie was stony no more mom not one more butt she snapped i promise ill try my best no more natalie said again visualizing the damaged alveoli in her one remaining lung finally she sighed and added well you and jen are alive and unharmed and thats what matters doug berenger looking totally professorial in his kneelength clinic coat stepped forward kissed natalie on the forehead and handed her a box of godiva chocolates then he turned to her mother mrs reyes hermina i wonder if terry and i could speak alone with natalie for just a few minutes hermina bewildered and trying not to pout muttered of course and left you are certainly the buzz around this place berenger said i heard the mayor and sam goldenberg have already been talking about some sort of award ceremony do what you can to get me out of that one natalie said i never did get the chance to congratulate you on getting reinstated at school thanks i always celebrate good news by getting myself put on a ventilator its a tradition millwood set the plastic bin down beside her get well cards he said everyone loves a good oldfashioned heroine including us these are from all over not just boston although their eyes met only momentarily natalie had no doubt her friend sensed her deep melancholy just set them in the corner she said ill open them all when i get home natalie berenger said i have an idea id like to discuss with you some friends and i have a small business rehabilitating apartment buildings and turning them into condominiums which we then sell at an obscene profit well it just so happens that at the moment we have a new building in east boston that weve just finished and all the units are sold except for the demo which is a nicely furnished twobedroom id be honored to have your mother and your niece live there until they can settle up with their insurance company and work out something more permanent its on the first floor and totally wheelchair accessible natalie suppressed the kneejerk impulse to say they would be fine in her place thats very kind of you she said instead its a wonderful gesture just one thing if you do it if my mother smokesshes out no second chances she can go and rent a room or an apartment and ill take jenny i should have put my foot down more firmly years ago if she smokes shes out berenger said hopefully this will be the event that does it for her and if you say thats the rule thats the rule but nicotine addiction is a powerful monkey just think about carl culver that patient of mine whose head your pal tonya levitskaya almost bit off getting a new heart put into his chest wasnt enough to keep him from smoking again youd be amazed at how many liver transplant recipients drink alcohol some quite heavily even though its been proven that as little as a couple of ounces causes fatty changes in the liver natalie wouldnt be moved weve got to keep the pressure on she said berenger tented his fingertips and bowed so it is written so it shall be done he said i shall see if your mother wishes to make the deal thats terrific ive always suspected that my mother has mystical powersdont let her persuade you to back down about the cigarettes i will do my best berenger said backing from the room im not kidding doug i love her very much but the highway in her rearview mirror is littered with people who thought they could get the better of her mostly men ill bet millwood said after berenger had left you got it pardon me for saying it but for a heroine you dont seem too bubbly im not rachel french says my lungs been damaged at this point theres no way to tell how badly she said that just in case shes turned my name in and started me on the road to a transplant i know millwood said i just spoke with her nat the transplant thing is just a precaution because the whole evaluation and lung allocation formula is so cumbersome and timeconsuming i cant do it terry i know its hard but youve got to try and stay in the moment no projecting until you know what youre up against easy for you to say youre not the one whose lung is rotting away im just saying dont get down about what you dont know about youve come too far to give in to this ill see what i can do she said acidly millwood stood nat im sorry i really am if you need anything anything at all im your man our friendship means everything to me good enough natalie said with little enthusiasm millwood seemed for a moment as if he were going to say something else then he merely shook his head in frustration and sadness and left once in the hallway he turned to the right away from the elevators and went to the nurses station rachel french working on some notes was waiting for him well she asked millwood sighed shes as close to beaten as ive ever known her to be just a few days ago she was high as a cloud over the news that she had been reinstated at school now this im afraid i havent handled things too well i should have waited until after she was discharged before even bringing up the word transplant the whole business has her believing that her lung is done for even though i keep telling her that we have no way of knowing at this point shes very smart and very intuitive good thing she doesnt have all the facts yet what facts i have some friends in the tissuetyping lab so i decided to call in a favor or two and have them do a rush job on her and shes opositive which as you know already puts her in a reduced recipient pool but theres more i just got the preliminary analysis of her twelve histocompatibility antigens many of them are rare some very rare the odds on finding a donor are long and even if we are willing to cut some pretty big corners in terms of donorrecipient matching she would require a lifetime of fairly high doses of antirejection drugs we havent addressed the fact yet that in her mind shes blown the toxicity of the medications out of proportion but her fears arent groundless either millwood grimaced so where does that leave her it leaves her french said squarely between a rock and an extremely hard place chapter we mean our guardians to be true saviors plato the republic book iv it would do something of a disservice to the jungle surrounding the whitestone center for african health to say that it was ever quiet but over the years joe anson had noticed a strange predictable lull in the white noise between three and three thirty in the morning over that specific span not much more than thirty minutes and not much less the peepers popillia and stag beetles chimpanzees and other monkeys bees and cicadas all seemed to quiet in unison none of the cameroon natives was willing to substantiate his observation but anson knew what he knew on this particular early morning he leaned against the bamboo railing outside his main lab and listened as the cacophony from the blackness all about him began to fade the air was rich with the scents of hundreds of different species of flowering plants as well as curry licorice mint and a myriad of other spices anson inhaled deeply treasuring the act life following his transplant was as elizabeth had optimistically predicted it would be the surgery itself was hell but he was heavily medicated for the two or three days afterward so even those memories were vague the only real problem his doctors encountered occurred in the immediate postoperative period an epidemic of in hospital infection with an often deadly bacterium caused them to transfer him precipitously out of amritsar and in fact out of india altogether he was flown anesthetized and on a respirator to a renowned hospital in his native capetown where the rest of his recovery was uneventful thanks to a virtually perfect tissue match with the donor of his lung the amount of antirejection medication he was given initially and was still taking could be kept to an absolute minimum thus greatly reducing the chance of infection from opportunistic organisms if he knew how effective the procedure was going to be in restoring his breathing to normal anson admitted to anyone who would listen he would have sought the transplant several years ago this is your favorite time here isnt it elizabeth had materialized beside him and now stood with her hands on the railing and her arm just barely touching his following the surgery their relationship had more or less settled back to what it always had been a deep friendship built on mutual respect and constantly on the verge of burgeoning into a romance it was a comfortable secure place to be and with ansons critical research so close to clinical acceptance neither of them seemed anxious to cross the line anson reminded her about his belief surrounding the white noise of the jungle and then pointed to his watch for a time the two of them stood there without speaking listen now he said finally listen to how the sound begins to build there there did you hear that debrazzas monkeys they havent made a peep for half an hour now here they go again its like they are renewed from a brief siesta i believe you joseph you should document your observations and we will submit them to a zoological journal of course there is the small matter of the research you must complete before you can do that he laughed i understand the british and french drug agencies are poised to approve extensive clinical trials of sarahnine yes thats wonderful the fda in america is not far behind you are on the verge of changing the world joseph i dont often allow myself the luxury of thinking of our work that way he said but i am pleased with what is happening here and at the whitestone facility in europe of that you can be certain have you been sleeping at all no need my energy is boundless you and your surgeons and of course my magnificent donor have given me a new life every breath had become such an effort now it is as if i am running without weights on my ankles well please be careful joseph just because you have a new lung doesnt mean you are immune to the illeffects of exhaustion just think of it though we have documented cures from forms of cancer that were thought to be incurable i think of it all the time st pierre said and heart disease his ebullience was childlike as i said my dear friend your work is about to change the world pardon me for asking but how much investigation do you think you have left to do before you turn your notes over to whitestone anson stared off into the darkness a smile in his eyes though not yet on his lips over the last two or three weeks he had been battling his eccentricities possessiveness perfectionism and mistrust it was time he kept thinking time to thank whitestone and elizabeth for setting him up with everything he needed to complete his work time to thank them for the hospital and the many whose lives had been saved there time to sit down with their scientists and turn over all the remaining secrets of sarah time to decide upon a new direction for his life you and your organization have been very patient with me he said somewhat wistfully then we can arrange a meeting with our scientists anson did not answer right away instead he looked up past the panoply at the sky which had in just a few minutes gone from black to a rosy gray dawn was so beautiful in the jungle it was time to cooperate with whitestone he acknowledged to himself but he had another agenda that he wanted attended to first an agenda that had everything to do with his being able to appreciate sunrise in the jungle actually he said there is something i need from you first something we havent already provided for you i know that may be hard to believe but yes there is one thing i want to meet the family of the man who gave me back my life and to help them financially in any way that i can st pierre did not respond right away when she did she spoke firmly joseph i hope you really do know and appreciate how tolerant and patient whitestone has been with you i do we own world rights to sarahnine and anything else that comes out of this laboratory yet we have allowed you to keep to yourself the methods and cell lines that you use we know that most of the vats of yeast in your lab are not used in the production of the drug and i am grateful for th joseph please listen to me the patience of the development people and board of directors at whitestone is running very thin our protocols have been limited by the fact that all of the saralnine we get for our research here and in europe comes from you you can say that you are supplying the drug fast enough but that is simply not so every day of delay in getting this wonderful treatment onto the world market translates into millions of dollars lost i know that you dont care a bit about money but think of the lives that are lost as well we need to complete the circle joseph we need the microbes and the source of the recombitant dna and we need your notes so that we can finish our clinical testing and begin mass production we promise that you will get full credit for having created sarahnine you know that doesnt matter to me joseph i dont really know what matters to you anymore if what matters to you is getting the drug onto the market where it can help the many many people who need it then you need to take some action it boils down to this you want something more from whitestone and we wish something more from you be specific please okay provided the widow of the donor of your lung approves we will arrange for you to fly to amritsar to visit her and possibly her two children as well and me upon our return from india we shall fly a research team down here from england along with the equipment to bring your cell line back to our facility there while they are here you must go through your notebooks with them not the dummy ones i know you have so meticulously created just the real ones we have paid and paid handsomely for this research and it is time that we became the proprietors of it you may disagree elizabeth but i believe strongly that the secrecy i have maintained around my work is both justified and in everyones best interest since i have been solely in charge things have been done my way without the confusion of multiple captains and also without the danger of espionage from the pharmaceutical industry but i agree with you that it is time for the secrecy to end so we have a deal then we have a deal thank you dear joseph on behalf of the world thank you st pierre embraced him then brought his lips to hers and kissed him briefly but tenderly we have been through a lot together he said the end to this phase of our work is near you should be very proud of what you have accomplished i know that i am now its time for me to get a little rest i am on the schedule at the clinic today and so as a matter of fact are you ill be ready anson said taking a deep delicious breath st pierre returned to her quarters a single room and shower down the covered corridor from ansons suite she was tiring of the small space and the mold that continually reappeared on the bathroom tile and she stayed there as little as possible preferring her elegant house high on a verdant hill overlooking yaounde whether she stayed in cameroon or not after the guardiansuse for anson was done was still uncertain either way she was due a bonus that would make her a wealthy woman and stock options in the new whitestone pharmaceutical company that would make her positively rich not bad for a few years work babysitting an eccentric mistrusting genius using a private line she called a number in london the deals been made she told an answering machine we bring him to india to visit the family and he sits down with our people for the final transfer of his notebooks and cell cultures i believe him hes always kept to his word and theres nothing in it for him financially that would cause him to hold back on us not that he cares about money but the stock options hell get in whitestone pharmaceuticals should be enough to keep this place functioning indefinitely it has been a very long haul but it is almost over my biggest error when i started here was that i just never anticipated the depth of the mans paranoia or the extent to which he would go to protect his work from the very people who were funding it it is good that i have found ways to work around his madness and to encourage his genius try to push my darling joseph and he is just as likely as anything to push right back chapter the mind more often faints from the severity of study than from the severity of gymnastics plato the republic book vii natalie wasnt going to make it through the session and she knew it it was stupid to have agreed to get back into physical and pulmonary therapy so soon after the ordeal of the fire she checked the elapsed time on the treadmill clock and then glanced up at the one on the wall just in case the electronics had failed seventeen minutes at zero incline this is bullshit she thought there was no sense in prolonging the charade her lung wasnt working well it was as simple as that rachel french could talk all she wanted to about healing burns and recovery of function but it just wasnt going to happen oh sure lefty youre going to be pitching real good again before you know it just as soon as that ol missing arm of yours regenerates come on nat her therapist urged five more minutes youre doing great im doing sucky and you know it youre wrong the pulmonary people tell me that your function tests have largely stabilized and that there should be steady improvement in them for some time to come nobody in medicine ever predicts improvement natalie snapped pausing to get an extra breath in fact they usually goout of their way to predict no improvement that way theyll either look smart and tuned inor theyll look like heroes when things do get better you know youre not going to help yourself very much thinking negatively all the time correction natalie said flicking off the power im not going to help myself at allthanks for your timeill call when i feel ready to come back she snatched up her warmup towel and stormed from the unit sensing the woman might actually be coming after her she knew she was acting like a jerk but in truth she really didnt care she had accepted the tragic loss of her lung with grace and spirit and a positive philosophy but at the moment even though her mother and niece were alive because of her and cards were continuing to flood in and testimonials were being planned there simply didnt seem to be enough grace or spirit remaining to undo what had been done she sped home half hoping that a cop would have the temerity and bad fortune to try to ticket her perhaps with time her feelings of despair and selfpity would yield to a renewed sense of purpose and perspective meanwhile somewhere some mathematician who probably couldnt get a job teaching in junior high was preparing to pull out his calculator to determine her lung allocation score lets see plus twenty two and she limps along indefinitely stopping every few feet to catch her breath plus twentyeight and she gets to wait on tenterhooks for the privilege of taking poison that will blot out her immune system and make riding in a public elevator a potentially lethal off air hermina with two plastic bags of cleaning supplies at her feet was writing a note to her at the dining table hi baby she said i didnt expect you home so soon jenny here shes in the car i was just getting set to drive her over to the new digs i think we might sleep there tonight thats great mom honey im really sorry for all this i know youre furious with me and you have every right to be things happen im just grateful you and jenny are okay if youre feeling bad about what happened to me you know what to do about it i know and so far im doing it i hope so you want to come over maybe tomorrow the rehab therapy go all right terrific pardon me for saying it but you dont sound so terrific im fine believe me if i could turn back the clock and either stop smoking a year ago or just crawl into a closet during that fire and get burned up i would thats nonsense youve stopped smoking thats what matters and now i want you to stop saying you wish you had burned up that doesnt help anything nat please come help me fix up the new place mom im fine really did they say youre getting better yes they did steady improvement thats what they said clearly sensing the truth hermina put her arms around her daughter and natalie made some pretext of responding baby im sorry i really am i know you are mom you sure theres not anything im positive i need to get some rest thats all welli dont want to leave jenny sitting in the car too long do you think maybe you could come over later for dinner no no i have some studying to catch up on after i nap thanks for the loan you gave us to get set up in the apartment ill pay you back as soon as the insurance comes through thats okay no i really want to okay mom pay me back whenever you want natalie stood for a time in the dining area even after the front door had closed at some point she would surely end up in the shower but she really hadnt even broken a sweat in rehab finally she pulled off her tee threw it onto the floor thought about putting on some music then just sank heavily into the deep recliner in her living room across from her just above the ornate marble mantel of her small gas fireplace was a large framed color photograph remarkable for its composition clarity and detail it had been taken by a professional at the pan am games in mexico city seven years ago just as natalie was breaking the tape at the finish of the finals her arms fists clenched were extended skyward and a true description of the sublime exhilaration on her face would have defied words never again not on the track not in the operating room probably not even in the bedroom for chrissakesnever again she reached across with her left hand and massaged the stillsensitive scar on the side of her chest what did that song from mash say suicide is simple suicide is painless maybe it was suicide is easy simplepainlesseasy hardly words anyone would ever apply to pulmonary rehabilitation after burning up your only lung if she could just get up the nerve how would she do it this wasnt the first time she had actually considered the possibility of ending her own life but it had been many years living as a pulmonary cripple simply would not compute nor would the debility of immunosuppressive therapy following a lung transplant and worst of all would probably be waiting around watching her lung allocation score rise and fall like the dow jones average it was hard to believe that a life with such promise had come to this the walls were closing in on her and there seemed to be no way no way at all to stop them pills probably she decided it had to be pills she remembered hearing someplace that the hemlock society recommended enough sedatives and painkillers to go into a coma in conjunction with a plastic bag over the head just before consciousness vanished altogether that didnt sound all that pleasant or even all that possible perhaps it was worth going online if one could learn to make a thermonuclear device there one could certainly learn the most efficient painfree way to commit suicide staring across at the pan am games photo and almost in spite of herself natalie began mentally ticking through how she would go about obtaining enough oxycontin or valium to induce coma the phone on the end table beside her had rung several times before she became aware of it caller id listed only the words new jersey and a number probably a telemarketer she thought smiling tightly at the notion of something so trivial interrupting something so profound bemused at the irony she answered the call hello this is june harvey of northeast colonial health calling for miss natalie reyes northeast colonial her medical insurance carrier what now this is natalie reyes miss reyes ive been assigned the claim for all charges connected with your recent operation in rio de janeiro brazil and your medevac flight back to the united states yes first of all i hope you are doing well thank you for asking i dont think ive ever had someone from my health insurance company actually inquire about my health the truth is ive had some recent setbacks im sorry to hear that well im calling with the good news that northeast colonial has reviewed your case and has committed itself to reimbursing you in full for your flight back to boston reimbursing until this moment natalie hadnt considered at all how her flight back had been paid for now she realized doug berenger had taken care of it not that he would have gone under financially without being reimbursed but such a flight had to have been a goodsized nut typical of the man he had never mentioned that he had paid for it outofpocket well thank you she said thank you very much theres just one thing yes our records state that you had a lung removal performed at the santa teresa hospital in rio de janeiro thats right well we have received no medical records from the hospital validating that fact and in fact although you are fully covered no claim has been filed for your surgical procedure or hospitalization well i was unconscious for a while but after i woke up i called home and got my insurance number and gave it to the people at the hospital i dont remember a lot of things from that hospitalization but i do remember very clearly doing that well june harvey said perhaps you could write or call santa teresa hospital we need copies of your medical records plus a claim if you wish ill send you the appropriate forms yes yes do that please june harvey wished her well with her setback confirmed her mailing address and then ended the conversation natalie remained in the recliner for a few more minutes aware that for whatever reason the call had defused some of the urgency of her selfdestructive impulses there will still be time she thought now plenty of time she pushed herself up boiled some water and brewed a cup of constant comment tea which she then took into the tiny study off her bedroom instead of doing a google search for the hemlock society she did one for santa teresa hospital there were entries the vast majority of them in portuguese the search engine found them all in seconds who would want to leave a world where this is possible she asked herself a backpacksized mechanical lung might be just around the corner it took half an hour but finally natalie had an address for the hospital in the botafogo section of rio and a phone number after considering then rejecting the notion of enlisting her mothers help in making the calls natalie looked up the country code for brazil and the city code for rio and began dialing initially her conversations were limited by lost connections while being transferred as well as by her awkward cape verdean portuguese little by little though her navigational skills improved she made it to patient information then to billing to records and even to security an hour and fifteen minutes after she set the receiver down from her conversation with june harvey she finished an animated discussion with the director of the santa teresa record room a woman named dasoto who actually spoke english probably about as well as natalie did portuguese i am sorry miss reyes she said but santa teresa is one of the fine hospital in all brazil our electronic record system is be very good you were not admit to our hospital on july eighteenth you never did received an operation on in any of our operating rooms and you were not certainly a patient in here for twelve days or even one day you ask if i am positive of which i say i tell you that i would hang my career on it no i would hang my life thank you senhora dasoto natalie said aware of her heart beginning to beat heavily but still unwilling to fully believe that the woman however certain she was hadnt overlooked something i know it was a hard decision for you to talk with me about this without proof of who i am you are welcome i have one last request yes could you give me the number of the police station that would have been most likely involved with my shooting chapter his life is manifold and motley and an epitome of the hues of many plato the republic book viii big bend diner sandy macfarlane flicked off the redandgreen neon sign even though technically the place was still open for another ten minutes what the heck the corlisses wouldnt mind in six years of working for them she had hardly missed one day she was a pretty woman with orangered hair and a sensual desirable figure that she often boasted about by bemoaning the weight she had to lose closin early sandy kenny hooper asked hooper a widower in his late sixties still held down a regular job working for tennessee stone and gravel there was nothing for him to go home to except his old hound dog so every evening after his shift was over he stopped by the big bend for a late dinner got some errands that need doin kenny sandy said besides there aint no one comin in between now and closin anyhow i got me a sixth sense about such things sandy didnt like lying even about something as insignificant as her plans for the evening but if twin rivers tennessee was the worlds best at anything it was gossiping and kenny hooper was as good at that as anyone if he learned that she was dating one of the customers from the diner the whole town would be talking about it in no time and every jack snap in the valley married or not would be considering making a run at her a single woman with an eightyearold kid and a decent body was fair enough game as it was without people thinking she was desperate but rudy brooks seemed like he was worth the risk any possibility a gittin one last cup a joe before you dump the pot kenny asked sandy was about to say that the coffee had already been emptied and the grounds cleaned out when she saw the man staring right at the pot behind the counter all right all right she said filling a mug and adding two creams and two sugars without having to be asked but make it quick hooper watched her fix her hair and apply a swatch of lipstick at the mirror behind the bar you sure you just got errands he asked with a glint just drink your coffee kenny hooper here heres the last piece of blueberry pie i was gonna throw it out anyway rudy was a texan ruggedlooking and smart with jeans and a sports shirt that didnt come off the racks in any army navy store he was narrow in the waist and real broad across the shoulders just the way she liked her men but what got to her most was his smile it was sexy and sly like that of a gunslinger who knew that no matter how fast you were he was quicker of course in twin rivers when it came to available men there wasnt a heck of a selection certainly few or none that looked like this one sandy finished wiping down and made a last check of the kitchen rudy might be married she acknowledged men were always lying about that but tonight they were just going to meet at the green lantern for a couple of drinks no fancy stuff if as he said his company was going to build the first shopping mall in twin rivers and if as he said he was going to be a regular visitor to the site just west of town he would get his chance to be amorous maybe plenty of them so wheres little teddy tonight sandy nick got im nick has teddy every wednesday i heard your ex put on quite a show at millers tother night took four men to throw him out man has a problem id say and id say keep your notions to yourself unless you have proof and it involves teddy sandy felt her heart tighten at the notion of nick hitting the bottle again although as far as she knew he had never hit their son he had hit her plenty over their five years of marriage always when he was drinking she had told the judge about his temper and his alcohol problem and had even provided witnesses to support her request that there be no overnights at all until nick could document he had been going to aa or therapy or something but the judge had strong ideas about a childs need for two involved parents and turned her down so every wednesday and every other saturday there wasnt a damn thing she could do except to pray that nick could keep it together and that his girlfriend brenda could keep her drinking together too and then the next day ask teddy indirectly if there had been any problems even though there hadnt been any alcoholrelated incidents at least until now the truth was that sandy ached every time the boy was away from her even when it was for an overnight play date with one of his friends he was the sort of kid who made even long hours of waiting tables seem worthwhile people met him and after just a few minutes they loved him he just had that way maybe it was his smile maybe his freckles or maybe just the fact that he had never done or said an unkind thing to anyone in his life whatever the reason sandy knew as did almost everyone in town that teddy macfarlane was going to amount to something special finally after what seemed an eternity kenny hooper pushed himself back from the table left enough money for the tab plus his usual fivedollar tip then shambled out the door anxiously checking the time sandy wiped down hoopers table and shut out the lights then she hurried to her fireengine red mustang convertible decided in the interest of her hair to leave the top up and skidded out of the parking lot onto the brazelton highway brazelton about the size of twin rivers was much more interesting with more bars and clubs it seemed than there were people in the town she was two miles down the highway when she picked up her cell phone and called nick it was not usual for her to interrupt teddys time with his father and nick really didnt like her doing it but even through the anticipation of meeting up with rudy brooks she felt a powerful ache to connect with her son and she admitted to check up on his father lo hi its me yeah i was just calling to see how you guys were doing were doin fine jes fine that was already plenty of words for her to tell that nick had a couple under his belt although he wasnt in the bag his speech was always the first to go asking for confirmation that he was drinking though was the same as asking him to hang up on her think i could just say good night to teddy hes watching cartoons with bern i dont want to bother him unless you have somethin important to say no not really ii just wanted to say good night ill tell him you called do that nick okay see you tomorrow yeahthanks helpless sandy set her cell phone down almost instantly it began ringing sandy hi its rudy damn she thought first nick wont let me talk to my boy and now im about to get blown off well hi yourself she said i just got out of work are we still on been looking forward to seeing you all day at least something was going right thats sweet of you to say well i been lookin forward to seein you too rudy brooks just one little change im still here at the mall site with one of the contractors greg lumpert i think you know him i know who he is but were not really personally acquainted well me an lumpert got some more business we need to finish any chance you could stop by here for a few minutes we could actually use your opinion about some things the sites right on the way to the green lantern and just a couple a hunnert yards off the brazelton highway iguess so sure sandy said deciding that greg lumpert had no reason to start rumors about her and grateful that her date with rudy was still on rudy described the turnoff in some detail although he neednt have bothered sandy knew almost exactly where it was ill be there in less than ten minutes she said terrific see you soon by the light of the moon the turnoff to the mall site was not more than a mile from the brazelton line in a wooded area that was still largely undeveloped but had been the subject of much speculation over the past few years sandy found it exciting even titillating to be in on the ground floor of a project that was going to change the physical and economic landscape of the town she knew so well she turned off the highway onto a stony dirt road and slowed way down to keep from bottoming out or sending a stone up through the muffler her high beams jounced up and down off the forest ahead just as she began to think she was too far off the highway and might have actually taken the wrong turn the woods fell away into a goodsized clearing that looked as if some sand and gravel operation might have done some excavating there parked off to one side was a ford bronco with rudy standing there alone leaning against the hood just beyond the bronco close to the trees stood a massive mobile home lights from inside the rv shone through the huge front windows rudy waved her over he was wearing tightfitting jeans tooled cow boy boots and a colorful longsleeved sport shirt just a fine looking man sandy thought hi she said you look great thanks wheres greg lumpert oh his wife called some sort of problem at home we were just about done anyhow so i told him to go ahead you sure it was his wife i was pretty certain i heard she died a few years ago i thought thats what he said rudy replied but i coulda misheard i had other things on my mind he nudged sandys arm for emphasis and gave her a gunslinger smile from his two visits to the big bend she knew he was well built but tonight he seemed even bigger and stronger than she had pictured so whats with the bus callin that just a bus is a little like callin jessica simpson just a girl sandy decided against mentioning that she couldnt stand jessica simpson does it belong to your company she asked instead its like my home away from home when were doin site work wanna peek inside suddenly inexplicably sandy felt uneasy some other time maybe its like i dont know its like thats your hotel room i dont see it that way rudy said but suit yourself sandy looked around at the absolute blackness of the forest the traffic noises from the highway were barely audible maybe we should get going to the club she said nervously i hear the band they have playing there is great whats the rush rudy asked not moving from his spot by the truck rudy please lets go this is starting to creep me out trust me darlin theres nothing to be creeped out about she stood just a few feet away and watched in confusion and mounting fear as he took a handkerchief from his pocket folded it neatly on the hood of the bronco then doused it thoroughly with something poured from a metal flask sandy gauged the distance to the mustang it wasnt a good bet that she could make it then the sickly sweet odor of chloroform reached her at that exact moment the door to the massive rv opened and a young woman thin shapely and blond stepped out hey sandy she called out cheerily come on over and let us give you a tour of this thing reflexively sandy swung around toward the voice in that single second any chance she had to resist vanished rudy closed the distance between them with two quick steps and clamped the chloroformsoaked rag across her mouth and nose so tightly that she could not even struggle in just moments the scene around her began to swirl then dim terror exploded through her mind but was immediately replaced by a single image a single word teddy the vision of her boy was the last thing sandy saw before darkness engulfed her fifteen minutes later the magnificent winnebago adventurer swung left onto the brazelton highway it was followed not too closely by a bright red mustang convertible eighteen miles down the highway the rv pulled into a rest area while the mustang bounced down a twomilelong dirt road that ended at redstone quarry a small lake that was reputed by the locals to be bottomless the drop from the cliffs edge to the water was fifteen feet the empty mustang had vanished into the blackness before it hit the surface no one except the man who had called himself rudy brooks heard the splash chapter would not he who is fitted to be a guardian besides the spirited nature need to have the qualities of a philosopher plato the republic book ii natalie youre supposed to be starting back on your surgical rotation next week dean goldenberg held up the stack of paperwork that had been generated in order to get her back on track at school i know and you say that physically you think you can handle such a trip from the moment i finished making all those calls to brazil ive been spending three hours a day or more in rehab my pulmonary function studies have improved nearly twentyfive percent since the first time they were measured after the fire im even able to jog but now you want to take more time off i feel that i have to goldenbergs office looked the same as when natalie had been suspended from school except that everything had changed the people there this time in addition to natalie and the dean were doug berenger and terry millwood veronica had offered to come along for moral support but natalie saw no reason for her to take time from her obstetrics rotation after her initial flurry of calls to various departments at santa teresa hospital natalie had spoken to several police stations around the city of rio to the best that she could tell there was a law requiring hospitals to report all gunshot wounds and no such report had been filed on her nor did the police themselves have a record of responding to her being shot first thing the next morning she had brought her mother over for another try the results were all the same with one additional failure the failure to find any dr xavier santoro on the staff of santa teresas or in fact in the entire city within an hour of her mothers last call this one to the rio de janeiro state medical board where there was no record of any dr xavier santoro natalie was at the gym dragging herself through a series of aerobic and anaerobic exercises the next morning she called her pulmonary therapist with an apology and a request for more time much more time terry you have a note from natalies pulmonologist goldenberg asked i do rachel french dropped it off with me because she couldnt make it this morning millwood passed the sheet over and the dean scanned it nodding that the conclusions were clear natalie you are behind on your schedule if you wish to graduate with your class he said and you yourself said that this whole business in brazil is probably a misunderstanding due to language barriers and the difficulty in negotiating through a hospital system that is half a world away if i get there and discover that the hospital and the police do have records of me ill be home on the next available flight i wont even try and find out who and where dr santoro is doug you spoke with this dr santoro once berenger replied according to nat the man said he knew who i was although i had never heard of him mostly i spoke with a surgical nurse whose name i just dont remember goldenberg looked nonplussed natalie he said as you know with your permission i spoke to dr fierstein your therapist she does not think it is in your best interest for you to go apparently you have been having some sort of serious flashbacks surrounding the evening you were shot i started having them when i was still in the hospital in rio dr fierstein is calling them a manifestation of ptsd i know she is worried that your return to the scene of your trauma might have disastrous consequences dr goldenberg natalie said terry knows about what i am going to tell you but aside from him no one else does not even my therapist at the time of the call from my health insurance company i was seriously contemplating killing myself i felt my situation was hopeless and that i would live my life either crippled from my pulmonary condition or debilitated from the antirejection drugs necessary for a transplant im still frightened of both of those possibilities but from the moment i finished with the first round of calls to brazil i have been consumed with the need to find answers to the questions of why there is no record of the crime that changed my life so radically if i have to give up my scholarship and a year of medical school then thats what im going to do the three physicians exchanged looks okay then goldenberg said finally here is the best i can do ill give you two weeks and take it off one of your electives half of the students dont do any work on their electives anyway ob in san francisco dermatology in london you all think we dont know but the truth is that when we were students we all did the same thing the three others smiled so nat millwood asked when are you going as soon as i can get a ticket sam thank you berenger said standing and shaking the deans hand for what its worth i think youre doing the right and fair thing he guided natalie out of the office into the reception area and then waited until millwood had gone before extracting an envelope from his jacket pocket nat the moment you told me what was going on i knew you were headed back to brazil i knew because i know you since i sent you there in the first place i thought that helping you get back to rio to straighten matters out would be the least i can do tickets natalie exclaimed without even opening the envelope firstclass tickets berenger corrected natalie hugged him unabashedly as goldenbergs secretary looked on amused when are they for natalie asked fumbling open the envelope when do you think remember i have no more patience than you do besides as im sure you recall my wife owns a travel agency natalie took a minute to find the departure date on the ticket tomorrow now its your turn berenger said i hope this circle gets closed quickly me too and i hope one other thing as well whats that i hope you take a bus into the city instead of a cab the physician known among the guardians as laertes paced across the study of his seacoast estate overlooking the mouth of the thames he was a professor of surgery at st georges in london and a worldrenowned lecturer on his specialty cardiac transplantation he was also one of the original members of the guardians for the past six months he had been serving his rotation as the pk the philosopher king of the society providing daytoday leadership and in rare instances the final word on any controversial decisions glaucon tell us again he said addressing the speakerphone on his louis quatorze desk the patient is w number eightyone on your list replied glaucon a brilliant young renal transplant urologist from sydney as you can see he is an industrialist and one of the most economically and politically powerful men in australia fiftyeight years old and conservatively worth four billion dollars a significant portion of which he is ready to transfer to us in exchange for our services his cardiac situation has gone from stable to critical and he will die within the next few weeks without a transplant it says here that he is a heavy smoker yes but he has promised he will stop but there is a problem yes his antibody pattern is quite unusual the best our database has been able to do an eight out of twelve which would require him to be treated aggressively with immunosuppressive drugs and would of course greatly increase the possibility of organ rejection however laertes said we have located a perfect twelvepoint match for him in the state of mississippi so whats the problem thermistocles asked the donor is eleven years old i see weight thats the good part hes chunky our man estimates he weighs one hundred and twenty pounds thats fiftyfour kilos and the recipient one hundred seventy pounds seventyseven kilos thats a thirty percent difference is that going to work twenty percent difference or less would be ideal but w has an excellent cardiologist with enforced rest and medication the transplant might serve for a while giving us time to search for something more compatible how long maybe a month maybe less maybe somewhat longer profile of the donor nothing significant one of four children father drinks too much mother works in a clothes cleaners our facility in new guinea is ready and i am willing to make the flight as soon as the donor has been procured and transferred there so i ask you again themistocles said whats the problem chapter the wise man speaks with authority when he approves of his own life plato the republic book ix from benjamin m callahan to congressman martin shapiro re investigation of mrs valerie shapiro enclosed are the discs and still photographs associated with my threeweek investigation of your wife it is my conclusion with a high degree of certainty that mrs shapiro is not involved in any sort of affair in the commonly understood definition of the term during the course of my investigation on four occasions mrs shapiro visited the home see photo of alejandro garcia a mechanic at the goodyear automotive store on veterans parkway in cicero and his wife jessica see photos twice she stayed for over an hour and twice she emerged with a girl about age twelve photos each time they went shopping mostly for clothes their relationship was a warm and loving one and twice i heard the girl refer to her as aunty val enclosed are documents validating that mrs garcias maiden name is in fact nussbaum the same as your wifes they have no other children there is a great deal more investigation that could be done but as of this report i can say that i believe julie garcia is in fact your wifes daughter born when your wife was sixteen and turned over for adoption to her older by thirteen years sister i have been told that attorney clement goring see enclosed detail sheet either brokered this adoption or knows who might have done so clearly there has been deception on the part of your wife but it is not the sort you believed as i told you when i agreed to this investigation i could give you one month but no more at least not until i return from attending to other business best of luck in sorting this situation out i hope you agree with my conclusions and that i have been of service to you ben packaged the summary along with a thick envelope of photos documents dvds and a final bill payment of which would take care of his financial problems for some time to come of all his recent cases this one had the chance to be the most rewarding an upandcoming congressman martin shapiro was married to a woman nearly half his age bright beautiful educated and very much of a political asset provided they could work out their issues one of those issues concerned his wife at age sixteen unwilling to terminate her pregnancy but unable to care for a child both of the shapiros seemed like decent people and ben was pulling for them now it was time to complete his work on lonnie durkin it was surprising to sense such commitment in himself after not really caring about much of anything for so long but since his trip to idaho he had been unable to shuck from his mind the images of the inestimable sadness and sorrow on the faces of karen and ray durkin he was convinced that whitestone laboratory technicians all over the country and in all probability the world were unwitting accomplices in what might prove to be a consummate evil and he both wanted and needed to know what was going on with althea satterfield fluttering about his apartment ben packed some warn weather clothes and set out enough cat supplies for a couple of weeks then after a hug for his elderly neighbor and a final scratch for pincus he hurried down the stairs and into his fiveyearold black range rover the car was battered with half a dozen dents that were too close to his deductible to bother fixing but despite more than a little neglect the engine was still sound in fact just yesterday the mechanic at quickee oil change had pronounced the car good to go for the thousand mile drive to fadiman texas in addition to his suitcase and a pair of twenty fivepound dumbbells ben set his moroccan leather valise in back packed with some new equipment including several listening devices a used but serviceable monocular night scope a hundred feet of clothesline and a new swiss army knife finally he transferred his smith amp wesson special freshly oiled from its velvet pouch to a shoulder holster and set the holster under some papers in the glove compartment initially gustafson who had finally stopped calling him mr calkhan had been as excited and enthusiastic as he was about the findings in cincinnati and at the whitestone lab in soda springs but over the intervening weeks she had become considerably more cautious ben i think we should call in the fbi she had said during their last meeting together and tell them what we have no hard proof of anything chances are these whitestone people could easily parry any thrust as feeble as ours then they just retool or relocate and restart i have some friends researching this company gustafson had said and what theyve found really concerns me whitestone is based out of london and financially spearheaded by their laboratories and a pharmaceutical business they may be one of the fastestgrowing privately held companies in the world pharmaceuticals mostly generics and medications that are legal in europe and africa but not here at least not yet ben i think were in over our heads so so i dont want you to get hurt believe me im no hero but folks are already getting hurt maybe lots of them and therell be more and more until these people are stopped a doctor orders a blood sugar and his patient unknowingly gets tissuetyped its like theyre walking around with time bombs in their pockets how many of those vials of blood those socalled quality control tubes are getting sent off to fadiman texas every day how many profiles do you think are added to the database gustafson shook her head grimly im worried thats all she said all those blooddrawing labs that huge van those weapons that thug who almost killed you these are not petty thieves hey ben replied is this the woman who put on a nurses uniform and marched into the operating room of a hospital in moldavia to document the illicit trade of a kidney in exchange for a job as i recall from the article you wrote it was a lousy menial job at that and i might add a lousy menial job that never even materialized i think you succeeded in getting some arrests in that one one of the first cases where we actually put an organ broker and a surgeon out of business she said somewhat wistfully at least for the moment professor google and yahoo have more than a hundred thousand entries about you running around in disguises making power brokers back down from hundreds of thousands in profits putting yourself in harms way for people that were staring up from the bottom of the barrel it doesnt sound as if youve ever backed down from anyone i think most of the time i was too young to know any better well you are a great power of example and for what im getting paid by organ guard i would brave any danger very funny okay ben do what you have to do but please please be careful i will and speaking of getting paid yes heres my sunoco gas card another night on the road playing detective another budget motel this one the starlight in hollis oklahoma at three thirty ben was still awake staring into the blackness of room by four thirty he had showered packed up grabbed a cup of coffee from the desk clerk and hit the road he had always found the starkness and palette of the desert to be awesome but never more so than this morning with sand and sage washed by the pastels of early dawn stretching out infinitely on either side of the highway he left the cd player off and the windows open and thought of what might be awaiting him in fadiman soon he found himself reflecting on fred and ed a cartoon he had read religiously in his weekly college newspaper in his favorite installment of the strip slow gangly fred with a huge net and length of rope announces to his much smaller sharper friend that he is going alligator hunting if you catch one what are you going to do with it ed asks i hadnt thought that far ahead fred replies totally silly totally profound ben reached fadiman just after noon the sleepy town looked as if it might have been used as the set for bogdanovichs classic the last picture show it was definitely more substantial than curtisville florida home of schyler gainess gas station and minimart but the gestalt of the two places was not dissimilar the wooden sign on the edge of town peeling and punctuated with more than a few bullet holes announced that fadiman was firmly rooted in yesterday with hands reaching out to tomorrow from what ben could discern from the ride into the center of town the main industries bridging yesterday and tomorrow were mobile home and rv sales and selfstorage facilities there were three of each on this side of town alone with a growing need for food and a bathroom but otherwise no more of a plan than the cartoon character hunting for alligators ben rolled slowly down main street four or five traffic lights long and wide in the way only midwestern main streets were wide he counted five taverns all of which served food but none of which looked as if it would be sanctioned by any health authority to do so he wasnt really that picky about ambiance and he certainly was no gourmet but he had only recently gotten off zantac and maalox and was enjoying an uneasy truce with his stomach on another pass up the street he spotted a couple of restaurants he had missed mother mollys and the hungry coyote the choice was easy mollys done in a motif of genuine cowboy and ranch regalia was actually larger and quainter than ben had anticipated booths with red leather and dark wood were arranged around the outside tables with red checked paper place mats in the center about a third of the seats were occupied ben was beginning to feel the fatigue of his early wakeup and the long drive still he debated ordering a coors with his mushroom and cheddar steerburger before opting instead for the caffeine boost of a coke the beer could wait there was work to be done mapquest had taken him to fadiman easily enough but had failed to come up with anything like a john hamman highway in the whitestone lab in soda springs he felt certain he had read the name correctly now he wasnt so confident as he worked on his lunch he imagined himself with a rope and net watching an endless line of alligators marching past what now first things first he decided finally and motioned his waitress over she was a husky grandmotherly woman with closecut silver hair and a calm competent demeanor that suggested things seldom got her down her name tag read cora excuse me cora im looking for john hamman highway can you help me out she looked at him quizzically and then shook her head at that moment the other waitress working the lunch shift passed by hey micki cora said softly enough not to disturb the customers john hamman highway you ever heard of that im looking for the whitestone laboratory ben added never heard of that either cora said isnt john hamman highway the same as lawtonville road micki asked they changed the name a year or so agomember an named it after that lawtonville boy who got that medal for gettin killed in iraq i remember exactly just follow main street west an when it forks take the right one dont know of any whitestone laboratory though well thanks ben said relieved that the road existed at all ill find it in fact you will the affirmation had come from the man seated alone in the next booth he was in his mid to late thirties with a square jaw widely spaced eyes and a dense mat of curly brown hair you know whitestone laboratory ben asked sensing from the lack of interaction between him and the waitresses that he wasnt local im going to work there tomorrow you a chemist of some sort me the man laughed at the notion heck no im a flight attendant friend of mine works with me at southwest makes extra money doing a private gig for whitestone only he cant make it this time and turned it over to me seth stepanski ben shook the mans hand and rated his grip at least a seven out of ten ben he said sensing that unlike his fictional heroes he would fumble if he tried to make up a name on the spot ben callahan without waiting to be asked stepanski put a bill on his table and swung around to take the seat opposite ben you expected at whitestone he asked nope ben said now thinking faster and ready to adlib in any way he could to keep seth stepanski engaged although clearly the man was grateful for company i sell lab equipment and the lab director at whitestone contacted us about an upgrade well im not sure theyre open for business today stepanski said im from corsicana south of dallas the drive here took a lot less than i had planned for and i ended up getting in here last night so i drove out there this morning to see if maybe they needed some help with the plane and i never even made it close to the buildings high fencing all the way around barbed wire on top looks like a maximumsecurity prison without the guard towers its way out there in the middle of the desert nothing and i mean nothing around i could make out a bunch of buildings in the distance but when i rang the bell at the gate and told them who i was this woman told me i wasnt expected until tomorrow afternoon and there was no one around to take care of me today ben was totally intrigued so youre flying out late tomorrow no no thursday morning apparently they have a place for me to stay tomorrow night but not tonight not tonight stepanski echoed sounds like i may end up waiting until tomorrow too its about a tenmile drive each way maybe you should call not doing that was my mistake ill do it if you need a motel the quality inn where im staying is as good as any thanks ben said searching for ways to expand their conversation hey listen why dont i call and see if my contact at whitestone is there if shes not maybe we can go find some cowboy bar have us a couple of beers an maybe play some darts did i just start speaking with a twang ben wondered as he put a twenty on the table and headed out to the rover allegedly to get his cell phone and the whitestone number he reminded himself that while his paperback heroes might know precisely how to handle this situation for him every move was a swim through uncharted waters seth stepanski was anything but interesting his hobby seemed to be watching tv and breasts in clubs and his main goal in life seemed to be finding a replacement for a woman named sherry who had dropped him when he didnt come through with a proposal in a timely fashion they were drinking beer in a booth in a dimly lit bar named simply charlies and were working their way into their second hour and third beer together women like to date flight attendants because they get to fly almost anywhere cheap he said his speech just a bit thickened i can see where that might be a plus ben said having realized that he neednt worry about keeping their conversation going merely directed sadly after the initial spurt of promising information at mother mollys stepanski had dried up he wasnt sure of the destination of his flight and had absolutely no idea who would be aboard he did know that wherever they were headed he would need his passport and that they wouldnt be staying wherever it was for more than two or three days he also added that what he was about to be paid was equivalent to a months salary at southwest given what alice gustafson had learned about whitestone ben wondered if some executives might be flying back to england he was trying to think of anything else he might ask when stepanskis eyes widened and he gestured out the window holy shit look at that rig ben swung around and suspected that his eyes had widened too rolling slowly up the street like a sleek invading spaceship was a metallic gray winnebago adventurer the winnebago adventurer he felt certain as he strained to see if vincent was at the wheel goodness he murmured two hundred thousand ill bet stepanski exclaimed whistling for emphasis maybe more a rolling hotel right idea ben thought wrong h word they watched in awed silence as the impressive rv eased down main street headed west ben knew the alligator had just jumped into his net the next move was up to him it took most of the afternoon and several hours away from seth stepanski for ben to formulate a plan convince himself that it was a good idea and finally put the pieces together he felt focused and keen but also more than a little apprehensive there were a thousand possibilities that could go wrong some of which might merely mess things up some of which might kill him the story he used to get free of stepanski was a stretch even more so when alice gustafson didnt answer her office phone his alternative plan required a call to his cell phone from althea satterfield whatever i say mrs satterfield you just listen he told her slowly having gone to the rover on the pretext of getting a map dont say a word not a word i listen she repeated im a very good listener dear i know you are okay five minutes and you call me on the cell phone number the number i have right here exactly hows pincus oh hes just fine dear why just a few hours ago he okay mrs satterfield call me in exactly five minutes fromnow his performance while althea listened in chicago and stepanski listened across the booth was worthy of an oscar in the end the flight attendant believed that bens boss had contacted their whitestone laboratory client and arranged a business meeting for the two of them at the womans home in pullman hills ten miles to the east of fadiman the trick from then until ben was ready would be to keep from being spotted by stepanski driving around town ill register at the quality inn when i get back ben said as they split up on the street outside of charlies save your appetite and well have dinner together if youd like it was nearly eight when ben stopped by the motel and picked up his new friend everything was in place but bens resolve which seemed to be wavering from minute to minute at a quarter of ten with the town drifting off to sleep they finished their texassized steaks at a place called the rodeo grille and headed back to the rover through a largely empty parking lot before we call it a night ben said having pumped the man for as much personal information as possible i have something i want to show you they drove north for almost twenty minutes there was some evidence along the way that fadiman was expanding in that direction but it would be years maybe decades before civilization filled in the spaces if stepanski was curious about their destination five beers and a huge meal kept him from voicing it finally ben pulled into the driveway of budget selfstorage the first of such businesses he had passed on his way in from oklahoma the neon sign was off the small office dark whats out here stepanski asked clearly unconcerned about the man with whom he had spent much of the day they passed the row of corrugated steel units in the front and went to the far end of the second row that was where ben pulled over so seth he said we need to talk what in the hell is the flight attendant stopped short when he realized that ben was almost casually pointing a pistol at a spot between his eyes chapter but then if lam right certain professors of education must be wrong when they say that they can put knowledge into the soul which was not there before like sight into blind eyes plato the republic book vii despite her seat in first class natalies flight back to rio was not pleasant three times maybe four the powerful images of the cab ride from the airport to the slums favelas her mother said they were called and the assault against her intruded into her thoughts it didnt seem to matter whether she was awake or asleep the reenactment reexperience would be a more appropriate word continued to be jagged totally vivid and absorbing one moment vague and illdefined the next more like a bad trip than a bad memory once she woke up gasping and hyperventilating with a sheen of perspiration across her forehead and lip are you all right the elderly brazilian man next to her asked he was a jovial widower returning home after visiting his children and grandchildren in the states and as a retired teacher spoke english quite well im fine fine she replied just getting over a virus is all here said the man handing her a sheet that was clearly an email printout my son in worcester gave this to me you may know that we who are from rio de janeiro are called cariocas well this humorous piece places to visit in rio was written by a carioca reporter for this wonderful publication a gringos guide to brazil the tongueincheek list though it would have been quite funny if read in the right circumstances was hardly the cure for natalies virus there were fourteen items altogether including downtown the street vendor riots are spectacular comparable perhaps to the salmon runs in the yukon mangueria hill by night is for those brave souls who love fireworks displays not the kind from roman candles but the kind from specials like to watch violent and shocking movies none of them can compare to any police station in rio as the cops like to say this is where a child cries and not even his mother hears sick of your hometown bums and jerks try ours they can be found legislating in the halls of our state assembly the central station rest rooms after pm they are nomansland the worlds biggest bordello just pick a sex natalie smiled palely and passed the sheet back i feel better already she said before leaving her apartment for bostons logan natalie had considered and quickly rejected the notion of taking a cab or a bus from the airport in rio to her hotel instead she went online and reserved a hardtop jeep now as she pulled out of the jobim airport and cruised south on the expressway into the city she tried to keep her breathing even and her pulse in check thanks largely to the unremitting flashbacks to her shooting the two months that had passed since her illfated ride into the city might as easily have been six hours the customers at the house of love will adore you you will be very happy there it was midmorning cloudless and already warm from time to time as she drove natalie glanced off to her right the direction she was fairly certain the cab had taken that night there were shantytowns packed at the bottom of barren hillsides much farther up above them were lawns and palms and with what must have been spectacular views toward the ocean mansions somewhere in one of those squalid overcrowded favelas she had been pulled from her cab and soon after shot the hotel she had chosen the rui mirador was given two stars by one of the online travel services but was presented as quaint clean and safe all words that resonated for her it was in the botafogo section of the city described by the same service as both traditional and exciting what na talkie cared about was that botafogo was also where santa teresa hospital was located traffic on the expressway was heavy and the drivers somewhat less than courteous but it didnt take long for her to appreciate that thanks to years of driving in boston she was well prepared in spite of her persistent edginess natalie felt herself drawn to the steep hills lush vegetation and spectacular architecture of the area botafogo was a fairly narrow corridor between centro the downtown and the beaches of copacabana and ipanema with the help of an excellent map she found her way through the sometimes narrow streets to the pasmado overlook the one tourist attraction she had promised herself in addition possibly to the magnify cent whitesand beaches after the stop at pasmado it would be strictly business she had no desire to linger in rio and planned to fly home as soon as the mystery of exactly who had cared for her and where was settled the rest of the city however spectacular and exciting would forever remain unknown to her suddenly weary from the long flight natalie sank onto a bench at the overlook and gazed out across guanabara bay and up to the statue of christ the redeemer beautiful she thought realizing at the same time that she wasnt experiencing the incredible sight in any emotional part of her being so what do you think of our little statue startled natalie turned to the heavily accented voice a uniformed policeman stood close by right hand resting on his short black rubber nightstick he was swarthy well built and handsome in a matinee idol sort of way with narrow features and a hawks dark eyes the name tag pinned over his breast pocket read vargas its very beautiful very moving she said how did you know i was american you look brazilian but next to you is a dead giveaway that you are a tourist the officer gestured to the map on the bench beside her a guess that any tourist is american would be right more often than wrong natalie managed a smile my family is from cape verde are you local police military actually where did you learn to speak english so well i am flattered that you would even think so i spent a year in missouri when i was in school have you been in rio long natalie shook her head i havent even checked into my hotel yet oh and where is that perhaps it was the nightmare with the cab driver perhaps an eagerness perceived or actual in the mans tone but suddenly natalie found herself wary the last thing she needed at the moment was an amorous advance from a cop the intercontinental she lied standing quickly well id better get there and register have a good day do you know the way perhaps i could no no thank you though this map and i are becoming the best of friends she refused to look the man in the eye for fear of seeing hurt or worse anger very well then he said may i wish that you have a wonderful time in rio the rui mirador a fourstory brownstone was as described on the travel site quaint and clean as for safety the clerk at the small desk by the entrance assured natalie that his post was manned we are each proficient in the use of this he said in portuguese proudly brandishing an ugly longbarreled pistol which he produced from a drawer beneath the counter not as confident in the hotels security system as she might have liked natalie registered nevertheless and toted her bag up three flights to a small room that featured little else save for a pair of twin platform beds two stars is two stars she reminded herself but she also knew sleep was going to be a problem unwilling to be placed at the mercy of the city by staying out late she decided her most prudent move would at some point be the purchase of a bottle of fine brazilian whiskey along with perhaps a visit to the pharmacy it was just after noon by the time she had showered and changed into a beige linen suit and shortsleeved turquoise blouse there was a microsized air conditioner in one of the two windows of her room but at that point neither the heat nor the humidity demanded its use the jeep was parked in a lot a block from the hotel but her targets for this day a police station or two and the hospital could be reached by foot dense traffic pedestrian and cars also mitigated against driving but then there was the matter of negotiating the hills as it had been since the fire her breathing was seldom natural and unintrusive satisfying deep breaths were incredibly welcome when they occurred but they were few and far between she could have used two or three more weeks of pulmonary rehab but her doctor and therapists had made it clear that even then nothing at all would have been guaranteed except perhaps for a drop in her lung allocation score the desk clerk was clearly curious about why she wanted to visit two or three police stations especially since she seemed to have little idea that there were three completely different police forces municipal tourist and military with the help of the phone book he marked one station of each on her map and pointed her in the right direction in fact the mans conclusions were incorrect following her return home natalie had learned as much about the various police forces in brazil as repeated internet searches could teach her what she gleaned did not make her that comfortable in relying on any of them or in believing that her nearkidnapping in one of the favelas north and west of the downtown area would ever be investigated anxious not to run into the officer from the pasmado overlook and reasoning that he might still be out on patrol perhaps searching out other female tourists to welcome she chose to start at the station of the military police it was a modern singlestory brick and glass structure on rua sao clemente about half the size of an average mcdonalds back in boston and just as crowded the officer at the front desk after she asked him to please speak a little slower referred her back to a detective perreira short and at least forty pounds overweight with a pencilthin mustache and a cold smile his english was serviceable though broken and heavily accented but natalie decided against telling him that her portuguese was probably better so i see that was quite a difficult welcoming to our city he said after she had told him her story and presented him with one of the hundred copies of a flyer she had made on her computer the single sheet included a photo of her and a summary in her mothers portuguese of the events of her attack as she remembered them or could piece them together i cant fully describe to you how terrible an experience it was to be attacked in such a way she said the taxi driver said he was going to take me to a place called the house of love perreira reacted not at all but instead began typing on his computer keyboard while natalie waited trying not to stare at the massive pseudochin rolling out from beneath his real one and you say that this crime which occurred on you was reported to the police he asked finally i was in a deep coma when i was found but i was told the police had called the ambulance that brought me to the hospital santa teresa hospital yes but you telephoned to them and they mentioned that they have no record of you as being a patient there i am going to santa teresas when i leave here to see if i can straighten that confusion out and certain you are the dates you have given to me are correct i am perreira sighed audibly and tapped his stubby fingertips together senhorita reyes he said we military police pay very close attention to people who get shot in our cities especially tourists we have to uphold to a reputation in her more cynical days natalie most certainly would have asked for clarification of precisely what reputation he was talking about her re search had revealed much about the role of the military police in the death squads that were believed to be responsible for the murders of hundreds if not thousands of street urchins over the years including the notorious massacre in when fifty street children were shot and eight killed in front of the candelaria church so what have you learned about my shooting she asked motioning toward the computer the databases of the military police i have searched and also the how do you say civil or municipal police and then also the tourist police yes there are in none of them records of anyone of your name to have been shot on the dates you have written here but what about i have checked also for unknown females shot on those dates also none that makes no sense perhaps it does and perhaps it does not senhorita reyes you say you are student a medical student yes in our country students are very often poor do you own much money natalie sensed where the man was headed and began to burn i am older than most students she said coolly i have enough money to take care of myself detective perreira please get to the point the pointlet me seei am sure that being as a medical student you know that in countries such as this third world countries i have heard you americans call us some people in desperate need for money sell on the black market a kidney or part of a liver or even a lung the payments to them i have heard often are quite high so even if i sold my lung on the black market which i most certainly did not why would i be here perreiras mirthless smile was triumphant guilt he replied guilt over what have you done joined with denial that you did actually do it pardon me for saying this fact senhorita but in a lifetime of working on this job i have seen stranger things much stranger natalie had heard enough she knew there was nothing to be gained by losing her temper at the policeman and potentially much to lose the police in brazil were answerable to few besides themselves and the military police were from what she could tell the most dangerously autonomous of all believe me detective perreira she said standing and gathering her things i would look a dozen times for a deficiency in your computer system before looking for one in me if something comes up i am staying at the hotel rui mirador she whirled and marched through the crowd and out of the little station it wasnt until she was on the street that she realized her brief outburst had left her considerably short of breath the next four hours were an exhausting blur on paper specifically her map santa teresas looked to be no more than six or seven blocks from the military police station had the map been topographical natalie might have hailed a cab the hills were steep and unavoidable and the walk across botafogo however picturesque was slow going in the mounting afternoon heat by the time she passed through the main entrance to the hospital she could feel the perspiration beneath her clothes the main structure of the sprawling hospital four monolithic stories of stone a block in every direction looked like it might have been built by brazilian discoverer pedro cabral in the early sixteenth century to that central core now modernized inside wings and towers had been added in a dozen different architectural styles natalie chose to visit the administrative offices first and hit pay dirt immediately at least in a manner of speaking a vice president by the name of gloria duarte seemed quite interested in her as an accomplished intelligent woman and was sincerely sympathetic with her plight they conversed in portuguese although from a glance at the womans extensive library natalie sensed duarte warm urbane quickwitted and insightful could have communicated in any number of languages including english what disturbs me most of your story duarte said is how sure you are backed by your mentor doctor berenger douglas berenger dr berenger that the physician who did the surgery on you was someone named xavier santoro we have no such physician on this staff and i know of none in the city although perhaps you should contact the state medical association i did you are right there is no physician by that name i seewell one step at a time i suppose one step at a time natalie repeated chagrined that duartes enthusiasm might have cooled i would like to say that patients never fall through the cracks of our hospital the woman went on but that is simply not the case we have all together more than two thousand beds and they are full much of the time a simple clerical error and all of your records might exist under a name one letter different from your own so take heart i suspect this part of your mystery will be solved quickly and that the solution will prove to be trivial and mundane with that she sent natalie to the security office for a visitors identification badge that would allow her access to any area of the hospital including the record room and all of the medical and surgical wards she also had copies of natalies flyer made and instructed her secretary to distribute them to all hospital departments with an addendum to notify duarte herself of any information however remote the connection might seem a quick espresso in a courtyard cafe outside the administrative wing and natalie headed for the record room reyes reyez rayes seated at a terminal in a carrel with one of the recordroom clerks she tried every permutation she could think of without success and went through records on unknown females as well next she headed to the medical then the surgical intensive care units she had some recollection of two of her nurses faces and also of santoros and wistfully hoped she might simply run into one of them even in a city like new york or rio an unknown woman found shot and almost naked in an alley and subsequently losing her lung would have been a top cluster on the hospital grapevine sooner rather than later everyone would have heard about it in fact none of the nurses in either of the units had at five bewildered and at an absolute loss for explanations but physically unable to go on this day natalie shuffled from the hospital six weeks ago she had flown to brazil she had been attacked and shot in an alley and she had lost her lung those were the givens somehow someplace there was an explanation that would tie these truths together she checked her map and chose a route back to her hotel that involved the largest and she assumed the flattest streets the lateafternoon sun was somewhat subdued by haze and the temperature was bearable she had flown to brazil she had been attacked she had lost her lung the thought roiling through her brain kept her from appreciating the incredible beauty of the city or any of the burgeoning vibrant rush hour pedestrians most probably making their way home despite all the guide books descriptions of laidback cariocas the street corners were much like new york masses of people shoulder to shoulder often eight or ten deep jockeying for position to cross while cars and taxis tried to wring every single moment out of each green light natalie was at a particularly busy intersection sardined in perhaps the third or fourth row of bodies when she heard a womans voice speaking in portuguese not far from her ear please do not turn around dr reyes please do not look at me just listen dom angelo has the answers that you seek dom angelo at that instant the light changed and the phalanx moved forward across the street sweeping natalie helplessly along she was on the curb at the far side before she turned scanning the faces around her and peering through the crowd toward the corner they had just left no one seemed the least bit interested in her she was about to give up and focus on the strange message when she caught sight of a heavyset woman wearing a brightly flowered housedress walking urgently away from her moving with a fairly pronounced lurch as if one of her hips were bad a mans voice demanding that she move out of the way diverted natalies attention for just a moment when she turned back the woman was gone natalie was stuck again toward the center of the pedestrian centipede and with autos speeding past to clear the intersection there was no way she could head back until the light changed when she finally reached the previous block the woman in the brightly colored dress was nowhere on the street she hurried up to the next intersection and scanned both ways nothing slightly winded by her efforts natalie leaned against the facade of a clothing boutique there was no doubt in her mind that the voice that had spoken to her belonged to the woman with the limp no doubt because she felt certain the two of them had met earlier in the afternoon albeit only in passing in the surgical icu at santa teresa hospital chapter necessityis the mother of invention plato the republic book ii its stepanski seth stepanski the flight attendant welcome to whitestone mr stepanski after the gate opens please drive directly to building six in the oasis and come in to register you have your own uniform yes yes i do excellent well see you here in just a minute the gate tenfoothigh heavy chainlink topped with razor wire glided soundlessly to bens right opening onto a rulerstraight road that looked to be at least a quarter of a mile long driving stepanskis sebring convertible he approached the compound slowly in the wheel well where the spare had been was his detectives valise and tucked beneath that was his the conglomeration of eight or nine pinkwashed adobe structures glowed in the lateafternoon sun two dozen goodsized trees the only significant vegetation and shade for miles greatly reduced the starkness of the place which he assumed was what the intercom voice had referred to as the oasis one of the buildings ben knew probably the largest housed a laboratory the technicians working there were probably unaware of the evil in which they were accomplices as they tissuetyped and electronically catalogued millions of greenstopped vials from unsuspecting clients all over the country probably even the world the notion sickened him beside the engine of the sebring the thrum of massive rooftop air conditioning units was the only sound penetrating the hot still texas air as he approached a pair of trees flanking the roadway like sentinels ben caught sight of the adventurer parked toward the right rear of the oasis he couldnt shake the painful suspicion that some version of lonnie durkin was imprisoned inside frightened beyond imagination as he or she waited to be told why they were there ben had darkened his hair and bought a pair of heavyrimmed glasses but made no other attempt to change his appearance the picture in stepanskis passport was slightly blurred wellworn and seven years old he was five years bens junior but had similar enough coloring and facial shape to make bens passing for him not too much of a stretch best of all the flight attendant now a resident of unit of the budget selfstorage company had made it clear that no one at whitestone knew what he looked like unfortunately ben was unable with any comfort to make the same claim about himself as he approached building he played over and over again his brief violent encounter in the dilapidated garage on laurel way in cincinnati the whole fight with the man named vincent couldnt have lasted much more than half a minute the lighting was minimal and only once a moment before the jet of black spray paint ended the struggle did the killer get a straighton look at his face was the man permanently blinded doubtful was he behind the wheel of the adventurer as it rolled through fadiman if so was he slated to be on board the upcoming flight at that moment the questions far outnumbered their answers building was a fairly small office decorated with framed artfully done posters of monuments from around the world standing behind a counter following him with her eyes from the moment he entered was a slender middleaged brunette with the bearing of a marine her navy suit had the single word whitestone embroidered in script just above the left breast pocket ben was trying to look and act nonchalant but he was on absolute red alert his pulse hammering he wanted desperately to go back outside and try another more composed entrance instead he introduced himself welcome mr stepanski the woman said her eyes unwavering im janet the office manager you have your passport and the letter we sent you ben set both items retrieved from stepanskis motel room on the counter janet gave them each a cursory examination perhaps hesitating for a moment on the passport photo then she slid them both to one side ben pressed his hands against the counter to keep them from shaking do you know janet do you know what goes on here i stopped by yesterday to see if i could help get the flight ready he said for no particular reason other than to loosen up and get a little deeper into character i know she said that was me you spoke to our policy is to make plans and stick closely to them i understand no real explanation no apology for not being able to oblige him janet the office manager was all business for him maintaining eye contact was a must from here on he was in enemy territory if he were caught it seemed doubtful he would be allowed to live okay mr stepanski weather permitting you will be leaving at nine in the morning you should be in uniform at this office at seven with enough clothes for a fourday trip it is possible as we wrote you that several more days will be added you will be tending to the needs of six passengers and a crew of three the flight will be transporting a patient to south america for an operation that cannot be performed in this country the patient will be with her doctors at the rear of the aircraft you are forbidden from going back there unless specifically asked if our passengers wish to engage in conversation with you they will do so otherwise their privacy is to be respected questions none good heres the key to room seven it is in building two just down this road and to your right you are not permitted in any part of the oasis except on the patio by your room and in the canteen located in building three which is right behind building two i understand he took the key and turned to go mr stepanski ben stiffened then turned slowly back to her his pulse in crescendo again yes she handed him his passport its probably time for a new photo ben decided to leave his in the wheel well there was no way he was going to be in any situation he could ever shoot his way out of especially given that he had never fired a gun at anything other than a shooting range target and on those rare occasions with no great skill if he had somehow given himself away to janet he would know soon enough and there probably wouldnt be a damn thing he could do about it room small but neat enough had little on the budget motels in which he usually stayed still he mused as he unpacked his bag and set the alarm for six seth stepanski would have probably given up his prized collection of beer steins to be spending the night in this room rather than where he was ben felt distressed at taking advantage of the man the way he had and even worse at the discomfort he had to inflict on him to keep him immobilized where he was and yet alive whether or not ben would have put stepanskis life in jeopardy he wasnt sure but he did know that the moment he pulled his gun he had stepped off a cliff now whatever he had to do to keep from crashing on the rocks below he would do in the end with inspired imagination a carefully chosen storage locker a dozen padlocks and lengths of chain and enough time he had constructed a setup of which rube goldberg would have been proud the key was the steel supports that ran across the ceiling and around the walls of the locker which was one of budgets jumbo units sixteen by twenty stepanski undressed from the waist down was fixed in the exact center of the room chained to the ceiling and walls in such a way that he had only enough mobility to switch awkwardly from a bridge chair to the commode that ben had purchased in a hospital supply store and attached to it his hands were cuffed behind him and duct tape was wrapped around his head covering his mouth a hole poked in the center of the tape made breathing easier and allowed him to drink by straw from any of a dozen bottles of water juices and protein beverages set up on a bridge table in front of him the heat might be a problem but ben chose unit not only because it was one of the farthest from the budget office but because it was well shaded by eleven that night stepanski was secured and the setup checked and rechecked still ben made two more visits to the locker to look in on his prisoner and to replenish the beverage supply at noon just a few hours before he headed out to whitestone he sat down on the floor and arms wrapped around his knees told the flight attendant in detail exactly what was going on at the lab and what he hoped to do about it stepanski begged to be released and promised to head home and say nothing but ben had gone as far as he dared to go i have sent a box to a friend of mine he said a professor at the university of chicago it contains the keys for these locks and a letter of explanation in three days she will either send the box overnight to the fadiman police or drive down and release you herself hopefully that will be enough time for me to figure out who and what whitestone is and to gather enough evidence to put whoevers running things out of business and into prison im really sorry to put you through this seth but i believe that whats going on with these people is way bigger than either of us he put a pair of earphones around stepanskis neck and set a pocket radio behind him i tried this out myself he said with a little practice you can learn how to adjust the volume and change the station youll get three or four stations in here but i sure hope you like countrywestern finally he set three nips of jack daniels and three of jose cuervo gold tequila on the bridge table with straws in each because youre traveling first class with us he said therell be no charge for these beverages he set the earphones in place then patted the man on the shoulder and left from the moment he opened the door to unit ben was locked in a debate as to whether it was worth the risk to try to make it around the oasis and ultimately to the winnebago if he went it would have to be with his contact microphone his particular model of the spy gear was low end but still serviceable for listening through walls if he was caught carrying it no amount of excuses would bail him out hoping against hope he tried calling alice gustafson on his cell to discuss the situation there was no signal whatsoever for a few hours until darkness had firmly settled in he rested and tried reading one of the magazines on his bedside table a recent people usually for him reading people was like drinking a chocolate frappe absolutely effortless tonight the celebritystudded articles went down like ground glass somewhere out there a plane was being readied for a flight to someplace in south america at the end of that flight ben felt fairly certain someone with money perhaps even one of the people stars would be given life at the expense of someone like lonnie durkin or the chambermaid juanita ramirez wearing dark clothing he stepped outside onto his rooms small patio the air was still quite warm and humid but the vast black sky was starless and a hot wind had picked up from the west unit was at the end of building not fifteen yards from the chainlink fence ben walked to the fence across a small corridor of grass beyond it the blackness of the desert was indistinguishable from the sky but in the distance jagged spears of lightning pierced the night in a threehundredandsixtydegree cyclorama the oasis itself was not well lit and the buildings were close enough together to offer some protection ben scanned the nearest structures for cameras not really expecting to see them even if they were there then he carefully made his way back to the sebring for his contact microphone and he decided his pistol at this hour any trouble he ran into might be with a single security guard if the gun could help him make it to the car there was a chance he could ram through the massive gate at the end of the drive just the idea of having his life depend on surviving that collision sent a jet of acid percolating into his throat his fictional heroes never had trouble crashing through such gates unscathed but he suspected that this particular gate might be more unyielding continuing his scan for security cameras he crossed to the canteen in building and got a diet coke then trying to stay under cover he moved into the shadows of first one building then another the lightning spears appeared much closer now and he swore he could hear thunder the largest building had some pale light inside through the windows he could just make out rows and rows of sophisticated laboratory equipment it was neither difficult nor pleasant to imagine a tube of blood with his name on it being opened and processed by a tech working at one of those stations the streets of the oasis seemed deserted although in spots the light from scattered windows washed into the night keenly on edge clutching the case containing the contact microphone and listening between every step for the sound of someone else ben maneuvered toward the winnebago beneath his black longsleeved tee he was unpleasantly damp the five minutes it took to reach the rv seemed like an hour there was a faint glow from around the diningarea shade on the left side and the curtain pulled across inside the front windshield breathing heavily from tension more than exertion ben knelt just forward of the left rear tire and soundlessly unzipped the microphone case which contained small earphones an amplifier and a thick cylindrical receiver about the size of half a roll of quarters he worked the earphones into place and pressed the receiver against the side of the winnebago the quality of the reception wasnt great but he could hear voices and make out most of what they were saying please please let me go i never did anything to you the womans voice probably coming from the rear of the van was quite clear hes shooting the moon for chrissakes connie do you know how to play this game or not vincent ben was almost certain of it listen rudy i have a kid a son named teddy i told you all about him please he needs me please let me go find someone else someone without a little boy who needs her jesus connie you dumb shit you had to take a couple of hearts when you had the chance now hes going to get them all couldnt you tell that all he had was spades listen sandy either you stop whining or im coming back there to put a sock in your mouth and stop calling me rudy i hate the fucking name im sorry i ever made it up the left earpiece was painfully tight ben pulled it out and was adjusting it when he heard the soft crunch of footsteps from his right pulling the from his waistband he flattened out on the ground and quickly worked his way under the van seconds later a pair of cowboy boots appeared no more than two feet from his face and only an inch he realized from where he had dropped the contact microphone for an interminable ten seconds nothing moved except bens thumb silently releasing the safety on his gun then the boots turned passing so close to the microphone that one seemed to have brushed it and headed toward the front of the van still frozen ben watched as the boots passed beneath the windshield and moved to the door on the far side a moment later two sharp knocks cut through the heavy quiet vincent connie its just me billy a youthful voice said the door to the adventurer swung open bathing the ground with light instantly from within sandy began screaming help please help me for gods sake theyre going to kill me im in a cage my names sandy please please help me im a mother i have a little boy hes only eight oh i have had enough of this shit there was a brief scuffling of feet from directly above where ben was lying and instantly the screaming stopped ben felt ill he had to do something should he simply charge into the van shooting he would have to kill the guard named billy vincent connie and someone else as well kill four people was there any chance he could do it would it be better to wait clutching the pistol feeling detached almost dreamlike he inched out from under the van he wondered what john hamman had been thinking and feeling just before he charged the machinegun nest or whatever he did to earn a posthumous medal and a godforsaken road named after him ben pushed himself upright if he was going to move it had to be now while the door to the van was open was there any way to stop any way he could just slip back to his room and let them proceed at least for the time being with whatever was planned for the terrified woman named sandy in exchange for leaving them all he would be keeping alive his hope of exposing the horror of whitestone he hefted the in his hand and moved to the rear of the van hey billy what gives another voice from within the van asked as if the womans outburst had never happened paulie hey whassapnin nothin much billy jes playin a little hearts with vincent an connie tpass the time ben moved silently to the corner of the van he had never fired a gun at anything but a range target and once a couple of bottles now he would have to take out the guard at the doorway and then climb over his body to shoot three killers before they could reach their weapons did he have any chance at some level he knew the answer was no but he felt unable to stop you ridin shotgun on the flight tomorrow the guard asked all four of us oh hey smitty i didnt even see you there hi billy quiet out there five ben lowered his gun as sanity took over must be big stuff billy was saying put in a word for me vincent will ya doin security here gets a little wearin in case you hadnt noticed nothing much ever happens i gotcha well do what we can well back to the cards you guys take care see ya billy the door closed and was bolted from the inside ten minutes later still badly shaken by how close he had come both to killing and dying ben was safely back in his room at midnight a violent thunderstorm swept through the oasis and then vanished as quickly as it had arrived at three still far too wired to sleep he was standing by the window when suddenly out in the desert well beyond the fence the blue lights of a runway lit up the vastness stretching as far as he could see a few minutes later accompanied by a roar that shook building a huge jet possibly a landed smoothly taxied to the far end of the runway and stopped stepanskis uniform had been taken in by a greedy tailor in fadiman now ben removed it from the closet and brushed some lint from the lapel the alligator was in his net chapter women must be taughtthe art of war which they must practice like the men plato the republic book v dom angelo with only those two words to go by natalie commenced a desperate search through every phone book she could find nothing she spoke with the desk clerk at her hotel who questioned whether or not she might have misheard and the woman actually said don angelo would that make any difference she asked instantly buying into the possibility no said the man his portugueseenglish dictionary said that dom meant gift or gifted one and was also a title specifically lord now uncertain over what the anxious nurse in the floral print dress might actually have said natalie trudged up to her room totally spent from the long day the hills of rio the heat and probably some lingering jet lag she felt as isolated and alone as she could ever remember she was an athlete with a single damaged lung that there was little chance of ever getting replaced don or dom angelo even if she ever did find him wasnt going to change that reality there was no need for brazilian whiskey to help her sleep this night or in fact for anything other than the white noise of the air conditioner tomorrow she would make two stops at santa teresas the first to vice president gloria duartes office and the second to the surgical icu if she was unsuccessful it would be back to the police don angelodom angelo as she drifted off the names generated an unending mobius loop of questions was one of them a title of some sort a first name why had the woman not even tried to explain did it seem that obvious to her that natalie would understand one thing that their brief encounter had made clear to her there was more to the assault in the alley and the subsequent loss of her lung than she had believed with time the drone of the air conditioner rocked her into an uneasy sleep but twice during the night her exhaustion lost out to the familiar vivid reenactment of her attack as was the case so many times before the horror was more intense than mere memory and in many ways more real and detailed than any nightmare after the second episode she was too shaken to fall back to sleep she was deceived by the cabbie at the airport she was shot she was operated on her lung was removed she was well cared for and she was flown home as soon as her identity was established all of that was completely and absolutely trueand yet it wasnt at some point natalie reconnected with sleep it was nearly eleven when she awoke by the time she had showered dressed and made it back to the hospital it was just past noon duarte was at a meeting she was told and would not be back in the hospital until the following morning on a lark she asked the womans secretary if either don or dom angelo meant anything to her the woman smiled politely and suggested that her boss who knew almost everything would be the one to ask certain that the way things were going the nurse she sought would be out of the hospital too natalie made her way up to the secondfloor surgical intensive care unit the sicu it would have been called in most hospitals in the states following the removal of her lung in one of santa teresas twentyone operating rooms she would have been taken there please be here natalie begged as she stepped through the automatic glass doors please be here she scanned what she could see of the busy unit and felt her spirit begin to sink the siou was stateoftheart ten hightech glassyenclosed cubicles arranged around a central core nursingmonitoring station slowly nonchalantly nodding and smiling at anyone who made eye contact natalie strolled around the circle she shouldnt have come during lunchtime she was thinking she shouldnt have wearing blue scrubs writing in a red looseleaf notebook the woman she was seeking emerged from the last cubicle and headed away from her her bulk and her pronounced limp left no doubt that she was the one from the street her pulse racing natalie caught up with the woman at the nursing station her face was cherubic and quite pretty she wore a thin gold necklace but no other jewelry and no wedding ring her id read dora cabral excuse me senhorita cabral natalie said softly in portuguese the woman smiling looked up at her instantly her expression tightened her gaze darted nervously about for natalie her reaction eliminated what little doubt remained yes dora asked i am sorry to come here like this senhorita but i am desperate natalie said worried that her portuguese might not be up to the task i believe that you are the person who spoke to me on the street yesterday afternoon if you are please help me know who dom angelo is i have tried to learn who he is but i have failed not who dora said in a harsh whisper where it is a village it is the nurse stopped abruptly scribbled something on the margin of a sheet of paper pushed it an inch or so toward natalie rose clumsily and lurched into the corridor toward the cubicle where she had been working totally flustered natalie was about to reach for the paper when something made her turn toward the entrance a policeman wearing the uniform of the military police had stepped into the unit and was just turning toward where she was standing his arrival was clearly what had driven dora away natalie didnt dare reach for the paper but did risk a glance at it pm rd felix by the time she turned back the police officer was coming toward her grinning with a dense sickening sensation she immediately recognized him it was vargas the oneman welcoming committee who had approached her at the pasmado overlook even though they had met in botafogo the same section of the city as the hospital and likely where vargas was stationed natalie felt virtually certain this second meeting was no coincidence she also felt frantic to get the policeman away from the desk in the nurses station where dora had written her address why youre officer vargas arent you she gushed hurrying over to him the policeman with the wonderful english i recognized you immediately from the park at pasmado yes exactly thank you for remembering he asked her name and she told him although she had little doubt he already knew had he seen dora writing the desk was five feet behind where they were standing she somehow had to move him in the other direction senhorita natalie he said charmingly pardon me for saying so but santa teresa hospital isnt on the usual tourist itinerary natalies mind was swirling what was he doing here if he had been following her since pasmado he knew that she had lied about staying at the intercontinental if he had been following her since her landing at the jobim airport something very terrible was going on natalie had never had much patience for flirts men or women and had proudly never considered herself very proficient at it but now seemed like a good time to try the last time i was here in your city she said i had the misfortune to run into an unscrupulous cab driver unfortunately we still have a number of those vargas replied although we at the military police are trying to stamp them out well this man took me to this alley andii just cant talk about it very easily i came here to the hospital to straighten out some insurance matters and to thank the staff for taking such good care of me when i was a patient here i see natalie took a small step forward and looked up at him trying for an expression that was soft and vulnerable officer vargas if i was away from here i think i could talk to you about what happened oh do you have a few minutes perhaps for a cup of coffee for you i would gladly make time thank you she touched his arm and sighed something horrible has happened to me and i would do anything to get to the bottom of it anything perhaps it is a blessing that you have dropped into my life not once but twice perhaps the policeman said as she led him out the doors and toward the cafe or perhaps i am the one who is blessed dom angelo state of rio de janeiro population the botafogo branch library had that much information on the village but little more on some maps it was located seventyfive miles north and west of the city in what the reference librarian told her was the eastern part of the rio de janeiro rain forest on other maps it wasnt listed at all after an hour and a half of searching natalie had drawn a map that it seemed would guide her there or at least close to there hopefully at eight this evening dora cabral would have more information on the place and what sort of answers natalie could hope to find there it took most of an hour for her to disconnect from rodrigo vargas a decorated veteran he said of fifteen years in the military police long separated from his wife but active in the lives of his two children he knew detective perreira well and described him as a man who spent far too much time sitting down throughout their conversation during which natalie said nothing of dora cabral or dom angelo the policeman gave no indication that his appearance in the siou while she just happened to be there was anything other than coincidence in the end he said that given her unpleasant experience in rio he understood why she might have been reluctant to give the name of her hotel out just because a man was wearing a uniform and claimed to be a policeman he then promised to go over some of the ground covered by perreira and gave her the name of a bistro where the two of them could meet tomorrow for lunch to update each other i hope this is the beginning of a special friendship senhorita natalie he said earnestly as they stood to go so do i rodrigo she said trying for a comehither smile and holding on for an extra beat when they shook hands so do i they parted inside the hospital and natalie got directions to the library from the information desk she left praying that dora had taken advantage of the chance to destroy what she had written once on the street she began moving through the city with absolute attention to whether she was being followed employing every maneuver she had ever seen on tv or in the movies plus a few she made up on the spot she had four hours before she was expected at doras four hours and a lengthy list of things she needed to get if she was going to drive into the rain forest by six thirty she had been to the library hardware and outdoor gear stores and several clothing outlets taking some purchases with her and promising to return for the rest once she had her car if there was someone watching the jeep there would be no way she could retrieve it without being seen and probably followed but she had no choice a bigger fear was that the car would be gone or in some way disabled but it was right where she had left it in a small garage two blocks from her hotel rd felix with help from the reference librarian she located rua de felix in the gavea section of the city three miles west of botafogo she loaded up the jeep covering everything with a canvas then wishing it were darker she began a serpentine drive from the shore to the hills and back again racing through red lights driving up alleys and through parking lots and making any number of upturns always with an eye on the rearview mirror when she was reasonably certain she wasnt being followed she locked up the jeep in a welllit spot and with an unpleasant tension in her chest flagged down a yellow cab gratefully the driver was a weathered gumchewing woman who reminded her not at all of the cabbie from the airport using a map and adlibbing when it seemed right to do so she directed the woman up streets and back down around blocks and through alleys finally she asked to be dropped off a block from rua de felix it was an indescribable relief when the driver simply complied the neighborhood was more rundown than natalie had expected given dora cabrals occupation tenements most three stories high and few of them well maintained were packed along dimly lit narrow hillside streets along with scattered larger apartment buildings dusk was giving way rapidly to night but there were a fair number of people on the streets so natalie did not feel particularly anxious about being alone it was exactly eight when she arrived at a featureless fourstory apartment building flanked by two alleyways each about ten feet wide and modestly littered with newspapers cardboard and cans the number was painted in white on the redbrick facing there were two panels of fairly new mailboxes in the enclosed foyer and a vertical row of doorbells d cabral was near the top natalie pushed the button once then again she peered through the glass of the inside door there was a short staircase going up to the first floor she rang the bell a third time then sensing the first nugget of apprehension she tried the door which swung open without resistance so much for security number identified by gold numerals nailed to the center of the dark wood door was on the right at the far end of the hall natalie listened intently then knocked at first softly then sharply silence pm rd felix there was no doubt in her mind that she had interpreted the written message correctly it was now ten after the nugget was growing with each second doras plea on the street that natalie not look back and her reaction in the sicu to the arrival of the military police officer underscored the womans fear but sharing the name dom angelo and the scribbled note suggested that she wanted to help come oncome on natalie knocked again then returned to the front hallway and tried the bell one last time her mind was racing through possible responses to this latest turn one thing was certain she wasnt leaving until she had done everything possible to ensure that dora cabral was all right eight fifteen natalie debated knocking on a neighbors door to see if any of them might have a key to apartment instead she went outside and suddenly wary walked to the end of the block and turned the corner before swinging around abruptly and heading back nothing looked suspicious so she went to the edge of the alley and ducked in assuming the apartments were approximately the same size the fifth and sixth windows on her left would be doras but because the first floor was up four stairs they were two feet or so above natalies head there was dim light behind each of them eight twenty the lights were not what natalie wanted to see a dark apartment could have meant that dora had been delayed somewhere lights made the possibility less likely grimly natalie raced as best she could down the alley to a single halffilled galvanized metal trash can she carried it back turned it over and clambered up so that the lower sill was now at the level of her chest she was looking into a neatly kept bedroom with two twin beds the light was coming from beyond from the kitchen it seemed she blinked twice to assist her eyes in adjusting to the gloom now she could make out the sink in the kitchen and the back of a chair and part of the kitchen table it took several seconds for her to realize that hanging off the side of the table was an arm oh god no she cried out softly without hesitation she slammed her elbow viciously into the pane exploding nearly all the glass into the bedroom there were several large shards still protruding from the frame rather than try to remove them she reached up and unlatched the window pushed it up and found the strength to hoist herself up and inside mindless of the blood flowing from a gash just below her elbow she raced to the kitchen dora cabral was slumped on the table dead her head rested peacefully on one cheek her mouth was agape her lips pulled back in a disturbing rictus exposing her teeth natalie checked the carotid pulse in her neck and the radial pulse at her wrist but knew there would be none then she noticed the syringe on the table next to an empty multidose vial of what she felt certain was a powerful injectable narcotic nothing she sensed about the woman encouraged the belief that she was a narcotics addict but if she knew nothing else she knew that was always a hard call to make in her heart she felt that doras death was murder and worse that it had something to do with the two connections between them the rain forest village of dom angelo and the military police officer rodrigo vargas still numb and not thinking with much clarity natalie glanced down and noticed the blood dripping off her hand and forming a small pool on the linoleum floor the gash by her elbow was two inches long and fairly deep but she knew pressure would take care of the bleeding and in time provided there was no major infection all she would be left with was another rio scar she took a dishcloth from the sink and managed to tie it tightly around the wound at that moment she heard sirens approaching was this a setup fueled by a massive adrenaline rush she was thinking quite clearly again she had to get away using her shirt to turn the knob she hurried to the hallway and immediately opted against the front stairs instead she took a narrow flight down to a pitchblack basement virtually blind she felt along the wall for a light switch at the moment she was about to give up and head back upstairs she found one and flicked it on just ten feet away was a small set of concrete stairs leading up to a door opening it cautiously natalie stepped out into an alleyway between the backs of buildings scarcely six feet wide and permeated by the pungent odor of urine the sirens were close now and she felt certain she heard heavy running footsteps from someplace to her right she had been set up there was no doubt about it it had to be vargas sometime soon very soon she would be killed trying to escape arrest and the loose ends surrounding dom angelo would be tied up mindless of her breathing she dashed to the end of the alley farthest from the footsteps and then flattened against a wall as a uniformed policeman raced by finally she slipped across the street and cut through another alley several more blocks and she could go no farther she was in an uppermiddleclass neighborhood now with singlefamily homes and lush gardens breathing heavily and not all that successfully she sank onto the ground behind a dense grove of palms ferns and huge yuccas and allowed herself to cry not so much out of fear for herself or even horror over the death of dora cabral but rather out of sheer bewilderment somehow she was either going to find some answers or die trying her search had to begin and would hopefully end in dom angelo chapter have you never observed how invincible and unconquerable is spirit and how the presence of it makes the soul of any creature to be absolutely fearless and indomitable plato the republic book ii natalie spent the night in the back of the jeep parked in a public garage north of the city using a duffel bag for a pillow and a tarp for a blanket for six hours her tension and confusion battled with her physical and emotional exhaustion for possession of her ability to sleep in the end the struggle was more or less of a draw and she estimated two hours of decent rest maybe even three at five thirty stiff and bleary she climbed out of the jeep and paced around level two of the garage as far as she could tell she was fifteen or twenty miles north of rio just a dozen or so miles from route a cutoff that would continue leading north and west away from the coast that twolane would eventually become a winding probably unpaved secondary road that snaked into the rain forest mountains for at least twenty miles before connecting in some way with a road to the village of dom angelo it was going to be a hell of a trip but that might be said for every inch her life had traveled since she stepped on board her initial flight to rio she had a dreadful ache in her soul for dora cabral and what the woman might have gone through before her death there didnt seem to be any signs of torture on her body but natalie had little doubt that rodrigo vargas was skilled at the art of getting answers without leaving marks natalie felt totally alone more so perhaps than at any time in her life she thought fleetingly about calling terry or even veronica to ask if they might fly down and join her in the search for answers but one person who had reached out to help her had already died no this was going to be her game to win or lose actually she acknowledged bitterly no matter what she had already lost the scimitar scar on her right side attested to that so now the rules had changed the game was no longer about winning or losing rather it was all about answers and if possible vengeance answers and vengeance the second level of the garage was still largely empty and the area true to form was awakening slowly natalie did some deep breathing and stretching her operation and the fire had taken their toll on her stamina but she was still limber wiry and as always deceptively strong calisthenics in a grimy parking garage it was pathetic that a life with so much promise had come down to this but that was the way it was most of her plans and dreams to become a great physician and a champion of the downandouters of the world had been sliced from her chest or seared by fire now all that remained for her was the powerful need to know what in the hell had happened and why and the even more overwhelming passion to find and punish whoever was responsible answers and vengeance a small coffee shop across the street provided her with breakfast and a washroom as well as a copy of the rio edition of o globo from what she could tell the newspaper had nothing on dora cabral soon though she suspected there would be a carefully crafted report complete with the name of a chief suspect the wizened woman behind the counter looked as if she might not have taken a day off from working for decades natalie left an enormous tip under her empty cup and headed back to the garage at least if she didnt ever return from this trip into the rain forest someone would have benefited she straightened up her gear and gave passing thought to calling her mother or doug berenger regardless of the story she concocted either of them was intuitive enough to sense there was trouble they had already once been through the nightmare of believing she had vanished only to have her resurface what would calling them now accomplish except to make them worry besides it was not yet seven and rio was two hours ahead of boston instead she wrote a long letter to hermina with instructions to share it with doug in it she summarized the events since her return to brazil including every name she could remember the waitress at the coffee shop first tried to return some of the tip natalie had left thinking it was a mistake then finally convinced that her windfall was no accident she provided an envelope for the letter and most gladly agreed to get postage and mail it it was time the jeeps fuel gauge was between threequarters and full and under the tarp in back were fivegallon stores of gasoline and purified water throughout her career as an international track star she had always traveled well and she could probably count the nights she had spent in a tent on the fingers of one hand now she had survived her first night sleeping in the back of a car in many years whatever lay ahead for her she knew was almost certain to include many more firsts the morning was clear and pleasantly warm promising yet another flawless day natalie swung onto the expressway north trying to get into the rhythm of carioca driving which did not often involve the use of directional signals or mirrors when changing lanes nor the use of brakes at almost any time on the seat beside her was the rather crude map she had drawn to dom angelo questions about the place continued racing through her brain with the speed of the cars whizzing past her on both sides most vexing of those questions involved the possibility that dora cabral was simply mistaken in believing that the village had anything to do with natalies illfated cab ride and the loss of her lung it was too cruel even to consider that the poor woman had been killed in error but if she really did know something what could possibly be the connections between a med student from boston a nurse in rio and a tiny hamlet in the brazilian rain forest highway west located essentially where she had expected it to be was a pleasant surprise a recently paved twolane road with painted center lines soft shoulders and not much traffic if her estimates were right there would be a cutoff fifteen miles up on her left probably unpaved that snaked through the mountains in the general direction of belo horizonte the large capital of the state of minas gerais a hundred miles this side of belo horizonte what looked on the maps like a onelane road would dive off to the left and somewhere on that road was dom angelo it was a long shot that she would make it without difficulty but if determination mattered she was going to find the place five miles from where she suspected the road toward dom angelo might be she slowed and began carefully inspecting and analyzing each turnoff she was in the steep foothills of the easternmost rain forest the twolane road no longer newly paved and now pocked with potholes rose almost continuously and turned sharply with little notice traffic was light and it was often a minute or two before a car passed her in either direction natalie slowed even further and rolled down the windows she might have been imagining things but the oxygenrich air felt different in her lung deep fulfilling breaths came easier and more frequently her pulse actually seemed slower the forest came close to the road on both sides shielding her from the latemorning sun at various points a broad rushing stream appeared and ran parallel to the pavement for some distance before darting off into the dense underbrush and trees the paved road had leveled when natalie saw the cutoff it was a wellworn dirt and gravel road more than one lane wide but probably less than two a crudely painted sign that read campo belo had been nailed to a tree with an arrow painted beneath the words by her estimate campo belo was the nearest town of any size to dom angelo but it was impossible to gauge the distance between them although she was almost certain she had found the road natalie checked the mileage and rechecked her map at last convinced she turned left and began a slow rollercoaster climb through increasingly dense forest excitedly she began to allow herself to believe that she was going to make it to dom angelo without a major hitch the going was slow and six cylinders rather than the four the jeep had would probably have made a big difference but she was going to make it the first time she sensed trouble was when she pulled off to the side to stretch and have a brief meal of sliced meat cold juice and half a chocolate bar she had been on this road for twenty or twentyfive minutes and had passed only one car coming in the other direction but as she cut the ignition just before the heavy silence of the forest enfolded her she heard something it seemed like the skidding of a car on gravel along with the briefest noise of an engine then in moments there was nothing could it have been just an echo from her own car probably she decided probably that was it she ate quickly listening with a constant ear for any sound beyond the birds and insects of the midday rain forest then she pocketed her swiss army knife and shifted her hunting knife from her duffel bag to the front seat just an echo that was all for the next mile or so the road seemed to narrow as it went steeply uphill to the left rising from the edge of the road was a nearly sheer heavily forested hillside to the right an increasingly steep dropoff if a car approached now it would be impossible for them to pass and someone would have to back up natalie drove with her attention equally divided between the challenging road ahead and the dusty emptiness behind her jaw was clenched and her hands were white on the wheel in part from the tension of negotiating the road but also from the sound she had heard it was then that she was hit from behind she must have momentarily taken her gaze off the rearview mirror because the jolt a substantial one was a total surprise reflexively she jammed on the brakes causing the jeep to be pushed toward the dropoff at a fortyfivedegree angle she would have gone over right there had she not switched to the accelerator and floored it while at the same time spinning the wheel back to her left the side of the jeep tore against the hillside uprooting bushes and gouging the trunk of a tree natalie knew even before getting a fix over her shoulder on the driver that it was rodrigo vargas in the moment their eyes met he grinned and waved then his car a large black mercedes dropped back a few feet and charged again this time there was absolutely no escape the jeep was airborne before natalie could even react careening through the trees and dense brush for what seemed like an eternity it hit the ground still upright with jawsnapping force the windshield shattered the doors flew open and the one on her side was immediately torn away the jeep bounced high enough to clear some underbrush turning partway over it just missed a tree belted in and holding the wheel with all her strength there was little else natalie could do finally the car took a vicious hit on the left front fender then pitched forward in a graceless cartwheel before coming to rest wheels spinning on the passengers side facing uphill the first thing natalie knew with certainty was that she wasnt dead she was strapped to her seat at a hideously awkward angle and was bleeding from someplace above her left eye the car was filled with a chemical fog apparently from having the airbag deploy then deflate her right hip was throbbing but her arms hands and feet all responded when she called on them to move whether it was from the tank or the fivegallon can there was an increasingly strong odor of gasoline she unsnapped the seat belt and pulled herself up and out of where the door had been stifling a cry whenever she moved her right hip a contusion or muscle tear she decided but not a fracture it would slow her down but it wouldnt stop her she noticed her hunting knife caught beneath the handle of the passenger door painfully she leaned across retrieved it and slipped it into the elastic waistband of her pants the jeep had come to rest so far down the embankment that she could not see the road through the thick foliage but she knew that somewhere up there vargas was preparing a descent to check on his handiwork and if necessary to finish the job she hobbled away from the jeep and then knelt head down and listened from not too far below she could hear rushing water from above nothing then the mosquitoes began lone fighters and squadrons attracted by her sweat her breathing and her blood buzzing into her ears and nose no movement she warned herself staying in a crouch as the first wave began biting no movement no sound natalie vargass call pierced the forest natalie are you all right it was stupid of me to have done that if youre hurt i want to help natalie peered back up the steep densely forested embankment but could detect no movement six inches at a time operating on all fours forcing the intense ache in her hip from her mind she worked her way parallel to the hillside farther and farther from the wreck that vargas had a gun she had no doubt she had the knife but her mobility was limited and her speed nonexistent every movement of hers along the sodden ground left crushed ferns and broken branches soon vargas would be following that trail her only chance and that a small one was an ambush from above of course at the moment of truth there had to be an unencumbered willingness to use her seveninch blade natalie i am sure you are hurt and in need of help i can help you i can explain everything i can tell you about dom angelo he was slightly breathless suggesting that he was working his way down toward the jeep snorting some bugs out of her nostrils natalie pushed on searching for just the right spot from below the sound of the stream or river grew louder suddenly on her right the forest broke away the twentyfive or thirtyfoot drop to the swirling water a broad stream was not exactly sheer but it was damn steep natalie i see where you are going if you want help just stay where you are i saw the blood in your car i know you are hurt there wasnt much time still on all fours natalie pushed ahead another twenty feet then cut uphill for ten feet and finally back toward the jeep if vargas was following her trail as he said he would pass right beneath her when he did she would have one and only one chance she braced herself against the thick squat trunk of a palm there was no position she could shift to that didnt put strain on her hip so she resolved to ignore any pain that didnt completely disable her somewhere she had read that there were more than million species of insects in the rain forest at that moment she had no trouble believing that statistic to her right she could see bushes moving she pulled the hunting knife from her waistband and unsheathed it the blade unused except for slicing a piece of paper in the store was frightening and intimidating she hefted it in her hand and decided to thrust it overhand aiming for a target in vargass neck or chest the image she had was of the attack by norman batess mother on the detective in psycho as the rustling of the policemans approach drew closer she reflected on dora cabral slumped on the table in her modest kitchen rodrigo vargas despite his charm and good looks was a remorseless killer she had to be strong and willing she told herself strong and willing in seconds she saw the top of the mans head above the undergrowth he was moving slowly aware of everything around him there could be no hesitating she crouched low and planted her right foot clutching the huge knife and working to ignore the electric pain in her hip vargas was coming into view in three or four steps he would be directly between her and the drop to the river the sound of the churning water was her ally masking her last second movement he was holding a gun loosely and professionally in front of him two more steps dont look up dont natalie pushed off awkwardly and threw herself down at the man flailing more than stabbing with the knife she struck home just behind vargass right shoulder and thought she might have hit bone the man screamed his gun discharged ineffectually then her momentum took them both over the edge of the steep embankment tumbling helplessly toward the river two rag dolls slamming off trees and over bushes ten feet from the bank natalie caught a woody shrub and stopped herself the branches tearing skin from her arms vargas continued his near free fall finally coming to rest facedown and motionless on the muddy bank with his lower half in the water blood was soaking through his khaki shirt from a stab wound just behind and below his right armpit neither his gun nor her knife was anywhere in sight natalie lay where she was badly shaken gasping for breath and hurting in more places than she could catalogue below her vargas remained still his legs dancing obscenely in the swirling stream had he broken his neck in the fall or accidentally shot himself or had the wound she inflicted been mortal of the three possibilities only the third seemed unlikely the knife hadnt felt like it went that deep but the thrust was wild and almost anything could have happened groaning from the discomfort she rolled over and sat bracing herself with arms that felt as if they had been assaulted with a bat below her vargass legs continued their macabre dance of death he was a bad man she said to herself and deserved his fate in her heart though she still felt sick at having killed painfully she used a tree to push herself upright then again stared down at the policeman trying to focus in on what her next move should be rodrigo vargas and the rental jeep were probably where they would forever be her job was to get to dom angelo and the most likely way to accomplish that was the mans mercedes where would the keys be the climb up the embankment was not going to be easy and it would certainly not be worth doing if the keys were as seemed likely in vargass pocket the notion of retrieving them from there made her queasy but climbing up the difficult slope to check for them then back down if they werent in the car then back up again made no sense gingerly working her way down to the body natalie looked for a heavy rock to use as a weapon in case she was wrong about vargas what she found instead was something much better his gun it was resting in some mud against the base of a huge fern about twenty feet from the water it was a heavy longbarreled revolver with a dark wood handle something close to what jesse james might have worn no surprise there she wiped off the barrel on her pants and carefully approached vargass body his cheek was pressed into the mud his face turned away from her his arms outstretched cautiously she knelt beside him then hesitated before reaching into his pocket instead she set her fingers on the skin over the radial artery at his wrist his pulse was bounding before natalie could fully react to the discovery a guttural scream issued from vargass throat snarling he twisted over like a viper latching on to the wrist of her gun hand the once urbane policeman was an apparition his upper lip was gashed through and was bleeding briskly into the muddy mask that covered his face his eyes were glazed by an insane fury and his teeth covered with mud and blood were bared natalie pounded frantically at his face with her free hand and kicked him again and again with all her strength hoping somehow to catch him in the groin he outweighed her by fifty pounds at least and despite all of her efforts he steadily forced himself on top of her his free hand got purchase around her throat and his grip closed tightly just as she felt she might be losing consciousness one of her kicks connected and for the briefest instant the grip on her wrist relaxed without a conscious thought natalie yanked her hand free pointed the pistol in the general direction of her attacker and fired in a spray of blood and gore vargass form went instantly slack the top of his skull shot downward from no more than two feet was gone exposing what remained of his brain in near shock crying out with every breath her ears ringing from the ferocious blast of the revolver natalie wiped tissue and blood off her eyelids with the back of her hand then she whirled and plunged her face into the cool silty stream chapter in respect of temperance courage magnificence and every other virtue should we not carefully distinguish between the true son and the bastard plato the republic book vii dr sanjay khanduri swarthy handsome and very intense weaved through the teeming streets of the metropolis of amritsar proudly extolling its virtues to anson who sat in the seat next to him and also to elizabeth st pierre in back we are in punjab state dr anson he said in his clipped indianbritish speech amritsar is my hometown it is one of the most beautiful cities in our country and is a spiritual center and pilgrimage destination of sikhism do you know about that religion according to st pierre khanduri was one of the foremost lung transplant specialists in the world now nearly two months after his remarkably successfully operation anson had no reason whatsoever to dispute that claim i know something of it he said very mystical deeply spiritual one god no idols equality of all five symbols let me see if i remember them no cutting of the hair always wear four specific tokens a comb a steel bracelet special underwear of some sort andand some kind of small dagger is that it the dagger is symbolic of a sword and the underclothes are those of soldiers symbolizing the sikhs constant readiness to fight for their beliefs excellent doctor i am very impressed but you are cleanshaven so i am assuming you are not a sikh that is true doctor although i do share much of the philosophy of the sikhs i do not share all of it sanjay st pierre asked is it very far to mrs narjots home not too far dr elizabeth but as you can see the traffic is bad we are on court road which is always congested we must go to sultan road three miles i would say it would not take very long if we were actually moving khanduri chuckled at his own humor the midafternoon sky was an unbroken expanse of azure and the sun was hot with the surgeons toyota virtually motionless beggars chattering incessantly were drawn to the windows beside the caucasian man and the stunning african woman i want to give something to each of them anson said you are a very kind man doctor alas there are many more beggars than you have money to give them i suppose and that is only in this section of the city i am excited to see that you are breathing quite naturally now i get to appreciate firsthand that all of the positive reports elizabeth has sent me are true you did an amazing job thank you i confess i was very nervous when the outbreak of serretia marcescens pneumonia occurred throughout the hospital and we had to move you so soon after your surgery to tell you the truth i remember very little of those first few days after my operation in fact the hospital you transferred me to in capetown is really the first memory i have the serratia outbreak was a dangerous one joseph elizabeth said especially with you on antirejection medication however minimal i was worried about transferring you to one of the other amritsar hospitals khanduri added serratia had already been showing up in some of their immunocompromised patients and in addition they have been hit hard by staffing shortages alls well that ends well anson said sensing at that moment that he had never really analyzed the shakespearean quote very deeply and now wasnt at all sure he agreed with it alls well that ends well khanduri echoed traffic had begun moving again and the beggars fell away anson sat quietly marveling at the kaleidoscope that was amritsar architecturally sophisticated and opulent one block tawdry and decrepit the next it was a miracle that among this incredible mass of humanity several million people in this city alone at just the necessary moment a lifesaving gift appeared for him in the form of a braindead man who was a virtually perfect tissue match to him whitestone has inquiries out quite literally all over the world elizabeth had explained when they were discussing his deteriorating health we are determined to protect our investment at all costs she had punctuated the statement with a wink indeed thanks to the charming unassuming man now serving as their guide whitestones investment had been protected and marvelously so now as soon as he had finished making his peace with the widow and children of t j narjot anson would complete the bargain and turn over the final secrets of the synthesis of sarah khanduri made a slight detour to take them past the gilded walls dome and tall minarets of the golden temple the water in which the golden temple sits is called the pool of nectar he said the sikhs have been continuously embellishing and improving the structure in various ways since the fifteenth century you seem very proud of the sikhs anson said why have you not embraced their religion i am hindu khanduri replied simply i believe strongly in the caste system and the sikhs dont outwardly espouse it anson was still gazing at the temple or he would have seen st pierre make eye contact with khanduri in the rearview mirror and shake her head sternly and emphatically after threequarters of an hour of driving the surgeon pulled up before a modest twostory dwelling on a middleclass street that was not nearly as busy as most of those around it t j narjot was the foreman of a crew that works doing repairs for the electric company he explained his wife narendra as is often the case here in india stayed home with the children she speaks no english so i will have to interpret for you this state punjab has its own language but both she and i speak primarily hindi elizabeth do you wish to come in with us yes st pierre said after the briefest hesitation yes i think i would is that all right with you joseph absolutely dr khanduri please tell mrs narjot that we will not inconvenience her long they were greeted at the door by a slender attractive woman in her thirties unadorned wearing a sari of subdued color her head was uncovered and her ebony hair hung loose to her shoulders she made no pretext at being demure but instead shook hands with her three visitors and maintained steady eye contact when speaking with them the small living room was neatly furnished with very little art on the walls or end tables there were several photos of a lean goodlooking mustachioed man with an engaging smile whom narendra later confirmed was her late husband from somewhere in the back of the first floor came clatter and the sound of childrens laughter after anson extended his sympathy and thanked his hostess for receiving them he asked about her husband tj and i were married for twelve years narendra said through khanduri our children are nine and six both boys they miss their father terribly and they still get very upset at even speaking about what happened i wont disturb them anson said that is much appreciated until his hemorrhage he was in excellent health the stroke was very sudden and massive bleeding they told me from tangled blood vessels that he had from birth it was an arteriovenous malformation st pierre interjected i thought so anson said my husband and i had spoken in general terms about what we would wish if something like this ever happened of course we never expected that narendra began to weep khanduri motioned that it was okay to wait and allow her to continue that either of us would need to make such a decision i understand anson said in the end tjs lung corneas and both his kidneys were transplanted he then had a wonderful shraddha a funeral khanduri explained and then his body was cremated the narjots are not sikhs anson asked realizing as he asked the question that t j had neither the beard of a sikh nor the customary turban no khanduri said like me they are hindu but dont hindus believe that organ donation is mutilation of the body and therefore to be avoided anson asked khanduri did not turn to narendra for the answer in older days that was certainly so he said but now there are an increasing number of hindus who understand that organ donation is useful to others and therefore most honorable fortunately for you and for the other recipients of his organs that is the case with the narjots in all the interpreted conversation lasted a little more than an hour during which anson asked about t j narjot his personality interests and personal history he sounds like a very unusual man anson said when narendra was through oh he was came the interpreted reply he was very special and we shall miss him forever finally narendra took her guests on a brief tour of her house that included a wave to her sons in the hallway anson removed an envelope from his pocket narendra immediately recognizing it for what it was tried vehemently to refuse but khanduri intervened and after a rather lengthy explanation the woman accepted then stood on her tiptoes and kissed anson briefly on the cheek take care of yourself dr anson she said my husband lives in you my body will be a temple to his memory mrs narjot anson replied so dr joseph khanduri said as they were driving back to the airport was the meeting with your benefactors widow all that you expected it to be i do my best to avoid expectations anson said but it certainly was an enlightening experience one that i shall never forget ansons fists held at his sides where neither khanduri nor st pierre could see were so tightly clenched that his nails nearly cut into the flesh of his palms it was three thirty in the morning when anson slipped out the back window of his apartment the jungle cleansed by a light rain was aromatic and mystical keeping low and avoiding the security cameras anson took a long arc through the dense undergrowth and then headed to his right toward the access road to the hospital the road was patrolled at night but infrequently the flight home with two connections had taken most of a day anson had used his trusted friend francis ngale to set things up for him then he had showered rested dressed in clean dark clothing and finally set out through the window after twenty minutes he arrived at the road paved by the government in gratitude for the work of the clinic it took a few seconds to orient himself and determine that ngale would be waiting a short distance to the south anson was a brilliant man and loved solving puzzles of all kinds the puzzle that was perplexing him now however was continuing to defy his logic he did know that the journey he was taking to the village of akomv limba would be a crucial step toward the solution there were those he knew including elizabeth who considered him overly vigilant and suspicious now it seemed possible that he hadnt been paranoid enough the rain clouds kept the unlit road quite dark but there was some light reflected off them that sparkled on the wetness of the pavement francis he called softly as he rounded a bend right here doctor the security guard answered just keep coming the massive man as dark as the night was waiting by the road holding up the fourteenspeed bicycle that had once been ansons but now more or less belonged to anyone at the clinic or lab who might want to take it out for a ride for anson this would be the first time in two years although his surgery had been so successful that he had no worries about using it now you remember how to ride ngale asked i expect it will be as easy as riding a bicycle very funny i have oiled the chain and the axles as well as the gearshift and brakes if you fall off you will have only yourself to blame anson patted his friend on the shoulder and started pedaling ngale trotted beside him for a few concerned paces then veered to the side of the road ill say hello to the mayor for you anson called over his shoulder i already did that myself platini is waiting up for you as usual the fragrances and sounds of the jungle were hypnotic and twice anson had to force his attention back to the road the fivemile ride to the village of akonolimba on the banks of the nyong river took just over half an hour the dirt road that eventually bisected the town was too muddy to ride so anson walked the last quarter mile many of the huts were made of cinderblock and corrugated aluminum but some were still reed and thatch the village had running water and electricity as well as telephone service but few of the inhabitants could afford to take advantage of them and some of those who could simply didnt want to platini katjaoha the mayor of the village ran a general store and lived in the most opulent house stucco and cinderblock two stories with a carport several rooms and a cistern there was also a satellite dish protruding off one of the outside walls he answered ansons gentle knock barefooted wearing red bermuda shorts and a buttonup hawaiian shirt that stretched tightly over his royal girth his smile showed perfectly white teeth that seemed almost phosphorescent against the ebony of his skin mr mayor anson whispered in french thank you so much for doing this for me you are always welcome in my home doctor katjaoha boomed punctuating his greeting with a handshake and bear hug the door is closed upstairs so you will awaken no one my wife sleeps like a cow anyhow and the children are exhausted from getting underfoot all day can i get you some wine tea anything just a phone i heard that you had a successful operation we are pleased thank you my friend i have a new lung from someone in india i heard actually thats what i am here to find out did francis tell you i would be making a longdistance call for all that you have done for the people in our village you could call the moon if you wish thank you please write your number down i will need my friend to call me back here no problem and i may have to wait for that call also no problem you are a wonderful man platini katjaoha then you are the idol of wonderful men i will be upstairs call my name out if you need me anson thanked him again then settled into a frayed easy chair by the telephone and pulled a folded paper from his pocket there was a fivehour difference between cameroon and new delhi so he had some uncertainty as to whether bipin gupta would be at home or at his office knowing the head of the editorial page of the highly regarded indian express newspaper as well as he did anson dialed the work number first not surprisingly gupta answered on the initial ring greetings from cameroon old friend anson said in nearfluent hindi joseph joseph what a pleasant surprise you must call more often though your south african accent is getting more pronounced the two of them had roomed together for two years during college in capetown even though gupta was quite fluent in english anson insisted from day one that they speak only hindi to each other he had always had a knack for learning languages and quickly added guptas native tongue to his english afrikaans dutch french spanish and german he was surprised during the trip to amritsar to realize that he had never shared the fact of his fluency in hindi with elizabeth at first he was a bit embarrassed sitting by while sanjay khanduri translated ianguage that he understood perfectly but he was also amused and he fully intended not to allow his humorous little deception get too far however that was before narendra narjot or whoever she was asked how do you like my performance so far and khanduri shockingly replied just keep your answers simple and straightforward and i will do the rest bipin anson said after some initial courtesies i need you to check on two things for me if it is possible i will wait here for your reply the first is a man by the name of t j narjot sultan road amritsar about forty he reportedly died at central hospital sometime during the week of july eighteenth and the second sometime around that date there was allegedly an inhospital epidemic at central hospital and others in amritsar with a germ named serratia marcescens i need to know if that epidemic actually took place the journalist had him spell the bacterium then said you know that it is more difficult to determine that a person doesnt exist or an event didnt happen than if they did what i know is that my friend bipin gupta can do anything give me a number to reach you gupta said and an hour chapter if they escape disaster they will be the better for it plato the republic book v rodrigo vargass black mercedes was a powerful fourdoor sedan that smelled of cigars battered and slowed by her breathing and the deep bruise in her hip natalie had driven nearly a quarter of a mile before finding a narrow dirt spur cutting off into the dense forest after she assured herself that the car was invisible from the road she made four trips back to the jeep to haul supplies up the hill by the time she had transferred her compact tent backpack water and food supplies into the mercedes it was late afternoon during that time not one car passed in either direction with no idea how far she was from dom angelo she decided to drive albeit slowly in just thirty minutes a road dropped off downhill into the forest to her right a sign nailed to a tree at the fork had an arrow pointing to the left along with the crudely painted directions da km less than a kilometer along that road she found a pair of rough tracks cutting off into the dense growth to her left she drove the mercedes in until the tracks had all but disappeared at the base of a hill this time she did her best to cover the rear of the car with tree branches and then wedged the key tightly beneath the right front tire during the drive she had concocted a reasonably satisfying story of a naturalist from america hiking the rain forest and at the moment searching for a relative who last she knew worked as a nurse in dom angelo part of her story would also be a nasty downhill tumble when the edge of the dropoff gave way her backpack with the tent strapped on was heavier than she would have liked but anything less might have drawn suspicion the pain in her hip was an annoyance but not unbearable and served as a constant re minder that her continued existence was a threat to some person or group she just had to find a way to keep the pressure on the early evening forest was awesome rich with oxygen and the blend of a thousand scents as she walked she tried to conceive of how she might be connected to this place many thousands of miles from her home the road followed a prolonged gentle slope before curving to the right then with little warning the forest fell away and the road dropped sharply ahead and below her nestled in a broad valley was what she assumed was the village of dom angelo for a time natalie sat at the base of a thick palm and studied the scene below which from this distance looked like a diorama there were a number of structures mostly residences it seemed aligned along a grid of dirt streets the buildings were crudely built with clay and corrugated metal smoke curled from several of them to her left north she reckoned was what appeared to be the entrance to a mine hewn into the base of a mountain that towered over the valley to her surprise there were electric lights on poles scattered throughout the village beneath them children were playing natalie guessed two hundred inhabitants maybe two fifty a hundred yards beyond the mine entrance a narrow waterfall twenty feet high filled a small pool which then emptied into a fastmoving stream coursing alongside the village natalie wondered if somewhere downstream this was the water that was sweeping over the dancing corpse of rodrigo vargas there were children in the pool and at least two women washing clothes in the stream farther down two men were working primitive sluices panning for gems or gold idyllic natalie thought quaint and absolutely peaceful and yet she had been maimed because of the place and another woman murdered with a soft groan she pulled herself upright and headed down into the basin chickens were the first to greet her followed by two generic brown dogs next were three women all brazilian indians the tallest of them was still well less than five feet the trio smiled at her openly and without the slightest hint of suspiciousness boa noite she said good evening boa noite they replied smiling broadly natalie wandered casually along the hardpacked streets and stopped at a tiny store for some packaged meat ginger ale and some sort of small melon the proprietress another indian shook her head when asked about a woman named dora cabral several more citizens of the village gave her similar responses including two miners just finishing a days work in the hole in the mountain the altitude and long day were beginning to take their toll on natalies stamina she was thinking about locating a place in the forest to pitch her tent when she spotted a chapel whitewashed clay with a red tile roof and a stubby squaretopped steeple with a crude sixfoot cross on top the canvases forming the top half of the walls and the door were rolled up and tied exposing two rows of ten roughhewn pews the altar was unadorned save for an elaborate ceramic crucifix fixed to the solid wall behind it although she considered herself spiritual in the sense of living in constant awe of the vastness of the universe the wonders of nature and the need to treat others with respect and some form of love natalie had never been religious in any organized sense still she felt a deep serenity in this simple structure and responded to it by sitting down on one of the benches despite her attempts to relax and clear her mind the horror of vargass attack on her and his violent death along with the puzzle of dora cabral simply would not let go she had been in the chapel for perhaps fifteen minutes when a man spoke to her from behind in accented though fluent portuguese welcome to our church his voice was gravelly and low but somehow soothing before she even turned natalie breathed in the alltoofamiliar scent of cigarettes standing behind her was a priest in a plain black mudspattered robe white collar and sandals he was fifty or so somewhat gaunt with dark hair cut short a day or two of grayblack stubble and striking electric blue eyes a heavy silver cross dangled halfway down his chest suspended on a thick silver chain this is a very lovely place she replied you are american the priest said in perfect english or at least as perfect as someone probably raised in brooklyn or the bronx could have boston natalie said switching to english and extending her hand natalie reyes reyes so you are brazilian my mother is cape verdean i am father francisco nunes frank nunes of the brooklyn nuneses natalie smiled as the man took a seat on the pew opposite hers he had a magnetic presence that immediately drew her to him but there was also an unmistakable aura of melancholy that she suspected might have something to do with the reason he had migrated so far from new york this is quite a parish she said actually i minister to several villages in the rain forest but primarily i am here call it penance if you wish natalie declined the silent offer to pursue the matter father francisco seemed anxious to talk and here is dom angelo a mining community primarily emeralds but also green tourmaline topaz opal amber and some sapphire i have become something of an expert on the purity of these gems and you i am a student taking some time away from my studies to reorder my priorities in life and to hike the rain forest before it is all gone it still has a ways to go but i understand i notice that most of the people here are indians the priest laughed many of our residents are indigenous to these vast forests he said but there are a number of others here who crave the anonymity of a place like this where all transactions are done in cash and people only have last names if they wish to do the indians own the mine again an ironic laugh these poor pure people own next to nothing he said and are probably the better for it the gems they mine are quite profitable and in brazil profit often means involvement of the military police it is they who own this place at least a small group of them do think of them as the sheriffs and dom angelo as tombstone in the once wild west natalie flashed on rodrigo vargass hideous visage as he lifted his bloodied face up from the mud to attack her involuntarily she shuddered ii have another reason for seeking out this village she said after a time a relative of my family a woman named dora cabral originally from rio wrote my mother that she was working out here as a nurse is that possible quite possible yes father francisco replied we have a hospital nearby and that hospital employs nurses brought in from rio but although i know some of them i know no person named dora cabral i will ask around the village though i have already asked a few people but no luck its hard to believe you have a hospital out here quite a modern hospital in fact they perform highly specialized forms of surgery although i have never been privileged to know precisely what fascinating so your parishioners go there for care not for surgery operations are only performed by the nurses and doctors who are flown in or sometimes driven in from rio and then only on their patients if one of our residents needs hospitalization there is an ambulance we are allowed to use who runs this hospital the same people who run dom angelo the military police essentially when they need help they bring villagers down as cooks or for housekeeping or sometimes even to assist in the operating room once every week or two a clinic is opened at the hospital so that a nurse or doctor can minister to the people from the villages thats very good of them it is all about control the care the villagers get they would not be able to get anywhere else their gratitude may cause them to think twice should they consider trying to keep a stone for themselves not doing so is generally a wise choice the police have a network of spies and informants and mete out justice with a very quick and heavy hand if you have spoken to any of the townspeople there is a chance the policeman currently residing at the hospital already knows you are here well if so they will soon know that i am only passing through father francisco tapped a halfsmoked cigarette from a crumpled pack and lit it inhaling gratefully i have decided that i have enough vices i am doing penance for he said the right to enjoy these i retain it is your right the priest hoisted natalies backpack on his shoulder come i will show you a flat protected plot overlooking the village where you can pitch your tent thats very kind of you father i wonder if there is any way i could visit the hospital i fell down an embankment not long ago and injured my hip i can clean and bandage your scrapes and cuts and tomorrow i can inquire about the status of affairs at the hospital but i can make no guarantee of treatment that would be very kind of you tell me where is this hospital a kilometer to the south no more i am sure if there is no special surgery scheduled dr santoro would be happy to care for you natalie felt her blood freeze who did you say she asked trying desperately to maintain a facade of nonchalance dr santoro father francisco said dr xavier santoro chapter then you will soon observe whether a man is just and gentle or rude and unsociable these are the signs which distinguish even in youth the philosophical nature from the unphilosophical plato the republic book vi with the steepness of the hills and the height of the trees night settled in quite quickly the small plot of grass to which father francisco had led natalie was beyond and above the stream not that far from the waterfall she politely declined his offer to help her set up her tent for fear that he would wonder why it was absolutely unused tomorrow if she continued to be comfortable with him she would share the real story behind her journey to dom angelo meanwhile she pumped the priest as hard as she could for information regarding dr xavier santoro what she learned was little francisco suspected that like so many in this part of the forest santoro had a past he would just as soon forget eight years ago when francisco took up residence in dom angelo the hospital and airstrip were already there as was santoro a kind man he said who genuinely seems to care for the forest people if thats so natalie wanted to scream how did he end up operating on my lung in the gathering gloom pitching the hightech tent was a chore that would have been comical had the situation not been so intense finally bathed in perspiration and swathed in insect repellent but victorious she sat outside her new home reflecting on her surprising lack of emotion at having so violently killed a man just a few hours ago according to francisco the group of policemen controlling the mine and the medical center numbered four with at least one always present at the hospital it was they who maintained the church and meagerly subsidized him as much he suspected for his skill as a lapidary as his ability to preach and minister tomorrow natalie decided she would probably share with him the news that the number of military police managers had been reduced by twentyfive percent for the moment though all she wanted to do was sit still and wonder how she could have found her way from an alley in a favela just outside of rio to a hospital in the middle of nowhere the vantage point from her campsite included a disarming view of the waterfall and pool and of the town below but of something else as well to the south in a valley visible over the tops of trees the priest had pointed to a faint cluster of lights the hospital that is where tomorrow we shall try and get medical help for your hip francisco had said i think you will find that dr santoro has the answer to your problem let us hope so natalie thought savagely it was nearly eleven before the nip of cachaca sugarcane liquor kicked in and natalie retreated to the womblike interior of her tent she slipped vargass gun inside her thin sleeping sack and allowed herself to drift off fully expecting the proximity to dr xavier santoro to trigger yet another flashback what she heard instead after just a few minutes was a soft scuffling from somewhere just outside the tent natalie silently slid the gun out held her breath and listened nothing astonished at how calm she was feeling she aimed the barrel at the spot where she placed the sound i hear you and i have a gun she said in portuguese go away before i shoot you do not need to do that a mans harsh whisper responded if i wanted you dead you would already be dead it is what i do who are you and what do you want my name is luis fernandes dora cabral is my sister with vargass gun still at the ready and a highintensity flashlight in her other hand natalie turned and crawled headfirst from the tent luis fernandes was seated crosslegged holding his hands palms up to show he was unarmed he was slightly built with an indians features but definitely taller much taller than those men she had seen in town a black patch held in place by elastic covered his left eye overall he was quite menacing you must speak a little slower natalie said lowering both the gun and the flashlight my portuguese is weak actually you are speaking very well are you from lisbon massachusetts in the states but my family is cape verdean are you really a professional killer i do what i have to and some of the time i am paid for doing it my sister works as a nurse in rio at santa teresa hospital is that the dora cabral you seek for a time natalie studied the mans narrow deeply etched face he might have been anywhere from thirty to fifty though she suspected early thirties he was cleanshaven with sideburns that came down below his ears and had probably been handsome before the hardness of his life took over now he simply looked rough natalie sensed there was no reason to be anything other than direct with the man i am afraid i have some bad news for you she said finally it was time she decided to share her story tomorrow it would likely be with father francisco possibly in the form of a confession tonight it would be with this man who she strongly felt was no threat to her luis listened intently as she recounted her two trips to his country and the frantic events since she was approached by his sister at the crosswalk in downtown rio outwardly he seemed calm almost detached but even through the gloom natalie could see that his jaw was set and his lips pressed tightly together believe it or not there was a time when i was a teacher he said when she had finished i taught music to schoolchildren then one night ten maybe eleven years ago i rose to the defense of the father of one of my students who was being beaten by the police during the struggle one of the policemen fell and hit his head and died after a few years of running and yes killing i ended up in this place even though the police run this village and the hospital there are never any questions asked here i understand natalie said so now after being a wanted man for so long i am the head of security for the hospital it is my job to bring people down from the village when there is an operation being done i learned from some of the nurses how much they were being paid and i talked my sister into signing up with dr santoro she only came here twice and then suddenly decided not to come anymore she never told me why perhaps something was going on at the hospital that bothered her when was the last time she was here two months ago maybe a little less you are sure it was vargas who killed her and vargas whom you killed i am sure this is his gun luis took the weapon inspected it then hefted it expertly in his hand it is vargass he said he was a very hard man with little respect for me or anyone else of stature below his own your sister was extremely frightened of him it is not easy to resign from working at this hospital maybe impossible i owe you a great debt for avenging her i believe your sister was killed because she tried to help me she knew what was done to me at this hospital now i need to know if i was really here and if so what happened to me luis thought for a time we are sworn to secrecy regarding the hospital and what is done there the town depends on the hospital father francisco tells me the mine is quite productive and could support the village perhaps luis said he would know better than i tell me luis you know what they do there dont you the killer stared down at the ground natalie knew what he was contemplating these people demanded loyalty and were not the sort who allowed second chances if he turned against them now if they learned he had shared any of their secrets there would be no going back for him they do transplants he said softly transplants of body parts many times the donors of the organs transplanted do not survive in those instances we are told to bury the bags containing their bodies buti was shot natalie said how could they transplant my lung when it had already been destroyed i do not know i do not often see the patients when they are alive i mean luis i am sure you are risking much by telling me what you have please know how grateful i am do you have a family here a woman only rosa she is the only person in dom angelo who is tougher than i am she knows knew my sister and will be very upset at the news she has been murdered rodrigo vargas was not a man she liked or trusted she will also be willing to help you in any way she can you should know that something is scheduled to be happening at the hospital over the next few days i have been instructed to assemble a squad of eight guards two shifts of four to keep watch on the hospital beginning in the morning in that case natalie asked is there any way i could get into the place tonight luis fernandes thought for just a few seconds as a matter of fact he said there is chapter the hour of departure has arrived and we go our ways to die and you to live which is better god only knows plato apology you may bring your torch luis said but do not turn it on until i tell you it is safe to do so unless there is something happening i do not know only dr santoro and oscar barbosa the policeman are at the hospital right now if this is a typical night each of those men will have a woman with him i will do whatever you say the night was moonless and the forest as black as it was noisy initially even though there was no discernible path and he was operating with one eye luis moved through the dense underbrush with the vision and stealth of a jaguar at first natalie was able to keep pace soon though the altitude and her injuries weighed in and she had to ask him to slow down he did so without comment he was armed with at least one handgun and a long slender knife sheathed just above his right ankle they moved south then west then south again over rolling terrain that in the main continued downward the air was cool and incredibly clean how ironic to lose a lung in such a place natalie thought it was after midnight when they ascended the steepest grade of their journey at the top of the rise with natalie breathing heavily luis raised a finger to his lips and pointed ahead below them much closer than she had expected was the hospital bathed in the light from half a dozen lamps set on tall poles it was a singlestory structure of pristine whitewashed clay sprawling across a plateau surrounded by a fourstrand barbedwire fence there was a long wing extending away from them to the right as you can see the building is shaped like an l the wire does not extend all the way around it luis said now i must ask you a serious question how badly do you want to get inside that depends on how much time i will have once i am there twenty minutes no more maybe less try for eighteen the hospital was hardly small there were ten windows along the wall facing them how many operating rooms are there luis remember to speak slowly please two right in the center those windows you see open on a long corridor that connects all the rooms there are also two hospital rooms right inside the third window from the right i think they are recovery rooms for those who have had surgery next right where the wing comes off are the dining room and the kitchen and beyond them in the wing itself are two small clinic rooms and the sleeping quarters maybe ten rooms in all but i really dont know exactly how many the dining room has some couches and soft chairs at one end where families wait for the surgery to be completed and at the other end after the operating rooms dr santoros office and one other for the surgeons who fly in do you know if those offices are locked i do not when i am around they are always open but there are usually doctors all over the place is that all yes no wait there is one more room at the far left it is a large room at least as large as the operating rooms filled with electronic equipment in the middle of that room is a chair an elaborate chair like the kind you might find in a dentists office and screens several television screens on the wall i have only been there once or twice they do not like me or my security people to be inside the hospital unless there is trouble they do not have uniforms for us and we are not clean enough for them as is natalie studied the structure trying to visualize beyond the windows and imagine how in twenty minutes or less she might go about finding any information filed away about her tomorrow there would be people arriving word might filter down from someone in dom angelo to santoro or a military policeman that a woman was in the village asking about dora cabral tomorrow might be too late you asked a question luis about how badly i wanted to get inside yes the answer is i am willing to risk everything by everything do you mean your life because oscar barbosa is a powerful pig of a man who has more brawn than brains and who is truly poisoned by his power natalie wondered what she would have ultimately done had not the phone call come in from her insurance company raising questions about santa teresa it didnt seem then nor did it seem now as if she had very much to look forward to in her life except answers as i said i am willing to risk everything you are a brave woman senhorita natalie but i already knew that in back of the hospital some distance from where the residence wing and dining area come together is a swimming pool beside the pool is a metal shed in the floor of that shed is a trapdoor covered by a reed mat the tunnel beneath the door was built as an escape route to the airstrip i am not certain why when you mount the staircase at the other end you will be in a pantry in the back of the kitchen clear clear there are electric eyes guarding the rear of the hospital where you will be the diversion you want will come when i shoot out the control box for those electric eyes one shot the moment the shot rings out an alarm will sound and your time starts barbosa and santoro may have women in their rooms or they may have sent them back to the village but no matter the women will stay in their bedrooms no matter what while the men investigate twenty minutes is the absolute most i can keep them occupied your way out is the same as your way in the control box will be damaged beyond a quick repair so the electric eyes will not be a problem wait ten yards beyond the pool until you hear my shot we will meet back here do you think you can find this spot i do i will give you time to get in place take a wide route around the hospital thank you luis thank you for doing this for me i do it for my sister he said as directed natalie took a track well to the east of the hospital the forest was so dense that at times she lost the spotlights altogether finally though she saw the pool a small dark rectangle surrounded on all sides by a concrete patio and separated from the hospital by twenty yards or so lights from several windows washed across the broad courtyard the corrugated metal shed was just where luis had said it would be i am willing to risk everything natalies bold pronouncement echoed in her thoughts as she crouched in the brush forty feet or so from the shed if she was caught she would die there was nothing more certain than that did it make any difference no matter what her life was going to be led as a cripple probably because of her unusual transplant antigen pattern and her low lung allocation score but also possibly from the side effects of the powerful meds that would keep her from rejecting a lung that wasnt closely matched to her in the first place she would gladly have changed places with odysseus facing the monsters scylla and charybdis i am willing to risk anything did she really feel that way she wondered now did she really not care to see her life play out to learn her destiny before the answer became any clearer a shot rang out and an instant later a siren began wailing from not far away without hesitating natalie activated the stopwatch mode on her wristwatch and sprinted forward to the shed slipped inside and dropped to one knee breathing heavily in moments the siren stopped by then she had located the heavy wooden trapdoor and swung it open eight stairs led down to a concrete floor that crossed over to the hospital maybe a hundred feet she estimated she followed the flashlight beam to the far end of the tunnel mounted the ladderlike stairs to the trapdoor and pushed it open struggling to maintain control of it above her she hoped santoro and the policeman barbosa had left the hospital and guns drawn were cautiously searching the grounds and the forest beyond the heavy aroma of mixed spices and foods told her that luis had once again been absolutely accurate she cut the flash and pushed herself up into a rather large cluttered space twelve by twelve stocked floor to ceiling with food and supplies and faintly lit through a glass panel in the door closing the trapdoor and replacing the mat that covered it she crawled quickly across the dining area and lounge the room was airy and comfortable with seating for twentyfive ten more counting the lounge for the moment the entire area was dimly illuminated from the corridor beyond the wide open arched doorway to the hospital when she reached that arch she paused just long enough to listen then moved ahead from what luis had said there was no sense in checking either of the small examination rooms to her right so she moved down the main corridor the two nearly identical recovery rooms were small but well appointed with stateoftheart wallmounted monitors and electronic iv infusion pumps one glance at the crucifix over the door of the first room and the clock on the wall to the right of it and natalie knew that she had been in that room before so much for santa teresa there were no filing cabinets in either room nor did she expect there to be four minutes the first operating room was incredibly large and technologically well equipped with a cardiopulmonary bypass machine and elegant operating microscope between it and the next or was the prep room where the surgeons and or nurses scrubbed in the second or had no bypass ma chine and less sophisticated equipment natalie felt certain that this was the room where her lung was removed the questions resonated louder and louder how did she get here from rio why was her damaged lung removed and not the good one and perhaps most perplexing why was she allowed to live seven minutes the solid doors of the two offices to the left of the second or were both locked one was labeled with a bronze plaque reading dr xavier santoro and the other departamento da cirurgia department of surgery natalie felt herself sink she had eleven minutes left thirteen at the outside before luis feared he would not be able to maintain his diversion and the records she was seeking if in fact such records existed were almost certainly behind one of those two locked doors was it worth trying to break one of them down she hesitated aware that the seconds were ticking past finally almost in spite of herself she moved on to the final room off the hallway the electronics room as luis had described it the door like of the other offices was closed the brass plaque read simply dr d cho ten minutes expecting the worst and prepared to race back to the pantry natalie tried the knob the door swung open she stepped inside and closed it be hind her before turning on the flash a quick scan showed no windows so she found a switch on the wall by the door and flipped it on instantly brilliantly bright fluorescent light filled the room which would have been un like any she had ever seen were she not suddenly and absolutely convinced that she had been there before many times before screens electronics and speakers were on every wall in addition there was a glass cabinet of medications the focus of the room was the chair luis had described plush leather with a number of segments that were all adjustable hanging down over the elaborate setup on a heavy adjustable steel arm was a thick square fullhead helmet made of some sort of metal attached to it was a smoky black plastic visor several cables dangling down from the ceiling were connected to each natalie pictured herself clearly being transferred from a stretcher to the chair she imagined no recalled the helmet being slipped into place and the visor being pulled down virtual reality natalie was certain of it the room was set up to create and implant situations that had never really happened and since her scar x rays and diminished pulmonary function were all quite real the scenario that resulted in her surgery had to have been what was manufactured fourteen minutes natalie rushed to the desk which was strewn with papers and letters all of which were addressed to dr donald m cho at either a post office box in rio or one in new york city she folded several of the more interesting looking ones and stuffed them into her pocket then one letter caught her eye actually it was a fax to cho written in english from cedric zhang phd psychopharmacologist audiovisual implantationist transfixed despite the crush of time natalie read the note dear dr cho i was so pleased to learn how successfully you have adapted my methods for the implantation of virtual scenes into the minds of your subjects as you have discovered the potential for my theories and equipment is limitless we are clearly geniuses you and i and are now in possession of a technique that can quite literally change the world over a short course of treatment witnesses can be programmed to testify that they saw or did not see whatever we wish agents and soldiers can relent in the face of torture and give out implanted information they absolutely believe is true the modifications you have made and tested especially the addition of electrodes that produce legitimate sensations of pain heat and cold are brilliant i suggest we meet at your earliest convenience after your return to new york with deepest respect cedric zhang phd seventeen minutes the circle of confusion was beginning to close natalie knew now that she had never been shot the last real thing that happened to her was the injection into the base of her neck the recurrent nightmares were nothing more than glitches in the system created by a dr cedric zhang and modified by dr donald cho she still had questions piles of them but some of the most disturbing ones had just been answered somewhere in the room she felt certain was a dvd or film of some sort showing from her point of view the attack and ultimately the gunshots that brought her down gunshots that had never happened except through the lens of a camera nineteen minutes clutching her flashlight her pockets stuffed with hastily folded papers vargass gun in her waistband she flicked off the light and slipped out into the corridor it was foolish to have stayed so long if she was caught now she almost certainly would crumble under the weight of torture and drugs and give them luis fernandes it had been selfish and foolish of her to stay crouching lower than the windows she sped down the corridor toward the entrance to the dining room she had just reached it when the main door to the hospital opened without looking back to confirm her impression that it was santoro barbosa or both she dove to her right into the family lounge area and flattened herself behind a sofa the gun was partially pinned beneath her but she dared not move to get at it moments later the two men entered the room they were speaking rapidly too rapidly for natalie to pick up everything they were saying winded from her dash and certain the men could hear if they but listened natalie pulled her shirt up over her mouth and breathed into it forcing herself to pause for a few seconds after each breath she pushed herself tightly against the back of the sofa as they walked past less than ten feet away from what she could make out they were angrily trying to sort out who might have taken a shot at the hospitals security electronics once she heard luiss name but she had no idea of the context the lights in the dining room were still off but she could see both men clearly and she knew that if they turned in her direction they could see her as well please nodont lookdont look barbosa was an absolute bull short and solid with a surprisingly highpitched voice santoro was as she remembered smooth slightly built with glasses and a prominent forehead he motioned the policeman to the lounge and to natalies horror barbosa sank down onto the sofa behind which she was hiding fortunately her breathing had begun to slow and the policemans respirations by virtue of his size were grunting and noisy natalie pressed her shirt even more firmly against her mouth there was no way she could move to get at her gun who would dare shoot at us the bull asked probably whiskey santoro responded around words natalie couldnt make out she had drawn herself into a fetal position barbosas backside through the sofa was no more than a foot from her the large pistol in her waistband drove painfully into her already injured hip go please go there was more conversation which natalie could not completely decipher then finally after what seemed an eternity the two men stood tomorrow will be fun barbosa said i like this place when there is action there should be plenty of that very soon tell me xavier have you heard anything from vargas he was due here late today nothing must be another woman single married young old virgin whore willing reluctant they dot his landscape like cow plop i tell you santoro someday one of those women is going to be the death of him chapter they see only their own shadows or the shadows of one another which the fire throws on the opposite wall of the cave plato the republic book vii moving as little as she could natalie waited for two more agonizing minutes before she stretched out and with no little difficulty crawled to the pantry half expecting to be surprised by someone she made her way back through the tunnel past the pool and into the forest wondering if luis would still be waiting for her on the hilltop north of the hospital as best she could recall she retraced her steps around the building and then started up a rather steep incline after a short while perhaps halfway up the hill she gave in to the altitude her hip the slope and the tension of the past hour and sank to the ground hungry for air luis had probably gone back to the village anyway she reasoned suddenly feeling immeasurably sorry for herself the whole business of the hospital at dom angelo had been nothing but a scam an organtheft operation with a hightech component thrown in it had been her misfortune to have flagged down the wrong cab at the jobim airport as usual pure and simple evil was purely and simply about money an opositive lung well youre in luck were running a special on those this week next week livers the quartet of military policemen now a trio were into gemstones and organs emeralds and kidneys opals and lungs pay for one pay for the other disgusting natalie pushed herself to her feet and trudged upward not really caring if she met up with luis or found dom angelo or not at the top of the ridge with no sign of fernandes she turned and gazed back downhill at the hospital glowing beneath the spotlights and what was now the first blush of dawn how many lungs she wondered how many hearts how many deaths this wasnt trading in organs this was simply stealing them stealing them and implanting scenarios in the poor victims minds when luis was describing burying the bags containing the bodies of donors she had wondered why that wasnt her fate as well now she knew she was being kept alive as a test subject for the product and technique being developed by donald cho and cedric zhang a new cottage industry for the enterprising military policemen to support and ultimately more money for their coffers in all likelihood someone had been checking up on her in boston maybe by rifling the records of her therapist it all hung together perfectly did you run into trouble startled natalie whirled despite the dense undergrowth luis had come up behind her soundlessly god do not sneak up on me like that especially when i have a gun luiss wry expression made words unnecessary there was no way she would have ever gotten a shot off come he said there is a better place for us to sit and talk in silence they walked north and west rising up into some of the densest forest natalie had yet encountered this time luis seemed more mindful of her physical limitations and actually helped her through some of the more difficult parts at the top of a particularly steep rise the forest suddenly opened up revealing a solid granite plateau fifteen feet across and eight feet deep tucked against a hillside to the south and east was a clear view of the hospital and the land beyond it the spectacular vista with the early morning sun washing across it belied the evil that resided there i nearly got caught she said after her breathing had returned to normal i thought that you had and actually said a prayer for you do you need to lie down no no im okay natalie quickly recounted her close call in the hospital so you were brainwashed into thinking you had been shot luis said when she was done the techniques they are developing could be a source of great profit when they are fully perfected i dont know the exact details of how it works but i suspect that first they used hypnotic drugs to open my mind to suggestion then using a visor thats like a tv directly over my eyes and a scene recorded as i would have viewed it they implanted a reality in my brain they even used electrodes to add the sharp pain in my back as the bullets hit me that is impressive it is terrible i wonder how many poor souls have lost organs there they perform maybe one procedure every two weeks how frightening so vargas is dead and you have the answers you were seeking i guess we are finished you and i for a time natalie sat arms folded around her knees gazing out at the lush panoply below sorting through her feelings luis was right she had battled her depression and her demons and come to rio again because of unanswered questions now there was nothing left but to return to boston continue with her pulmonary rehab and await her position on the lung allocation scoreboard she had been at the wrong place at the wrong time and as a result life as she knew it had been destroyed still the fire to end her life had at least for the moment been quenched by a sense of pride over what she had accomplished over the few days since her return to brazil luis what do you think would happen if i contacted the american embassy or the brazilian police about what is going on here she asked the truth the truth there is an enormous amount of money supporting this hospital you can destroy the building but unless the people behind it are dead it will simply be built up again besides i dont know how you do things in america but here we need proof that a crime has been committed before people can be convicted right now the only proof we have is that jeep you rented and the dead body of a policeman in the stream below it oh yes i also believe you have the policemans car natalie nodded that she understood for a time as dawn brightened into morning the only sound was the forest when natalie did speak the words were from the woman who had stood up to cliff renfro and tonya levitskaya luis she heard herself say these people have killed many and also have ruined the lives of many more including mine i am not satisfied with just answers i want satisfaction i want vengeance if i die trying then i die the one good thing if you can call it that of all i have been through is that there is little left for me to fear i want to do whatever i must to close this place down for good to turn it into dust and i want santoro and barbosa behind bars or i want them dead you know luis said more and more as i think about what was done to my sister i have been feeling the same way if it had not been vargas who had murdered her it would have been barbosa or one of the others i agree you must be certain though that you are willing to risk everything for your revenge what advantage we have will rest in that certainty i am certain luis the best i have to look forward to is not a life i wish to lead then we shall try luis offered his hand and natalie held it tightly so what can we do she asked maybe nothing luis said slipping his fingers beneath his eye patch and rubbing at whatever was under there maybe everything first we need some weapons and then we need some help where do we start we start right here luis walked to the hillside behind them and pulled some shrubs from the ground behind those five feet from top to bottom and also across was the opening to a cave i never noticed that natalie exclaimed that is the point very few know this is here inside we have guns explosives and a place to hide should we need it but why do you in my line of work it always pays to be careful and to plan ahead can i look inside you can but first i suggest you look over there natalie turned toward where luis had pointed toward the southeast but she saw and heard nothing new here luis said handing her a pair of highpowered binoculars he had retrieved from just inside the opening of the cave look beyond the hospital then listen natalie saw immediately a long runway very long lined with alternating blue and white lights had been carved east to west into the forest some distance beyond the hospital nearly a minute later she heard what luis had heard some time ago the drone of an approaching plane moments after that she saw an airliner soaring in low from the east luis and natalie lay side by side on the rock shelf trading off the remarkable binoculars watching as the plane made a perfect landing then turned at a culdesac that had undoubtedly been created just for that purpose and taxied to a spot midway down the runway from somewhere in the trees both barbosa and santoro accompanied by four people carrying semiautomatic machine guns materialized to greet the arrivals a hydraulic lift lowered from the belly of the jetliner bearing an unconscious woman on a stretcher along with an accompanying man and woman in surgical garb next trip the platform bore three men one of them a huge blond with a ponytail and a woman they were followed by a uniformed crew of two as the procession neared the hospital the lift made one more trip bringing down a man dressed as the captain wearing his uniform hat and one other man in shirtsleeves perhaps natalie decided the flight attendant finally barbosa and two of his men entered the jetliner and began unloading luggage and other supplies i make it eight men and two women luis said plus santoro barbosa and four security guards from the village it would seem that our odds of success have just dropped significantly to some extent please explain one of those men with barbosa would give his life for me and one of the other guards the one with the red hat is my rosa chapter the best of allis to do injustice and not be punished and the worst of allis to suffer injustice without the power of retaliation plato the republic book ii ben was pleased with himself very pleased he had rolled the dice and had it come up seven nearly twenty hours among the enemy posing as a man he was not performing a job of which he had no knowledge and he had succeeded in fact he acknowledged he was actually quite good at serving people cheerfully and obsequiously and equally skilled at staying out of the way when he wasnt doing that the flight was long but reasonably easy with a stop in venezuela to take on fuel and another one someplace in brazil possibly to do business with an immigration official never did he see an actual customs agent it was amazing how smooth the water could be when it was blanketed with an oil slick of money ultimately he watched through the small porthole in the forward door as the jet swept low over dense forest that went on for many miles banked slightly to the right and then dropped down on a welllit runway that seemed to have materialized from the undergrowth the landing was textbook by far the most distressing part of the flight had been the several visits he made to the compartment at the rear of the plane where the woman who had been the prisoner in the adventurer lay in what had to be a drug induced coma the night before she had cried out that her name was sandy and that she was a mother now she looked only like someone who was about to die in a bizarre horrible sacrifice she would unwillingly lose a vital organ so that another probably a totally stranger might live a man and a woman in surgical scrubs with stethoscopes in place were tending to her the man swarthy and thicknecked sounded and looked more like a longshoreman than a doctor but the woman silver haired and probably in her sixties had a cultured manner and speech suggesting she might well be a physician they called for soft drinks then on two occasions for meals the woman on the stretcher had an oxygen mask and iv in place as well as a cardiac monitor she was a rather pretty redhead in her forties and looked serene and at peace but ben was nearly overwhelmed by the memory of her pathetic cries the chances were slim at best he knew but somehow he had to find a way to help her escape the man named vincent was taller and broader across the shoulders than ben remembered from the moment the killer stepped onto the plane ben was searching for any sign of having been recognized and replaying as best he could every second of their encounter in cincinnati it was so dark in the garage and everything had happened so quickly it didnt seem likely the man had gotten a solid look at him by the time they had been airborne for a few hours bens concerns had largely vanished for his part vincent spent much of the flight asleep on the shoulder of his girlfriend connie was most definitely not the girl of bens dreams she was a ferretfaced woman with a barbedwire tattoo around her upper arm and a tight white tee that accentuated her huge breasts she smoked throughout the flight while the other two security guards played cards or slept howre you doing seth almost finished cleaning up the captain a burly man named stanley holian was as laidback and nonthreatening as vincent and the team of security people were menacing ben had been in the cockpit as much as he had been anywhere on the plane and was grateful for every minute of sportscenter he had ever watched a few batting averages and an opinion as to who was going to win the national league pennant and he was just one of the guys one more minute stan while holian finished up in the cockpit ben made a final pass through the now deserted main cabin and then entered the area at the rear of the plane shielded from the main cabin by a curtain he was looking for something anything that might serve as a weapon he found nothing that he could count on which was probably for the good this was not seth stepanski he was dealing with it was a trio of professional killers that he had succeeded against vincent in cincinnati only lengthened the odds of his succeeding again unless he found help in the rain forest it was wishful fanciful thinking to believe he could free the comatose sacrificial lamb and make it safely back to civilization so what next he still had the elements of acceptance and surprise working for him but that was about all minute by minute he would just have to assess the situation and search for a scenario any scenario that had even a remote chance of success was he willing to stand by and leave sandy to her fate he might have to he acknowledged dying himself wasnt the answer to putting these people out of business he felt ill at the prospect of readying the plane for the flight back to the states knowing what had happened to the woman knowing that because of these people there was an eightyearold boy who was never going to see his mother again stan holian was waiting for him by the elevator to the hold was there a gun someplace in the cockpit ben wondered he glanced down the aisle the door to that room was closed and almost certainly locked where in the heck are we stan brazil very funny north and west of rio seventyfive maybe a hundred miles ive never been to brazil nice place truly beautiful women i dont expect youll get to do much sightseeing on this trip though day after tomorrow maybe the day after that well be heading back how long have you been doing this holian pointedly ignored the question and motioned ben past the roughly dressed brazilians who were transferring boxes of supplies to the hydraulic platform as they were lowered from the belly of the plane ben caught a glimpse of a sprawling white building nestled in the forest then it disappeared behind the trees once on the ground all he could see around them was the forest the early morning was cool and after so many hours in the plane the moisture rich air laden with the sounds of insects tasted especially sweet vincent was waiting for them by a broad dirt path off the edge of the runway then the three of them pilot flight attendant and killer made their way in silence until the path emptied into a road this one much wider and more gravelly with wellestablished tire impressions you go on ahead captain vincent said to the pilot same room as always your bagll be there soon i have something i want to go over with seth here holian did as he was asked as the man disappeared around a bend ben alone with vincent for the first time began feeling a nugget of apprehension the hospitals just around there vincent said its an amazing operation youll be impressed ill bet i will ben said searching for any giveaway in the killers tone do you know whats going to happen to that woman we brought here the nugget expanded nope well pal were going to cut her heart out how about you seth do you know what were going to do with you i don t before ben could say another word a longbarreled pistol materialized in vincents hand and whipped across the side of his face sending him spinning to the ground did you really think you could get away with this you stupid shit vincent said i had to go to the operating room to have that damn paint cleared from my eyes did you think i wasnt going to remember you you didnt fool janet in the office for a second she had a photo of you brought to me before you had even opened your suitcase he kicked ben viciously in the back how long before youre a candidate for the operating room another kick i think we should find that out huddled in a fetal position on the packed road ben was unable even to speak he had eaten little for some time but what there was in his stomach made a sudden uncontrollable reappearance through his mouth and nose up vincent said kicking him once more this time in the back of the knee im going to show you to the hospitality room when you and i are finished youre going to envy that passenger of ours chapter but can you persuade us if we refuse to listen to you plato the republic book i all right lets do it again who are you callahan benjamin michael callahan what do you do detective iim a private detective for gods sake please from where iidaho pocatello idahono please dont do that again dont vincent touched the electric prod to the side of bens chest the shock more intense than any pain ben had ever experienced exploded down his arm and around his back sending every muscle in its path into agonizing spasm ben screamed and then screamed again he was absolutely helpless there was no place to go no one to intervene and no way he could get vincent to let up helpless the interrogation had gone on for hours with the electric prod being the main source of pain along with a device that screwed down on his fingernails after being beaten he had been dragged to a room in the basement of the hospital stripped naked and lashed to a highbacked wooden chair a dozen shocks later plus some work on his hands he had wet and soiled himself and from what he could tell had passed out as well probably more than once twice a brazilian aborigine short but extremely powerful had dragged him to a shower stall and allowed him to wash off in cold water then he was shoved back onto the chair and the torture and interrogation began again with vincent reminding him over and over about their encounter in cincinnati relishing every scream how did you learn about the rv ssomeone in soda springs wrote down the license plate dont bullshit me please stop im telling you the truth i swear i am again the prod this time on the inside of his thigh again the hideous nerve pain and muscle contractions again the screaming ben knew from the moment vincent had slashed him across the face that he was going to be tortured he also knew that although it would likely be the last thing he did he had to keep alice gustafsons name from them once she read the letter he had sent her and freed seth stepanski there would be plenty she could do to make a dent in the whitestone laboratorys illegal organs operation but only if she was alive if vincent and his people got to her his own death would be meaningless his focus as they dragged him to the room likely the last place he would ever see was to concoct a story that was close enough to fact and held together well enough in the telling and retelling to be accepted as the truth how did you find us in cincinnati im a detective for crying out loud thats what they hired me to do with the license plate number it really wasnt that hard who else knows about all this no one no one just me no one knows anything about this except meno no more whether it was from being chilled to the bone or from the breakdown of his nervous system he couldnt stop shaking there were some forms of pain ben could handle headaches ankle sprains viruses strep throats even the pounding vincent had administered but from the deepest memories of his childhood he had hated and feared being drilled by the dentist even with novocain or whatever they used for numbing the anticipation of just the slightest touch on a dental nerve was almost more than he could stand the prod in vincents hands was like a hundred drills into pulp only there was no numbing medicine none at all again the killer shocked him this time on the base of his neck every muscle in his body seemed to contract his jaw viciously snapped shut causing him to bite through the side of his tongue and snap off part of a tooth again who hired you thethe durkins from soda springs their son was killed by a truck in floridathe coroner there thought someone had stolen his bone marrow its the truth i swear it is ill decide what is and isnt the truth and if i decide youre messing with me i swear ill open you up from ass to eyeball with this thing now tell me again how did you end up in texas ben had no trouble making it seem as if he couldnt stand any more of the cattle prod his situation was hopeless and all he wanted now was to get out of his life with as little further pain as possible and to take with him the ort of nobility that would go with not exposing organ guard and its devoted founder he retold the story of the whitestone laboratory in soda springs and his almost inadvertent glimpse of the address on the case of blood vials to be shipped to fadiman the shocks became less frequent though no less terrible finally after what seemed an eternity vincent motioned his helper to throw ben into the shower stall again his chest and abdomen were covered with bile and drool unable to stand on rubbery legs he sat on the grimy tile and supported himself against the wall as the chilly water beat down on him he extended the shower as long as he could stand it then unsteadily crawled back to his chair vincent was gone beside the chair were a large clean white towel and a pile of neatly folded clothes a pair of chinos a gray tee thin white socks and a pair of black spitpolished high cut boots the aborigine motioned for him to get dressed ben had wondered how when his torture was no longer entertaining he would be terminated he had expected even hoped for a bullet to the brain now he didnt know what to think dressing was an excruciating slow process his legs were almost too battered and the muscles too spent to bend there were electric burns over most of his body and his swollen bluish fingers were too stiff to handle the laces after watching him struggle for fifteen minutes or more his guard tied him back in his chair and then laced the boots next he went to a small refrigerator in one corner of the torture chamber and brought over a bottle of water and a thick chocolate bar and freed one of bens hands ben tried to connect with the man do you understand me he asked the guard stared at him blankly i asked if you understood me there was no way bens bruised jaws could even make a dent in the cold chocolate just as well he thought his stomach raw from retching was in no shape to accept any food glumly he sipped the water through cracked bloodied lips his body was throbbing his vision blurring then clearing then blurring again from time to time during the days when he was younger and more philosophical he would ponder the unanswerable wondering how old and where he would be when he died it felt strange and more frightening than he could have imagined to have that moment actually arrive but why had he been dressed up ten minutes passed then another ten ben too dry even to sweat felt himself slipping in and out of consciousness and would have fallen over had he not been strapped to the back of the chair the opening and sharp closing of the door startled him awake even having endured pain that was beyond pain even somewhat prepared for facing certain death what he saw drew an instant band of fear around his chest the man he knew only as vincent his torturer was about to be come his executioner the apparition that was the man stood before him feet apart head erect looking taller and stronger than a park statue his face was expertly streaked with camouflage paint which matched his shirt and pants almost perfectly his long blond hair was tucked beneath a commando watch cap but that outfit was not the source of bens fear across the killers back was slung a quiver containing a dozen or so long arrows and in his left hand held just off the floor was a complexlooking bow let me introduce you vincent said this is a buck fever compound bow with a seventypound draw and a pse shootthrough arrow rest these here are thirtyoneinch epic carbon arrows straight and true all the way we aint got much time for tracking and hunting on these trips and decent game is in pretty short supply here anyhow so whats a hunter to do idont think i can even stand up ben said in that case this is going to be one goddamn short hunt now listen and listen closely rio is maybe eighty miles south and east of here belo horizonte is almost due north a hundred maybe a hundred and fifty miles but in that direction theres some powerful steep hills mountains some might call em in between theres any number of little towns and villages where you might find a friend personally i dont think youre gonna make it but you never know first you gotta get away from me and i dont think folks would accuse me of bragging if i said i was a pretty good shot with this thing his free hand flashed out grabbed ben by the hair and pulled his head back as far as it would go i need some fresh blood of yours to keep the scent he said i promise you callahan if you dont make this a challenge for me if you dont put up enough of a fight im going to wound you someplace that wont kill you and have you dragged back in here for a serious goround with the prod that will make this last session seem like a carnival he released his grip but before bens head could flop forward vincent hammered him across the face reopening the gash his gun barrel had made ben ignored the blow and the pain and the blood streaming down soaking into his shirt to his way of thinking he wasnt being given a chance to live but rather a chance to die outdoors and with a modicum of dignity he had won the battle against this man and against whitestone alice gustafson and organ guard were safe now it didnt matter that he was about to lose the war he had long ago lost his faith in the church in any church in fact but now he sensed that if his childhood priests and catechism teachers were right and there was a heaven he at least had a shot at getting there he only hoped he could put forth a decent effort and that the end wouldnt hurt too much hail mary full of grace the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb jesus untie me he heard his surprisingly forceful voice say vincent nodded to his assistant and it was done ben clenched his teeth as best he could and pushed himself upright a wave of dizziness and nausea threatened to topple him but he forced himself to remain erect and even managed to take another pull from the water bottle holy mary mother of god pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death with the hail mary reverberating in his mind ben took one painful awkward step toward the door then another he wondered what it would feel like to have a highpowered arrow pierce his body these werent summer camp archery arrowheads vincent would be firing at him they were the hunters the ones with three or four metal sides coming to a lethal point at the tip another step this one somewhat easier he took a deep steadying breath and passed through the door into the midafternoon sun vincent strode out after him straight ahead he ordered ill tell you when to stop ben forced himself upright he had won now it was time simply to play out the string just two months ago if someone had told him he would be dying for a cause he believed in he would have leaned back in his scarred desk chair in his tawdry little office and laughed until he cried where was madame sonja when he needed her the whole business of being tortured would have been so much easier if he had only known in advance he was going to make it if he had only known in advance that he was going to safeguard alices name and mission to the death he wanted so much to see vincents face when he told him that the game was over and that whitestone had lost but of course that would have to remain his secret he forced his chin up and trudged forward one painful unstable step at a time then he paused took one last swig from the water bottle and tossed it into the brush they were on the gravel road out of view of the hospital it was time let me get this straight ben asked his voice raspy and not as strong as it had been if i kill you i can just go free thats it vincent said perhaps a little irritated get away and youre free kill me and youre free get shot you lose has anyone in this little game of yours ever gotten away what do you think then ill just have to be the first you have a minute asshole sixty seconds and thwack my eyes will be closed but my ears wont go any way you want i owe you big time for cincinnati so im only going to wound you with the first shot and maybe the second one too now that i think about it say when ben said when when just like that bens life was on the clock several precious seconds had passed before he moved the brush to his right seemed slightly thinner than to the left so he plunged in that way not trying for stealth but rather to stay on his feet and put at least a little distance between him and the man who was about to kill him fortyfive seconds the voice seemed inches away ben slapped aside branches and pulled himself ahead using the trunks of trees the initial pitch was mainly downhill but the terrain was rocky and uneven if there was any path or track that could at least partially mask his progress he didnt see it several large boulders announced the beginning of an uphill push he should have gone the other way he thought in his condition uphill was an enemy oh hell what difference did it make this wasnt a matter of life and death it was a matter only of death only of when he was in his last seconds on earth his life which had once held so much promise was about to end painfully and suddenly thoughts of what he had missed of what had never happened were shooting through his mind thirty seconds vincents voice seemed marginally farther away the hill much steeper now would have been no problem for him if he hadnt been so battered as it was the dizziness and nausea were intensifying maybe he should hide find a place of dense growth and try to burrow in and wait his killer out until dark ridiculous for one thing he hadnt put that much ground between them for another branches were breaking with every step and finally he realized where he was the undergrowth had fallen away if he continued standing vincent would have a straight shot from many yards away at that moment ben stumbled and pitched forward slamming heavily into a massive granite rock face that was four or five feet taller than he was the rising ground around the monolith made ben think he could at least make it up to the top then what the best he could think of was throwing himself down onto the killer and trying for one of the arrows the best of no options fifteen seconds ben wondered how far he had gone a hundred yards probably much less on his hands and knees he forced himself uphill and around the huge boulder he was lightheaded and gasping for air but inch by inch he moved ahead all right asshole vincent called out time to die ben flattened himself near the top of the rock he was probably at such an angle from the ground that he couldnt be seen but he still felt exposed he held his breath and listened there was only the machine thrum of thousands of insects he glanced about there were some tall trees maybe mahogany or eucalyptus and thick undergrowth extending six or seven feet off the ground but his chance to run was gone his only hope was to stay out of sight and pray that vincent passed directly beneath him or that somehow he had started off in the opposite direction again ben held his breath this time he heard something a rustling of the brush not far to his left vincent was close very close ben turned his head but did not lift it instead he pressed his cheek against the granite and peered in the direction of the noise the underbrush was definitely moving and the moving force was headed in his direction if vincent circled the rock to the uphill side that was it hunt over ben knew he should have kept running his only chance now and not much of one at that was to wait until it seemed the killer was right beneath him then hurl himself down the noise of cracking twigs and shifting brush was even closer now just to the left of where ben lay staying flat he shifted his weight as best he could at the movement from above vincent would be swinging his bow upward trying to get off a quick shot ben would avoid the arrowhead fall on him and quickly go for the quiver quietlistenlookdont breathedont breathehail mary full of grace the lord is with theeandnow ben pushed to his knees prepared to leap but vincent wasnt beneath him instead an emaciated feral dog tan with white legs and a long narrow snout was sniffing its way through the bushes ben felt a surge of hope maybe vincent had gone the other way after all maybe there was still time to run at that moment he was shot from behind the arrow slammed through the muscle at the base of his neck glancing off his collarbone before exiting with the arrowhead and four inches of shaft exposed just below his jaw stunned by the impact and the shocking pain ben pitched to his right fell heavily onto the surface of the huge rock and then toppled off he landed on his side air exploding from his lungs through the corner of his eye he could see the point of the arrow and the part of the shaft that was protruding from his body holy mary mother of god mother of god pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death but in that minute death did not come nor in the next ben lay motionless beyond feeling pain tasting the coarse dirt of the rain forest floor the surrounding greens and browns a blur finally there was movement from behind him to the edge of his field of vision that was for cincinnati vincent said this one is for all the smartasses in the world who think theyre putting something over on the rest of us in a final moment of absolute clarity bens vision sharpened and he saw the camouflagepainted apparition fifteen yards away grinning as he raised his bow and drew back suddenly vincent jerked his head back and swatted at his cheek as if he had been bitten by a gigantic insect what the they were the killers last words from somewhere in the forest a long thin blade flashed from the trees and pierced his neck through and through blood from a severed artery was spewing from the wound before he even began to fall widened eyes a muffled cry and a graceless pirouette and the behemoth slumped to the ground dead before he even hit ben not being able to completely comprehend what had happened felt blackness closing in at the last moment before total darkness he felt a light touch on his shoulder and heard a voice a soft reassuring womans voice its going to be all right she said chapter our guardians as far as men can be should be true worshipers of the gods and like them plato the republic book ii dr anson please come quickly its

although he was beyond speech rennie you are a good and kind man it will go well for you in the life after this one you have fought your illness bravely are you afraid now ono shook his head may i read to you rennie may i read to you may i read you through the passage good anson opened a wellworn looseleaf notebook his notebook it was filled with drawings short essays diary entries and poems and he added to it in some way nearly every day there was no title to what he was about to read only the words carefully printed on a sheet that was whiter than the others the world can be hard full of trickery full of deceit full of injustice full of pain but there is an emptiness waiting my friend a great glowing emptiness soft and fragrant with the essence of peace the essence of serenity you are almost there my friend the magnificent emptiness is the eternal harbor for your soul take my hand friend take my hand and take a step just one more step and you are there anson felt rennie onos grip go slack the faint rise and fall of the sheet over his chest vanished for several minutes they remained silent and motionless nurse doctor patient finally anson stood bent low and gently kissed the mans forehead then without a word he left the room it was nearing dawn the most cherished time of ansons day from the moment in amritsar when he had realized the deception of the surgeon khanduri and the woman claiming to be narendra narjot along with the tacit participation of his dearest friend elizabeth he had been sad and perplexed sleeping little he had thrown himself as never before into his work and into caring for the patients in the clinic and hospital all the while he waited for understanding of what his response should be now after several conversations with the nurse claudine who had been let go by elizabeth he was ready when anson reached the lab his friend francis ngale was waiting just outside dr joe the laboratory is prepared the huge security guard said dr st pierre has just arrived at the hospital good did rennie pass on he did peacefully very peacefully francis thank you dr joe he was quite a good man now we have business to attend to might i have the remote control ngale handed over a small rectangular box tested and retested he said i hope you dont have to use it if i do i do the chair is in place it is you are a good friend francis you have always been so the two men embraced briefly and then anson sent ngale back to the hospital a minute later the man reappeared leading elizabeth into the room she was wearing a loose filmy white cotton skirt and matching blouse not even her expression of bewilderment and concern could mask her enduring beauty anson motioned her to the chair and stood in front of her sometimes pacing like a barrister sometimes standing quite still and erect well she said in english summoning me here at four oclock in the morning is certainly a first yes anson replied it is as you know prior to your arranging our trip to india to visit the widow of my benefactor i made you a promise that i would share the final secrets of my research on sarahnine with the scientists from whitestone that is correct her bewildered expression intensified why would he be retelling something she knew so well all you are missing is the identification of which of the ten strains of yeast in our vats we are actually using and also one step in the process of stimulating the yeast to actually produce the drug yes well i have decided to renege on my part of the bargain but you have been deceitful elizabeth you built our friendship and then abused it anson had always been an extremely peaceful man but his temper once triggered could be intense he cautioned himself against going off at this moment not with the remote in his pocket i dont know what youre talking about st pierre tried anson rattled off a few sentences in hindi i assume you recognize the language even if it is one of the few you do not speak i am reasonably fluent in it at least fluent enough to identify that ridiculous charade in amritsar i dont understand she tried again of course you do upon our return hoping against hope that i had somehow misread the whole dreadful scenario i contacted a journalist friend in new delhi there is no evidence that a t j narjot ever existed nor that there was ever an outbreak of serratia in the hospitals of amritsar wait st pierre pleaded now clearly beginning to panic theres more anson said ever since my operation and recovery ive been mystified by the convenience of my respiratory arrest here in the hospital i called the nurse claudine who was here that day at first she tried to protect you or rather her future as a nurse which you threatened but ultimately her allegiance to me won out and what do you suppose i learned i learned that my dear friend elizabeth my dear old friend nearly killed me out of her own selfinterest that was done for your own good joseph you needed the transplant you mean you needed me to have the transplant my work wasnt going fast enough for you or was it that you were fearful i would die before your damn scientists had picked my brain clean now joseph that isnt fair whitestone built this hospital we built these labs anson withdrew the remote from his pocket you know my friend francis yes he asked motioning to ngale of course francis is something of an expert in demolition at my request he has wired this entire research wing with explosives elizabeth you have exactly fifteen minutes to satisfy me you are telling the truth or this lab is going up in smoke wait no you cant do this fifteen minutes and all this will be rubble including those precious vats of yeast and my notebooks which are piled right over there in the corner joseph you dont understand it is not my place to tell you anything ii need to make some calls i need to get permission to share some things with you my life is in danger if i dont ii need more time anson theatrically checked his watch fourteen minutes st pierre looked frantically about as if searching for a rescuer i need to make a call as long as it takes less than fourteen minutes st pierre raced off shall i go with her ngale asked her only option is to tell us the truth the people who employ her are smart very smart they will see that in just a few minutes st pierre was back all right all right she said breathless ive been authorized to tell you certain facts but no names is that acceptable you are the liar elizabeth you are the deceiver i will make no promises all right then sit down and listen anson nodded to ngale who brought over a chair and then with one final look at his friend excused himself from the room proceed anson said just remember though if i feel you are lying i will not give you a second chance he held up the remote for emphasis st pierre straightened herself and met his gaze defiantly a number of years ago she began maybe fifteen a small group of transplant specialists medical and surgical began getting together at international transplant meetings to discuss the awesome pressures of our specialty and our dissatisfaction and frustration with the system of organ donation and allocation go on around the globe restrictive legislation was essentially removing us the internal medicine specialists and surgeons responsible for organ transplants from the loop of decision making surgeons began lying about the severity of their patients conditions to push them farther up certain lists in addition public apathy and a lack of involvement by organized religion have deprived societies of a reasonable supply of organs and finally perhaps most frustrating of all again and again people whose selfdestructive behaviors smoking drinking eating poorly have caused them to need a transplant slide back into their selfdestructive ways and literally destroy the organ that could have saved the life of a more responsible more deserving candidate were you part of this group not initially i was invited to join the guardians about eleven years ago the guardians as you can imagine the discussions the initial group of transplant doctors had were deeply philosophical in this group were some of the greatest minds in medicine facing some of the greatest ethical dilemmas and also possessing some of the greatest egos ive been told these men and women especially the transplant surgeons are burdened with incalculable responsibility the guardians gradually in search of a philosophical center the group began focusing more and more on the writings of plato particularly the republic his philosophy and logic made sense to everyone meeting by meeting through readings and discussion the basis for a highly secret society was formed dr khanduri is a guardian i said no names damn it is he anson snapped yes of course of course he is why do you ask because he spoke about his disagreement with the sikhs over their rejection of the caste system plato as i recall divided society into three castes he didnt use that word but yes the producers laborers farmers and the like are the lowest of the three the auxiliaries soldiers managers and secondary leaders are next and at the apex of the pyramid the guardians anson filled in the elite st pierre nodded proudly intellectually athletically artistically creatively altruistically scientifically and politically think of what would have happened if einstein or nelson mandela or raymond damidian who invented the mri scanner oror mother teresa needed an organ to survive and they were mired down in some list or bureaucratic red tape oror there were simply no suitable organs available think of yourself joseph and all that you are about to bring to mankind because we were able to procure a lung for you and not just any lung a perfectly matched lung as transplant specialists it is the goal of the guardians of the republic to see to it that other guardians around the world who need organs of any kind are supplied them st pierres zeal and intensity were chilling anson could barely breathe the word procure cut through him like a knife for the first time he began considering the possibility that the source of his new life might not have been someone legally dead from where he managed hoarsely pardon where from where do these organs come why from the producers and the auxiliaries of course st pierre said certainly not from other guardians that wouldnt make any sense it is against our policies anson stared at the woman he thought he had known well for eight years his utter disbelief was directed not merely at what st pierre was saying but even more at her absolute comfort in saying it how many guardians are there now he asked not so many she replied maybe twentyfive maybe thirty now we are very selective and as you might suspect very careful as well only the best of the best of course he muttered only the best of the best he held up the remote elizabeth i promise you that if you make one effort to move from that chair without answering my questions i will press this button and you will die along with this lab but you will die as well my priorities are straight now tell me about procuring this perfect match st pierre fidgeted uncomfortably and looked around as if expecting a knighterrant to ride in and save her well she said finally her composure now only marginal if a guardian is to receive an organ it must be a perfect or nearperfect match otherwise there would be emotional trauma and medical issues around the high doses of toxic antirejection drugs they would have to take look at you joseph you are barely on any medications at all after your operation you were back at your critical work in almost no time i would imagine many of the guardians who receive organs can pay for them and they do such monies are used to forward the work of the society through the whitestone foundation we are the whitestone foundation yes we perform philanthropic works all over the world on behalf of artists healers politicians and scientists like yourself we own whitestone laboratories whitestone pharmaceuticals and soon if you are a man of your word sarahnine as well dont you dare talk to me about being a man of my word that entire trip to india was a fraud a total charade that was because you wouldnt let up in your insistence to meet the family of your donor and the council of the guardians of the republic felt that for the time being at least that was neither practical nor desirable my operation wasnt performed in india ive cooperated with you in every way joseph now will you please put that thing down where was my surgery done he brandished the remote for emphasis no lies brazil it was done at a whitestone facility in brazil you were kept sedated and then transferred from there to a guardian surgeon in capetown as soon as it was safe anson took a deep cleansing breath okay now tell me elizabeth who was he pardon the donor who was he and where was he from again st pierre cast about fruitlessly for someone to intervene her jaws were clenched in frustration actually she said finally it was a woman a woman from boston in the states her name i told you no goddamn it elizabeth anson bellowed give me her name or be prepared to die on this spot i mean it and you know i mean it its reyes natalie reyes okay now step by step you are going to tell me everything you know about this natalie reyes and how she came to be chosen to give me her lung chapter when a man thinks himself to be near death fears and cares enter into his mind which he never had before plato the republic book i ben reentered consciousness to a pungent though not unpleasant aroma and a womans voice softly singing in a tongue he didnt understand the arrow was gone the agonizing pain in his shoulder and the racking ache throughout his body were present but strangely muted it was not the first time he had awakened he recognized not the first time he had heard the woman singing he was naked from the waist up on his back on a pile of blankets and rags in what seemed to be a cave sunlight was pouring in through the entrance ten feet or so away gradually his vision came into focus along with his memory beginning with the moment of vincents gruesome death some sort of dart to the side of his face then a knife through his neck the lethal arrow ben had expected was never fired instead what he remembered was a woman kneeling beside him speaking english and reassuring him that he was going to be all right smooth tanned skin dark vibrant concerned eyes along with a man wearing an eye patch she had gotten him to his feet and struggled to get him to walk the rest was a blur except for her face it was a lovely intense interesting face steeled against the pain he tried to sit the woman singing nearby more ageless than aged made no attempt to stop him she was a tribal native her face though deeply lined had features not unlike the man who had helped vincent torture him behind her ben saw the source of the scent that was filling the cave a pot boiling on a small fire emitting wisps of gray smoke he managed to get upright and remain that way for a few seconds be fore a wave of dizziness forced him back the woman caught him with one hand and lowered him down then she eased a small ladle between his lips and held his head as he drank the thick aromatic liquid that was there in just minutes the pain was completely gone replaced by a cascade of remarkably pleasant thoughts and images soon after as she was replacing the dried poultice on his shoulder with a moist one the light from the cave opening began to dim the tumbling images slowed then faded minutes or hours later when his consciousness returned the woman from the forest was kneeling beside him her face made him smile hi she said my name is natalie reyes do you understand me good heres some water you must drink ben nodded and took cautious sips from an earthen cup behind natalie the other woman worked away at her fire and pot ben he managed after his lips were moist enough ben callahan from chicago are you brazilian american im a medical student from boston thank you for saving me my friend luis did the saving not me the people who run the hospital murdered his sister for trying to help me friends of his down there told him you were being tortured we were watching from right out there when that man with the bow followed you out of the hospital and down the road luis knew what was about to happen and he decided to save you im glad he did ben understated i never thought easy natalie said theres time ben again forced himself upright this time the dizziness was minimal his shoulder was carefully wrapped in gauze that looked as if it might have been used before as his thoughts cleared his expression darkened no there isnt much time he said excitedly theres a woman in the hospital her names sandy shes going to be killed operated on and then killed i think they are going to take her heart they natalie calmed him with a gentle finger to his lips you are very dry and dehydrated she said you need water if we cant get enough fluids in you you wont be able to help anyone that woman behind you shes giving me some sort of incredible drug shes a shaman and a friend of luiss her name is tokima something like that she speaks a mix of portuguese which i understand fairly well and some kind of tribal dialect that i dont understand at all but luis does well ask luis to see if she wants a permanent job making me feel like this the color just left your face ben callahan thats your blood pressure dropping off the table in a few more seconds you are going to start feeling rotten very rotten i think youd better lie down you can predict whats going to happen natalie checked his pulse which was rapid and weak your cardiovascular system is under stress you need rest and lots of fluids and some more of that medicine he said just before he drifted off ben awoke twice more each time natalie reyes was nearby looking down at him with deep concern and caring i saw you on the rock down there when that monster was hunting you she said at one point you were so weak and you were so brave now that i know what brought you here i think youre even braver she gave him water and the medicine woman tokima treated him with some of her mixtures each time he felt stronger and sat up longer piece by piece they were able to share the accounts of how they came to be in dom angelo when ben opened his eyes for the third time natalie was still there as before but crouching next to her was the man who had saved his life luis ben said rolling to one side and extending his hand ben luis said his grip incredibly strong luis doesnt speak english natalie said but hes kind enough to speak portuguese slowly so i can translate what needs to be translated tell him im sorry about his sister ben said youre a very sweet man to think of that natalie replied brave and sweet i like that combination she had a brief conversation with luis who met bens gaze and nodded ben saw the intensity of a warrior in the mans good eye the woman you are worried about natalie said is still unconscious in the hospital and on a breathing machine shes drugged ben replied she was kidnapped and now shes drugged back in texas she was screaming about her child she yelled that she was being kept in a cage then someone probably vincent shut her up he sat up with no assistance is there anything we can do he asked tell us exactly who came in with you on the airplane three in the cockpit four in the cabin now three thanks to luis one of those is was vincents girlfriend there were also two aft with the patient one of them is an older woman i think she may be an anesthesiologist natalie translated for luis and got some information in return at the hospital we have barbosa hes a crooked policeman santoro hes a crooked doctor vincents assistant whom apparently you met plus a few kitchen housekeeping and janitorial people long odds ben said theyre going to get longer another group the nurses from rio and those others surrounding the recipient of that poor womans heart are due very soon somehow weve got to get her out ben said what do you mean we natalie asked you are in no shape for battle im going to do what i can ive come too far not to here give me a hand ben reached out and was effortlessly pulled to his feet by luis for a few seconds the cave reeled but he braced himself against one wall and remained upright sweet brave and tough natalie said nice okay weve got the two of us plus luis his girlfriend rosa and one other guy from the village that luis says we can count on how good are you at war strategy i got an a in it in college do i have time to get my notes luis natalie said gesturing to ben i think we are five luis did not reply instead he crossed over to where tokima was working and spoke with her she nodded took a small plastic pail and headed off into the forest tokima has been healing people for many years he said perhaps eighty natalie translated for ben who merely grinned nodded and commented that although she had already worked a miracle for him he hoped the medicine woman could give him something longacting for the hours ahead does she know my insurance probably wont cover this treatment he asked natalie translated for luis who actually smiled then the two of them spoke for some time before she turned to ben as you probably know there are many many psychoactive drugs in the plants out there she said tokima has gone out to get the strongest of them all a root luis only knows the indian name for it which is something like khosage dried ground and smoked it is a very powerful hallucinogen but taken in excess there is little time to enjoy the more pleasant and interesting effects violent vomiting and diarrhea along with severe abdominal pain disorientation and even death will soon intervene assuming tokima can find enough of the root luis thinks he can either get it into the food that is being prepared for lunch or have one of the kitchen help do it for him with any luck some of the people at the hospital with guns can be disabled as well as those who are scheduled to assist with the surgery sounds like a plan ben said what about sandy assuming you can make it you and i will cut through the forest to where i have left the mercedes of the policeman i killed then well drive around to the access road and down to the hospital by the time we arrive there should be absolute chaos somehow then weve got to wheel sandy out and get her into the car luis and his people will then just have to melt into the forest hes ready to do that he loved his sister very much ben patted the man on the arm then unwilling to have either of the others know that his lightheadedness was returning and that both knees and his lower back were throbbing he took a mug of water shuffled out to the granite shelf in front of the cave and sat his back against the rock be low him and to the south sparkling in the latemorning sun was the hospital hospital ben laughed ruefully aside from nazi germany the word had probably never been more inappropriately used the brutality of what had been done to him there and to so many others made him shudder now hopefully it was going to end were coming he thought savagely were coming a short while later tokima returned her red plastic pail filled to overflowing with thick gnarled rustcolored roots glistening from having just been washed with hardly a word she set about preparing the poison luis moving like the predator he was headed down the hillside natalie moved outside the cave settled down next to ben and took his hand a private eye huh she said do you own a gun of course ever had to use it of course boot hill in chicago is full of the men ive put there women children and pets too he shot the hospital with his finger and blew the smoke from the barrel absolutely terrifying she said gently folding his finger back in place they dont stand a chance do you think we do of course were both sort of living on borrowed time anyway in another fifteen minutes unheard and unseen luis suddenly appeared at the side of the cave opening people are nervous about the disappearance of vincent he said it is being assumed that ben killed him i am supposed to be out looking for his body right now he went into the cave and returned with a heavy clay bowl containing the root preparation covered with leaves you ready ben callahan natalie asked helping him to his feet ben clenched his fists and willed the dizziness to lessen ready he managed the kitchen staff is preparing lunch luis said allowing time for natalie to share the information with ben i need to get the final ingredient down to them the doctors are in with their patient awaiting the arrival of the one who is to receive her heart the flight crew is sunning by the pool santoro is everywhere preparing for two operations barbosa and the other guards are ready for trouble the time is now the time is now natalie repeated come luis said i will point you in the direction of your car plan on being outside the hospital with it in one hour with any fortune we will be bringing your patient out to you for a ride chapter here is no paththe wood is dark and perplexing still we must push on plato the republic book iv the trek through dense forest to the mercedes was a bear the heat and humidity were intense and the journey was uphill nearly all the way using the sun as a marker natalie and ben gave the town a wide berth and continued to head due north she was convinced that if they just stayed true to that direction they had to hit the dom angelo road at some point then a turn to the right and she was certain she could find the deadend path where she had hidden vargass car she and luis had allowed an hour and a half for him to get the toxic hallucinogen into whatever was being served for lunch and then to get it disbursed throughout the hospital and for her and ben to retrieve the mercedes and drive it around to the rear entrance it was as ben had said a plan but it was a shaky one with timing tight and the hospital on red alert because of vincents disappearance the chances for things to go wrong were many natalie had only a rough idea how far away the road actually was or how difficult the terrain so she pushed ahead more aggressively than she would have liked now after half an hour the altitude and steady upward climb were taking their toll on her compromised stamina but she could see that ben though he was keeping up and refused to ask any quarter was having an even tougher time lets take a break she said breathing heavily as she handed him the canteen you holding up im managing it shouldnt be too much longer now she didnt bother to ask him the same question he would say he was doing fine but natalie knew he wasnt the pallor had returned to the area around his lips and he had a disturbing glaze over his eyes it was inconceivable to her what he must have endured before being set off into the forest to be hunted down there were nasty electrical burns speckled over much of his body his fingers were swollen and discolored and both the entry and exit wounds on his shoulder despite tokimos poultices were showing early signs of infection she wondered how he could possibly hold up much longer fortunately she reminded herself all they had to do was make it to the car from then on he would be a passenger ready she asked lead on i can do this have a little more water if you say so although i have the feeling that all this water ive been drinking isnt exactly from a crystal springs bottling plant dr banks my doc back in chicago will have a field day trying to diagnose all the injuries parasites and other diseases im going to bring home from this trip you better hurry up and finish med school so you can help him take care of me no problem like many women im cursed with the need to take in wounded broken men and fix them up they stopped once more for rest and water and just as natalie was questioning whether or not they might have drifted off course they hit what she felt certain was the dom angelo road ben was dragging badly now and no longer able to disguise his weakness still as long as they found the mercedes without difficulty they were doing reasonably well for time hang on ben callahan she urged were almost there a righthand turn toward what she hoped was the town and five more minutes of walking and she found the overgrown cutoff ben was so far behind that at some points after rounding a bend she lost sight of him completely she waited until he caught up and then led him to the car the moment she saw the branches she had used as camouflage lying on the ground she knew there was trouble rodrigo vargass mercedes was right where she had left it but it was not going to be driven not now and probably not ever all four tires were slashed and flat the hood had been pried open and much of the engine destroyed the drivers side window had been smashed as deflated as the tires natalie checked beneath the drivers seat for the extra ammunition she had left there gone trouble in paradise ben said bracing himself on the trunk this damage seems too total and meticulously done to be senseless vandalism i was thinking the same thing natalie replied checking her watch ben i can make it down to the hospital but i dont think you can i dont know i think please you look as if youre about to fall over either wait here with the water or try and make it into town i told you about father francisco you can find him there tell him whats happening and what happened to you hell take care of you im sure of it maybe hell even have access to a car to drive you down to the hospital but ben please luis is risking everything to help us i need to get down there its mostly downhill and i can take the road im a runner i can do this ookay keep the water i wont need it dont you forget to come and get me he said okay ill add it to my todo list get ben see you soon my friend promise give my best to father francisco she kissed him on the cheek whirled and for the first time since the fire in dorchester massachusetts five thousand miles and several lifetimes away she ran in her biggest challenges on the track natalie never pushed her body any harder than over the next twenty minutes she was running on a single damaged lung carrying a backpack containing vargass heavy pistol duct tape rope and a swiss army knife the downhill slope put a heavy strain on her ankles and knees as well as on her balance the more winded she got the more out of control her balance became twice she stumbled once she fell scraping skin off her palms her chest was on fire at no time could she get in enough air she slowed then slowed some more still she drove herself finally unable to get a decent breath she stopped clinging to a tree trunk gasping thirty seconds and she was off again lurching down the steep grade like a drunk after one more brief stop fighting for air and trying to ignore the explosive pounding of her heart natalie found herself on level ground a long right bend in the road and she was in front of the same hospital entrance where just a day before ben had been shoved out to meet what seemed a certain death hands on knees she allowed her breathing to deepen until finally one sweet breath fought its way to the depths of her lung glancing around she withdrew the gun from her backpack and began warily to circle the residence quarters retracing roughly the route she had used to escape after her last visit she stayed in the trees and gave the far end of the wing a wide berth as she neared the broad patio and the swimming pool she could tell almost instantly that luis had succeeded in at least one phase of his mission three men were around the pool all of them in swimsuits all of them giggling on the tables near them were bowls of some sort of stew so then she brings the tray out filled with like a ham and pork sampler trips and flips the whole frigging thing onto the rabbis lap the teller of the tale a redhead in his late twenties burst into uncontrollable laughter at his own humor sloshing his drink onto his lap and making no attempt to blot it up the flight crew natalie quickly deduced one of the men more maturelooking than the other two and probably the captain was on his hands and knees violently vomiting into a low bush while simultaneously continuing to laugh i dont feel so good the third man kept saying over and over again i dont feel so good there was no way natalie could make it to the storage shed and the passage to the hospital without being seen by the trio she lowered her backpack to the ground then leveled her longbarreled revolver at the redhead okay on your bellies she snapped all of you the men including the captain glanced up at her pointed and howled natalie gave brief consideration to simply shooting each one of them in the leg but knew she wasnt capable of it unless there were no other options instead she moved quickly to the redhead and whipped him across the back of the head with the muzzle instantly opening an inchandahalf gash the man cried out as he fell facedown onto the concrete but then he began laughing again mumbling jeez whyd you do that natalie stared from one of the men to the others wondering what her next move should be did they have weapons in their rooms how long could she count on tokimas preparation lasting there was no way luis could control the amount of drug they each ingested were they all going to die from it while she stood contemplating the man who wasnt feeling well rolled from his chaise and retched into the pool natalie had decided it was safe to leave them where they were when a woman wearing olive military fatigues burst from the shed her semiautomatic machine gun ready she was five feet at the most with a pleasant russet face and broad hips quickly she took in the scene you are natalie she asked in coarse portuguese rosa luiss girlfriend smiled and nodded we must tie them up she said gesturing toward the rope and tape luis says everyone gets tied up the two of them with no fear of resistance from the men quickly bound their ankles and taped their wrists behind their backs the patio and pool were now awash with whatever had been inside their stomachs the women wiped their hands on elegant beach towels and hurried to the shed and down into the tunnel in the dining room they found the kitchen help in one corner bound and gagged in a way similar to the flight crew trussed up not far from the brazilians her glare threatening to burn a hole in natalies chest was a narrow waisted white woman with short dirty blond hair and a barbedwire tattoo around her arm natalie gestured toward her silently asking who she was but rosa could only shrug it could be worse natalie wanted to say to the furious woman you could have eaten lunch do you know where luis is natalie asked as they moved cautiously guns drawn from the dining room and past the lounge where she had hidden behind the couch so close to santoro and barbosa he has been here rosa whispered risking a peek around the doorway of the first recovery room and then gesturing inside natalie flattened against the wall across from rosa and looked inside the room there on the floor wideeyed and trussed up in a manner that would have challenged houdini were a husky man and a silverhaired woman in scrubs they were in obvious distress due in large measure to the vomiting they were doing through their noses and around the duct tape pasted across their mouths on the hospital bed beside them blissfully unconscious and breathing with the help of a stateoftheart ventilator was a pretty redhaired woman sandy i think we should leave her be like this for now natalie said do you agree rosa nodded and started down the hallway natalie anxious to get clear of the fetid air in the room made some minor adjustments on the ventilator and followed three from the kitchen three from the plane the woman who was probably vincents girlfriend and the two medical people nine accounted for but none of them a major source of danger those people were still out there someplace natalie caught up with rosa by the main entrance the corridor leading down to dr donald chos macabre treatment room was empty the fact that the master of virtual reality and psychopharmacology had not been brought in for this case spoke frighteningly of sandys fate there would be no need for a dvd brainwashing her into believing a bogus reason for her surgery rosa stood beside the heavy glass double doors put a finger to her lips and motioned outside there facedown on the ground was a redskinned man in fatigues similar to rosas there was no blood about and no obvious wound but if he wasnt dead he was doing a praiseworthy imitation salazar bevelaqua rosa whispered he beats his wife luis never liked him you dont have to remind me to stay on luiss good side natalie replied the odds were growing shorter as near as natalie could count it was rosa and she plus luis and one ally of his four against them were santoro barbosa and two remaining security men from the plane suddenly the still afternoon air was pierced by volleys of gunfire a man screamed out in pain then just as abruptly as it had begun the gun battle ended from off to the right they heard moaning and a man swearing over and over again in english handgun ready natalie followed rosa in that direction at the edge of the building sprawled on his back peppered with bullets was the man from dom angelo rosa hurried to him cradled his head in her hand then quickly turned to natalie and shook her head grimly nearby writhing on the ground clutching his abdomen his white turtleneck jersey saturated with blood was another man one of the security guards from the plane natalie reasoned oh god goddamn it he kept moaning oh please help me without a flicker of hesitation rosa stood and from five feet shot the man in the forehead natalie was no longer amazed at her own detachment and lack of emotion the world of whitestone laboratories was a world of big money of violence and of death she had been unwillingly drawn into it and now she had adjusted sharing their unspoken concern for where luis might be and if he had been hurt the two women inched their way back into the hospital and turned toward the portion of the main corridor that ended in chos laboratory natalie stopped in front of the closed door to santoros office and tried the knob she was surprised to find it wasnt locked and had taken a single step into the room when the door was viciously slammed and barbosas powerful forearm slipped over her shoulder and tightened around her throat he was nearly a full head taller than she was with a bulging rockhard belly that pressed into her back the hair on his arm was like sandpaper against her skin drop it he hissed drop the gun gagging from the pressure across her trachea and larynx natalie immediately complied barbosa opened the door slowly and using her as a shield moved into the hallway and called out drop it rosa drop it now or i will break her neck and kill you at the same timeyou know i can do it and you know i will good now get on the ground facedown quickly her lips drawn back in the snarl of a tiger rosa slowly did as the policeman insisted at the instant she was prone the outside door flew open and luis lurched through he was a disheveled apparition wounded at least twice once in the left shoulder and once in the chest on the right side blood probably his and others was smeared across his face and the legs of his khakis his right hand clutching a pistol dangled impotently at his side natalie sensed barbosa smiling so traitor he said keeping his forearm tightly in place it is over for you drop the gun and lie down next to your woman and i will have one of our surgeons see if they can save your life that would be very kind of you oscar luis said i know i can trust you to keep your word the warriors arm snapped up like a striking cobra so fast that natalie barely understood what was happening until it was over orange fire spit from the muzzle of his gun at the same instant barbosas grip across her throat vanished she dropped to one knee and whirled in time to see the policeman stumbling backward his hand blood oozing from beneath it was pressed over where his right eye had been his vast bulk slammed heavily against the wall by santoros office door then slid to the floor macabrely held in a seated position by his massive girth i told you i was good at killing luis rasped before collapsing chapter wealth and poverty the one is the parent of luxury and indolence and the other of meanness and viciousness and both of discontent plato the republic book iv for a time ben sat there on the ground leaning back against the cedes sipping the last of what little water remained in the canteen he felt feverish and weak his shoulder was throbbing and a pounding headache was evolving directly behind his eyes natalie had been right to leave him he should have suggested doing so himself now here he was he wondered what alice gustafsons reaction would be to his predicament she had risked her life a number of times to expose those trafficking in illegal organs so maybe she wouldnt think much of his putting his survival on the line when he drove through that gate to the whitestone compound back in texas but then again she probably would thanks to whoever had vandalized the car the plan he natalie and luis had settled on had come apart almost before it had begun it still seemed possible that luis could get tokimas drug into the food at the hospital it seemed possible that the guards and professional killers who were defending the place could be overcome it seemed possible that natalie could make it to the hospital in time to help and that she could somehow get sandy off the respirator into someones car and back up the hill to whisk him away it all seemed possible but not very likely ben pulled himself up and battled back the resultant dizziness and nausea he had come too far merely to sit here and wait natalie had said that he might be of help ihe could reach the village and contact the priest there if he tried and instead ended up moldering on the roadside at least he would have died knowing he had gone for it at least he would have made his return to the earth having cared as he pushed a step away from the car his hand brushed across his pocket and the small revolver luis had given him he had actually forgotten that it was there it was a a snubnosed saturday night special not unlike the gun still in the wheel well of seth stepanskis chrysler back in fadiman he took several more steps then forced himself up straight and marched back to the road the two classy women in his life alice and now natalie would be proud of his grit so would sandy if she ever knew it was strange to think of her lying there medicated to unconsciousness in the hospital while so much turmoil swirled about and all of it involving her he turned away from the direction where he and natalie had come and headed toward the town one step then another head up shoulders back he tried to ignore the pain racking his body keep goingkeep going father forgive us for what we must do you forgive us well forgive you holy mary mother of god well forgive each other till we both turn blue pray for us sinners the afternoon sun was intense now and because of the hour the rain forest road offered little shade first john prine then the hail mary then john againline by line verse by verse ben kept walking stumbling from time to time but never falling he might have walked a mile or just a few hundred yards he couldnt tell and it really didnt matter the water was gone and his hope of making it anyplace was dwindling his head was down now watching his boots inch forward one painful step after another then a slight downward change in the road caused him to lift his head and there below him was the town a postcard photo of lilliputian structures nestled in a lush valley he was nearly insane from the pain and the dizziness but he had made it his cracked lips pulled upward into a raw defiant smile he was still dragging more than walking when he reached the actual outskirts of the village curious eyes followed him as he made his way toward the center of town agua porfavor he said to an old woman using his feeble spanish and hoping it bore some similarity to portuguese idonde estd padre frankapadre francisco the wizened woman offered no water but did gesture up the street to a quaint chapel down several of the streets ben saw vehicles of one kind or another if anyone could borrow or rent or even commandeer one of them it would have to be the village priest what shade there had been on the road was gone now and heat radiated like a kiln from the hardbaked clay he shuffled forward but sensed that he might crumple at any moment the surroundings grew dim and as he approached the church he felt his legs beginning to go hail mary full of grace the lord bit by bit life came back into focus bens first major reconnection to the world was that he was on a bed clean linens a pillow no two of them the aroma of brewing coffee helped nudge his consciousness along so a mans voice said in english my american patient awaketh how do you know ben asked you have been somewhat delirious for nearly half an hour what you said made absolutely no sense but being from brooklyn i know american when i hear it frank nunes father frank if you wish padre francisco if you want to sound more exotic you took some water two glasses just a little while ago would you like some more coffee bens awareness returned with force he pushed himself up and swung his feet over the bed mindless of the cannon blasts between his eyes listen please father i just came from natalie reyes she said she ah the missing vagabond i helped her to a campsite and then when i went to look in on her the next morning she was gone shes at the hospital ben said breathlessly theres trouble there big trouble i need your help my help theres a woman whos been flown in i was on the plane if we dont get down there with a car she will die no not just die she will be murdered ive got to get a car and ive got to get down there right away is senhorita reyes all right i dont know father she listen i really dont have time to explain this is an emergency natalie is in danger so are some people from the village here luis luis fernandes i never knew his last name but hes trying to help us us natalie reyes and please you must believe me people are going to die there maybe many people if you can just get us a car i can explain on the way maybe you can intervene maybe you can do something to he glanced over at the kitchen table across the room and noticed a set of car keys lying there father frank followed his gaze my car is not very dependable he said ben was beginning to feel exasperated lets at least try it he begged ormaybe one of the other ones in the village surely you im sorry ben stood up okay if you cant help me ill find someone who can sit down frank said sharply no i need your car ben reached for his revolver but his pocket was empty that little thirtyeight was dangerous the priest said the barrel was filthy no way to know for sure which way the bullet was going to go now a glock is a different story altogether he withdrew a glistening pistol from beneath his robe and flicked the barrel in bens general direction i polish this fortyfive every sunday right after mass parts of the rain forest can be quite wild and dangerous there are times even for a priest when the shield of god may not be enough protection youre no priest ben snapped furious and desperate enough to be mindless of the consequences of his action he dove at the man father frank parried his attack with little effort throwing ben back onto the bed easy the priest said i have no desire to hurt you as i am in fact a man of the cloth less pious than some i would grant you but far more pious than others i just happen to believe that there is no great dignity or holiness in being poor it is one of the few beliefs i do not hold in common with the good book the people who run that hospital see to it that our church remains solvent and that i remain as dignified as possible and all you have to do is keep these people in line that and to let the powers at the hospital know when nosy strangers driving cars that arent theirs come wandering into town with pristine boots pretending to be hiking the rain forest it was you who wrecked the car wasnt it i do what i am told mercedes dont hold up that well here in the rain forest anyhow so here we have a priest who carries a gun vandalizes cars preaches to people he considers too poor for dignity and supports himself and his church by taking money from murderers arent you something makes me really proud im a catholic xavier santoro is no murderer nor for that matter are any of the others associated with the hospital mr callahan socalled illicit organ traffic takes place all over the world money changes hands and kidneys and other organs change bodies what can be wrong with that one person benefits in one fashion the other benefits in another in fact in my opinion there is no reason for such exchanges to be illegal or to consider them immoral stunned ben stared at the priest trying to see whether or not the man believed what he had just said then he remembered saying almost the same thing to alice not that long ago frank he asked regaining some composure do you know who that woman natalie is or why shes here aside from the fact that shes searching for a relative and posing to be someone she is not no i know nothing about her put the gun down father im not going to try and leavethank you now i have just one more question for you and then ill do whatever you say and tell you anything you wish to know and what is that question mr callahan padre francisco do you know what really goes on at that hospital chapter in what manner does tyranny arise that it has a democratic origin is evident plato the republic book viii the dining room was like a mash unit rosa and natalie had moved the tables and chairs to one side and had dragged their captives to the area of the lounge where a makeshift enclosure of sofas easy chairs and dining tables turned on edge kept them all in view for the time being the jet crew had been left by the swimming pool but the rest of the hospital workers and what remained of the security staff were all present and accounted for luis though badly wounded had been able to direct natalie to the virtual reality laboratory at the end of the hall where she found xavier santoro and a guard from the plane dapper urbane santoro had been violently ill and now was cringing in one corner swatting at the products of his hallucinations still he was managing periods of lucidity during which he kept telling natalie that she was making a terrible mistake not far away from the surgeon was a strapping young man with his gun in his hand too disoriented even to function natalie relieved him of the pistol without a struggle and then helped him shuffle down the corridor to rosa before bringing a wheelchair back to transport santoro chucks surly girlfriend who initially seemed to be the only one unaffected by the stew had suddenly gotten sick and begun also to show other signs of toxicity luis and his medicine woman had done their jobs well in spite of their triumph natalie and rosa were grim luis stretched out on one of the sofas was in trouble natalie had tended to his wounds as best she could and had begun an iv infusion of saline to keep his sagging blood pressure from dropping to critical levels but there was no question he was bleeding internally possibly from a laceration to his liver the mission now was to stabilize him as quickly as possible wake sandy and get the two of them off to a hospital stopping along the way for ben natalie had seen two cars subcompacts parked by the rear of the hospital they might need them both to transport the five of them and they would need them quickly somewhere out there people were on their way at the very least nurses from rio one or more surgeons and a patient in need of sandys heart luis natalie said after getting a blood pressure reading in the low eighties for the time being i should move you into the room where there is a heart monitor the warrior shook his head and lifted the pistol he had tucked beneath him others are coming he said we must get away or we must be ready we have come this far luis we will make it but only so long as you are there to save our lives if we get in trouble again you are my hero and i have been so busy with everything i have not thanked you she turned to rosa pointed to her own lips and then gestured to luiss the woman grinned and nodded her permission thank you luis natalie whispered kissing him lightly on the cheek then the lips thank you for saving my life luis managed a weak grin it was nothing he said in dangerous situations like this there is often only one chance i had to take it the shot that finished barbosa was amazing you didnt even seem to aim i think i felt the wind of the bullet as it went past my head it was a lucky shot he replied if i had hit you i would have just pulled the trigger again he punctuated the remark with a wink leaving rosa to guard their prisoners natalie went in to wake up sandy in fact the morphine infusion had run dry and the woman already much more conscious was actually beginning to fight the ventilator sandy easy does it natalie urged softly stroking her forehead easy does it sandy squeeze my hand if you understand mecome on squeeze my handgood thats it thats it sandy my name is natalie im a medical student from boston and im here to help you everything is okay squeeze if you understand it took just a few minutes for sandy macfarlane to wake up enough to have the breathing tube removed she was hoarse disoriented and near hysteria muttering about her son in tennessee and also someone named rudy but to her credit she was able to listen to natalies explanations and gradually to cooperate enough to roll onto a stretcher natalie wheeled her to the dining room there was little change in those poisoned most of them were still trying to cope with the effects and side effects of the hallucinogen one of them the husky man in surgical scrubs either an anesthesiologist or possibly a surgical assistant was tucked on his side in a fetal position not moving and on closer examination not breathing exhausted and desperate to do something about transportation natalie was able to summon little more than a brief pang for the man she hurried over and knelt on one knee by santoro whose color was a ghastly graygreen santoro i need a car or a van what do you have i have nothing for you you are making a mistake a terrible mistake with no time to argue natalie forced the muzzle of vargass heavy pistol into the surgeons groin you might not remember me she said in english but i hope you do two months ago you and your friend dr cho helped steal one of my lungs you caused me great pain and ruined my life and i will have no problem at all in doing the same to you for emphasis she jammed the pistol in even harder im going to count to five if you havent told me where i can find the keys to at least two cars or a van im going to pull this trigger and blow whatever is there between your legs to bits and you know what ill be happy to do it maybe you can become the first one on your block to have your privates replaced with a transplant no wait help me im sick i fivefourthreetwo wait my desk my desk the keys to the hospital van are in the top drawer of my desk van i didnt see a van just two small its on the other side of the hospital down that way now help me im going to be sick to my stomach again ignoring him natalie raced to the office and located the keys then hurried back to where luis lay his pressure was still in the low eighties and his color was poor she was certain that he was in pain from his wounds he had to be still he gave no outward sign of it luis were ready to go ive got the keys to santoros van there should be room for all five of us i do not think so he said leave me and rosa we have friends in the town we can take care of ourselves absolutely not we need to get you to a hospital ben too luis did not reply instead he put his finger to his lips and pointed in the direction of the landing strip a helicopter he said it just landed i didnt hear anything it probably came in downwind natalie motioned rosa over rosa she whispered luis says he heard a helicopter fly in and land did you hear anything no rosa said but believe me if he heard something it is there maybe we can force the pilot to help us take luis and ben to rio let me go and check rosa said changing the ammunition clip in her gun i will go out the back past the pool and then move into the forest just be careful there was no time for rosa to heed natalies warning her gun ready she cautiously opened the door to the pool and patio before she had taken a full step outside there was a burst of machinegun fire which nearly cut her in two and drove her several feet back into the dining room before she dropped lifeless to the floor natalie had taken no more than two steps toward her when two swarthy men in commando garb and arab headdresses charged into the room then two more in seconds moving with extreme precision they stationed themselves strategically around the room guns ready one of them flicked his automatic weapon at natalie and issued a sharp order in arabic natalie opened her hand and let her gun drop then she raised both hands and kept them up the soldiers scanned the room looking for anything threatening passing over rosas crumpled bloodied corpse as if she werent there then one of them marched back through the door half a minute later he returned leading a man in an elegant robe and headdress was this the patient ticketed to receive sandys heart natalie felt as sick as any of those who had ingested tokimas toxin the four of them ben rosa luis and herself had tried the impossible and only moments ago it seemed as if they had succeeded now rosa was dead ben was sick luis was gravely wounded and she was standing helpless in the face of a team of professional soldiers they had tried they had lost please she shouted across the room at the latest arrival please listen to me do you know whats going on here the man taller than the others and imperious in his manner and bearing stared at her blankly do you speak english she persisted portuguese i want someone who speaks english or portuguese then you are in luck ms reyes because i am fluent in both with those words her mentor doug berenger strode through the door and into the room chapter when he obtains the power he immediately becomes unjust as far as he can be plato the republic book ii the moment natalie saw berenger the missing pieces of her life began flying into place instantly consumed by a hatred more powerful than any passion she had ever known she slowly lowered her hands and stood arms folded watching as he impassively surveyed the carnage and illness surrounding them then he turned to her our friend in the village father francisco radioed our friend sergeant barbosa here at the hospital that a beautiful sexy tree hugger with clean new boots had made it out to dom angelo when i heard barbosas description of the woman i had a funny feeling that it might be you you are to be commended for making it this far go to hell doug she said barely able to keep herself from leaping at him in an effort to claw his eyes out before the arab soldiers cut her down youre a goddamn murderer a killer her mind was racing over their years together as mentor and pupil then as friends she had developed a strong sense of the man now she struggled to integrate what she knew of him with his involvement in this place there was little chance she reasoned that she was going to survive no she immediately corrected there was no chance at all but somehow she had to get at him somehow she had to take advantage of his arrogance his love of power and his enormous ego somehow she had to rattle him ridicule and goad him into making a mistake no matter what she was not going to die passively george washington killed for a cause he was saying so did eisenhower and truman and moses and mandela and simon bolivar and lincoln sanctioned the deaths of hundreds of thousands in the cause of what was right oh please spare me your feeble justifications for being an amoral monster the surgeons eyes flashed and she knew that she had stung him it wouldnt be the last time she vowed berenger turned from her to the director of the hospital santoro wheres oscar my stomach im sickso sick the surgeon began sputtering and coughing up bile and acid damn it xavier where is he dontknow hes dead natalie said matteroffactly i shot him right here she pointed to her eye he was a pig and a murderer just like you and you my dear lady are an irritating selfserving little bug a gnat aptly named and certainly not deserving of the status of a guardian not deserving of what tell me what you poisoned these people with i dont know a little shaman i met in the forest put together a special something for me she glanced around the room he should have listened to me though i told him to make it a lot stronger berenger crossed to where the silverhaired woman lay moaning and clutching her middle he glanced down with some disgust at the body lying next to her and then carefully stepped around it dorothy he said without a word of sympathy for her condition can you work ii cant stop getting sick she managed it feels like my stomach is about to tear in two it was something in the food at lunch im sure of it ive been hallucinating too poor tony couldnt stop throwing up either hows he doing not so well dorothy i need you i was counting on you to do the anesthesia for both cases is that the woman over there at berengers gesture in her direction sandy began to shriek hysterically no please no i have a little boy he needs me please i beg you dont hurt me oh thats just sweet doug natalie said she has a little boy arent you proud of yourself shut up berenger quickly whispered something to the man in the regal robe who then nodded in the direction of two of his men and issued a quick order with sandy continuing to scream piteously the soldiers wheeled her away and into the farthest operating room in moments there was silence with berengers help the anesthesiologist managed to get to her feet there was no way to keep her from seeing tonys corpse oh dear she gasped poor man dorothy listen berenger said well take care of tonys family real good care now youve got to pull yourself together the prince will be here any minute hes gone into congestive heart failure and may be in early cardiogenic shock we need to move quickly and to do that we need you when this is over when you have helped give one of the most enlightened and powerful rulers in the world back his life you will never have to work again if you dont want to you will live in luxury for the rest of your days can you do it ii can try as the woman headed unsteadily out of the dining room holding her midsection and shaking her head as if trying to clear it natalie noticed that luis white as a sheet had shifted position and was working his hand underneath him toward his gun she shook her head in sharp warning but he either did not notice or else did not care so natalie said anxious to distract her mentor the paper i was supposed to deliver the international transplant meeting it was all calculated to get me down here if there wasnt a meeting here i modestly admit i would have found another way you see it wasnt mere chance and a passion for longlegged track stars that led me to connect with you when you were at harvard it was let me guess it was a blood test that was drawn on me at a whitestone lab a greentop tube to be specific berenger looked genuinely surprised it appears that when the procedures here are concluded you and i will have to have a little discussion as to who knows what about greentop tubes i know that you are a murderer a serial killer no better than any of the rest of them think what you wish berenger said we prefer to think of ourselves as involved physicians who are righting a serious wrong in the system oh please you were a twelve out of twelve tissue match with a person we knew would one day need a new lung a person whose work is about to revolutionize medicine as we know it twelve out of twelve natalie that means almost no nasty antirejection drugs to slow him down all mankind will be the richer for his work without your lung he well might have died so you took me out to lunch and acted as if you actually cared about me we needed to keep you on a fairly short leash i ask you who deserves that lung of yours more you or him thats not your decision to make doug isnt it you know until recently i actually tried to stick up for you there was another candidate a laborer who was an eleven out of twelve match for our man but then when you showed how crass and arrogant you were by trying to stab dr renfro in the back and subsequently getting kicked out of school and your residency it was clear you had denigrated yourself and lowered yourself far beneath any guardian guardian guardian of whatwhat in the hell are you talking about i wouldnt expect you to know what kind of guardianhey wait a minute are you talking about guardians as in platos guardians the philosopher kings surely you dont think that youoh but you do dont you you consider yourself a philosopher king natalie knew that in her campaign to disrupt and rattle the man she had just been given a weapon how many of you are there doug how many philosopher murderer kings are you part of some sort of secret society a plato club berengers expression left no doubt that he had been gored you are in no position to be mocking he said the guardians of the republic are among the greatest most talented most enlightened men and women on earth by taking over the decisionmaking relative to the allocation of organs we have done more good for mankind than you could ever imagine the guardians of the republic oh this is too much do you have an anthem doug a password a decoder ring how about a secret grip and merit badges enough berenger took a single step forward and slapped natalie across the face with all his strength dropping her to one knee natalie her eyes watering from the blow ran her tongue over the corner of her mouth and tasted blood that was brave doug she said standing i hope you broke your hand no such luck too bad so tell me what harm did that poor woman in there ever do to anyone that would cause your precious guardians to sacrifice her youll never understand try me shes a producer the lowest of all social groups compare the value of her life to that of the great man she is about to save either she must die or he must its as simple as that and i say it is no contest organs must be allocated to save the lives of those who can and will best serve mankind you left out the part about being able to pony up a gazillion dollars as well wrong many of the guardians we save dont have that kind of money such charity and here i was so surprised and proud of you when you put tonya in her place and treated that poor fellow who couldnt stop smoking so humanely if you hadnt been standing there i would have kissed tonya for being so right on the mark i wanted to kill that bastard culver for wasting that heart i wanted to kill him on the spot i wanted to open his chest with a dull blade remove that precious heart i had been forced by the system to place there and put it into someone who deserved it more and would take better care of it out of the corner of her eye natalie could see that luis had reached his gun and was slowly maneuvering it to where he could pull it from beneath his leg his color had if possible worsened and his eyes looked nearly lifeless nearly so douglas the great natalie said the reason you didnt just have me killed and buried down here is no wait dont bother answering lord philosopher king i know im alive just in case by some fluke my lung is rejected or fails to function for whatever reason you want me incubating the other one how long is this poison going to last berenger demanded i would say go fuck yourself but i have high hopes of being elevated to the exalted ranks of guardian once more and i wouldnt want to say anything so crude that it hurts my chances natalie could see that the corner of berengers eye had begun to twitch another hit turning his back on her he ordered santoro to his feet come on xavier i need you in the or santoro tried to stand slipped on the products of his own sickness fell and began to giggle and moan at the same time at that moment a helicopter swung low over the hospital then off to the landing strip one of the soldiers was dispatched to guide the latest arrivals in damn it santoro berenger snapped get up get showered and dressed and get ready to assist me in the or he grabbed the man by the back of the shirt and pulled him rudely to his feet the cleansing shower would never happen luis raised his gun and before either of the remaining two soldiers could react fired from twenty feet away the bullet caught santoro squarely in the chest knocking him back into an easy chair an odd smile on his lips a second shot probably meant for berenger shattered a window no natalie screamed as the two soldiers riddled luis with automatic fire from their machine guns causing his body to jerk about like a marionette no natalie wanted to rush to him but in truth there was nothing she could do and the arab soldiers were extremely jittery instead she moved off to one side and satisfied herself that her hero was at least at peace as she herself would undoubtedly be before too much longer berenger was clearly unraveling he stormed over to where vincents girlfriend lay violently snapping her head and kicking her feet at whatever hallucinations were harassing her who are you what are you doing here the woman glanced up at him and began laughing hysterically then without warning she threw up spattering his shoes contemptuously he wiped them on her pants leg and then turned toward the patio entrance where three soldiers rushed in wheeling a stretcher on which lay a young copperskinned mustachioed man with a portable monitor defibrillator and oxygen mask in place his breathing was labored behind him came an arab physician in scrubs and a white coat and a young lean black man pushing a small glassfront case mounted on wheels and containing a number of units of blood youll be working in or one as usual randall berenger said to the man the bypass pump is just as you left it you know where everything else is be careful getting ready but do it quickly he patted the pump tech on the shoulder hurried over to the prince and listened to his heart and lungs i dont like this he said to the physician in english i dont like this at all where are khanduri and the nurses we flew over them theyre in two cars about five miles from here on that winding road half an hour maybe no more than that you should have put them all on the jet and flown straight in you heard the pilot back in rio he said the flaps werent working right and it was too dangerous christ when did the prince start to slip at the airport just as we were transferring him to the helicopter okay okay we can still pull all this together can you assist me in the or i dare not leave the prince especially when he is in this condition all right get him into the recovery room and see what you can do to stabilize him until khanduri gets here wait whats the ministers name minister althani im going to ask him if he can assist me in the operating room i dont think that would be proper no matter what the physician said he is i need help damn it i need another pair of hands even if the person theyre attached to doesnt know anything about no no wait never mind just get the prince onto the monitor in the recovery room and get him stabilized im going to get started and have the heart harvested and ready when khanduri and the nurses arrive but who will assist you berenger actually may have smiled she will he said pointing at natalie chapter an enemyowes to an enemy that which is due or proper to him that is to say evil plato the republic book i youre out of your mind natalie cried out im not going into the operating room to assist you not now not ever id rather die berenger almost invariably composed suave and in control was clearly rattled by the sudden downturn of his patient the violent death of xavier santoro and natalies constant sniping she was pleased to see that the tick at the corner of his eye had if anything intensified actually natalie he said his teeth nearly clenched its not going to be you who is doing the dying at least not yet he bent down and picked up vargass pistol its going to be them he gestured to the kitchen and maintenance crews if you arent in clean or scrubs prepping your hands within two minutes i will begin at the end of this row and will kill one of them every minute until you comply but theres more if you dont assist me i will have to use dorothy my anesthesiologist and before i do that i will have her strap the patient down and allow her to wake up then we will harvest her heart jesus doug what are you right now im a man who needs to get things done in a hurry are you in he casually aimed the gun at one of the chambermaids a pretty indian woman who couldnt have been more than sixteen the philosopher king natalie muttered as she turned and headed for the operating room berenger followed her there are scrubs for us in that cabinet he said we can change in recovery room two i wont peek if you dont peek all you want my second surgeon and the nurses should be here any minute then i shall have all the help i need and you can return to the others knowing you have saved many of their lives after getting their masks and surgical hair covers in place he led natalie into the narrow scrub room set between the two ors and nodded her toward the second of two stainless steel sinks as they washed with antiseptic impregnated sponges her mind was consumed with finding a way to kill him antonio vargas and probably luis as well killed by their nature but this beast and his fanatic guardians killed by choice put a gun in her hand and she would have no trouble pointing it at her former mentor and role model and pulling the trigger and so he was saying at the very core of the guardians is platos concept of the forms his determination that perfection is inborn in the guardians he used this concept to conclude that the soul of such as us must be immortal because how else could the notion of what perfection is be present at birth its been a while since i took philosophy at harvard natalie replied but from what i recall i dont think youve got it quite right the only perfect thing you guardians are doing is being perfectly immoral in the mirror natalie could see the tightness and tension in berengers eyes keep jabbing she told herself whatever you do keep jabbing the forms tell me otherwise he replied our organization has prospered and has benefited millions and millions of the citizens of the world at very little cost people will never know whose music is being brought to their ears because of us or whose buildings they are marveling at that would never even have been conceived of they will never know that the lifesaving drug they are taking was developed because we were able to supply its creator with the perfect organ at the perfect time you see de natalie the guardians are all about perfection and the forms now t harvest our heart and place it where it belongs and where it can do the most good how about we harvest yours instead at that moment the door to the scrub room burst open and randall the heartlung bypass pump technician rushed in the pump is ready doctor he said any sign of dr khanduri or the nurses none dr alrabia says to tell you the prince is slipping damn it go have a chopper sent up to find out where the others are and then get ready if necessary well put the prince on the bypass pump right now and just keep him there meanwhile im going to get started next door come on assistant lets get cracking berenger followed natalie into the or where the anesthesiologist having put their patient to sleep and intubated her helped them gown and glove seeing sandy macfarlane looking so serene natalie felt a trickle of relief make its way into her profound sadness just before her achilles tendon repair she remembered asking the anesthesiologist only partly in jest how am i going to know if i didnt wake up the man merely smiled down patted her on the arm and injected the preop meds it was totally disheartening to possess that information about sandy and to be helpless to do anything about it hey doc tell me how am i going to know if i didnt wake up from my surgery dorothy are you all set berenger asked weve got to move on this one all set do you have ice ready theres going to be a delay between the harvest and the transplant always natalie again looked across at berengers eyes he was clearly frazzled but for twenty years or more he had been the man outside of and within the or and had successfully handled countless medical crises with no nurse to assist them the anesthesiologist had pulled two large instrument stands across the operating table so that both surgeon and assistant could get at them doug berenger was not only one of the most elegant brilliant surgeons natalie had ever seen he was one of the fastest without asking for her help he began rapidly swabbing russetcolored betadine antiseptic over sandys chest let me tell you one last time natalie if you make any odd or unusual moves any at all i will tell dorothy over there to turn off the anesthesia before we proceed have i made myself clear clear then just shut up and do as i say have sponges and hemostats ready just in case dorothy were opening as natalie picked up what berenger asked for she noticed three scalpels lying side by side on the far edge of the instrument tray there was no way she could get at them without being seen but there was also nothing else available that even looked like a weapon a desperate situation called for desperate measures and one way or another she also knew that like the poor woman on the table she wasnt going to wake up from her operation without another word berenger snatched one of the scalpels from the tray and made a footlong incision from top to bottom along sandys sternum blood instantly began oozing from a dozen or more small vessels but unless one of them began hemorrhaging rapidly berenger would not bother to gain control there was no need the bone saw is right there natalie so are the spreaders natalie felt sick as she reached for them the operating room door opened berenger turned to see the arab physician alrabia dr berenger the man said urgently the princes blood pressure is zero i cannot bring it back up the few seconds berenger was distracted were enough natalie swept her gloved hand across the two remaining scalpels and came away with one of them tucked in the sleeve of her surgical gown then she glanced over at the anesthesiologist to ensure that she too was focused on alrabia now her mission was clear somehow to get close to berenger and then for rosa and luis and ben and herself and all the other victims of the guardians to be fearless berenger was clearly on edge the juggler of balls who had just reached a personal best when one more was thrown into the mix but he was still the man all right doctor he said lets wheel him quickly into the or and ill get him on the pump dorothy just leave the gas on here and come with us natalie lets go we have work to do berenger took a step toward the door then another natalie moving from the other side of the table was now a pace behind him there is often only one chance with luiss words resonating in her mind she slipped the scalpel into her hand doug startled berenger turned toward her exposing his jaw and the side of his neck fearless with all the force she could manage natalie swung the blade up from her hip and swiped it viciously across berengers throat instantly the opening of his severed trachea appeared where his larynx had been a moment later bright crimson arterial blood began spewing from a laceration through his carotid artery splattering natalie and coating the floor unable to speak pawing futilely at his neck the man called socrates one of the founders of the guardians of the republic lurched backward and fell heavily awash in the rapidly ebbing essence of his being his last moments were spent staring up at natalie in silent absolute wideeyed disbelief come dr berenger alrabia cried from the or next door the princes heart has stopped come quickly natalie stripped off her gown and raced in to help but she knew that unless the dysfunctional muscle that had caused the princes heart failure could be replaced there was nothing that drugs or cardiac compressions could do oh dear allah alrabia kept muttering dear allah help us natalie continued performing cpr but the cardiac monitor remained absolutely discouraging she considered trying with the help of the pump technician to hook him up to the bypass machine but her knowledge and surgical skill stopped well short of that alrabia clearly a gifted physician tried several shocks from the defibrillator even though he knew that his masters problem was not fibrillation a potentially reversible lethal rhythm but rather complete cardiac standstill a virtually untreatable flat line there really was no hope the minister althani was standing just outside the doorway only a few feet from berengers bloodsoaked body his eyes were narrowed and grim his arms folded tightly across his chest clearly he knew that the fate of his prince had been sealed natalie following alrabias orders to the best of her ability was waiting for him to stop the resuscitation but the man desperately kept at it suddenly one of the helicopter pilots appeared by althani trying at first to speak in portuguese than resorting to badly broken english lord two cars on road stopped people on face on ground men women with guns around them ben the impassive minister actually sighed then he rattled off an order in arabic to the physician turned and left moments later the resuscitation on the prince was over alrabia his eyes glistening looked dismally over at natalie and shook his head allah will care for him he said but he was such a good man and would have made a wonderful ruler for our people im very sorry she replied for what its worth i think you did an excellent job he had a heart infection that could not be treated maybe someday there will be such a treatment maybe someday she echoed natalie that is your name natalie reyes yes well natalie reyes it means nothing now but i want you to know that we were told the donor of the heart to our prince was braindead until we arrived here that is what we believed with dr berenger in charge matters simply got out of hand i appreciate your telling me dr berenger and his organization were corrupted by their own egos and greed they could not stand to be told by people they considered beneath them how to use their incredible skills i understand if the minister will allow me to leave the prince like this perhaps with the anesthesiologist watching over him i wish to come in and help you suture that poor womans chest i would like that dr alrabia natalie said i would like that very much the two arab physician and american medical student returned to the or where sandy macfarlane lay peacefully beneath the surgical drapes being breathed for by a ventilator and kept asleep by carefully metered anesthetic gas the incision down her chest to the surface of her sternum was oozing blood but certainly not enough to be a threat natalie electrically cauterized the largest of the bleeding vessels then with alrabia holding the skin edges together she settled in and meticulously sewed the incision back together as she worked natalie flashed back to the metropolitan hospital emergency room just hours before berenger would arbitrarily remove her as a guardian for being suspended from medical school standing nearby was the nurse beverly richardson and on the table before her was the boy darren jones the last person she had sutureduntil now beneath her mask natalie smiled chapter you are lazy and mean to cheat us out of a whole chapter which is a very important part of the story plato the republic book v with the anesthesiologist left behind to bring sandy macfarlane v w back to consciousness natalie headed excitedly to the dining room the minister althani was there but all of the soldiers save one were gone may i go out she anxiously asked alrabia there is someone out there a friend i need to make sure he doesnt get hurt is he the one who held up the arrival of the surgeon and all the others i believe so alrabia shook his head in utter frustration and wordlessly checked with the minister who clearly understood natalies request yes yes go ahead he said they will not be hurt before natalie could leave ben and father francisco hands in the air entered the dining room followed by three arab soldiers and the man natalie felt certain was berengers second surgeon althani barked out a brief order and the soldiers lowered their weapons then backed away wheres berenger the surgeon asked alrabia pointed with his thumb in the hallway he said not bothering to explain any further natalie raced across and threw her arms around ben knocking him backward a step nice place you run here he said gesturing about the room his gaze stopped at luiss bulletriddled corpse oh no he was a warrior right to the end natalie said he always seemed ready to die before he was killed he did what was needed to bring this place down maybe his sister will be able to rest in peace i couldnt believe it when the helicopter pilot said that someone had stopped the nurses and surgeon and had them lying on the ground i just knew it was you after berenger told me that father francisco was on their payroll i felt sick at having sent you to him for help what happened believe it or not francisco answered until mr callahan here convinced me otherwise i had no idea the donors who had come through the hospital had all been kidnapped he told me the story of this professor from chicago and a farm boy from idaho he made the analogy between forcing the poor and downtrodden into prostitution and slavery and forcing them to sell their body parts or in this case to give them away nat father francisco here really came through when it counted it took him just a few minutes to round up ten of the toughest men and women i have ever seen we were fortunate to arrive at the hospital road just as the cars did that man over there is a surgeon he started bossing us around and telling us how important it was for them to get to the hospital next thing they knew they were on the ground then these soldiers came out of the trees and all of a sudden we were on the ground too natalie turned to alrabia whats going to happen to us and to these people she asked the physician received a silent answer from his minister before he responded contrary to what you might believe senseless violence is not our way he said minister althani is sad and angry but not at you the princes body will be placed on one of the helicopters and flown back to the airport after we return to our country he will be buried as the hero he was they all waited somberly as the soldiers wheeled the prince out across the patio followed by alrabia and the minister finally natalie turned to father francisco once the flight crew is in working order well hitch a ride with them back to rio and get sandy into a hospital then ill get in touch with the american embassy and set up a meeting with them and this military police detective i met in botafogo he didnt treat me with any great interest but i sensed he took pride in his work and his position plus rodrigo vargas disliked him and thats recommendation enough for me his name is perreira i will check with some friends of mine to see if he is someone you can trust thank you father francisco today you behaved like a true man of god the priest shook her hand then embraced her and thanked her for helping to free their town you know he said this man has some way with words he wore me away absolutely wore me down like waves pounding at the shore hey you know what i think mr callahan i think maybe you should consider becoming a lawyer or maybe even a priest no chance father ben said putting his arm around natalies shoulders to brace himself im going to be too busy writing my first detective novel epilogue the soul of man is immortal and imperishable plato the republic book x i can see why you love autumn in new england so much ben said im really happy to be here again natalie squeezed his hand and smiled up at him four weeks had passed since dom angelo and this was bens second trip to be with her their embryonic connection forged initially in the rain forest was growing stronger and more passionate although neither of them was anxious to push things too hard too fast i have something to share with you natalie said as they passed the esplanade where just a few months before she had gone with friends to watch the pops celebrate the fourth of july but first tell me about texas it was kind of a surreal trip he said the cops knew who i was and didnt charge me anything for towing and storing my car then i started out of town but almost before i knew it i was heading out john hamman highway to see the place one last time the gate was chained and padlocked and the oasis inside looked totally deserted i got out and hung for a time just taking in the whole scene that had to have been intense oh it was i stood there wondering about how many how many unsuspecting clients were tissuetyped there millions i guess how many perfect matches had they chosen how many had died as a result ben you helped put an end to it all i hope so how do you feel about taking a leave from school its the right thing to do im not mentally or physically in shape to go back yet but i will if i can maybe next year meanwhile im getting to spend some quality time with my niece jenny with her cp and my sisters death shes really had a raw deal of it and i want to be sure she gets as much as life owes her plus i really am enjoying the time we spend together and your residency first things first ben i understand im still angry and frustrated for you thats all i dont have a hell of a lot to look forward to in terms of my health but at least im not walking around all day thinking about solving my problems with a bunch of pills and a plastic bag i sure hope not mindless of the runners and roller bladers passing by ben lifted her chin and kissed her gently wanna sit down for a bit he asked why am i breathing weird again hey hey no touchiness now remember our deal you stay cool about your lung and ill stay cool about having no career no interests aside from you and the illicit organ trade and no immediate job prospects job or no job good lung or bad we still have what everyone else has we have today now what did you want to share with me natalie didnt respond immediately instead she rested her head on his shoulder trying to purge any unpleasant thoughts from her mind finally she reached in her pocket and extracted a letter this came yesterday she said you watch the boats ill read it to you she was unable to cull the melancholy from her voice sorry for sounding down im still lacking closure in this whole business and from time to time notions about the future just hit me hey read and dont worry my scars are almost gone yours is slightly more permanent he ran his fingertips along her right side anything that brings closure a little nearer do it natalie pressed his hand to her lips the letter was folded in quarters and already dogeared its from detective perreira she said opening it dear senhorita reyes this letter like my first one is being translated by an american friend who teaches english and can be counted upon to be absolutely discreet i first want to tell you that the attorney you have hired here has been most active and seems to us all to be extremely competent i believe that ultimately there will be no formal charges pressed against you in connection with any of the matters related to dom angelo i also wish to thank you and mr callahan for referring your friend alice gustafson to me i find her to be a charming thoughtful woman who only yesterday was a guest at our home for dinner she and i have traveled together to dom angelo my third trip for picturetaking and for her to examine the hospital and the village with the help of information from someone in the town several bodies have been unearthed it may be difficult if not impossible to identify them but professor gustafson believes the answers to that mystery are in london and she will be flying there when she leaves here scotland yard has been investigating their end of this case and are eagerly awaiting her arrival although it will take some time to identify all of those involved she believes that some arrests there are imminent professor gustafson is as i assume you know a most determined woman we here in rio de janeiro have great respect for your courage and for the service you and mr callahan have done our country i hope our aggressive pursuit of this matter and the arrests we have made including two of our own have changed your opinion of the brazilian military police if and when you choose to return to our country please accept my invitation to serve as one of your hosts power corrupts ben said natalies reply was cut short by her cell phone which announced a call with its riff from vivaldi with no one around to disturb she let the melody play through twice before answering hello is this natalie reyes a womans voice asked are you selling something because please indulge me for a moment and ill explain everything all right im natalie now what is this who are you natalie i know you picked up ben callahan at the airport earlier today is he with you now look either you tell me what this is all about or im going to okay okay this has to do with brazil instantly natalies irritation vanished what about brazil natalie if youre not already you may want to sit down we re sitting great can you put the phone where you both can hear natalie pulled ben closer and did as she was asked okay she said we can both hear natalie my name is beth mann im a private detective here in boston on behalf of a client i have been investigating you since your return from brazil no peeping tom stuff i promise you an ethical detective ben whispered pulling back for a moment must be a hoax go on natalie said as part of my investigation i have had a number of conversations with dr rachel french my pulmonologist natalie whispered to ben and also with your friend dr terry millwood he is at white memorial hospital right now awaiting your call those two physicians have spoken with the head of the hospital and all necessary arrangements have been made necessary arrangements for what natalie asked absolutely nonplussed natalie does the name dr joseph anson mean anything at all to you no should it not really dr anson is from west africa cameroon to be more exact hes a dedicated physician and a brilliant researcher in the area of neovascularization making new blood vessels natalie whispered to ben go on at this moment dr anson is in or around boston i have no idea where he has made a decision from which he has no intention of turning back the decision was made after i told him about the fire at your mothers house and the damage your lung incurred in saving her and your niece but how did you mr callahan would you please take a moment and tell this woman what we detectives do we detect ben said please go on natalie said sensing but not yet believing what was to follow at nine oclock this evening just seven hours from now dr anson is going to peacefully take his own life i will get a call from an attorney telling me the address where dr ansons body can be found then i will receive a call from dr anson i have an ambulance standing by and will wait exactly thirtyseven minutes before sending it out to the location by the time they arrive dr ansons heart will be beating but he will be braindead believe me natalie dr anson is a genius and is absolutely capable of making this happen once a neurologist has confirmed the brain death dr millwood and his team will be standing by to transplant dr ansons lung into your chest butbut why why not just donate a lung to me and keep one for himself because natalie joseph anson has only one functioning lung yours natalie felt her body go slack and wondered if for the first time in her life she was going to faint ben squeezed her hand so tightly that it hurt oh god she said theres already been so much death is there any way i could talk to this man believe me natalie i have spoken to him a number of times and researched him thoroughly dr anson is at peace with what he is doing all we need now is your cooperation ben nodded vigorously at her theni guess you have it she heard herself say in that case dr millwood is awaiting your call hell explain what happens next im very happy for you be sure to stop by my office after your recovery but what if beth mann had rung off natalie making no attempt to stem her tears took both of bens hands in hers remember what i said about closure she asked the time is right anson was thinking the time is right he was in a small rented garage just a mile from natalie reyess apartment sitting in a compact car in pitchdarkness the passenger side window was open an inch the opening was sealed with rags protruding inward from the rags was one end of a length of garden hose the other end was sealed in the exhaust pipe the heavy sedation he had taken at a carefully predetermined moment was beginning to take effect he had read and reread beth manns twohundredpage report on natalie reyes her family and even on the new man in her life he had studied the numerous articles dating back to natalies days as a student athlete at harvard he had watched videos of several of her races and finally he had walked beside her close enough to brush her sleeve oh yes the time was absolutely right natalie reyes and possibly ben callahan as well were perfect to oversee the bringing in of new management for the hospital and to control the fate of sarah after she recovered from the surgery she and if she wanted callahan would be summoned to his attorneys office to receive his notebooks and a detailed dvd he had recorded for her she would be under no obligation to stay in cameroon indefinitely but he suspected that once she breathed the wonderful air of the jungle and met the people she might want to she and callahan were everything the wouldbe philosopher kings of elizabeths and douglas berengers sad organization were not they were true guardians anson flicked on the inside light and checked the time then he opened the notebook on his lap and read aloud the world can be hard full of trickery full of deceit full of injustice full of pain but there is an emptiness waiting my friend a great glowing emptiness soft and fragrant with the essence of peace the essence of serenity you are almost there my friend the magnificent emptiness is the eternal harbor for your soul take my hand friend take my hand and take a step just one more step and you are there anson lifted his cell phone and dialed ms mann he said you may start timing now without waiting for a reply he set the phone aside shut off the light turned on the ignition and placed his notebook down on a wellworn copy of platos republic
