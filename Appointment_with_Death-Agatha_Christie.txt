part one chapter one dont you agree that shes got to be killed the words seemed to hang in the still night air before disappearing into the darkness it was hercule poirots first night in the city of jerusalem and he was shutting his hotelroom window the night air was a danger to his health when he overheard these words he smiled even on holiday i am reminded of crime he said to himself no doubt someone is talking about a play or a book as he walked over to his bed he thought about the voice he had heard it was the voice of a man or a boy and had sounded nervous and excited i will remember that voice said hercule poirot to himself as he lay down to sleep yes i will remember in the room next door raymond boynton and his sister carol looked out of their window into the darkblue night sky raymond said again dont you agree that shes got to be killed it cant go on like this it cant we must do something and what else can we do carol said in a hopeless voice if only we could just leave somehow but we cant we cant people would say we were crazy said raymond bitterly they would wonder why we cant just walk out carol said slowly perhaps we are crazy perhaps we are agreed raymond after all we are calmly planning to kill our own mother she isnt our real mother said carol shes our stepmother there was a pause do you still think she has to die asked raymond quietly yes i do said carol shes mad she must be she she wouldnt treat us so badly torture us like this if she wasnt mad its lasted for years and years and i dont think it will ever stop we keep saying shell die some time but she hasnt died i dont think she will ever die unless unless we kill her said raymond and you or i must do it not our brother lennox or our sister ginevra they mustnt be involved and we must do it quickly said carol im really worried about ginevra shes getting worse and its not really wrong said raymond its just like killing a mad dog before it hurts anyone else carol stood up suddenly pushing back her redbrown hair from her face but we would still be sent to prison if we were found out how could we explain what mother is like it would sound crazy as if we were imagining it nobody will know said raymond ive got a plan well be safe ray said carol youre different in some way somethings happened to you was it that girl you met on the train no of course not said raymond carol dont talk nonsense lets talk about my plan are you sure it will work asked carol yes i am replied her brother we must wait for the right opportunity of course and then well all be free free carol looked up at the stars then suddenly she started to cry its such a lovely night with the stars in the sky if only we could be part of it all like other people but instead we are strange and twisted and wrong even if mother dies isnt it too late for us to change no carol its not too late said raymond but if you dont want to i do want to we must do it said carol because of the others and especially ginevra we must save ginevra raymond paused a moment all right well do it he said ill tell you my plan chapter two miss sarah king was standing in the lounge of the solomon hotel in jerusalem looking at the newspapers and magazines when a tall middleaged frenchman entered the room and walked towards her sarah looked up and smiled as she recognized the man who had helped her carry her suitcases at cairo railway station the frenchman introduced himself as dr theodore gerard dr theodore gerard sarahs eyes opened wide in surprise oh im so excited to meet you ive just qualified as a doctor myself and ive read all your books your opinions on mental illness and schizophrenia are very interesting i was just going to order some coffee dr gerard smiled amused at the girls enthusiasm will you join me miss king my name is sarah king they sat down in the lounge and dr gerard ordered some coffee are you staying in jerusalem long he asked admiring sarahs beautiful black hair and red lips just for a few days said sarah then i want to go to the famous rosered city of petra its carved into the rock i believe and i think it takes about a week to get there and back aha i too was thinking of visiting petra if i have time said dr gerard just then a group of people entered the lounge and sat down sarah looked at them with interest do you see that family of americans she asked dr gerard quietly they were on the same train from cairo as us dr gerard looked at the family first he saw a tall man of about thirty with a pleasantlooking face then he saw a goodlooking younger boy and girl obviously brother and sister who both looked nervous and excited there was another girl who was even younger she was beautiful with redgold hair and another woman who was young and calm with dark hair and a pale face but at the centre of the group there was an old woman with a large swollen body dr gerard thought she looked like a huge spider in the middle of a web who are they dr gerard asked sarah the family name is boynton sarah replied there is the mother married son his wife one younger son and two younger daughters they all seem very strange they dont speak to anyone else and they dont do anything unless the old woman the mother says so they look so scared so afraid of her its not right have you spoken to them dr gerard asked i spoke to the younger son on the train said sarah it was peculiar he was very excited to speak to me but also afraid hes at least twenty three or four but he seems very young it isnt normal dr gerard smiled is anyone really normal he asked just then the younger son raymond boynton passed sarahs chair as he fetched a magazine sarah looked up at him and asked have you been sightseeing today raymond jumped nervously and his face went red oh oh yes certainly i then suddenly as if a needle had been stuck into him he hurried back to his family the old woman mrs boynton held out a hand for the magazine and turned her head to look at sarah the old womans face had no expression and it was impossible to know what she was thinking but sarah was looking at her watch i must go im afraid dr gerard i must write some letters thank you so much for the coffee the doctor stood up and shook sarahs hand perhaps i will see you again at petra he said sarah smiled at him and started to walk out of the lounge mrs boynton stared hard at her son raymond and as sarah passed raymond turned his head away from her slowly and unwillingly it was as if mrs boynton had pulled a string that no one could see sarah king noticed that raymond had turned away from her and was very annoyed she knew that she was an attractive young woman and she didnt like being ignored i wont waste time talking to him again she said to herself as she went upstairs to her hotel room instead of writing her letters sarah sat down in front of her bedroom mirror while she combed her lovely black hair she thought about her life things had been difficult for sarah recently she had been engaged to be married to another young doctor but a month ago she had decided to end the engagement though they were very attracted to each other they both liked to be in charge and in control and had argued all the time it had been a hard decision for sarah and to help her forget her troubles she had arranged this interesting holiday before she went back to work sarah sighed and forced herself to think about the present not the past i hope i meet dr gerard again she thought id like to talk to him about his work then she thought about raymond boynton it was ridiculous for anyone especially a man to be controlled by their mother suddenly she felt sorry for him that young man needs to be rescued she said out loud and im going to do it chapter three after sarah left the lounge dr gerard moved and sat nearer to the boynton family he was curious about them and wanted to look at them more closely from a professional point of view as a doctor he pretended to read a newspaper while looking at each of the family in turn dr gerard had guessed that raymond boynton and sarah were attracted to each other so first he looked at raymond the young man looked sensitive and clever but why thought dr gerard is he so nervous and excited raymonds sister carol was also nervous she kept moving in her chair and looking around her as if she couldnt relax and she is afraid decided dr gerard yes she is afraid but why the boynton familys conversation about the tourist sights they would visit tomorrow sounded normal but dr gerard thought that their words were hiding something underneath the surface there was some other emotion though he didnt know what that emotion was next dr gerard looked at the elder brother whose name was lennox lennox didnt seem to be as nervous as raymond and carol instead he looked very tired exhausted he didnt seem to care about anything dr gerard was reminded of people he had seen in hospital he is exhausted yes exhausted with suffering thought the doctor now he just waits waits for the end to come finally he looked at the youngest daughter the girl with the redgold hair she was about nineteen with a thin beautiful face she was sitting very still and smiling calmly at nothing but then dr gerard saw her hands under the table they were busy tearing a delicate handkerchief to pieces chapter four then in a slow wheezing voice mrs boynton spoke ginevra youre tired go up to bed the youngest daughter answered in an attractive musical voice im not tired mother yes you are replied mrs boynton i know what youre like youll be too tired to go out tomorrow youll be ill im not tired and i wont be ill ginevra began to tremble a soft calm voice said ill come upstairs with you ginevra it was the quiet young woman with dark hair nadine boynton no let her go upstairs alone said mrs boynton i want nadine to come said ginevra excitedly you would prefer to go alone wouldnt you ginevra said mrs boynton there was a pause yes i would prefer to go alone said ginevra boynton in a flat dull voice she got up and left the room dr gerard put down his newspaper and looked at mrs boynton the old woman was smiling then suddenly she looked straight at dr gerard with her small black eyes he realized that although she was old mrs boynton had a strong personality and power her eyes were dark and frightening and evil dr gerard breathed in quickly now he knew the emotion that the family was hiding it was hate all her children hated mrs boynton dr gerard thought people would think i am imagining all this then he looked at the quiet young woman nadine boynton she wore a wedding ring and was looking anxiously at lennox so thought dr gerard she is married to lennox the elder son and he realized that although she was worried about her husband nadine was not afraid of mrs boynton this is all very interesting said dr gerard to himself chapter five at that moment a man came into the lounge saw the boyntons and walked towards them he was a pleasant middleaged ordinarylooking american with a long cleanshaven face he was dressed very neatly ive been looking for you he said in a slow pleasant voice he shook hands with each of the boyntons and how are you mrs boynton my health is never good as you know mr cope wheezed the old lady nadine is taking good care of me but i can only go sightseeing for a few hours a day i think its wonderful mrs boynton that you have travelled so far said mr cope its the mind thats important wheezed mrs boynton not the body and where are you going next asked mr cope i am definitely going to visit petra although it takes about a week to travel there and back id love to visit petra said carol it sounds marvellous if you cant go to petra because of your health mrs boynton perhaps some of your family would like to visit it with me suggested mr cope we dont want to separate do we children said mrs boynton her question was answered quickly no mother oh no no of course not you see mr cope said the old woman with a strange smile they wont leave me you are a close family said mr cope though his voice sounded unsure we prefer to stay together said mrs boynton by the way raymond who was that young woman who spoke to you earlier raymond jumped nervously his face went red and then white i i dont know her name i i met her on the train i dont think well speak to her again said mrs boynton she tried to stand up but it was difficult because of her large swollen body nadine went to help her bedtime said mrs boynton good night mr cope all her family left the room with mrs boynton none of the others thought to stay in the lounge without her mr cope watched them leave with a strange expression on his face dr gerard decided to go and talk to mr cope the american certainly seemed like a friendly man so the doctor walked over and introduced himself mr cope was impressed im very pleased to meet you dr gerard he said you are famous in the medical profession and there are quite a few other famous people staying in this hotel at the moment as well as you theres the archaeologist sir manders stone and lady westholme a wellknown member of parliament and of course the famous belgian detective hercule poirot mr jefferson cope was indeed very friendly and liked to talk soon he and dr gerard were sitting in the bar of the hotel and after a few drinks dr gerard said so tell me mr cope what do you know about that american family the boyntons well said jefferson cope nadine boynton is a very old friend of mine i knew her before she was married she worked in a hospital training to be a nurse then she went to stay with the boyntons and married lennox mr cope picked up his glass and drank let me tell you about the boynton family he said elmer boynton who is now dead was a very charming man his first wife died when lennox raymond and carol were young then he married his second wife the lady i was talking to and they had a daughter ginevra after elmer died mrs boynton totally devoted herself to the children she protected them from the real world they dont have any friends and have grown up to be very nervous do they all live at home asked the doctor yes do any of them work no answered mr cope elmer boynton was a rich man and he left all his money to mrs boynton so she could look after the children they dont have any money of their own they live alone in a big house in the country and they dont go out or do anything for themselves i tell you dr gerard it seems all wrong to me i agree with you said dr gerard do you think it is their fault or mrs boyntons fault jefferson cope moved in his chair i think its mrs boyntons fault he admitted though im sure she meant to be kind but im surprised that none of them want to leave and live their own lives perhaps its impossible for them to do that now said dr gerard thoughtfully there are ways mr cope to stop peoples minds growing and developing but surely said jefferson cope a man like lennox shouldnt sit around doing nothing it makes things very difficult for nadine she doesnt complain but i know she isnt happy do you think nadine should leave her husband asked dr gerard nadine needs to live her own life said jefferson cope his face turned red i love and respect nadine very much i want her to be happy and im here to help her if she needs me what does mrs boynton think of your friendship with nadine asked dr gerard curiously i dont know said jefferson cope slowly normally she doesnt like outsiders but shes been very kind to me she treats me like im part of the family that seems very strange said dr gerard i wonder why she doesnt mind you being here mrs boynton interests me yes she interests me very much dr gerard had a lot to think about when he went up to bed chapter six sarah king was out enjoying the tourist sights in jerusalem and was standing near a famous temple listening to the water in the fountains the place was calm and peaceful although there were other tourists walking around then suddenly she heard loud footsteps and the boynton family appeared lennox and raymond were helping mrs boynton to walk nadine and mr cope followed behind them and carol came last as they were leaving carol saw sarah and after a pause ran towards her i i must speak to you said carol nervously my brother raymond didnt mean to be rude to you last night please believe me at first sarah thought that carol was being ridiculous but then she realized that something was wrong with the girl carol was afraid and her face was white do tell me about it said sarah gently it sounds so stupid said carol excitedly i know ray would like to talk to you but its our mother she isnt well and she doesnt like us to have friends were a strange family carol looked around nervously i must go now she added cant you stay and talk to me asked sarah no i cant said carol my mother its sometimes difficult for parents to realize that their children are grown up said sarah calmly why dont you just tell your mother what you want to do carols hands twisted nervously you dont understand she said before her marriage my mother shes my stepmother really worked in a prison thats what our lives are like its like being locked up in prison she looked around nervously again i i must go sarah held carols arm to stop her leaving come to my room after you go to bed said sarah come and talk to me im in room number then she let go of carols arm and the girl quickly ran off sarah stood staring after her she was interrupted by the arrival of dr gerard and sarah told him what had just happened dr gerard was interested so mrs boynton worked in a prison he said that explains a lot of things she has always wanted to have power over people she did then and she does now she likes to hurt people and make them suffer that sounds horrible exclaimed sarah why dont they all leave her escape and be free dr gerard shook his head they cant leave now he said remember that mrs boynton has controlled them since they were children they believe that they have to do everything she says oh i know most people would say that was nonsense but you and i are doctors we know it can happen now they are too afraid to be free what will happen when she dies asked sarah it depends replied dr gerard if mrs boynton died now the younger members of the family could become normal but i think it may be too late to help lennox he doesnt seem to have any hope how can mrs boynton hurt her own family like that said sarah passionately it shouldnt be allowed someone should stop her chapter seven that night sarah waited in her room though she didnt think that carol boynton would come she was just going to bed when she heard carol knock on the door im so glad youre here sarah said as she let the girl in let me get you some tea carol was nervous but calmed down while she drank her tea im a doctor you know said sarah i think your mother is very interesting from a medical point of view she may have a disease that makes her want to control people sarah said this on purpose she wanted carol to think about mrs boynton in a different way carol stared this was a new idea to her its so good to talk to you she said with relief ray and i have had some strange ideas lately if youre unhappy said sarah why dont you leave home we we cant said carol mother wouldnt let us and where would we go what would we do we dont have any money sarah could see that carol was upset so she changed the subject do you like your stepmother she asked slowly carol shook her head i hate her she whispered ray and i wish she would die again sarah changed the subject tell me about your elder brother lennox somethings wrong with lennox said carol he doesnt speak much anymore nadine is very worried about him have nadine and lennox been married long asked sarah about four years replied carol lennox used to go out secretly at night though he wasnt allowed to none of us were mother was very angry when she found out then she asked nadine shes a poor relative of my fathers to come and stay nadine was training to be a hospital nurse she came and stayed with us for a month mother was very pleased when lennox and nadine fell in love she helped them get married very quickly and they now live with us did nadine want to live with you asked sarah carol hesitated i dont think so she said but she didnt mind at first after a while she wanted to leave so she and lennox could live on their own but mother wouldnt let them i dont think mother likes nadine any more and what about your sister asked sarah ginevra said carol im worried about ginevra shes been acting very strangely lately she she doesnt always know what shes doing she frightens me sometimes and she wont see a doctor suddenly carol stood up i must go now she said youve been very kind to talk to me you must think were a very strange family oh every family is strange said sarah please visit me again and bring your brother if you like ill come tomorrow said carol excitedly goodnight and thank you carol went back to her room opened the door and then gasped with surprise mrs boynton was sitting on her bed where have you been carol demanded mrs boynton staring at the girl with her horrible black eyes carols heart beat faster with fear to see miss king sarah king is that the girl who spoke to raymond last night yes mother you are not going to see miss king again carol do you understand yes mother do you promise said mrs boynton standing up with difficulty and using her walking stick yes yes i promise said carol in a dull empty voice good mrs boynton went out and shut the door carol felt sick she lay down on her bed and cried and cried while she was talking to sarah carol had been reminded that there was a world outside a world of sunlight and trees and flowers but now she was back inside the black walls of her prison chapter eight when carol didnt come to sarahs room the next night sarah decided to speak to nadine boynton and luckily found her alone in the hotel lounge the next day nadine was surprised when sarah introduced herself and explained what had happened but she said im glad carol has found a friend to talk to but when i spoke to carol today continued sarah she didnt answer she just looked at me and hurried away im very sorry said nadine carol is a nervous girl after a pause sarah decided to speak openly i dont think its very good for carol not to have any friends nadine boynton looked thoughtfully at sarah i agree with you she said at last but my motherinlaw mrs boynton is in bad health and doesnt like strangers i am sure mrs boynton told carol not to talk to you again carol is doing what she is told sarah felt very disappointed at nadines words she thought shed helped carol but it seemed that mrs boynton had won just then mrs boynton came into the hotel lounge leaning on a walking stick raymond was helping her mrs boynton looked at sarah with an evil pleasure in her small black eyes she knew she had won sarah turned away i think ill sit down and rest before i go out said mrs boynton with enjoyment nadine and raymond sat down beside her so thats miss king said mrs boynton why dont you go and speak to her ray she smiled unpleasantly raymonds face turned red i dont want to speak to her he said no said mrs boynton still smiling you wont speak to her you couldnt even if you wanted to she coughed suddenly im enjoying this trip nadine she said im very glad we came ray yes mother go and get me a magazine from that table raymond stood up and walked across the room close to sarah who looked up hopefully but raymond didnt look at her his face was white as he handed the magazine to his mother very softly mrs boynton said ah as she watched her sons face then she saw that nadine was looking at her and she said angrily wheres mr cope today i dont know i havent seen him said nadine calmly i like him said mrs boynton we must see him more often would you like that yes said nadine i like him too and whats the matter with lennox lately continued mrs boynton hes very quiet perhaps youd like to live in a house of your own nadine smiled but you wouldnt like that mother mrs boyntons face turned dark red i forgot my heart medicine she said get it for me nadine nadine stood up and went upstairs to get the medicine then she went into her own hotel room where she found her husband sitting by the window lennox we must leave said nadine to her husband we must get away it was a moment or two before lennox answered it seemed as if nadines words had a long way to travel before he heard them do we have to talk about this again yes we do said nadine lets go away i can work and earn money i want a life of my own with you your mother is mad she doesnt want you to be happy but mother cant live for ever said lennox her health is bad when she dies well get our share of my fathers money it may be too late by then said nadine too late for us to be happy lennox i love you are you going to choose me or your mother you know i love you nadine said lennox youre far too good for me if you dont want to leave said nadine i cant force you but i can leave in fact i think i will lennox stared at his wife for once he spoke quickly but you cant leave mother wouldnt let you she cant stop me said nadine i can do what i want nadine dont leave me dont leave me lennox spoke like a child nadine turned her head away so that he didnt see how upset she was then come with me lennox you can lennox turned away from his wife i cant he said i cant i dont have the courage chapter nine a few days later dr gerard and sarah king met at the travel agency where they were both arranging a visit to petra are there many other people going dr gerard asked sarah i think its just you me and two other women replied sarah enough people for one car once they had both made their travel arrangements they walked out into the sunshine ive been away for a few days explained dr gerard is there any news about the boyntons i think theyre leaving today said sarah and i dont know where theyre going she told dr gerard what had happened i feel stupid for trying to help carol she added can you ever really help someone else asked the doctor at least you tried from what you have said mrs boynton was very clever about her son lennox she invited nadine a pretty but poor young woman to stay and she even helped lennox and nadine get married but nadine has a strong personality and shes not afraid of mrs boynton im sure she hopes she can still escape they walked back to the hotel together and passed lennox nadine and mr cope who were standing next to some suitcases dr gerard went up to his room while sarah walked slowly into the hotel lounge there she saw mrs boynton sitting in a chair waiting to leave looking at her sarah suddenly felt angry mrs boynton was just a stupid old woman she was pathetic she didnt have any real power all she could do was hurt and control her own children she wasnt important to anyone else sarah went up to her goodbye mrs boynton she said i think youve been very silly trying to stop raymond and carol talking to me youre really rather pathetic its much better to be kind and friendly to people there was a long pause mrs boynton sat very still and when she finally spoke her voice could be heard very clearly her evil black eyes looked not directly at sarah but over sarahs shoulder i never forget said mrs boynton remember that i never forget anything an action a name or a face the way she spoke these words was so poisonous that sarah stepped back and then mrs boynton laughed it was a horrible laugh you poor old thing said sarah as she turned away as sarah walked towards the lift she met raymond boynton goodbye said sarah i hope you have a lovely time perhaps well meet again some day she smiled at him warmly and went up to her room raymond stood very still lost in thought he was standing in front of the lift and a small man with a big moustache had to speak to him several times before he noticed and moved out of the way just then carol appeared ray will you go and get ginevra shes in her room were leaving now all right said raymond ill go and find her he walked towards the lift hercule poirot with his eyebrows raised in surprise watched raymond as he left after a while he nodded his head as if he had decided something he walked through the lounge and looked at carol who was with her mother excuse me hercule poirot said to a passing waiter can you tell me who those people are the name is boynton monsieur they are americans thank you said hercule poirot up on the third floor of the hotel dr gerard passed raymond and ginevra boynton who were walking towards the open doors of the lift as they were about to get into it ginevra said just a minute ray wait for me in the lift she ran round the corner to dr gerard please help me ginevra said quickly theyre taking me away they want to kill me i dont belong to them my name isnt really boynton please help me to escape she stopped suddenly as she heard footsteps ginevra said rays voice the girl looked beautiful as she put a finger on her lips and looked sadly at dr gerard im coming ray she said and ran back to her brother dr gerard walked on to his room slowly he shook his head and frowned chapter ten sarah came down the stairs of the hotel ready to start the journey to petra outside she saw a large masterful woman who she knew was also staying at the hotel the woman was complaining loudly about the size of the car that was going to take them to petra it is much too small for four people and our guide the woman was saying take it away and bring us a bigger car the young man from the travel agency tried to argue but the woman wouldnt listen to him this car is not big enough she said i was promised that i would travel in a comfortable car so you will provide a comfortable car and at no extra cost the young man stopped trying to argue and left to find a bigger car looking very pleased the woman turned to sarah are you miss king she asked i am lady westholme sarah looked at lady westholme she had heard about her lord westholme her husband was a middleaged man who wasnt very clever he had met his wife whose name was mrs vansittart on a ship travelling back to england from america soon afterwards they were married when she realized that her husband was never going to be a success the new lady westholme was elected as a member of parliament she had strong opinions on everything especially womens rights she thought that women were just as good as men and always thought that she knew best everyone respected lady westholme but no one liked her just then dr gerard came out of the hotel and sarah introduced him to lady westholme then the fourth person going to petra arrived her name was miss amabel pierce a little middleaged woman with untidy grey hair she seemed rather vague and indecisive lady westholme took control do you have a job miss king i have just qualified as a doctor replied sarah good said lady westholme it is women who will achieve things in this world i myself am very organized and efficient just this morning i told the manager how he could improve things in our hotel lady westholme did seem to be efficient because in fifteen minutes a very large and comfortable car arrived lady westholme told the driver the best way to arrange their luggage and then they started the journey to petra after visiting the dead sea they stopped for lunch at the city of jericho while the others went to look at the city sarah stayed behind in the hotel garden she had a headache and was feeling miserable lady westholmes loud voice miss pierces chatter and even dr gerard were all annoying her and she wished she wasnt going to petra she wondered where the boyntons were now and what raymond was doing why am i thinking about people i wont see again thought sarah and why did i say those things to mrs boynton it was stupid of me and im sure other people heard what i said i think lady westholme was close by dr gerard returned and sat down wiping his hot face phew he said that woman is unbearable sarah jumped mrs boynton no i mean lady westholme said dr gerard how does her husband live with her ive heard that lord westholme is very proud of his wife and the work she does said sarah or perhaps he is pleased that her work takes her away from home suggested dr gerard shes still unbearable i just find her annoying said sarah shes so controlling and thinks she knows best but miss pierce is annoying too shes so vague and inefficient she told me that she used to teach very young children then a relative died and left her some money so now shes travelling and enjoying herself at this moment the others returned and after a short rest they all got back in the car and continued their journey the road went uphill twisting and turning late in the afternoon they reached the next town amman and went to bed soon after visiting a few sights the next morning they got up early ready to drive all day across the desert the day was hot and by the time they stopped for lunch it was even hotter the heat was making everyone annoyed with each other lady westholme and dr gerard had an argument about politics while sarah listened to miss pierce chatter on about nothing they reached the town of maan an hour before sunset and then drove on across the flat desert sarah wondered where the city of petra was she couldnt see any hills or mountains anywhere and petra was built into rock how much longer did they have to travel at the village of ain musa their guide mahmoud said that they were going to leave the car behind and ride on horses to petra miss pierce looked very uncomfortable sitting on her thin horse but lady westholme wore sensible riding breeches which did not suit her mahmoud led the horses along a path that went downhill sarah who was tired after the long hot drive in the car thought that the ride was like a dream the path twisted down and down until red cliffs rose high above them on both sides the path was deep and narrow and endless twisting through the tall red cliffs the sun went down and still they rode on lost deep down in the earth its not real thought sarah as lamps were lit so they could see i cant believe its real then suddenly the narrow cliffs were behind them and they arrived in a wide open space sarah could see lights far ahead of her that is our camp explained mahmoud after a while sarah could see some tents standing on a ridge of rock higher up against the cliff and there were some caves too in the rocks they were nearly there local bedouin servants came running out of tents as they approached sarah stared up at one of the caves she could see something or someone sitting there what was it was it a religious statue guarding the camp then sarahs heart beat faster she recognized the sitting figure and knew who it was mrs boynton chapter eleven mrs boynton was here at petra sarah couldnt believe it she found it hard to listen to the questions that people were asking her would she like dinner would she sleep in a tent or a cave sarah chose a tent and was taken there by one of the camp servants he wore a dirty coat and breeches much repaired and untidy puttees long strips of fabric wrapped round his lower legs on his head he wore the local cheffiyah a piece of cloth wrapped round his head to protect his face and neck from the sun and the desert sand in her tent sarah washed her face and combed her black hair which made her feel better then she stepped out into the dark night and started to walk to the large marquee to join the others for dinner you here sarah heard a low amazed voice she turned and looked straight into raymond boyntons eyes he looked so amazed and happy to see her that sarah was almost afraid she would remember that look for the rest of her life you raymond said again he looked dazed still only half believing sarahs heart beat faster and she felt very happy but also a little shy raymond came towards her and held her hand it is you raymond said its really you ive been thinking about you so much he paused i love you he said ive loved you since i first saw you on the train i didnt mean to ignore you or be rude to you it isnt my fault its my nerves when mother tells me to do things my nerves make me do them please dont hate me i know i should behave more like a man you will now sarah said to him her voice was sweet and sure youll have the courage now i know you will courage said raymond standing up tall yes thats what i need suddenly he kissed sarahs hand and then walked away sarah went to the marquee and found dr gerard miss pierce and lady westholme eating at the table mahmoud explained that the boyntons had been there two days they are americans mahmoud said the mother is very heavy and it was very hard work very hot to carry her here in a chair ha said lady westholme i think these americans were staying at our hotel ive seen the old woman before i think i saw you talking to her at the hotel miss king sarahs face went red she hoped lady westholme had not heard what she said to mrs boynton they arent very interesting people decided lady westholme and then talked about the famous and interesting americans she had met miss pierce listened and made noises now and then to show that she agreed because it became very hot later in the day the next morning sarah and the others got up early they had breakfast at six oclock where lady westholme complained that there wasnt any fruit there was no sign of the boynton family just as they left the camp they heard a shout and turned to see jefferson cope hurrying after them i was surprised to see you again dr gerard he said id like to come with you if you dont mind dr gerard introduced sarah to mr cope as they all began to climb uphill as well as mahmoud they had two local guides with them who knew the path very well it was very steep and sometimes dangerous a fall down the steep sides could kill you sarah and dr gerard didnt mind being so high up but lady westholme and miss pierce didnt like it miss pierce shut her eyes and her face turned green when she saw how high up they were dr gerard was very kind and helped her climb up the steepest places at last they arrived at the top and sarah breathed in the fresh morning air in amazement at the sight of the bloodred rocks all around and below them the country looked wild and strange it was different to anything they had ever seen before the whole world seemed to be at their feet this is the place of sacrifice the high place explained mahmoud he showed them the hole cut in the flat rock at their feet this is where animals were sacrificed killed to please the gods sarah sat down on a rock away from the others to look at the amazing views she was so lost in thought that she didnt hear dr gerard approach what are you thinking about he asked i was thinking about the place of sacrifice sarah replied sometimes people should be sacrificed death isnt always as important as we think it is if thats what you really think said dr gerard you should not be a doctor to us death is always the enemy yes i suppose you are right sighed sarah just then jefferson cope joined them this is a remarkable place he said im very glad i came because of her bad health mrs boynton cant climb up here and she doesnt let her family do anything without her mr cope stopped his nice kind face looked uncomfortable you know he said someone in the hotel told me a story about mrs boynton that upset me indeed said dr gerard what was it i was told that mrs boynton had a young woman working for her as a servant the woman was going to have a baby at first mrs boynton was very kind to her but just before the baby was born she threw the young woman out of the house i think that is a very cruel and heartless thing to do continued mr cope and i dont understand why she did it im sure mrs boynton enjoyed it very much said dr gerard she seems to like being cruel to people mr cope looked shocked i think dr gerard he said walking away that ill look at the view from over there dr gerard smiled and looked at sarah her face was very serious as if she had decided something now miss pierce came towards them were going down now she said nervously mahmoud says going down is easier and we follow a different path the path down was indeed easier and there were no steep places to worry about they arrived back at the camp tired but happy and ready for lunch it was past two oclock the boynton family was in the marquee finishing their lunch lady westholme spoke to them kindly but as if they were rather stupid we had a very interesting morning she said petra is a wonderful place carol answered oh yes yes it is that was the end of the conversation as they ate the four discussed their plans for the afternoon i will rest said miss pierce its important not to do too much ill go for a walk and explore said sarah what about you dr gerard ill go with you said the doctor mrs boynton suddenly dropped a spoon loudly and everyone jumped i think said lady westholme that i too will rest this afternoon perhaps ill go for a walk later on slowly with the help of lennox mrs boynton stood up you can all go for a walk this afternoon she said to her family smiling it was almost funny to see how surprised they all looked but what about you mother asked carol i dont need any of you said mrs boynton ill sit alone and read ginevra you can stay go and lie down get some sleep but mother im not tired said ginevra i want to go with the others you are tired said mrs boynton youve got a headache go and sleep i know whats best for you ginevra stared at her mother for a while then did as she was told she left the marquee and the rest of the family slowly followed her what strange people said miss pierce the mothers face looks very red perhaps she has a bad heart the heat must be very bad for her health why is mrs boynton letting the family go for a walk thought sarah to herself she knows raymond wants to be with me why is she planning something since last night sarah had realized that she loved raymond boynton and would do anything to protect him and make him happy after lunch sarah went to her tent and changed her clothes she returned to the marquee at about quarter past three lady westholme was sitting in a chair reading a dull officiallooking report despite the heat she was still wearing her thick wool skirt dr gerard was talking to miss pierce who was standing by her tent holding a book called the journey of love an exciting story of romance and passion i will lie down later said miss pierce its cool and pleasant here in the shadow of the marquee oh dear she continued do you think that old lady is wise to sit in the sun up there its very hot they all looked at the ridge in front of them where mrs boynton was sitting like a statue in front of her cave just as she had done the night before all the camp servants were asleep and there was no one else in sight except for a small group of people walking together a short distance away i wonder why mrs boynton has allowed her family to go off and enjoy themselves said dr gerard to sarah is she planning something new thats just what i thought said sarah do you want to walk with them yes said dr gerard theyre not far ahead well catch them up for once the boyntons looked happy and relaxed soon lennox and nadine carol and raymond mr cope sarah and dr gerard were all laughing and talking together everyone was enjoying their unexpected freedom sarah walked with carol and lennox dr gerard talked to raymond and nadine and jefferson cope walked a little apart soon however dr gerard stopped im very sorry he said but i must go back to the camp i can feel an attack of malaria coming on i caught it in africa shall i come with you asked sarah no no said dr gerard ill go back and take some medicine some quinine i have some in my medicine bag please enjoy your walk he turned and quickly walked back towards the camp sarah wondered whether or not she should follow but then she looked at raymond and forgot about the doctor after staying with the others for a while sarah and raymond walked away together they sat down on a rock in the shade they talked to each other about their lives and then sat holding hands in silence the sun was getting lower in the sky im going back now said raymond by myself theres something i have to say and do but i must do it and do it alone do what asked sarah ive got to prove my courage said raymond he looked very serious and i must do it now he stood up suddenly and quickly walked away sarah was a little afraid raymond had been so serious the sun was setting when sarah came back to the camp she saw that mrs boynton was still sitting outside her cave sarah hurried past on the path below to the marquee inside lady westholme was telling miss pierce her opinions on changing the divorce laws the boyntons were sitting and reading sarah went back to her tent to wash before dinner and then went to visit dr gerard she stopped outside the doctors tent and called his name quietly there was no answer sarah looked inside the tent and saw dr gerard lying still on his bed she hoped he was asleep and went away quietly in the marquee everyone was there except dr gerard and mrs boynton a servant was sent to tell the old lady that dinner was ready after a few minutes there was a sudden noise and two servants ran up to mahmoud looking frightened there was some excited speech in arabic mahmoud went outside and sarah followed him whats the matter she asked can i help the old lady is very ill said mahmoud she cannot move ill come and see said sarah she followed mahmoud up the ridge to the old womans cave sarah touched mrs boyntons hand and felt for her pulse there was no sign of life sarahs face was pale as she went into the marquee im sorry she said to the boyntons but your mother is dead she watched the faces of the five people who were now free part two chapter one hercule poirot had arrived at the town of amman and was staying with colonel carbury who was the man in charge of the area colonel carbury had gentle blue eyes and a bald head and was very untidy the colonel smiled across the table at his guest ill be very happy to show you around he said to hercule poirot there are some very interesting things to see the two men had a drink and then after a pause colonel carbury asked does your profession follow you around poirot i mean do you often find dead bodies when you are on holiday it has happened a few times yes admitted poirot theres a dead body here that im not happy about said the colonel its an old american woman who died at petra its very likely that she died a natural death but i think her family killed her no one liked her but if she was murdered it will be very difficult to prove still i want to know what happened hercule poirot nodded was there a doctor there he asked yes there were two doctors replied colonel carbury one was ill with malaria and the other a young woman is just qualified but the old womans death wasnt unexpected her health was bad and she was taking medicine for her heart so why my friend are you worried asked poirot gently have you heard of dr theodore gerard the colonel asked him yes replied poirot he is very famous well hes the doctor who was ill with malaria ill phone him and ask him to come and tell you his story when colonel carbury had used the phone poirot said tell me about this american family the family name is boynton answered the colonel there are two sons one married and two daughters boynton interrupted poirot that is strange very strange the mother was an unpleasant old woman continued the colonel she had all the money and made her family do everything she wanted aha said poirot that is interesting do you know who inherits her money its divided equally between all the family said colonel carbury so maybe just one of them killed her or maybe they all helped or maybe im completely wrong chapter two when dr gerard arrived colonel carbury introduced him to hercule poirot tell monsieur poirot the facts the colonel said to the doctor hes very interested i am always interested in crime admitted poirot as the three men sat down with a drink well said dr gerard ill tell you my story and you can see what you think he told poirot everything that had happened before and after his arrival at petra and then described his return to the camp on the afternoon of mrs boyntons death i was very ill with malaria dr gerard continued when i got to my tent i couldnt find my medicine bag for a while it wasnt where i left it when i did find it i opened the bag but i couldnt find my syringe i was going to inject myself with quinine i looked for the syringe for a while but finally drank the quinine instead and lay down on my bed dr gerard paused mrs boynton had been sitting in the same place and hadnt moved all afternoon he continued we didnt know she was dead until sixthirty when one of the servants went to tell her that dinner was ready miss sarah king who is a qualified doctor looked at the body and decided that mrs boynton had been dead for some time how long exactly had mrs boynton been dead asked poirot miss king didnt think that was important said dr gerard but when was she last seen alive said poirot colonel carbury read from an officiallooking document lady westholme and miss pierce spoke to mrs boynton shortly after four oclock he said lennox boynton spoke to his mother about fourthirty and his wife nadine talked to her about five minutes later carol boynton also spoke to her mother but doesnt know when we think it was about ten minutes past five jefferson cope an american friend of the family returned to the camp with lady westholme and miss pierce and saw that mrs boynton was asleep he did not speak to her that was about twenty to six it seems that raymond boynton the younger son was the last person to see his mother alive he returned from a walk and spoke to her at about ten minutes to six did anyone go near mrs boynton after her son raymond asked poirot i dont think so from six oclock servants were busy and people were going to and from their tents no one saw anyone approach the old lady so raymond boynton was the last person to see his mother alive said poirot dr gerard and colonel carbury looked at each other but theres a problem said dr gerard miss king said that mrs boynton had been dead for some time but when i told her that raymond had spoken to his mother just before six she said that was impossible mrs boynton was already dead by then that is very curious said poirot what does raymond boynton say about that he swears that his mother was alive said colonel carbury raymond said something like im back i hope you had a nice afternoon he says that his mother answered quite all right and he went on to his tent curious said poirot again with a frown and when did you see the body dr gerard not until nine oclock the next morning replied the doctor by then it was impossible to say how long mrs boynton had been dead all i can say is that she had been dead for at least twelve hours but not dead more than eighteen hours and that doesnt help go on dr gerard said colonel carbury tell poirot everything else when i got up in the morning said dr gerard i found my syringe behind some bottles on my table he leaned forward perhaps i was too ill to see it the day before i was shaking and had a fever but im sure the syringe was not there the day before and there was a mark on mrs boyntons wrist that could have been made by a syringe carol boynton says the mark was made by a pin ah said poirot please continue and finally said dr gerard when i looked in my medicine bag i saw that some of my drug digitalin was missing and injecting someone with a large dose of digitalin causes death by stopping the heart mrs boynton already had a bad heart i believe said poirot yes she did replied dr gerard in fact she was taking a medicine containing digitalin if she took too much medicine over time she may have died of digitalin poisoning but a medical examination would not show it colonel carbury looked at poirot so whats your expert opinion he asked was it murder or not wait said poirot i too have some evidence he smiled at their look of surprise at the window of my hotel room in jerusalem i heard a voice which said dont you agree that shes got to be killed at the time i did not think these words were about a real murder but now i am not so sure poirot paused and i believe i know who spoke those words he said it was a young man i later saw in the hotel raymond boynton chapter three so raymond boynton said that exclaimed colonel carbury he is definitely the most obvious suspect it will be difficult to prove anything but if it is murder we must do something what do you think dr gerard asked poirot mrs boynton was an unpleasant woman and with a weak heart she could have died at any time said dr gerard slowly now she is dead her family are free so you are satisfied said poirot no said dr gerard hitting the table with his hand i am not satisfied i am a doctor i try to save life not to take it it is not right for a human being to die before her time has come dr gerard doesnt like murder said colonel carbury pouring them more drinks and neither do i very well said poirot i will find out exactly who killed mrs boynton if she was killed i will find out the truth how will you do that asked dr gerard i will carefully examine the evidence and use method and reason replied poirot first i need to decide whether this murder was planned and carried out by all the boynton family or just one of them if its just one of them said dr gerard its most likely to be raymond boynton i agree said poirot the words i overheard and the fact that his story does not fit with miss kings story make him the obvious suspect tell me dr gerard are raymond boynton and miss king attracted to each other the frenchman nodded definitely they seem to like each other very much aha i believe i have seen miss king in the solomon hotel after she spoke to raymond boynton he stood still as if in a dream blocking the exit from the lift three times i had to say pardon before he heard me and moved poirot thought for a moment so miss king is involved with the boynton family and could have wanted mrs boynton to die we must remember that when we consider her medical evidence colonel carbury coughed can i interrupt he asked those words you overheard dont you agree that shes got to be killed who was raymond boyton speaking to a good point said poirot i had not forgotten it he must have been speaking to a member of his family dr gerard can you tell us about the boyntons from a professional point of view as a doctor raymond and carol boynton were in a very nervous state said the doctor lennox boynton appeared to have given up hope he was lifeless and quiet i believe that nadine his wife was deciding whether or not to leave her husband he described his conversation with jefferson cope and what about the younger daughter ginevra asked poirot dr gerard looked serious she may have a mental illness called schizophrenia he said she is trying to escape her real life by living in a fantasy world she says she is in danger with enemies all around her but they all know who did it said colonel carbury unexpectedly theyre all hiding something they will tell me what they know said poirot confidently when they talk people normally tell the truth because it is easier than telling lies all the time and so the truth becomes clear but there may be no proof once i know the truth said the colonel i can decide what to do next but i cant give you much time i can only keep everyone here in amman for another twentyfour hours you will have the truth by tomorrow night said poirot quietly chapter four hercule poirot was interviewing everyone in a hotel room in amman sarah king was first i dont understand why im talking to you she said i know youre an expert on crime monsieur poirot but there was nothing strange about mrs boyntons death the journey to petra was too much for a woman with a bad heart and if theres any doubt you can have an official medical examination in jerusalem but there is something that dr gerard has not told you explained poirot a supply of digitalin is missing from his medicine bag oh said sarah thinking for a moment is dr gerard sure he was ill with malaria at the time he looked in his bag on the night he arrived in petra he is almost certain that the digitalin was there then almost said sarah poirot shrugged his shoulders yes there is a doubt as any honest person would feel sarah nodded yes she agreed people who always feel sure about things cant always be trusted but monsieur poirot there is very little evidence do you really need to be involved havent the boyntons suffered enough so you think that the very unpleasant mrs boynton is better dead than alive asked poirot but to me it does not matter what the victim is like good or bad i do not approve of murder murder sarah breathed in quickly why do you think that there is other evidence mademoiselle replied poirot there is the mark of a syringe on the dead womans wrist and i myself heard raymond boynton say dont you agree that shes got to be killed so that is why i am investigating mrs boyntons death will you help me sarahs face had turned pale but after a pause she nodded yes she said quietly i think what youre doing is right thank you mademoiselle replied poirot now please tell me what you remember about that day sarah thought for a moment in the morning we went out with mahmoud none of the boyntons were with us i saw them at lunch they were finishing as we came in mrs boynton seemed strangely cheerful and she let her family go for a walk it was very unusual why do you think she did that asked poirot i was puzzled admitted sarah i thought she must be planning something then the boyntons left all except ginevra who went to lie down in her tent dr gerard and i joined the others on their walk at about halfpast three where was mrs boynton then asked poirot she was sitting in her chair outside her cave said sarah dr gerard and i walked with the others for a while and then dr gerard became ill and went back to the camp at about four the rest of us went on walking were you all together poirot asked we were at first said sarah then nadine boynton and mr cope went one way and carol lennox raymond and i went another later raymond and i sat down alone on a rock together and when raymond left i stayed to look at the view at about halfpast five i thought i should go back to the camp and arrived at six it was just about sunset did you see mrs boynton as you came back to the camp yes replied sarah she was still sitting outside her cave i went to the marquee everyone was there except dr gerard i washed in my tent and then came back to the marquee one of the servants went to tell mrs boynton about dinner and came running back to say she was ill i hurried out to help but as soon as i touched her i knew she was dead because she had a heart problem i thought she could have died in her sleep did you have an opinion on how long mrs boynton had been dead not really said sarah though she had clearly been dead for over an hour perhaps longer over an hour said poirot do you know mademoiselle king that raymond boynton spoke to his mother about half an hour earlier and says that she was then alive and well sarah didnt look at poirot but she shook her head raymond must have made a mistake it must have been earlier than that no mademoiselle it was not poirot noticed that sarahs mouth was very firm and determined well said sarah im young and i havent seen many dead bodies but im sure that mrs boynton had been dead at least an hour if not more so can you explain said hercule poirot why raymond boynton said that his mother was alive when she was dead ive no idea said sarah all the boyntons are rather vague about times theyre a very nervous family and did you ever speak to mrs boynton poirot inquired sarahs face reddened yes i did on the day mrs boynton left jerusalem she admitted i made myself look very silly sarah unwillingly told poirot what had happened he seemed interested and asked lots of questions it is important for me to understand mrs boynton and know how her mind worked explained poirot your opinion of her is valuable thank you for your help mademoiselle i will now speak to the other witnesses sarah stood up excuse me monsieur poirot but why dont you wait until after the official medical examination then you will know if mrs boynton was murdered or not poirot waved his hand importantly this is the method of hercule poirot he announced sarah frowned and left the room chapter five lady westholme entered next looking confident and important she was followed by miss amabel pierce who sat down slightly behind lady westholme in the background i am happy to help you monsieur poirot said lady westholme loudly it is my public duty she talked about her public duty for some time before poirot managed to ask her exactly what happened that afternoon after lunch i decided to rest said lady westholme the morning had been quite tiring miss pierce agreed with me oh yes sighed miss pierce i was very tired after the morning it was such a dangerous and exhausting climb so after lunch you both went to your tents poirot asked yes replied lady westholme was mrs boynton then sitting at the mouth of her cave yes she was said lady westholme could you both see mrs boynton oh yes said miss pierce she was opposite you know a little way along and up above lady westholme explained the caves were up on a higher ridge of rock below the ridge were some tents then there was a small river only a stream really and across that stream was the marquee and some other tents miss pierce and i had tents near the marquee she was on the right side of the marquee and i was on the left the opening of our tents faced the ridge but of course it was some distance away nearly two hundred yards i believe said poirot i have a plan of the camp here it says that lennox boynton and his wife nadine were staying in the cave next to mrs boyntons below but more to the right almost opposite the marquee were the tents of raymond carol and ginevra boynton on the right of ginevra boyntons tent was dr gerards and next to his tent was that of miss king on the other side of the stream next to the marquee on the left is your tent lady westholme and the tent of mr cope miss pierces tent was on the right of the marquee is that correct lady westholme agreed that it was thank you that is perfectly clear please continue lady westholme at about quarter to four i went to miss pierces tent to see if she wanted to go for a walk said lady westholme miss pierce was sitting in the entrance of her tent reading we agreed to start in about half an hour when the sun was less hot i went back to my tent and read for about twentyfive minutes then i joined miss pierce and we went for a walk everyone in the camp seemed asleep there was no one about when i saw mrs boynton sitting up there alone i suggested to miss pierce that we should ask her if she wanted anything before we left yes you did it was very thoughtful of you agreed miss pierce but she was so rude about it as we walked under the ridge explained lady westholme i asked if we could do anything for her do you know monsieur poirot the only answer she gave us was a grunt a grunt she just looked at us as though we were as though we were nothing it was really very rude said miss pierce turning red i think you were right to say what you did i said to miss pierce that perhaps mrs boynton was drunk said lady westholme her behaviour was very strange had mrs boyntons behaviour been strange earlier that day at lunchtime perhaps asked poirot nno said lady westholme thinking no her behaviour then had been fairly normal she was very angry with that servant said miss pierce just before we left the camp oh yes i remember she did seem very annoyed with him of course continued lady westholme it is difficult when servants dont speak english but when you are travelling you must be patient with foreigners what servant was this asked poirot one of the bedouin servants in the camp said lady westholme he went up to mrs boynton and she was very angry i dont know why the poor man went away as fast as he could and she shook her stick at him and called out what did she say we were too far away to hear at least i didnt hear anything did you miss pierce no i didnt i think mrs boynton had asked him to get something from her daughter ginevras tent or perhaps she was angry because he went into her daughters tent i dont know exactly what did he look like poirot asked miss pierce she shook her head really i dont know he was too far away he was a man of more than average height said lady westholme and wore the usual bedouin cheffiyah round his head his breeches were very torn and had been much repaired shocking and his puttees were very untidy these men need to be managed better could you tell me which servant it was i dont think so said lady westholme we didnt see his face it was too far away i wonder said poirot thoughtfully what he did to make mrs boynton so angry we will have to find out please continue lady westholme we walked along slowly said lady westholme and then we met dr gerard he looked very ill he was shaking added miss pierce shaking all over i saw at once that he had malaria said lady westholme i offered to go back to the camp with him and get him some quinine but he said he had some with him poor man said miss pierce it seems wrong for a doctor to be ill we walked on continued lady westholme and then we sat down on a rock with a very good view of all the scenery though we could still see the camp so romantic murmured miss pierce a camp in the middle of the rosered rocks did you see anyone else poirot inquired yes said lady westholme lennox boynton and his wife passed us on their way back to the camp were they together no lennox boynton came first he looked as if he had too much sun he was walking as though he was dizzy what did lennox boynton do when he returned to the camp asked poirot this time miss pierce managed to speak first he went to see his mother but he stayed only a minute or two she said then he went into his cave and after that he went down to the marquee said lady westholme what did his wife nadine do asked poirot she passed us a few minutes later said lady westholme she stopped and spoke to us quite politely i think shes very nice said miss pierce very nice indeed did you watch nadine boynton return to the camp yes she went up and spoke to mrs boynton for about ten minutes said lady westholme after that she went down to the marquee where her husband was what happened next inquired poirot that strange american mr cope came along said lady westholme he told us there were some interesting ruins nearby and took us to see them then we walked back to the camp at about twenty minutes to six was mrs boynton still sitting where you had left her asked poirot yes lady westholme replied but i didnt speak to her i went to my tent changed my shoes and got out my own packet of china tea i then went to the marquee and told mahmoud to make some tea and to make sure the water was boiled properly was there anyone in the marquee poirot asked oh yes lennox and nadine boynton were sitting at one end reading and carol boynton was there too and mr cope he had some tea with us said miss pierce though he said teadrinking wasnt an american habit and then what happened said poirot raymond and ginevra boynton came in shortly afterwards said lady westholme miss king arrived last when dinner was ready one of the servants was sent to tell mrs boynton the man came running back with his colleague and spoke to mahmoud who went out with miss king when she came back miss king told mrs boyntons family that she was dead and what did mrs boyntons family do when they heard the news asked poirot for the first time lady westholme and miss pierce didnt know what to say well said lady westholme uncertainly they they were very quiet they all went out with miss king miss pierce and i very sensibly stayed where we were miss pierce looked regretful she had obviously wanted to go and see what was happening later finished lady westholme we had dinner before the boynton family so they could eat alone after dinner i miss pierce and miss king went back to our tents while mr cope as a friend of the family stayed with the boyntons thats all i know monsieur poirot when miss king told them of the death of their mother did all the boynton family leave the marquee poirot asked lady westholme yes no i think that the youngest girl ginevra stayed behind do you remember miss pierce yes i think i am quite sure she did what did ginevra boynton do asked poirot did she say anything no lady westholme frowned she er she just sat there she twisted her fingers together said miss pierce suddenly she didnt show anything on her face but her hands were twisting and turning is there anything else monsieur poirot asked lady westholme poirot had been thinking no nothing he said you have been very clear and certain i have an excellent memory said lady westholme with satisfaction one last thing lady westholme said poirot please do not look round can you describe what miss pierce is wearing today lady westholme looked annoyed but said miss pierce is wearing a striped brown and white cotton dress and a belt of red blue and beige leather she is wearing beige silk stockings and brown leather shoes there is a hole in her left stocking she is wearing a bright blue necklace and a silver butterfly ring on the third finger of her right hand lady westholme paused is there anything else she asked coldly excellent madame said poirot you see everything lady westholme stood up and left the room miss pierce looking down sadly at her left stocking started to follow one moment please mademoiselle said poirot yes miss pierce looked up nervously poirot leaned forward do you see these wild flowers on the table yes said miss pierce staring and you noticed that when you first came into the room i sneezed once or twice yes did you notice if i had just been smelling these flowers well really i dont know but you remember that i sneezed oh yes i remember that ah well it is of no importance i just wondered if these flowers gave me hay fever hay fever said miss pierce i remember a cousin of mine had it very badly with some difficulty poirot finally got rid of miss pierce but i did not sneeze he said quietly when he had shut the door no i did not sneeze chapter six lennox boynton came into the room with a quick confident step instead of looking exhausted he now looked lively and wide awake and nervous good morning monsieur boynton poirot stood up politely thank you for talking to me why are you asking everyone questions lennox said crossly thats what i want to know if you do not want to answer poirot said lennox boynton said quickly no not at all only it seems all so unnecessary i understand replied poirot but it is just a matter of routine now on the afternoon of your mothers death i believe you left the camp at petra and went for a walk yes we all went except mother and ginevra was your mother then sitting outside her cave yes she sat there every afternoon said lennox when did you leave the camp asked poirot soon after three i believe and when did you return from your walk i dont know what time it was said lennox four or five oclock perhaps about an hour or two after i left did you pass anyone on your way back two ladies sitting on a rock for instance i dont know yes i think i did did you speak to your mother when you got back to the camp yes yes i did she did not complain of feeling ill no no she seemed perfectly all right may i ask what you both said lennox paused she said i was back soon i said yes i was he paused again thinking hard i said it was hot she she asked me the time said her watch had stopped i took it from her wound it up set the time and put it back on her wrist poirot interrupted and what time was it it it was twentyfive minutes to five so you do know exactly the time you returned to the camp said poirot gently lennox reddened yes how stupid of me im sorry monsieur poirot i cant think properly all this worry oh i understand said poirot quickly and what happened next i asked my mother if she wanted anything continued lennox she said no then i went to the marquee none of the servants seemed to be there i drank some water and sat there reading the old newspapers and i think i fell asleep then nadine came in and you did not see your mother alive again asked poirot no did she seem annoyed or upset when you talked to her no she was exactly as usual she did not speak about any trouble with one of the servants lennox stared no nothing at all and that is all you can tell me i am afraid so yes thank you monsieur boynton that is all lennox didnt seem to want to go er theres nothing else nothing replied poirot please could you ask your wife to come in next as lennox went out slowly poirot wrote on the paper beside him lb pm chapter seven poirot looked with interest at the tall calm young woman who entered the room and sat down i hope you do not mind madame talking to me at this sad time nadine boynton looked at him thoughtfully after a pause she said i will be honest with you monsieur poirot i did not love my motherinlaw mrs boynton and i am not sorry that she is dead thank you madame for speaking so openly but i do blame myself continued nadine i was the cause of my motherinlaws death you could even say that i killed her poirot leaned back in his chair will you explain that more clearly madame nadine bent her head my married life she said has not been happy i thought that mrs boynton had too much power over my husband on the afternoon of mrs boyntons death i decided to leave lennox and go away with my friend mr cope i walked home to the camp by myself and saw my motherinlaw sitting alone so i told her what i was going to do was she surprised inquired poirot yes she was very shocked said nadine and she was angry very angry after a while i refused to talk to her any more and walked away her voice became quieter i i never saw her alive again poirot nodded his head slowly i see he said so you think mrs boynton died because of the shock it seems certain to me replied nadine it was a difficult journey to petra and my news and her anger killed her and what exactly did you do when you left mrs boynton poirot asked i went down to the marquee my husband lennox was there poirot watched her closely as he asked did you tell your husband that you had decided to leave him or had you already told him there was a very short pause before nadine said i told him then he was very upset but he he didnt say very much you see we both knew that something like this might happen after a long pause poirot asked do you own a syringe madame yes i mean no said nadine uneasily i do have an old syringe in my luggage but i left it behind in jerusalem why did you ask me that monsieur poirot instead of answering poirot asked another question mrs boynton was taking medicine containing digitalin for her heart trouble yes said nadine she was answering his questions very carefully now so if mrs boynton had taken a big overdose of digitalin nadine interrupted him quickly and definitely she did not she was always very careful and so was i the chemist who prepared the medicine may have made a mistake we can analyse what is left in the bottle unfortunately the bottle was broken said nadine indeed who broke it asked poirot i dont know one of the servants i think when mrs boyntons body was carried into her cave there was a good deal of confusion and the light was poor the table fell over poirot looked at her that he said is very interesting nadine boynton moved in her chair do you think mrs boynton died of an overdose of digitalin she asked it doesnt seem very likely poirot leaned forward even when i tell you that some digitalin was missing from dr gerards medicine bag nadines face grew pale and she sat very still monsieur poirot i did not kill my motherinlaw many people can tell you that she was alive and well when i left her so please i am asking you to stop your investigation if you continue you will destroy peoples peace and happiness cant you say that mrs boynton died a natural death poirot sat up straight and his eyes looked very green let me be clear madame you think that mrs boynton was murdered and yet you are asking me to say nothing nadine said passionately you dont understand she was evil i do not care what she was like exclaimed poirot no one has the right to take the life of another person i will not accept murder that is the final word of hercule poirot nadine stood up her dark eyes flashing with sudden fire then you will ruin the lives of innocent people i have nothing more to say but you do madame what happened after you left mrs boynton while you and your husband were in the marquee together she looked straight into his eyes i know nothing monsieur poirot nadine turned and left the room chapter eight after writing nb on his paper poirot looked up to see carol boynton enter the room as she sat down poirot looked with interest at carols redbrown hair and nervous hands her face had no colour or expression now mademoiselle poirot said will you please tell me what you did that afternoon carols answer came quickly as if she had practised it before after lunch we all went for a walk i returned to the camp poirot interrupted were you all together until then no i was with my brother raymond and miss king for most of the time then i walked off on my own and what time did you return to the camp i believe it was just about ten minutes past five poirot wrote down cb and what then my mother was still sitting in front of her cave said carol i went up and spoke to her and then went on to my tent can you remember exactly what you both said i just said it was very hot and that i was going to lie down my mother said she would stay where she was was there anything about her that seemed unusual or different asked poirot no at least carol paused she was a strange colour her face was redder than usual she may have had a shock perhaps suggested poirot did she say anything about trouble with one of the servants no no nothing at all poirot continued and what did you do next mademoiselle i went to my tent and lay down for about half an hour then i went down to the marquee lennox and nadine were there reading i looked at a magazine did you speak to your mother again on your way to the marquee asked poirot no i went straight down i didnt even look at her then i stayed in the marquee until until miss king told us she was dead thats all i know poirot leaned forward and what did you feel mademoiselle when you found that your mother pardon your stepmother was dead carol said uncertainly it was a great shock was it carols face went red she stared at poirot helplessly with fear in her eyes was it such a great shock mademoiselle do you remember a conversation you had with your brother raymond one night in jerusalem his guess was right he knew from the way her face went white how do you know about that she whispered part of your conversation was overheard oh carol hid her face in her hands and started to cry hercule poirot waited a minute then he said quietly you were both planning to kill your stepmother carol sobbed out brokenly we were mad mad that evening she sat up and pushed her hair from her face you dont understand what it was like travelling made it so obvious how different we were to other people and ginevra mother was making her worse ray and i were afraid that ginevra was going mad that evening in jerusalem ray and i were overexcited we thought that killing mother was the right thing to do but we didnt really do it the next day it seemed stupid and wrong mother died naturally of heart failure monsieur poirot ray and i had nothing to do with it will you swear to me mademoiselle said poirot quietly that mrs boynton did not die as the result of any action of yours carol lifted her head i swear she said steadily that i never harmed her poirot leaned back in his chair and thoughtfully stroked his moustache what exactly was your plan he asked in his mind he counted the seconds before carol answered one two three we didnt have a plan said carol at last we never got that far poirot stood up that is all mademoiselle will you tell your brother to come in next carol went slowly to the door monsieur poirot you do believe me she said passionately ive told you the truth i have hercule poirot did not answer and carol boynton went slowly out of the room chapter nine poirot noted the family similarity between carol and her brother when raymond boynton came into the room raymonds face was serious but he didnt seem nervous or afraid your sister carol has spoken with you poirot asked gently raymond nodded yes if you overheard our conversation in jerusalem i dont blame you for being suspicious i can only say that the conversation was was madness planning to kill my stepmother oh how can i explain we were under so much stress that just talking about it made us feel better hercule poirot nodded his head slowly that he said is possible in the morning it all seemed rather stupid i swear to you monsieur poirot that i never thought about it again the facts are that i spoke to my mother just before six oclock when she was alive and well i went to my tent had a wash and joined the others in the marquee from that time neither carol nor i moved everyone could see us so my mothers death was natural heart failure it couldnt be anything else but miss king said poirot quietly said that when she examined the body at sixthirty your mother had been dead for at least an hour if not longer raymond stared at him totally shocked sarah said that he gasped but its impossible she must be mistaken my mother was alive just before six and i spoke to her he leaned forward monsieur poirot people die every day especially people with weak hearts and there is nothing strange about it mothers death only seems suspicious because you overheard what i said poirot shook his head you are wrong he said there is other evidence poison taken from the medicine bag of dr gerard poison ray stared at him poison he looked completely shocked is that what you suspect poirot said quietly so your plan was different oh yes raymond answered without thinking this changes everything i i cant think clearly what was your plan our plan it was raymond stopped suddenly and his eyes became wary i dont think he said that ill say any more as you please said poirot as he watched the young man leave the room on his paper he wrote rb then he wrote a list boyntons and jefferson cope leave the camp about dr gerard and sarah king leave the camp about lady westholme and miss pierce leave the camp dr gerard returns to the camp about lennox boynton returns to the camp nadine boynton returns to the camp and talks to mrs boynton nadine boynton leaves mrs boynton and goes to the marquee about carol boynton returns to the camp lady westholme miss pierce and jefferson cope return to the camp raymond boynton returns to the camp sarah king returns to the camp mrs boyntons body is discovered chapter ten next hercule poirot spoke to the guide mahmoud whose english wasnt very good but who liked to talk it was a while before poirot could ask a question no i do not think any servants were about at halfpast five said mahmoud lunch is late two oclock and then all afternoon sleep we all go to sleep by halfpast three at five i get up but no one is there they all go walking for me that is good i can go back to sleep at quarter to six trouble begin large english lady very important lady comes back and wants tea she always complains says water must be boiling i have to do it myself ah what a life what a life i do all i can always i am blamed i have another question said poirot the dead lady was angry with one of the servants do you know which servant it was and what it was about i do not know mahmoud replied old lady did not complain to me could you find out no that would be impossible none of the servants would admit it if the old lady was angry then naturally they would not tell abdul say it was mohammed and mohammed say it was aziz and aziz say it was aissa and so on poirot finally managed to escape from mahmoud and went to talk to colonel carbury in his office detecting crime is sometimes very easy said poirot all i have to do is let the criminal talk and he will tell me everything briefly poirot told the colonel about the interviews he had had that morning raymond boynton is definitely the most likely person said the colonel in a detective story he would certainly be innocent do you read detective stories poirot asked thousands of them said colonel carbury he added hopefully can you write a list of significant facts like they do in detective stories you know facts that dont seem to mean anything but are really very important ah said poirot kindly i will do that for you with pleasure on a piece of paper he wrote significant facts mrs boynton was taking a medicine containing digitalin dr gerards syringe was missing mrs boynton definitely enjoyed stopping her family having a good time with other people mrs boynton on the afternoon of her death encouraged her family to go away and enjoy themselves mrs boynton enjoyed being cruel to people the distance from the marquee to the place where mrs boynton was sitting is about two hundred yards lennox boynton said at first he did not know what time he returned to the camp but later he admitted setting his mothers watch to the right time dr gerard and ginevra boynton were staying in tents next door to each other at halfpast six when dinner was ready a servant was sent to tell mrs boynton excellent said colonel carbury smiling widely i dont understand it at all and you mention the servants a few times i hope one of them didnt kill mrs boynton that wouldnt be fair poirot smiled but did not answer as he left the office he said to himself incredible the english never grow up chapter eleven sarah king was sitting on a hill picking wild flowers and dr gerard sat on a rough wall of stones near her sarah looked up that little mans coming up the hill she said i suppose hes looking for us poirot reached them at last wiping his hot forehead before looking sadly at his expensive leather shoes this stony country he said my poor shoes why do you wear shoes like that in the desert asked sarah i like to be welldressed poirot answered women do not look their best in the desert said dr gerard thoughtfully miss king always looks welldressed but lady westholme wears such thick coats skirts and boots and those terrible riding breeches and poor miss pierce her clothes are so pale and dull and she wears too much jewellery i dont think monsieur poirot climbed up here to talk about clothes said sarah true said poirot i came to ask you both about mrs boynton i have a feeling that the way her mind worked is very important in this case from my point of view she was certainly very interesting said dr gerard he described his own interest in the boynton family and his conversation with jefferson cope he had no idea about the hate and unhappiness in the boynton family explained the doctor but i think that on the journey to petra mr cope was beginning to realize what mrs boynton was really like he told them what mr cope had said about mrs boyntons behaviour to the servant and her baby that story about the servant is interesting said poirot thoughtfully it shows how cruel mrs boynton could be but i do not understand why did mrs boynton arrange this trip abroad when she knew it would be more difficult to control her family dr gerard leaned forward excitedly she was bored he exclaimed she needed a new challenge mrs boynton wanted her family to rebel so she could use her power to control them once again poirot took a deep breath yes i see exactly what you mean mrs boynton chose to live dangerously and now she is dead just then they saw a girl wandering along the side of the hill her redgold hair shone in the sunlight and a strange secret smile was on her lovely mouth how beautiful she is said dr gerard she has a face to dream of as i once did when i was ill with malaria i opened my eyes and saw her face with its sweet strange smile i was sorry to wake up from my dream then he added that is ginevra boynton chapter twelve a few minutes later ginevra boynton reached them and dr gerard introduced her to hercule poirot i tried to see you in the hotel mademoiselle said poirot will you talk to me now they walked away from sarah and dr gerard you are you are a detective arent you asked ginevra a very wellknown detective the best detective in the world said poirot saying it as a simple truth have you come here to protect me ginevra asked quietly poirot stroked his moustache thoughtfully are you in danger mademoiselle yes yes theyre trying to kill me ginevra looked around quickly i told dr gerard about it in jerusalem he was very clever he didnt say anything but he followed me to petra he is kind and good hes in love with me ginevras voice became soft and beautiful he says my name in his sleep i saw him lying there ill on his bed saying my name i went away quietly she paused did dr gerard ask you to protect me there are enemies all around me sometimes they are in disguise yes yes said poirot gently but you are safe here with your family they are not my family ginevra said proudly i cant tell you who i really am its a secret was your mothers death a great shock to you mademoiselle poirot asked gently ginevra stamped her foot angrily she wasnt my mother my enemies paid her to pretend she was where were you on the afternoon of her death i was in my tent it was hot in there but i didnt come out in case they killed me she shivered with fear one of them looked into my tent he was in disguise but i knew him i pretended to be asleep the arab prince sent him to kidnap me they are very romantic these stories that you invent poirot said ginevra stopped and looked at him angrily theyre true theyre all true again she stamped her foot before turning and running down the hillside poirot stood looking after her and in a few minutes he heard a voice close behind him what did you say to her asked dr gerard a little out of breath as sarah joined them poirot answered the doctors question and ginevra was angry said dr gerard thats good she still knows that what she says isnt true when she comes to my clinic in paris it is all arranged i will make her better ginevra enjoys acting and drama and being the centre of attention like her mother he hurried down the hill after ginevra ginevra is nothing like that horrible old woman said sarah with a frown although in jerusalem i once felt sorry for mrs boynton myself i suddenly saw her differently not evil but pathetic sarahs face went red as she remembered that meeting i felt so stupid she admitted and i felt even more stupid when lady westholme said shed seen me talking to mrs boynton she probably overheard me what exactly did mrs boynton say to you poirot asked can you remember the exact words i remember replied sarah because she said it so poisonously not even looking at me she said i never forget remember that i never forget anything an action a name or a face then she suddenly asked monsieur poirot have you found out anything definite about mrs boyntons death i have found out that raymond boynton spoke to his sister carol when he talked about killing his mother he told me that they were both overexcited and forgot about it the next day then he added gently miss sarah what are you so afraid of sarahs face was white that afternoon when he left me raymond said he wanted to do something now while he had the courage i thought he meant just to to tell her but what if he meant chapter threeteen nadine boynton was walking with jefferson cope along the stony hillside her face was pale jefferson she said ive got to talk to you of course nadine but dont be upset said mr cope you must do just as you want you know what im going to say dont you she said with emotion youre so good and kind jefferson and ive treated you so badly nadine you know i love you but all i want is for you to be happy when you decided to leave your husband you were honest with me you didnt say you were in love with me but i was happy all i wanted was to look after you im sorry said nadine im so sorry jefferson but i somehow thought youd change your mind and things are different now you and lennox can have a life of your own yes i cant leave lennox now said nadine quietly please forgive me theres nothing to forgive said mr cope well forget about that afternoon and will just be friends nadine placed a gentle hand on his arm dear jefferson thank you im going to find lennox now she turned and left him mr cope went on alone lennox was so deep in thought that he didnt notice nadine until she sat down beside him on the hillside we havent been able to talk until now she said but lennox im not going to leave you now were you really going to leave me nadine lennox said seriously she nodded yes i thought it was the only thing i could do i hoped you would be jealous and follow me i was so shocked when you said you were going away with jefferson cope said lennox why didnt i leave with you when you asked when you told me i realized that there was only one thing to do if i didnt want to lose you i went and dont said nadine lennox gave her a quick look i went and argued with mother i told her that i chose you he paused yes thats what i said to her chapter fourteen poirot met two people on his way back to the hotel the first was jefferson cope who introduced himself and as they walked together mr cope explained i hear youre investigating mrs boyntons death the journey to petra was too much for her but she wouldnt listen as a friend of the family id be happy to take care of anything such as moving mrs boyntons body to jerusalem just let me know if i can help i am sure the family will thank you for your offer said poirot he added carefully i believe you are a special friend of nadine boynton jefferson copes face went a little pink nadine told me shed spoken to you this morning but thats all over now nadine is staying with her husband there was a pause before poirot asked monsieur cope can you help me by telling me about the afternoon of mrs boyntons death of course said mr cope after lunch and a brief rest we all went for a walk that was when i talked to nadine afterwards she wanted to talk to lennox so i went off on my own and walked back towards the camp about halfway there i met the two english ladies lady westholme and miss pierce we looked at some ruins and when we got back to the camp at about five forty i had tea with them the servants prepared supper and went to tell mrs boynton and found her dead in her chair did you notice mrs boynton as you walked home inquired poirot i noticed she was there thats all thank you monsieur cope may i also ask if mrs boynton has left a large amount of money very large though it was her husbands money and is divided between all his children explained mr cope they will all have a lot of money now money said poirot makes a difference thank you monsieur cope for your help while mr cope walked on uphill poirot walked down until he met miss pierce she greeted him breathlessly oh monsieur poirot im so glad to meet you ive been talking to that very peculiar girl ginevra boynton she told me that there are enemies all around her and that an arab prince wants to kidnap her it sounds so romantic and exciting life can indeed be very strange said poirot i didnt realize who you were this morning continued miss pierce with excitement ive heard all about you i know i must tell you everything every small detail and it was rather strange please said poirot i would like to hear all about it well its not much but i got up early on the day after mrs boyntons death and i saw carol boynton come out of her tent and throw something into the stream i didnt really think about it at the time but later i walked along the stream and met miss king then i saw a small metal box and thought that must be what carol boynton threw away so i picked it up and there was a syringe inside then miss king said oh thank you thats my syringe and took it back to the camp with her miss pierce paused and then went on quickly of course im sure its not important but it did seem strange she looked hopefully at poirot his face was serious thank you mademoiselle he said what you have said gives me the last piece of information i needed to solve this case everything is now clear and in order oh really miss pierce looked as pleased as a child back in his hotel room hercule poirot added one line to his list of significant facts i never forget remember that i never forget anything mais oui poirot said yes now it is all clear chapter fifteen hercule poirot and colonel carbury were standing in one of the empty hotel bedrooms where poirot had arranged the furniture it is time to begin he said looking at his watch you colonel must sit behind this table in an official position here he pointed to some chairs will sit the boynton family and over here will sit the three other people who are personally involved in the case miss king dr gerard and monsieur cope he stopped as he heard people arriving aha here they come when everyone had sat down colonel carbury began to speak in an official voice when mrs boyntons death was reported to me it seemed a perfectly natural death however the evidence of dr gerard a missing syringe missing poison and a mark on the dead womans wrist made me suspicious so i asked monsieur hercule poirot to investigate he will now give us his report the boynton family all looked frightened there was silence complete silence when someone dropped a shoe in the room next door it sounded incredibly loud poirot stepped forward before i began my investigation he said i told colonel carbury that i would find the truth even if i couldnt prove it by talking to everyone involved you have all talked to me and though you have lied you have also without knowing it led me to the truth first i considered whether mrs boynton died a natural death and decided that she did not the missing digitalin and syringe and the boynton familys behaviour convinced me that she had been murdered not only was mrs boynton murdered but every member of her family knew it they all acted as if they were guilty and they all gained both money and freedom once she was dead but did the boyntons work together as a family to kill mrs boynton when i looked at the evidence i decided that they did not their stories did not fit together and no one had a proper alibi it seemed more likely that two people were working together and i myself had evidence to add here he told the story of the conversation he had overheard in jerusalem of course poirot continued this meant that raymond boynton was the obvious suspect i guessed correctly that he had been talking to his sister carol they wanted to kill mrs boynton to free the whole family particularly their younger sister ginevra poirot paused while raymond boynton looked at him with pain in his eyes before i discuss the case against raymond boynton i would like to read to you a list of significant facts which i wrote for colonel carbury significant facts mrs boynton was taking a medicine containing digitalin dr gerards syringe was missing mrs boynton definitely enjoyed stopping her family having a good time with other people mrs boynton on the afternoon of her death encouraged her family to go away and enjoy themselves mrs boynton enjoyed being cruel to people the distance from the marquee to the place where mrs boynton was sitting is about two hundred yards lennox boynton said at first he did not know what time he returned to the camp but later he admitted setting his mothers watch to the right time dr gerard and ginevra boynton were staying in tents next door to each other at halfpast six when dinner was ready a servant was sent to tell mrs boynton mrs boynton in jerusalem used these words i never forget remember that i never forget anything i thought that the first two facts were incredibly strange because they do not fit together do you see what i mean if not it does not matter i will explain later so is raymond boynton guilty or not these are the facts he had talked about killing mrs boynton he was in a very nervous and excited state as he had mademoiselle please forgive me he nodded to sarah just fallen in love this may have given raymond boynton the courage to rebel against his mother at last or even kill her raymond boynton left the camp with the others at about five minutes past three mrs boynton was then alive and well raymond and sarah king stayed together until he left her returning to the camp at ten minutes to six he went and talked to his mother then went to his tent and afterwards to the marquee he says that at ten minutes to six mrs boynton was alive but miss king who is a doctor says that when she examined mrs boyntons body at halfpast six she had been dead for at least an hour and probably more so either miss king or raymond boynton is lying assuming that miss king was not mistaken and is not lying let us examine what happened raymond boynton returns to the camp goes up to his mother and finds she is dead instead of calling for help he waits for a few minutes goes first to his tent then joins his family in the marquee and says nothing why would he behave like that i wouldnt said raymond in a sharp nervous voice that proves that my mother was alive and well poirot ignored raymonds interruption if his mother was already dead when he returned to camp raymond boynton cannot be guilty but if he is not guilty can we explain his behaviour i believe that we can remember raymonds words to his sister carol he returns from his walk and finds his mother dead he immediately suspects that carol has killed mrs boynton its a lie said raymond in a low shaking voice so is there any evidence that carol boynton is the murderer poirot continued carol has talked to her brother raymond about killing her mother she returned to the camp at ten minutes past five when she says she went up and spoke to her mother there were no witnesses the camp was empty the servants were asleep and lady westholme miss pierce and monsieur cope were exploring ruins the time would fit it is perfectly possible that carol boynton killed her mother he paused carol had raised her head and she looked at him sadly there is one other point said poirot the following morning very early carol boynton threw something into the stream a syringe dr gerard looked up surprised but my syringe was returned he said poirot nodded yes but this is a second different syringe it belongs to miss king does it not carol spoke quickly before sarah had time to answer it wasnt miss kings syringe she said it was mine and i threw it away carol exclaimed nadine her eyes wide and upset carol oh i dont understand carol turned and looked at her slightly angrily i threw away an old syringe thats all i never touched the the poison it was my syringe monsieur poirot added sarah poirot smiled it is very confusing this affair of the syringe but i can explain it ah well we have now discussed the innocence of raymond boynton and the guilt of his sister carol but i am always fair so now we will see if carol boynton could be innocent carol returns to the camp goes up to her mother and finds that she is dead at once she suspects that her brother raymond has killed her she doesnt know what to do so she says nothing an hour later raymond boynton returns finds his mother dead but does not say anything either perhaps carol goes to raymonds tent and finds a syringe carol is now sure her brother has killed mrs boynton she takes the syringe and hides it and early the next morning throws it into the stream there is one point to show that carol boynton is innocent when i question her i ask her to swear that mrs boynton did not die because of her and carol swears immediately but she says i never harmed her and thinks that i will not notice that is the case for the innocence of carol boynton and now let us go back a step and consider not the innocence but the possible guilt of raymond if carol is speaking the truth and mrs boynton was alive at fiveten can raymond be guilty he could have killed his mother at ten minutes to six when he went up to speak to her there were servants around but it was getting dark but if this is so then miss king must have lied remember she came back to the camp only five minutes after raymond from the distance she could see him go up to his mother when mrs boynton is found dead miss king realizes that raymond has killed her and she lies to save him knowing that dr gerard is ill and cannot say anything different i did not lie said sarah clearly there is yet another possibility said poirot miss king returned to the camp a few minutes after raymond perhaps she injected mrs boynton with poison she believed that mrs boynton deserved to die this would explain why she lied about the time of death sarah had become very pale but her voice was steady its true that i once spoke about death and sacrifice she said but i swear that i didnt kill mrs boynton and yet said poirot softly one of you two is lying raymond boynton moved in his chair you win monsieur poirot he said excitedly i was lying mother was dead when i went up to her i was all ready to tell her i was leaving and there she was dead her hand was cold and like you said i thought maybe carol had done it there was the mark on her wrist there is one thing i would like to know said poirot quickly how did you plan to kill your mother i know it involved a syringe but if you want me to believe you you must tell me everything i was going to use an empty syringe in a vein raymond said i read about it in a book a detective story ah said poirot i understand did you buy a syringe no said raymond i took nadines poirot looked at nadine boynton is that the syringe that is in your luggage in jerusalem he asked nadines face reddened slightly i i wasnt sure where it was she replied you think very quickly madame said poirot chapter sixteen after a pause poirot continued we have now solved the mystery of the second syringe it belonged to nadine boynton was taken by raymond boynton before leaving jerusalem and was taken from raymond by carol after the discovery of mrs boyntons dead body after carol threw the syringe away it was found by miss pierce and miss king said it was hers i believe miss king has it now i have said sarah so you lied when you said it was yours sarah said calmly thats a different kind of lie it isnt it isnt a professional lie poirot cleared his throat let us now review our timetable boyntons and jefferson cope leave the camp about dr gerard and sarah king leave the camp about lady westholme and miss pierce leave the camp dr gerard returns to the camp about lennox boynton returns to the camp nadine boynton returns to the camp and talks to mrs boynton nadine boynton leaves mrs boynton and goes to the marquee about carol boynton returns to the camp lady westholme miss pierce and jefferson cope return to the camp raymond boynton returns to the camp sarah king returns to the camp mrs boyntons body is discovered as you can see there is a space of twenty minutes between fourfifty when nadine left mrs boynton and fiveten when carol returned so if carol is speaking the truth mrs boynton must have been killed in that twenty minutes now who could have killed her at that time miss king and raymond boynton were together mr cope was with lady westholme and miss pierce lennox boynton was with his wife in the marquee and dr gerard was lying ill in his tent the camp is empty and the servants are asleep could anyone have committed the crime at this moment he looked thoughtfully at ginevra boynton there is one person ginevra boynton said that she was in her tent all afternoon but that is not true she also said that dr gerard spoke her name when he was ill while dr gerard said that he dreamed of ginevra boyntons face but it was not a dream he really saw her standing there by his bed so ginevra was in dr gerards tent was she returning dr gerards syringe after killing her mother ginevra boynton raised her head with its redgold hair her beautiful eyes staring at poirot thats impossible said nadine excitedly poirot leaned forward you are very intelligent madame he said to nadine what do you mean by that monsieur poirot asked nadine quietly i mean that the whole time you have judged the situation calmly you realized that you and your husband lennox had to leave mrs boynton if you were going to enjoy a happy life but you could not persuade lennox to go your husband was too exhausted to do anything so because you love lennox you told him you were leaving with jefferson cope to make him jealous to make him do something but if that failed the only other thing that might save lennox was if his mother died leaving him with money and freedom nadine stared at poirot i didnt kill mrs boynton she said gently after i had told her that i was leaving i went straight to the marquee and joined lennox i did not leave it again until mrs boynton was found dead and had no opportunity to kill her you did not leave the marquee again until mrs boynton was found dead repeated poirot that is one of the points i found strange it is number nine on my list at halfpast six when dinner was ready a servant was sent to tell mrs boynton i dont understand said raymond poirot looked at the boyntons a servant was sent he said why a servant you did everything for mrs boynton helped her walk get up from her chair one of you was always with her so i asked myself why did no one go to help her and i tell you my answer because you knew that she was dead no no do not interrupt me madame he said to nadine as she tried to speak you will now listen to me hercule poirot you have decided to kill mrs boynton so you take dr gerards digitalin in the morning and his syringe since yours had disappeared you hoped to put back the syringe before the doctor noticed it was missing you return to the camp talking politely to lady westholme and miss pierce as you pass you go up to mrs boynton with the syringe full of digitalin ready you hold her wrist and quickly inject the poison it is easy for someone who trained as a nurse from far down below lady westholme and miss pierce see you talking to mrs boynton for about ten minutes but they cannot hear they are too far away you are talking to a dead woman then you go to the marquee join your husband and are careful not to leave mrs boyntons death will be blamed on her heart trouble but dr gerard is ill in his tent so you cannot return the syringe that madame was the only thing wrong with your perfect crime there was silence until lennox boynton jumped to his feet nov he shouted thats a lie nadine did nothing she couldnt have done anything my mother my mother was already dead ah poirot looked at him gently so you killed her mr boynton lennox sat down in his chair and raised shaking hands to his face yes thats right i killed her i took the poison from dr gerards tent when asked poirot as as you said in the morning and the syringe the syringe yes why did you kill her you you know why my wife was leaving me with cope yes but you only heard about that in the afternoon lennox stared at him of course when we were out but you took the poison and the syringe in the morning before you knew asked poirot what does it matter said lennox pale and shaking it matters a great deal said poirot i advise you to tell me the truth all right i will said lennox suddenly but i dont know if youll believe me he breathed in deeply that afternoon i was i was nearly mad i never thought nadine would leave me i felt as though i was drunk or ill poirot nodded lady westholme told me you were walking as if you were dizzy he said that is why i knew your wife nadine had told you she was leaving before not after you returned to the camp i hardly knew what i was doing continued lennox then i realized it was all my fault and i should have escaped from mother years ago i decided to go and tell her just what i thought and that i was leaving with nadine that night oh lennox my dear sighed nadine and then said lennox she was just sitting there dead i didnt know what to do i was shocked and confused without thinking i picked up her watch and put it on her wrist then i went down to the marquee i should have called someone but i just sat there staring at a newspaper i dont know why i didnt tell anyone dr gerard cleared his throat you were in a bad nervous state mr boynton he said you were too shocked to do anything it is a known medical condition oh i am sure it is replied poirot but nadine boynton saw her husband put back his mothers watch she returned to the camp only five minutes later when she found mrs boynton dead with the mark of a syringe on her wrist she thought that lennox boynton had killed his mother and put back the watch to hide the mark because she said she was leaving him he turned to nadine am i right madame nadine nodded her head then she asked did you really suspect me monsieur poirot i thought you were a possibility madame and now said nadine tell us what really happened chapter seventeen poirot now seemed friendly and relaxed as he sat down in a few days after the medical examination we will know if mrs boynton died of an overdose of digitalin or not but it is better to know the truth tonight before the murderer can escape so now we return to my list of facts and why the first two points do not fit together mrs boynton was taking a medicine containing digitalin and dr gerards syringe was missing it is a clever idea to kill mrs boynton with digitalin as she was already taking the drug in her medicine but why would someone in her family inject the poison with a syringe it would be much easier to add the poison to mrs boyntons medicine sooner or later mrs boynton would take her medicine and die and even if the digitalin was discovered in the bottle it could have been an accident or a mistake by the chemist who prepared it nothing could be proved so why was dr gerards syringe taken if the murderer could not poison the medicine he was an outsider and not a member of the boynton family this puzzled me because all the boyntons acted as if they were guilty but what if they were really innocent so now i considered how the murder could have been committed by an outsider someone who did not know mrs boynton well enough to enter her cave or touch her medicine bottle he paused there are three people here who are outsiders but who are still involved in the case mr cope is a family friend did he have a motive to kill mrs boynton i do not think so since mrs boyntons death has ended his hopes with nadine boynton mr cope said with dignity i had no opportunity to commit this crime monsieur poirot and i dont agree with the taking of human life you certainly seem to be innocent said poirot in a detective story you would definitely be the obvious suspect he turned a little in his chair now miss king had a motive and medical knowledge but since she left the camp at three fifteen and did not return until six it is difficult to see when she could have committed the crime next we must consider dr gerard and think carefully about when the murder was actually committed lennox boynton says that his mother was dead at four thirtyfive according to lady westholme and miss pierce she was alive at fourfifteen when they started their walk that leaves exactly twenty minutes now as the two ladies walked away from the camp dr gerard passed them going towards it no one knows what dr gerard did when he reached the camp he could have committed the crime then since he is a doctor he could easily pretend to have malaria perhaps he killed mrs boynton to save the young and beautiful ginevra from mental illness your ideas said dr gerard are unbelievable without taking any notice poirot continued but if dr gerard killed mrs boynton why did he tell colonel carbury about the digitalin and the syringe it was thought that mrs boynton died of natural causes but it was dr gerard who first suggested the possibility of murder that my friends said poirot does not make sense it doesnt seem to agreed colonel carbury there is one more possibility said poirot nadine boynton said that ginevra could not have killed her mother because she knew mrs boynton was already dead but ginevra boynton was at the camp all afternoon and there was just time for her to commit the crime when lady westholme and miss pierce were walking away from the camp and before dr gerard returned ginevra looked at poirot with an innocent puzzled stare you think i did it then suddenly with a quick and beautiful movement she sat at dr gerards feet and looked passionately up into his face no no its not true i never did anything they are my enemies they want to put me in prison you must help me there there my child gently the doctor patted ginevras head what you say is nonsense he said to poirot if ginevra had killed her mother she would have done it boldly with drama this crime was very clever and well planned poirot smiled i agree with you he said smoothly chapter eighteen come said hercule poirot we are nearly there we have heard the facts but now we must look at the most important thing in this case mrs boynton herself and how her mind worked points three and four on my list of facts definitely do not fit together mrs boynton definitely enjoyed stopping her family having a good time with other people and yet mrs boynton on the afternoon of her death encouraged her family to go away and enjoy themselves why mrs boynton has been described in many ways evil cruel controlling mad but i think sarah king came closest to the truth when she looked at mrs boynton and thought she was pathetic all her life mrs boynton wanted power and control over other people but what did she achieve in the end she had no real power all she did was control her own family travelling abroad made her realize how unimportant she really was and now we come to point number ten the words mrs boynton spoke to sarah king in jerusalem sarah king had told mrs boynton that she was pathetic and the old woman knew it was true miss king said that mrs boynton answered her so poisonously not even looking at me but listen carefully what did mrs boynton say i never forget remember that i never forget anything an action a name or a face do you realize the importance of these words poirot waited a moment it seems not but mes amis they were not a proper answer to what miss king had just said they do not make any sense it is obvious continued poirot excitedly that those words were not spoken to miss king they were spoken to someone else standing behind her he paused looking round him mrs boynton has just been told she is pathetic and realizes that it is true but just at that moment she recognizes someone a face from the past and a new victim an outsider so now we know why mrs boynton let her family go on the afternoon of her death she was planning to speak to her new victim in the afternoon the boynton family go for a walk and mrs boynton sits up by her cave now let us consider very carefully the evidence of lady westholme and miss pierce miss pierce is not a good witness she does not notice much and you can suggest ideas to her that she later says are true lady westholme however is very clear about facts and notices everything both ladies agree on one fact a bedouin servant approaches mrs boynton angers her in some way and quickly leaves miss pierce said that the servant had first been into the tent of ginevra boynton but i think that the servant went into the tent of dr gerard as it was next door are you saying that one of the camp servants injected the old lady with poison said colonel carbury i dont believe it wait i have not yet finished said poirot so the bedouin servant came from dr gerards tent and not that of ginevra boynton now both ladies agree that they could not see the servants face clearly and that they did not hear what was said that is understandable because the distance between the marquee and the ridge was about two hundred yards lady westholme described the man clearly including his torn breeches and untidy puttees poirot leaned forward but that my friends was very odd indeed because if lady westholme could not see the face of the servant or hear what was said she could not possibly have noticed what his breeches and puttees looked like from two hundred yards away so why did lady westholme describe the clothes of the servant in such detail was it because they did not really exist when lady westholme and miss pierce both saw the man they could not see each other from where they were sitting that fact is clear because lady westholme had to come and see if miss pierce was awake and found her sitting in the entrance of her tent my dear poirot said colonel carbury suddenly sitting up very straight are you suggesting i am suggesting that after visiting miss pierce the only witness who was awake lady westholme returned to her tent put on her riding breeches boots and coat and made herself a bedouin cheffiyah by wrapping a piece of fabric round her head then she went boldly into the tent of dr gerard took his syringe and filled it up with digitalin and walked straight up to her victim who may have been asleep lady westholme was quick she held the wrist of mrs boynton and injected the poison mrs boynton half cried out and tried to stand up then sat back in her chair the bedouin servant left quickly as if he was afraid mrs boynton shook her stick and called out after him but she could not stand up by herself five minutes later lady westholme goes back to miss pierce and talks to her about mrs boynton and the servant carefully telling her own version of what just happened so miss pierce will begin to think that is what she really saw then they go for a walk pausing below the ridge where lady westholme shouts up to the old lady there is no answer mrs boynton is dead but lady westholme says to miss pierce she was very rude just to grunt at us like that lady westholme knows that her own strong personality can influence miss pierce miss pierce accepts the suggestion and will swear quite sincerely that she actually heard mrs boynton grunt the only thing that went wrong was that lady westholme did not have time to put back the syringe before dr gerard returned to his tent she hoped he would not notice that the syringe was missing and she put it back during the night he stopped but why said sarah why did lady westholme kill mrs boynton you told me that lady westholme was standing near you in jerusalem when you spoke to mrs boynton mrs boyntons words i never forget remember that i never forget anything an action a name or a face were spoken to lady westholme mrs boynton had once worked in a prison in america and lord westholme met his wife on a ship travelling from america before her marriage lady westholme had been a criminal and had been locked up in prison though we dont yet know why but mrs boynton recognized lady westholme and knew she was a criminal at last she had real power if she told anyone lady westholme would lose everything her career her marriage and her important position in society and mrs boynton liked being cruel she would enjoy revealing the truth and ruining lady westholmes life so while mrs boynton lived lady westholme was not safe she did what mrs boynton wanted and met her at petra where lady westholme saw her chance and boldly committed her crime she made only two mistakes one was to say too much describing the torn breeches which first made me suspect her and the other was when she went into the wrong tent instead of going to dr gerards tent she first looked into ginevras where the girl was lying half asleep when ginevra spoke of a man in disguise sent to kidnap her there was enough truth in her story for me to understand what had happened he paused but we shall soon know today i managed to get the fingerprints of lady westholme without her knowing when these are sent to the prison where mrs boynton worked we will know the truth he stopped in the brief silence a loud noise was heard like a gun being fired it was in the next room said colonel carbury rising quickly to his feet whos staying there i believe said poirot quietly it is the room of lady westholme epilopue from the newspaper the evening shout we regret to announce the death of lady westholme mp after a terrible accident while travelling abroad lady westholme was cleaning her gun when it accidentally fired and killed her immediately we would like to offer our deepest sympathy to her husband lord westholme five years later sarah boynton was sitting with her husband raymond at the savoy hotel in london with them sat ginevra who earlier in the evening had been acting in a very successful play and dr theodore gerard nadine and a happylooking lennox sat across the table its so nice to be together said nadine im glad we came and i think our children are old enough to see their aunt ginevra acting on stage dont you lennox just then a welldressed man with a superb moustache stopped at their table hercule poirot smiled at them happily so everything is well with the boynton family yes thanks to you said sarah did you know that carol has married jefferson cope and ginevra ginevras a great actress and ginevra with a serious look on her beautiful face said unexpectedly poor mother now were all so happy i feel sorry for her she didnt get what she wanted from life it must have been hard for her
