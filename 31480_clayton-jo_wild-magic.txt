jo clayton wild magic goddance the opening steps the islands of the tukery glitter with dew the sky is dark blue burning at the edges clear of clouds a wandering breeze twitches at green leaves still on the trees whirls up and drops again khaki and mustard leaves drying on the ground the selatsthe narrow winding stretches of sea between the islandsare filled with chop and shadow and drifting veils of mist a small boat slides gracefully along the selat that goes past jal virri the hull is amber and motherofpearl the single mast is yellow sandalwood the lateen sail silk the color of beeswax the bow curls up and over like the scroll on a violin the stern rises in a ducktail delicate feathering is carved into the sides a woman clad in veils of honeycolored mist stands in the stern honey arms folded across her breasts gossamer bee wings shimmering from her shoulders antennas like curved black threads rising above huge black bee eyes the boat stops improbably in midstream when it reaches the part of the island where a house is visible among the trees and a broad lawn slopes to white sand and the sea water the beeeyed woman begins to hum inside the house in a small nursery the newly risen sun is shining through the window turning the leaves of the vines that grow across the glass into slices of jade leaf shadows dance on the white wall across from the crib and the child in it the leaves scrape across the glass in soft arrhythmic sshpsshps faan rolls onto her back kicks off the sheet and sits up she pulls herself onto her feet and pushes at the latch holding the side of the crib in place she unbalances as it goes crashing down gurgles with pleasure as the crib mattress gives under her and bounces her a few times she flips over wriggles backward till her legs are hanging over the edge lands on her feet wobbles in a crouch till she gets her balance then trots into her mothers bedroom her mother is deep asleep lying on her stomach with her light brown hair in a tangle over her face and shoulders faan holds her breath and scurries across the room she raises on her toes stretches up gets her fingers on the latch handle pulls it down and leans into the door it opens and she slides through the gap after a quick guilty look at her mother she manages to get all the way outside before the guardian sprites of jal virri catch her strip off her nightgown and her damp diaper and dress her in a dainty lacy shift they play with her a moment then go back to the neverending work of keeping the house and garden in order she is watching a frog hop beside a pond when she hears the humming for several minutes she sits on her grubby heels and listens then she shakes her head impatiently gets clumsily to her feet wiping her muddy hands on the shift she starts toward the sound maksi she says as she trots around the house she makes a song of the name maksi maksi mak la la si la la mak la la si la la mak la la seeee when she sees the boat and the beeeyed woman standing in it she stops and stares not maksi the humming grows louder and more compelling faan slows she doesnt like that womans eyes they frighten her step by step the beeeyed woman hums her closer closer she is walking on sand now she doesnt like walking on sand it gets between her toes and makes them sore closer mamay said never go in the water the sprites said never go in the water they arent here now she whimpers but the sprites dont come the water is cold it pushes at her she stumbles and goes floundering under the surface the beeeyed woman reaches out her arm stretching and stretching plucks her from the selat faan wails as she swoops across the water be quiet the beeeyed woman sits her on the deck you arent hurt faan ignores her and wails some more my liki i want youooo leee leeee leee keee the mahsar pops out of the air beside her hisses at the beeeyed woman good she says i was waiting for you she hums and the mahsar curls up with her back against faan deep asleep faan yawns her eyes droop shut and she sleeps the beeeyed woman hums another note a honey shimmer trembles about the child be loved the beeeyed woman croons over her let he who finds you cherish you to death and beyond let them who dwell with you cherish you be loved honeychild by everyone you need the beeeyed woman hums a block of crystal hardens around faan and ailiki the mahsar the beeeyed woman hums a double note spreads her arms a dome of crystal forms about the island stopping everything inside kori piyolss mother and apprentice sorceror sleeps settsimaksimin sorceror prime and his lover simms the witch sleep side by side the sprites melt into the soil and sleep the trees and everything on the island freeze in place and wait the beeeyed woman turns her head the honeyamber boat glides off the way it had come sibyl a mist flows from the stone eddies and blows about in the strong wind coming up the cave from the lava lake at the heart of the mountain a hot wind like the breath of the sun near the mouth of the cave on the dark side of the line where sunlight meets shadow there is a chair carved from stone broad and worn old as the mountain the mist blows toward the sunlight coalesces into a big woman with an ancient wrinkled face iron black and collapsed on the bone the smell of age hangs about her musty and intimidating she settles in the big chair sits there wrapped in layers of wool and silk leaning back relaxed amused her face obscured her oncebeautiful hands curled over the worn finials a jewel on her thumb shimmering blue and green and crimson a black opal that echoes the bright lights in her black eyes she opens her mouth and declaims the wheel is turning the change is near one by one the signs come clear salagaum flower through the nights and the days high kasso seeks power in odd little ways in the beehouses bower the honeychild plays she laughs a soft growly sound like the earth shifting to be a sibyl she says it is necessary to cultivate a talent for bad verse the seekers demand it they will not believe you if you speak them plain if you want me she says come i am waiting for you you will find this cave on the slopes of mount fogomalin not far below the high terrace where the temple is the camuctarr of bairroa pili to reach it climb the steps and steeps of the jiko sagrado until you reach an ancient olive tree it is no bigger than a bent old woman but it has been making olives since the world began the path begins there go along it holding your clothes tight against you so the firethorn wont catch you and the boutra birds wont eat your livers if its spring when youre coming bring silk to breathe through when you pass the grove of enyamata trees lest the pollen beguile you and keep you till you starve follow the cairns of black lava around the bulge of the mountain until you reach a cave mouth enter and i will be there come with your puzzlements come with your needs come in the daylight or hidden by night you summon me into being come i am sibyl i am born of earth and dream i alone in this land exist outside the wheel the wheel turns and all things change i do not change the wheel turns and what was is now forgotten i do not forget these are things you might like to know she says names geography and rule if such thingsbore you ignore them this is the land this is zam fadogurtun the titular ruler the amrapake is famtoche banddah the real power mostly lies in the hands of the maulapamthis never changes the first city the seat of rule is gom cor asso little that is important happens there the city below us bairroa pili is called the second city though the part that is occupied is twice the size of corasso it is the mill of plenty grinding out the wealth of the land kasso is priest kassian is priestess the temples are called camuctarrs she sighs and changes the position of her hands i remember everything i remember chumavayal dancing down abeyhamal i remember language changing law and custom myth and history all changing i remember bairroa pili moving from the low city to the high the low city sealed and sleeping i remember chumavayal as a screaming babe a raging youth a splendid man as the years turned on the spindle of time his beauty grew stolid his alertness faded until he became what he is today iron grown brittle with time jealous of the youth he once had hoarding his strength like a miser hoards gold i remember abeyhamal as a screaming babe an impatient child a sullen girl she is a woman now arro gant in her young splendor beating her wings against the power that imprisons her on the instant that chumavayal is danced down he that was ancient will be newborn knowing nothing on that instant the years of iron will be forgotten as if the five hundred years just completed did not exist at all as if those five hundred years were simply erased from time abeyhamal and chumavayal forget them the fadogurs of zam fadogurum forget them forget the amrapake forget the language forget the caste names and make them newmaulapam the landlords and rulers cheoshim the warriors biasharim the merchants fundarim the artisans naostam the laborers and wascram the children born to slaves forget

turns end chaos then settle into a new pattern a new peace i watch it is my amusement to watch the permutations and combinations of the change the infinitely varied kaleidoscopic corruscations of the dance the end is always the same the details never she leans forward bringing her aged face into the light the ghost of beauty clings to her bones i am sibyl that reads the soul and answers as she choosesmost of the timewhenever im not sealed by those interfering ignorant gods ah well silence is also an answer chapter the coming of the honeychild reyna hayaka leaned against a sequba tree at the edge of the abeyzaza grove dug out his strikebox and his tipipe he packed a pinch of bhaggan into the smokehole fired it up and sucked in a mouthful of the smoke he was pleased with himself hed found all the herbs and roots tai needed and got them in first light with the dew still on them the best time the smoke trickled from his nose and faded into the warm green shadow a breeze whispered through the leaves of the canopy and in that gentle rustle he started hearing murmurs from the sequba moththeries translucent elusive creatures that even the kassian tai saw only from the corner of her eye tai corner of her eye corner of her eye tai wildmagic nevernever flyyouby he smiled dreamily as a wispy something soared past on gossamer wings and swooped in and out of the feathery smoke in a burrow beneath the knotted roots of a nearby sequba a famma bird sang and his mate answered with a demure twitter deeper in the grove a pantya chittered broke off abruptly all around there were furtive rustles small squeaks and chirrups the thousand sounds of life beneath the trees sing a song of slippery slides atip atoop atwitter hot hot hotter damned dirt gets dirtier tike tiki tirriah and a twee twi tweeee a bee hummed past then another reyna tapped the pipe against a root ground his heel over the ash he stretched and yawned settled the basket handle more comfortably over his arm and started for the river reyna hayaka was salagaum tall and limber with long narrow hands and feet and the breasts of a woman his blueblack hair was plaited in hundreds of thin braids that swung in a limber lions mane down past his shoulders he had honey colored eyes and his skin was burnt caramel smooth as silk with amber lights where it was pulled tight across the bone he wore a white cottonandsilk underrobe cinched tight about his waist with a wide black leather belt a heavier overrobe with broad stripes of crimson and amber which fell in straight lines from his shoulders blowing back as he moved to show the lining of amber silk slowdancing along in a happy languor humming a beehymn amber bangles clanking about his wrists amber and gold hoops swinging from his earlobes he rounded a tall broom bushand stopped startled as he saw a very young child sitting on the landing watching a strange little beast that looked like a cross between a cat and a monkey it was jumping at famma birds hunting snails in the gravel at the waterline ulloa honey he said where did you come from she stared at him through a webbing of silky black hair startled and afraid she had big eyes odd eyes gemcolored the right was blue the left green its all right reyna said his voice soft soothing making a song of the words its all right my honey i wont hurt you he took a step toward her the child whimpered rolled onto her hands and knees and scooted away from him heading for the end of the landing and the wide brown river beyond as reyna swore under his breath dropped the basket and ran desperately down the bank a gray streak whipped past him circled the child and chittered in her face as she slowed startled he dived and caught the hem of her lacy shift shaken but keeping a firm hold on the cloth in spite of the babys howls and struggles he sat up hush little honey he murmured hush sweeting no no reyna wont hurt you look here your little friend isnt afraid of me he held out his free hand and let the beast sniff at it the catmonkey wriggled with pleasure pushed its head against reynas palm and produced a loud soothing hum then it sat on its haunches and stared at him with round intelligent eyes it was a strange creature with its flattened little face like a miniature baby and small black hands folded over a silky white ruff the child stopped her struggles her screaming diminished to a series of sniffles reyna laughed comfortably took the lower corner of his overrobe and used the lining to wipe her eyes then her nose there isnt that better spa nas she said poessm oidats tor tis su i dont understand a word of that beb he smoothed the hair out of her mismated eyes it was a waterfall of black silk and softer than anything he could remember touching his heart turned over you are a mystery oh diyo well let us see let us see he tapped his forefinger between his brows reyna hayaka thats my name do you understand bebe he tapped again me reyna moving slowly so he wouldnt startle her he touched her forehead his finger trembling then spread both hands in what he hoped was a universal query sign you name she gurgled a happy sound that tickled his insides curled one small grubby hand into a fist then used her other hand to straighten out her forefinger she poked herself in the chest faan korispais piyolss she chanted a lesson shed learned so completely she didnt have to think reyna nodded his many black plaits swinging and slipping with the movements of his head and does your friend have a name he pointed to the catmonkey name nainai she said nodding vigorously ailiki eym mahsar she shook her hair over her face again looked slyly through the strands her body shouting mischief reyna she said then giggled diyo you are quick little honeychild he chuckled you know you arent supposed to go round calling adults by their use names someone taught you manners and did a good job of it he gazed over her head at the river so wide here near the estuary that the far bank was a faint fuzzy blue line wide and empty speaking of which my honey how did you come here and wheres your mother hmm he tucked his hand under her chin and lifted her head so he could look into those bicolored eyes mama she blinked at him for a moment he thought she was going to cry mamay her eyes dulled as if a film had slid across them she shivered and gulped then she flung herself at him hands clutching his robe head butting into his breasts mamay mamay she wailed hush bebe hush well find your mama diyo we will he could feel the small body shuddering against him feel the shudders fading there was a last small gulp and she lay heavy in his arms diyo my honey oh diyo my sweeting i wish ailiki went trotting off jumped into the small sailboat reyna had moored to a post at the side of the landing her tail curled around her the beast crouched on one of the thwarts her head up her ears pricked as if to say what are you waiting for well look at that bb faan turned her head blinked at the mahsar she sighed started sucking her thumb too worn out he thought for anything more thats a sign if i ever saw one my honey he shifted his grip on her got to his feet and started toward the boat abeys sting he said suddenly id forget my head he looked down at the child pulled a sad face for her that made her giggle round her thumb then hauled her back along the landing to the basket hed dropped when he dived for her explaining as he walked that he didnt dare put her down she moved too fast and chances were shed be in that river before hed taken two steps she was turning into a dead weight heavier with every step he shifted his grip again before he bent for the basket i know now why women have hips he murmured how in this crazy world does a baby like you gain fifty pounds whenever she feels like it he straightened jiggled her higher and got his arm crooked under her vema vema honeychild its back to the boat we go and off to find your mama downriver first i think look round the koo if your people know theyve lost you they should be looking for you trouble is a hundred things could happen so they dont know when you went off or where he settled her in the bottom of the boat set the basket beside her nodded with satisfaction as ailiki jumped from the thwart into her lap good mahsar he said keep her safe a boats no place for a baby but we havent much choice right now he scratched at his nose and frowned down at her the lacy shift was clean and dry you dont look like youve been in the water but i dont see how else vema vema how doesnt matter right now the rest of the morning reyna crisscrossed the long narrow bay stopping by every boat he saw asking if theyd lost a child if they knew anyone who had if theyd seen any roasters coming or going or any sign of trouble anything at all nothing nothing more nothing faan was curled in the bottom of the boat sleeping so heavily she worried him until he felt a warmth flowing across his feet she was peeing on him in her sleep marking him like a little dog marking his territory youre mine he whispered to her by right of rescue he laughed salvage he said aloud thats it he almost stopped then and went back to the river but he could see one more boat ahead anchored near the mouth of the bay the kiymey owned and worked by vumictin the silent he sighed and tacked across to her vumictin had his nets out his two nethands leaning against the rail taking a baghhit vum you see a ship going in or coming out early this morning maybe just before sunup the long thin man scratched thoughtfully at his arm stared at the water then at the sky whats up rey kuh youre a worse clam than any you ever dug i found a child a baby mightve been lost off a ship lightskinned probably slavebom he shrugged or a foreigner ant seen nothing like that one of the netmen cleared his throat and spat with a sweeping gesture vumictin waggled his thumb at his head then at the spitter dikhan there he swears he seen the bee mother sailing upriver quite a sight he says honeygold in the moonlight maybe the kids a little accident the gods dumped on you he grinned it gets mam and da in one package and honeymama can go play reyna snorted youre about as funny as a wetpack vum seriously though if you hear anything let us know hmm vumictin straightened well do that now you do us a favor rey and shift youself you in the middle the nets and were gonna start pulling it was late afternoon when reyna broke off the futile search and wearily sailed the boat back up a river alive with traffic fishermen out for bottom feeders and the spiny buagosta which brought more than all their fish roundbodied merchant ships moving downriver stuffed with ingots of copper and iron bolts of pammacloth dyed into bright patterns and the widemouthed jars bairroa pill was known for slimmer smaller coasters carrying passengers and anything else that brought in cash slave ships bouncing downriver empty except for chains and stained benches loooaaah reeey a pilots apprentice swinging a leadline from a net slung under a merchanters bowsprit waved at him then went back to reading the knots loaaaa ghedd reyna called back then gasped and snatched at faan whod waked from her long nap and was trying to stand up you been a good girl so far honey dont spoil it now klann i could do with some rope run a line from you to the mast faan tilted her head smiled uncertainly ti kaps nothing honey just stay still he returned the wave of a sailor sitting on a topmast spar exchanged shouts and whistles with fishermen with pilots with traders hanging over shiprails men hed danced the double passage with a time or two or more he said nothing more about faan he didnt exactly know why except there was no point in it and the danger a stray child faced in the streets of bairroa pili was something he didnt like thinking about there were wharves and landings all along the north bank of the river with barges and boats filling every inch of space nudging at each other swinging restlessly against their mooring cables lines of naostam laborers and foreigner slaves moved in and out of them like ants carrying burdens ashore coming empty back for more there were whistles and calls from a number of them waves and the lazy eight abeyhamals sign faan looked up from where she was crouching beside reynas knee tugged at the underrobe until she got his attention tis aym hush honey distractions bad right now iron bridge coming up i know i know im talking to them but i have to you see people i know urn some of them from times i went with tai and nursed abey damn that wind why cant it dosed with tonic and purgatives sh sh honeygirl we can make it see slip by slide through come out the other side friends and clients and oh you name it klann you cretin ive got windright oh potz he snatched up a boathook and pushed himself away from the barge found the sheet hed dropped and brought the sail around it filled and the boat stopped gliding backward tense with concentration he maneuvered through the river traffic passed under the iron bridge then the wood bridge tacked around the last bend and angled in toward the dilapidated wharf at the edge of the edge the ladroavivi was the last gatt wharf on the north side of the river standing more than half a mile past the wood bridge there were a small house for the shindagatt when there was one and a rotting warehouse which was empty except for dust spiders in the rafters and the occasional drunk its interior smelled of urine and death and no one went there except those drunks or fugitives hiding with the spiders to get above the stench and away from the light once or twice a month the shinda guards searched the place confiscated any contraband they found hidden there the shinda prefect who ran the city threatened repeatedly to bum it down but he never did the sheds and groves around ladroavivi were the meeting ground for idle porters and truant slaves thieves and vagabonds diseased habatrizes and overage salagaum they played dados with loaded dice kucha with cards so old the cheatmarks were more legible than the pips jiwabufa with bones the rats had eaten clean and stones from the river or they smoked tumba or drank raw mulimuli from clay jugs or sniffed fayyun or smoked bhaggan or dumped handfuls of the dust of dried pepepoa caterpillar fed on crazyleafinto the slugs of mulimuli and went so far off that half the time they never came back or ingested other drugs from the pharmacopoeia of selfdestruction those who hung about kept their eyes open and trusted to agility and luck to shelter them from dangeras did the kassians the beepriestesses of abeyhamal who ventured here to bind up wounds set broken legs and dose the hallucinating with purges and settlers while reyna hayaka was busy knotting the painter ailiki leapt onto the gatt and sat on her haunches waiting reyna laughed then lifted faan up beside the beast he set the basket on the planks gathered the skirts of his robes to keep them clear of the muck and climbed quickly up the short ladder something new eh a wascram smuggler with connections the selfappointed shindagatt of ladroavivi stepped from behind a tree and stood at the top of the gatt his hands on his plump hips his elbows out reyna slid the basket handle over his arm swung faan up and held her against his breasts half hidden by the folds of his outer robe ulloa chez he said nothing to interest you playpretty no i dont go that route you know that some a you clients do they dont tell me i wont have it he turned putting his shoulder between faan and the shindagatt two pradh and you dont say chezar joggaril rubbed at his broad broken nose for a moment reyna thought he was going to argue the price then he shrugged verna he growled one hour bring it youself i said no trade just coin im not in the mood for games chezar shrugged leia got female troubles he muttered needs some more a that red stuff reyna shifted his hold on faan who was starting to wriggle wanting down he patted the child to quiet her and frowned at chezar ill bring a bottle you sure thats it same as last time vema with the mahsar ailiki trotting behind him reyna strode into the trees he stepped over a sprawled mulehead started to circle around a game of jiwabufa scratched into the hard dry earth one of the players a salagaum looked up pushed straggling gray hair out of his eyes loa rey he wrinkled his brow swayed on his knees and peered hazily at ailiki whats that ulloa jumsi pet i picked up loa morg jago huz he moved quickly through the trees emerged from them into a nameless wynd filled with refuse cats and stray dogs stopped for a moment to resettle the child in the curve of his ann faan sweeting honeychild be quiet now like a little mouse he touched her mouth shook his head theres danger here danger until we reach beehouse rm going to cover you with this robe and i want you to stay very very quiet shhh he hefted her higher and tugged his outer robe over her klann wish i knew how you turn into solid lead he strode along the wynd slowed as he turned into verakay lane the longest and widest of the streets in the edge wild followed close behind him a small graybrown shadow loa rey an old fundar woman leaned out a window a soppy cloth trailing from her hand she flapped it at him splattering washwater over everything beneath her what you got there loa thamman he waved at her went quickly on a line of naostam boys went running past stuttered to a stop swung round and shouted obscentities at him he paid no attention to them they were just echoing their fathers he had naostam clients but they refused to know him when they passed him on the street he heard the clankclash of a pair of shinda guards before they turned the corner ahead of him retreated a few steps and ran down a wynd between two tenements then worked back to the lane dodging through porters and laborers handcarts and oxcarts scurrying cutpurses and lounging outofworks squatting around jiwabufa circles drawn in the dust mahnk peshalla stood in the door of his tavern waving a fan lazily back and forth he had the high cheekbones narrow face and beaky nose of his caste rattail mustaches and a thin beard twisted into long tight ringlets though he was poor biashar the son of a merchant whod lost everything when a ship hed invested in never came back he had two official wives of the three that biasharim allowed themselves and was more generous to beggars and streetfolk than most sponsoring a score of wascram boys in the edgeschool when he saw reyna he flicked the folding fan shut slapped it against his arm rey he rumbled in a voice like a barrel rolling down a gatt what you got good this and that mak this and that louok the nimble was standing atop an overturned washtub making silver cemms dance between his dark fingers the coins glinting in the morning light changing to copper shabs then back again appearing and disappearing now you see it he chanted now you dont silver into copper yes thats the way it goes copper into air my hands are empty my pockets too yet see and see silver he paused in the middle of his handdance waved to reyna whistled a snatch of a tune popular in the joyhouses went back to his performance milking a rain of coins from the air and dropping them into a large boot he upended it shook his head when a moth flew out tossed the boot to one of the wascram boys crouched by his feet and went on with his performance as the boys moved through the crowd collecting coins from his audience on the other side of the lane zinar the porter shifted his load loa rey he yelled tell dawa the lewinkob silks in he slapped at the bale on his head he should get up to horrys fast or itll be gone gotcha zin quiambo tanish went hurrying by his arms loaded down with supplies for the school he waggled an elbow at reyna slowed for a few steps tell pan to come by school tomorrow ive got the talk cleared through the manasso head will do tan he fended off more men and women who had greetings for him messages for dawa or jea the other salagaum living with him at the beehouse the kassian tai or panote the doorkeeper nodded at them waved brushed hastily past the mahsar stayed close to his heels drawing a few stares but no comments the verakay beehouse was a blocky redbrick building rising three stories to a flat roof with a splitwood fence poking like spiky cheoshim hair above a waisthigh parapet there was a bee carved within a cartouche above the heavy outer door and the bellpull was an amber bee on the end of a tough thin cord braided from the gut of a large fish caught in the koo bikiyar stretched rolled and kiln dried the followers of abeyhamal bee mother avoided metals as much as they could reyna let faan slide down until she was standing on the stoop hidden from the street by the flare of his overrobe then he yanked at the bellpull the wicket slapped open and panote peered out he smiled slid the shutter closed and opened the door he was an ascetic naostam in service to a foreign god tannabss of felhidd a pacifist warrior god who decreed his servants should be so proficient in selfdefense they would never have to use their arts rey loa pan tanish says come by tomorrow hes got the talk approved tai around reyna bent tapped faan on the shoulder and gave her a gentle push the child circled warily around panote went trotting over to the cape rack that stood at the far end of the small square entry she smoothed her hand down the shining wood patted the only cape hanging there ahsan rey diyo shes come in washed her hair dryin it up on the roof panote rounded his eyes and whos that a visitor or her names faan thats all i know she doesnt speak fadogur reyna rubbed at his jaw if thi agrees she could be living here for a while silence is best on this pan vema vema whistling a bouncy tune he shut the door and dropped the bar into its hooks he canted his head and inspected faan with bright black eyes charmer he said then went back into his room as reyna slipped off the overrobe and hung it on its knob he heard the rhythmic thumping of the doorkeepers ritual exercises faan come along he stooped took her hand and led her through the door beside the rack into a large square court filled with bloom two trees one a willow one a flowering plum a fountain in the middle and patches of short springy green grass morning shadows darkened the court but the treetops shimmered with sunlight and the water droplets were diamond bright beyond the fountain an outside stairway jagged up the wall to a door in the rooffence faan looked around started talking words tumbling out of her none of which reyna understood he shook his head come along honey i want you to meet someone maybe shell know what youre talking about the kassian tai wanameh was a tall woman almost as tall as reyna and dark a dusty insideoftheoven black with bluish highlights she was reading a leatherbound book as she lay stretched out on a longchair her hair spread behind her on the slatted drying rack they used for the sacred linens on laundry days she hadnt cut that hair for more than thirty years it was a yellowwhite mass thick and coarse as a horses tail she looked up lay the book face down on her stomach as ailiki came lalumping through the door circled round her and stopped to sniff at her feet reyna was close behind faan clinging to his robe i found everything you wanted tai he set the basket on the roof tiles even the ganda root and a bit more seems like faan she was on the landing when i came from the grove no one else in sight no boats upriver or down reason im late ive scoured the koo and just about walked every inch of the riverbank looking for her people she cant talk shes being shy right now and its not much help when she does talk she doesnt speak the fadogur nor any tradetalk ive ever heard and this little creature whos so interested in my feet her names ailiki and shes a mahsar more than that who knows mm bring the child over here reyna stroked faans small grubby hands coaxed her into letting go of his robe and led her to tai pointing to ailiki curled up in a lump next to tais ankles purring loudly faan relaxed curtseyed and made a polite and formal little speech aspa tim tethie biosh primeyksh tai nodded ah i see what you mean how old do you think she is young is as close as i get what i know about children you could paint with a whiting brush on a pinhead tai tugged at an earlobe and considered faan do you mean to keep her reyna touched his face felt the sweat beading there his chest was tight it was hard to breathe he glanced at faan looked down at his feet a small bit of his mind wondered why the feeling was so strong the rest of him merely surrendered to it its your house zazi tai you say who stays he hesitated then added i will keep her i must ah rey rey youre my daughterinabeyhamal that hasnt changed im no ones daughter tai tai spread her hands whats a little thing like a nuhm matter truth lies in the spirit he pulled a clown face his mobile mouth curving down his eyes opening wide its not so small a thing as all that boasting biba reyna flung his arms wide winked at her speaking the truth as you taught me zazi kassian tch its a good thing this baby doesnt understand the fadogur she sobered lay back gazing into the cloudless sky do you realize what this involves rey a childs not a pet i know and you could lose her any moment diyo i know and you have to keep looking for her people rey shes got a mother somewhere a mother who didnt bother to look for her one like mine maybe whod deny her own flesh he said bitterly whod turn away when she saw him on the street his bones coming through his skin you dont know what happened rey dont judge until you do too twitchy to stay still he went striding about the roof fidgeting with this and that he stroked the leaves of the white cadenthas growing as tall as he in their huge ceramic pots shifting the mafuiflowers in their altar vases nipping off crimson trumpets that were beginning to wilt as the morning faded faan wriggled off the longchair and trotted after him like a puppy who couldnt bear to leave her master she patted the dark heartshaped leaves on the lower branches squatted collected the discarded flowers piled them neatly beside one of altar tables legs he checked the water in the bee dish before the altar hive walked away and began following the fence around the edge of the roof peering through the peepholes carved into the poles subarin hasnt taken her sheets in yet shes been sick think we ought to give her a call or is her man still saying he wont see us or an abasoa kasso either potzhead he didnt wait for an answer but shifted to the next hole sailors snoring outside emaurs mulehouse two three five of them somebody better go boot them up or ah theres the shinda guard theyll haul the mutts back where they belong at least theyre good for that faan stood back hands on hips watching the bees fly then scurried along a step or two behind him shying away from the looming tank of the cistern and stood close beside him when he made his brittle nervous comments when reyna reached the door he swung round set his shoulders against the panels faan swung round and set her back against the brick of the parapet chez wants coin and a bottle of the red for his woman to forget what he saw you mind watching the baby or should i take her down to pan leave her here she wont be a bother tais smile faded rey reyna drummed his fingers on the door its what i told you kassian faan tried to drum hers on the brick but her hands werent coordinated enough yet to manage it this time weve had this before i need to relax kassian i can quit any time i want but i dont want to not now sometimes its i need to forget for a while rey you know you dont have to so whod hire a salagaum we need the bribe money to keep the house we have to have water from the shinda cisternsyou want to chance the river he moved his shoulders impatiently hearing the anger in his voice faan crept closer clutched at his robe and pressed herself against his leg or charge for your services how much do we squeeze from a woman with a flux or a baby who cant breathe he dropped into street speech as he flew back to the bad days after his father drove him out impatiently he shook off faan went striding back and forth his soles slapping loudly on the tiles his hands jerking through broad angular gestures starvin tsah i know it you took me off streets bones out m skin and so poxy i coont potz straight owe y diyo i know it owe y zazi ma he stopped his lope swung to face her arms flung wide i like living good i like loving most the time bhaggjagi need it for the other times he sighed dropped his arms anyway im not going to the gatt for a buy just a bribe to keep that sleaze from selling news of faan tai pressed her lips together scowled unhappily at the tiles but when she spoke shed set the old quarrel aside did he get a good look at her reynas shoulders sagged his anger burnt to ash good enough im afraid ibo bad shes such a pretty thing hmm weve got to have papers if were going to keep her even if its only for a short while juvaigrim could do that for you couldnt he diyo but thats touchy reyna rubbed at his eyes lifted the hair off his neck so a breath of air could reach the sweaty skin if the maulapam were forced to take notice of us he let the braids fall moved back to the door and faan the laws and the times being what they are he said wearily itd be difficult for him to refuse if i started asking him favors and dangerous for me because hes not a man to stand for blackmail then you make sure he knows its not thi sat up pulled her hair over her shoulders she closed her book laid it aside and began rubbing strands of hair between her palms squeezing the wet out when she looked round again reyna was bending down touching faans black hair with his fingertips his face gone peaceful tai grimaced if the manassoa find out about her youll lose her fast you know how rabid all of them are against the salagaum and us heretics giza kutakich she wrinkled her long nose hes the worst of a bad lot nearly had me burned for a witch reyna straightened what i didnt know that before you were born just after i came here she laughed a soft burring at the back of her throat he got his nose singed in that one forgot who my brother is that little slip in tact keeps him stuck in bairroa he cant get to corasso no matter how he yearns for it she got to her feet crossed to the fence and dropped on her knees beside faan held out her hand and smiled when faan reached over timidly to touch it diyo honeylove its dark dark im night and youre only twilight she looked up clicked her tongue go go you know how fast rumor runs through the edge reyna washed off eye paint and lip rouge changed into the clothes he wore when discretion was demanded a loose shirt tight trousers a long sleeveless jacket to furtherconceal the breasts he usually carried with pride but bound down now he kicked off his sandals pulled on a pair of hightop boots tugged the braids harshly back from his face locked them at the base of his neck into a wooden clasp carved with the sigil of the fundarim caste it was his by birthright though his family had disowned him and denied him when his breasts started growing he inspected himself in the full length mirror that was his most expensive possession sighed and went out inconspicuous in his trousers and drab jacket he walked up the sokajarua threading through the throng of buyers and sellers then made his way through the maze of booths and tables in the sok circle the heaps of goods piled on grass mats he went past the joyhouses he knew so well the shops and manufacturies until he reached the kariam he sought one of the spokes that ra ated from the sok through the outer city across the lesser ring road that marked the boundary between the biasharam and cheoshim districts to the greater ring road that connected the city estates of the maulapam he turned into kariam moranga walked along in the shadow of the biashar towers concrete monsters ten stories high raised from the ground on iron pillars and iron arches with iron lattices filling the window openings there were shadowy gardens under the arches some of them with bee altars hidden away in bowers womens gardens with fountains at their centers where the sun could touch them each nooning slipping down through the hollow towers fountains hidden away from those who walked the kariams by kichidawa hedges with thick clusters of dark green leaves and shining silvery thorns the length of a mans middle finger the whisper of the unseen water was cool and sweetly seductive he crossed the lesser ring road continued along the kariam moranga outer moranga now on both sides of him rose the great red towers of the cheoshim like the merchants dwellings these apartments built in a rising spiral rested on iron arches and iron pillars but there were no gardens here the red stone facades had iron lace set into them endless repetitions of the warrior sigil wrought and riveted by fundarim ironmasters on the beaten earth of the tbwer grounds cheoshim youths were marching and training riding in formation shooting their bows on command cheoshim warriors protected the armrapake his household the maulapam and themselves but mostly they raided neighboring lands for slaves at least a third of the slaves in bairroa pili came from these raids and they collected a hefty suborrush half the headprice on all the rest this was the chief source of their wealth it pleased reyna to walk free past these bloodred phallic towers and mock them secretly with everything he was he strode along arms swinging wanting to whistle his defiancebut that wasnt prudent cheoshim cadets were squatting at the edge of the grounds playing dados and jiwabufa they got slowly to their feet as he passed stood watching him until he left the kariam and stepped onto the greater ring road he turned north walked along beside the thirtyfoot stone wall that kept strays away from the grand sirmalas of the maulapam families the lords in bairroa pili who owned every grain of dust and sucked coin in the name of order from everyone even the scruffiest of druggedout beggars unlike the biashar merchants and the cheoshim warriors who paraded their wealth and power who liked to strut and intimidate the maulapam owned everything but concealed themselves behind wallswalls of stone walls of secrecy they were almost never seen slaves and servants and resident kassos did their shopping and if they wanted something special merchants were invited into their gatehouses though never beyond the kassian tai wanameh was maulapam she didnt talk much about her early life except once when she said it was boredom to the point of ossification that made her walk away from her house the jiko sagrada or holy way was paved with doublecurved tiles of black iron each of them the length of a mans palm nesting curve into curve with plugbits at the edge to straighten the line the jiko went up the mountainside in a leisurely arc broke into stairs at several points and ended at the blessing gate reyna stepped onto the iron tiles and started the long walk up the side of fogomalin joining the stream of other suppliants heading for the afternoon presentation of pleas and prayers to the high kasso juvalgrim and the council of administrators who served him and chumavayal in him there were mothers with sick children and well children shopkeepers with petitions dockworkers players strangers all of them walking the iron way the blessed way to the camuctarr the temple of chumavayal to get papers stamped judgments made petitions read prayers purchased every need conceivable and probably some beyond conception at the first flight of stairs reyna passed an old woman who was struggling to carry a baby and use her cane at the same time he turned back took the baby from her tucked it in the curve of his left arm and gave her his right to cling to she labored up the seven steps and stood panting and smiling at him reaching for the baby ahsan senho nayo nayo zazouivo ill carry the baby for you if you dont mind my nose in your business oh nayo friend of the gods dont trouble yourself your legs are too long for me im in no hurry zazou he uncovered the babys face a pale face the color of old cream a slave child with dark straight hair like spines the old woman was taking a bastard to the foundling wards part cheoshim from the look of the hair is it a girl or a boy girlchild poor thing he nodded there was nothing he could say to that it was the hard truth if the baby were male he could study for one of the priest orders an unclaimed girl would be fostered with some naostam family already overburdened with mouths to feed where shed be worked to death or sent to earn her bread on the streets as soon as she was old enough he stroked the babys soft cheek and felt like weepink that was faans life unless he could protect her does she have a name no its better not he asked no more questions but bore the weight of the old woman and the baby the rest of the way up the jiko at the blessing gate the old woman took the child back watch over the rivers gift good senho and receive a grandmothers blessing she took his hand wrote with her finger in his palm then went off with the baby up the mercy walk he stared after her and wasnt all that surprised when she melted into the air like fog on a sunny morning it was ttmgjiis sign in the palm of his hand tungjii luck he passed through the gate his heart and step suddenly light magic child and tungjiis blessing it was a wonder thats what it was chapter be loved honeychild reyna bent over the cot faan was fiercely asleep her soft mouth working her hands closed into fists with his fingertips he gently carefully brushed a tangle of black hair out of her eyes and away from her nose tucked the strands behind her ear youre mine my honey by law and by love youre mine he closed his eyes the past month hed walked among the traders asking them about a child with bicolored eyes getting headshakes and raised brows but no word of where faan might have come from hed repeated words and phrases shed spoken but none of them recognized the languageor admitted to having heard it bdore with each negative he relaxed a little though the fear was still there churning in him giving him nightmares if he had to give her up he watched her a moment longer then eased from the dressing room holding his breath as he pushed past the blanket hed tacked up to make door for her so he wouldnt wake her when he came to bed himself and had to light the lamp thankoffering and evensong time to get ready he pulled a hand across his face grimaced at the sandpapery sound and feel sniffed at his armpit and grimaced again all that running around hed done he was ripe he stripped and shaved gave himself a sponge bath from the water in the ewer chanting over and over the dedication to the honey mother until he slid into the calm and muted joy he felt appropriate for evensong and a thank rite the sun was slipping away without much fuss and evening was settling in clear and brilliant the cadenthas were waxy luminous white cups glowing against dark stiff leaves a few late workers from the altar hive hummed about moving from bloom to bloom their wings glittered like shards of mica in the light from areia oneeyes working candle their small black bodies shimmered with gold guard hairs when reyna came off the stairs areia oneeye was spiking the altar candles onto the kinaries one was already in place in front of the hive two others lay beside the squat holders waiting for her to get to them like the others in the verakay beehouse areia moha was one of the kassian tais rescues she was about thirteenthat was tais guess areia had no idea when she was born her exfamily didnt celebrate girlbirthswith the burnt amber skin of a naostam and tight curling chestnut hair coming home late one night from tending a new mother with milk fever tai blundered into a gang of wild boys who were tormenting areia she took her stick to them chased them off and brought the girl to the verakay beehouse for a few nights sanctuary in the end areia stayed as her novice and acolyte she looked around when she heard the door open faan sleeping he set the cones on the altar beside the candles want me to do the poles if you will areia oneeye lifted another candle and began pushing it down on a spike i didnt think to look out the incense tray perhaps the kassian will have it when she brings the honey water reyna twisted the candle into the cup at the top of the pole made sure it was steady then set the kinari in the stand your nursing rounds this morning any talk about faan areia oneeye began trimming the wicks so she could light the candles some bad some grumbling but you know edgers most people mind their own business any threats to try taking her away nayo rumors got about that shes spooky dikhans told everyone what he thinks he saw bee mother you know igd diyo the kassian tai stood before the point of the altar her kinari in one hand the candle flame flickering precariously in the breeze her funbo gripped in the other a staff of aromatic arazwood a foot taller than she was with a dense ceramic sheath on the base and a point shaved to a cone firehardened then waxed and polished to a high gloss carrying thinner shorter fimbos and kinaries with thinner shorter candles reyna and dawa stood at tais right jea and areia oneeye at her left the kassian tai opened her mouth wide produced a humming burring sound in the back of her throat she stepped forward one pace placed her kinari in the stand one by one the others followed her example blending their voice with hers in a complex chord dawa and areia oneeye squatted beside the altar and tapped the rhythm on small drums while the other three danced the bee honors and sang the blessing words tai first then reyna and jea tai sang honey mother we come in the marks of our mortality having chosen you been chosen by you we come with heads bowed and blessing in our hearts giver of gifts we offer you ourselves reyna sang i hear the hum of your wings honey mother low and tender in the sound i am filled with gladness mother of bees i am blessed by your gift honey mother dawa sang you glide through my bones honey mother i taste your sweetness on my fingers i lick crystals of your love from my lips tai sang the river runs by day and night and never stops honey mother so runs your mercy the river floods and buries and retreats honey mother so floods your justice over us fierce and terrible is your justice we tremble honey mother your mercy heals and comforts us you come to us with unveiled eyes and speak without hurry as honey flows we raise our mouths and drink your words honey mother as honey flows we drink your words as honey flows we cherish honeychild as honey flows kosef hayaka howled and brought the switch down on reyna jerked awake he sat up dropped his head on his hands as he struggled to orient himself his father was dead he hadnt dreamed of him for he groped for the robe hed thrown over the chair beside the bed pulled it on and stumbled toward the dressing room faan was curled into a knot whimpering and sobbing her eyes squeezed shut tears streaking her straining face when he picked her up she was hot as a small stove and trembling so violently he had trouble lifting her without hurting her he eased himself down on the cot holding her on his lap as he rocked gently carefully so he wouldnt tip the tottery thing over patting her back rubbing it humming to her singing snatches of sleepsongs he remembered his mother singing to him talking to her slowly slowly he got her calm until she was hiccupping and sighing and so relaxed her body oozed back and forth with his as he rocked he thought she was asleep again and tried to put her down on the cot but her hands froze to his robe and she opened her mouth to howl oh honey honey he grunted onto his feet and carried her into the bedroom honey baby go to sleep sleep sleep he walked back and forth with her back and forth what am i going to do with you sleep honey sleep lovey sleep humming a beehymn he carried her about the room as he collected cushions from the chair and the divan beneath the window the blanket from the cot still holding her he arranged the pillows on the bed then laid her down in the nest and pulled the blanket over her when he moved away she stirred mamay mamay hush honey sh sh just a minute ill be back still talking he discarded the robe and pulled an old shirt over his head he slept nude but he didnt feel right doing that with faan on the bed beside him sh sh honey nothings going to hurt you im here i wont leave you sleep honey sleep lovey sleep he crawled under the covers settled himself on his side his body curved about the nest and laid his hand on a cushion where she could reach it then dropped back to sleep himself reyna bent down touched faans tearstreaked face then pushed past the blanket and passed into his bedroom each time she saw him setting out his evening robes she howled and clung to him tried to keep him from leaving her she wouldnt be satisfied with tai or lea or dawa who played with her more than anyone else she had to have reyna but she was asleep now finally asleep he hated the thought of leaving her but he had a longstanding arrangement with someone he was fond of he wore white on white lace and broiderie blanc with gold chains about his neck the links stylized bees his earrings were large hoops of beeform beads he had more loops of those beads twisted about his wrists his client liked a touch of danger as long as it wasnt threatening the bee heresy was very much to his taste he paid well and had a gentleness that was rare among the cheoshim almost a perversion reyna found this entertaining and enjoyed the doubledance when tumclfinar was his partner he rummaged through his closet found the black leather cloak he seldom wore black was depressing and it made him feel hagged but he needed something to moderate the effect of all that white he swung it round his shoulders and went out jea was waiting in the entry he laughed klann rey you look like a cheossy bride boasting her virgin reyna jigged in a circle arms raised elbows out so the cloak spread like a fan sweet and sassy oh diyo he slapped his hands and pranced warbling nonsense syllables like a kalele singer high falsetto swooping and swinging jea stamped his heels on the inlaid wood clapped his hands a moment then caught reynas wrist and swung into a degge dip a dance some northern slaves had brought with them that biasharim youths had taken for their own a dance with much energy and little grace but it got the blood moving leaning in his doorway panote clapped his hands and added his hooming basso mamay faan came through the door to the inside stairs a strap of her sleeping shift tumbling off one shoulder her hair tangled her twocolored eyes wide and dark with fear reyna dropped his arms swung around honey what you doing down here i thought you were asleep mamay ou heym nayo nayo ou m leps nayo nayoooo she plunged across the entry wrapped her arms about reynas leg sobbing with abandon her body clenched and straining honey faan reyna bent stroked her hair tried to soothe her ill be back baby ive gone out before and ive always come back sh sh lovey im not leaving you hush honey panote dropped beside the child cupped his huge hands over hers now now bad hush your nonsense you come with old pan hell see you right be a good girl now come his voice burred on her crying slackened she loosed her grip blinked at him as if shed never seen him before maksi pan honey pan oh tay say it sweetee pan oh tay pan oh tay she slid her eyes around for a quick peek at reyna then sidled closer to him he laughed swept her up come come honeychild ill show you how to make a muscle reyna scowled after them jea clicked his tongue jealous shame shame rey come on its time we went reyna stood twisting his silk facescarf between his hands staring at the empty chair sibyl he said his voice a hoarse whisper the cave caught the sibilant and hissed it back at him sibyl he said more loudly this time answer me black smoke stirred in the chair solidified into the bright eyed old woman ask i found a child he slid his tongue over dry lips tell me who she is i cannot why nor that is there anything youcan tell me cherish her i will what comes will come it is enough the days passed slow and sweet nenna the month changed to sabba sabba to tikenda tikenda to tamma tamma to jamma as spring ripened into summer nothing was the same at the beehouse at times faan was quiet sad but her memories of her mother and jal virri faded even the home dreams came less and less often and finally not at all she stopped clinging to reyna but she was quiet when he was out and crept up to him afterward touching him over and over again as if she wanted to be sure he was really there she followed him around whenever hed let her went with him when he visited sick women and children playing quietly in one corner of the room while he talked to them massaged them did whatever he could to make them easier as soon as faan picked enough fadogur to answer questions tai talked to her about her mother trying to get some idea where the child had lived for her first three years reyna didnt want to hear any of it the longer faan was with him the harder it was to face giving her up he didnt know if he could do it sometimes he wondered about the strength of his feeling but he didnt want to question it no one had ever given him such joy such intense uncomplicated love after the session was over he put faan down for her nap crooned old songs to her until she was asleep then he left and with dragging steps went down to tai so tai shook her head not much she lived on an island with her mother a man called maksi who i dont think was her father she says hes same color as panote there was another man a pale man with red hair sims her mother was just mother she said the panumi took care of her i couldnt get a clear idea what they were invisible spirits of some kind no other children about so they might be playmates she invented nothing to tell us where to find the place she set her hand on reynas arm vema my friend weve done all we can he set his forehead against the window closed his eyes and shuddered as tears slid down his face thi smoothed her hands over his back kneaded his shoulders the warmth of her strong thin hands sinking into him comforting him helping him regain control faan talked constantly to herself and to anyone whod listen mixing the fadogur she was learning with her birthtongue in a hash of sound that gradually grew more comprehensible with ailild trotting behind her she poked her nose everywhere handled everything got into every drawer and cabinet she could manage to open and there were few beyond her she disrupted the kassian tais meditations knocked plant pots off the altar when she tried to climb up on it nearly pulled the hive over got areia oneeye stung by the angry bees panote began latching his door when he exercised after he pulled a muscle to keep from stepping on her jea put a hook on his door the second time he turned around and found faan watching with fascination as he put on his makeup dawa played with her sang with her but even he couldnt give her all the time and attention she wanted and every time reyna went out at night she howled and screamed until she wore herself outand everyone else nothing was the same at the beehouse his round of nursing visits finished for the day reyna came home and stood shifting from foot to foot as he waited for panote to answer the bell hed made faan stay home this time because he was going down to ladroavivi batt and into some tenements where he wouldnt take a dog let alone a child he yanked on the bee again banged on the door pan its hot out here he yelled whats going on he kicked at the door and waited when panote drew the slide back and saw reyna he twisted his face into a sorry grimace its faan shes disappeared he closed the shutter and pulled the door open we looked everywhere except your rooms my rooms couldnt get in you mustve jogged the latch when you went out i didnt dropping his basket of remedies reyna ran across the entry and up the stairs he tugged at his door but the hook was down and it wouldnt open kick it open they found the mahsar curled nose on tail in front of the lowboy where reyna kept his clothing a drawer was open the width of a finger when reyna pulled it all the way out faan was inside curled up in a nest of rumpled silk deep asleep and sucking her thumb every underrobe reyna owned damp with drool and smeared with dust he swore and with exasperated gentleness shook her awake lifted her from the drawer and stood her on her feet little pest punishing me werent you he muttered go tell the others pan as the beat of panotes feet faded reyna scowled down at the smudged sleepy child nayo he said this is a nayonay faan he took one of the underrobes from the drawer shook it out draped it over his arm and showed her the stains on the silk look at that fa dirty faan heaved a sigh dirty you dont sleep in drawers fa you sleep in your crib say it i sleep in my crib sleep m crib im angry with you baby ive got to wash all these again maybe ive got nothing to wear tonight faan flung herself at reyna wrapped her arms about his waist crushing the silk of his underrobe mamay reyna she wailed mammy mamay don be mad din mean to din din reyna detached her vema vema honey i know you didnt think just dont do this again oh we spoil you silly we do we do he hoisted faan onto his arm drew a finger down a tearstreak lets go wash your face hmm what a face chapter honeychild explores and finds more than she wants on the day of first honey one week before the midsummer fest reyna left before faan was awake to visit the hives in the abeyzaza grove lea went with him to collect changa ponny and balaua to flavor the honeybread kassian tai was on the roof getting ready to brew next years mead beside her areia oneeye was bending over a heavy stoneware pot moving the paddle through the hot bubbling liquid that would end as chunks of honey taffy theyd hand out to the children of the edge on midsummers day panote was at the back door listening to utsapisha gossip and tell stories while her daughters and granddaughters went like a storm through the house dusting and straightening scrubbing floors and windows bagging everything that needed a washingexcept the salagaums clothing they didnt do clothing and the sacred linens which the kassian cared for herself utsapisha was a collection of wrinkles folded about thick old bones and her life had been harder than most but she hadnt let age or aches kill her interest in everything going on around her panote liked her stories they were earthy and full of zest and a sly malice that he knew he should deplore but nevertheless thoroughly enjoyed out in the courtyard where areia oneeye had deposited her to keep her out of the way of the cleaning faan crawled under a flowering bush stretched out on her stomach with her doll under her arm and watched the fountain frogs jump about she liked frogs shed forgot her temperstormfor a while anyway put it aside until reyna came home ailiki was prowling about the bushes pouncing on grasshoppers and eating them two of utsapishas granddaughters came hurrying across the court with bundles on their heads chattering with animation and completely forgetting to close the doors behind them and dahlina just stood there lookin like a fish with heaves yeh y know the pigg was doing it with tohlin all the time dah was thinking he was after her th pigg chooee chooee whod want that loser their voices faded as they wound through the house faan crawled out and trotted after them still chattering they swept out the back door utsapisha was dozing in the armchair panote had brought her she twitched as her granddaughters passed but didnt open her eyes panote was gone for the moment fetching a mug of tea for her the door was open the morning crisp and bright and beckoning faan followed the girls out and down vallaree wynd the rutted unpaved lane at the back of the house ailiki lolloped along after her running off to nose at the patches of grass and weeds growing in a dun and graygreen strip along back walls and rickety pole fences and send small lives skittering off in terror she came trotting back sniffed at faans legs followed her a while then veered off to run up a pole to a second floor balcony and peer in through the windows there she danced along the balconys rail leapt across to the roof next door came down to the alley by way of a dry and dying vine ran back to follow faan again there was a burntout building rotting back to earth around a bend in the wynd with children playing in the weeds and mud where the house had been girls six seven eight years old faan stopped to watch shed never met children before all her life shed lived with adults the girls stopped their screaming and chasing about to stare at her then went back to their game faan walked toward them talking as she plowed through the weeds mixing words shed got from her mother and words shed picked up from the kassian and the others at the house troks she said to demai ball me she reached for the battered wooden sphere as it hit the ground by her feet but one of the girls running after it pushed her roughly aside knocking her down the girl scooped up the ball and threw it an older girl ran past faan came back and picked her up shoved her toward the wynd go way baby she said you too little we don want you she ran back to the game faan stood in the weeds with her mouth open she started to cry but no one came to soothe her the children ignored her the wynd was empty of adults the granddaughters with their bundles had turned off somewhere she stopped crying after a few minutes then picked her way over the ruts and stood in the middle of the wynd looking around she couldnt see the beehouse but ailiki was nearby and she had her doll she brushed it off dirty girl bad angry with you baby clutching the doll to her ribs she went confidently off down the wynd someone always turned up when she needed help the sounds of the game died behind her the backs of the houses were shut tight a ragged stinking old man was sprawled along a wall his mouth open with flies walking in and out of it she moved as far from him as she could dirty she said to the doll she was getting tired and hungry she wanted reyna mamay to come get her and cuddle her and feed her honeysweetened milky coffee as he did sometimes she held her doll out in front of her and shook it bad baby she said ailiki came lalloping back to her and rubbed against her ankles her fur soft and tickling faan tried to start walking again but ailiki was in front of her leaning into her legs trying to turn her so shed go back the way shed come she leaned down tried to push ailiki out of her way overbalanced fell heavily on her hands and knees dropping the doll bad liki she said she groped for the doll got laboriously onto her feet and went trudging on down the wynd ailiki sat on her haunches and whined but faan ignored her the mahsar groaned and trotted after her the pigg and his gang were scruffing down a side wynd tempers on quick trigger tricky and his scourings had stomped them again last night forced them to turn tail and get away any way they could they were simmering with rage and humiliation it didnt help that younger children leaned out from upperstory windows yelling names at them smacking their lips in the shameshame noise pointing their fingers and laughing they turned into the wynd wrestling and hitting at each other flaring into brief shouting matches that the pigg fisted into grudging silence kicking at the dirt whistling cursing a mob of knobby knees and flying elbows violence barely contained faan came round a bend of the wynd dragging her doll by one ann the boys surged in a dark herd about her mocking her pulling at her hair one of them snatched her doll away laughed at her outraged yell threw it to another boy she ran after it he threw it to a third frightened and angry and helpless she started crying the pigg laughed snatched the doll took hold of it by its china legs and slammed it against a wall shattering the head and arms tearing the body so the aro matic wood shavings spilled across the weeds at the base of the wall he swung the rag that was left about his head and flung it away then he grabbed at faan caught hold of her hair and jerked her off her feet she screamed ailiki screamed ran at the pigg black lips curled back over her teeth the piggs lieutenant kicked at ailiki missed pigg kicked and caught the little beast in midshift he sent the mahsar flying up and over the other boys and the road cracked open and huge gray shapeless forms rose from the earth writhing serpent forms that reared up and over the gaping boys roaring soundlessly roars that hurt the mind not the ears a serpent plucked ailiki from the air with its mouth set her gently down the pigg yowled swung a screaming bawling faan up and around and flung her at the serpents another serpent caught her set her down then reared back and darted its head at the pigg he whimpered and went racing away the rest of his gang fleeing with him faan fled blindly back along the wynd running and running whimpering in terror ailiki ran after faan squealing at her trying to break through her panic the gray stone serpents undulated after faan protecting her there were edgers watching children leaning out windows men and women gaping at her and at the monsters undulating behind her they stayed where they were too frightened to try to help a few of the women were lay beeservants with enough education to know what the serpents were they stared at the baby and made abeyhamals lazy eight any child who could call elementals to her was rare magical and dangerous to everyone around her and possibly useful more than one gazed after the terrified child with a mix of wonder and speculation an anacho priest coming from a laying ceremony for the souls of a newly dead boatman was plodding up the wynd head down fingering the skulls and hammerbeads on his prayerchain he almost walked into the serpents glanced up and went pale edging cautiously backward he hugged a wall as the great gray snakes undulated past when the wynd was clear he hurried across it and plunged into the maze of ways and wynds beyond interested only in putting distance between himself and that eerie manifestation of a magic he didnt want to know about panote heard faans screams and hurried into the alley he froze as he saw the serpents talmaks tannakes tannakds he shouted held his arms out before him bent upward at the elbow crossed at the wrist my shield and my strength he ran out knelt in the middle of the wynd spreading his arms blindly faan ran into them he held her tenderly gently she struggled bit scratched kicked but he restrained her without hurting her hush honeychild he said hush lovey its just old pan you know old pan pan oh tay he sneaked a look past her gulped as he saw the huge serpent heads weaving over him then calmed as he understood they werent threatening him ailiki was sitting in the middle of the wynd busily grooming her fur licking at her small black hands and rubbing them over her body shed been hurt by something or someone but she was healing herself as panote watched utsapisha struggled to her feet but panote waved her back keep everyone inside he said she nodded shut the door and rested her back against it faan stopped struggling and begin to sob panote hummed a tannak hymn and the sobbing diminished until the child was leaning exhausted and silent against his massive arm silently

had seen her lift the lid on the desk and dump the snake inside that didnt matter the heads monitor took her out of the class and manasso kunin gave her a dozen strokes of the switch school head manasso kunin drummed his fingers on the sheets of paper sewn together into a lesson booklet the writing on them defaced by thick strokes of black ink crudely written obscenities im waiting he said he had a scratchy voice absurdly incongruent with his massive body sweetly humble and the image of remorse izmit the silversmiths daughter bowed low i am sorry heshim kufuat i offer no excuse smarmy little faan ground her teeth then struggled to control her face as the head glared at her he turned back to inuit his scowl smoothing out as he gave her fifty lines to write i will remember my duty is to charity for all and obedience to my elders izmit bowed again all sugary compliance as she went out she shot a swift side glance at faan her eyes gleaming with satisfaction and triumph you the head snapped at faan whatsyourname get that insolent pout off your face he knew her name well enough shed been here almost every day this month for one reason or another this turbulence this hairpulling

my stuff they call me names and nobody does anything be still fidhil he scowled at her his dark face slick with perspiration they have provocation they were born fundarim he rolled up the pages and dropped them in the wastebasket beside the desk talking as his hands moved you were thrust on them by that he scowled at her his wide mouth twitching into an ugly knot as he reached for the limber switch shed learned to know too well he got up and came round the desk hold out your hand faan squeezed her eyes shut and turned her head away trembling and miserable she did as he commanded you dont belong there wascra his voice was harsh filled with loathing he slapped the switch across her palm you should stay with your own kind slap you will not shout at your elders and your betters slap you will show respect slap respect slap izmit only wrote the truth slap that unnatural whore who adopted you slap his own family threw him out slap do you know what he does slap he went on explaining in liplicking detail precisely how reyna serviced his clients slap slap slap the pain was small in the beginning but it grew and grew until she was sick to her stomach pain changed to heat translucent fire danced along her arms no she cried no no no youre a liar the pale flamelets yearned toward him liar liar liar he shrank back his mouth dropping open she gasped and went running from the room the fire faded as she fled through the halls and out into the yard but she didnt notice she plunged into verakay lane and ran along it head down breath sobbing between her teeth halfblinded by tears of pain and anger and terror desperately she willed friends and strangers alike not to notice her not to stop her or question herand they didnt they moved out of her way in an absentminded shuffle and went on with what they were doing the river drew her that slow deep flow of thick brown water she wriggled unnoticed through the trotting porters ducked under the noses of plodding saisai and ran down a levee workpath into the quiet and shadow beneath the maskoa gatt a small wharf busy with upcountry shipping near the west end of the gatt road a spring flood some decades back had hollowed out the levee below maskoa and the shindagatt had replaced the earth with an eclectic mix of mussel shells broken bricks clay jars and discarded paving stones covered this mass with dirt then scattered grass seed thickly over it near the end of the next rainy season an old rowboat lodged against the patch and stayed there when the water went down faan dropped onto hands and knees scooted up the matted grass flung herself on a broken paving stone and sobbed until her throat burned and her head ached a small warm body pressed against hers wriggled up under her arms until a cold nose was pressed against her face ohhh my liki she crooned hoarsely ohh my aili people are so awful feet thudded back and forth above her as the porters worked to empty the barge tied up at the gatt handtrucks rumbled by over her head these noises mixed with the shouts and laughter of the sailors and the porters it was a kind of sound quilt vaguely comforting a voice like a mosquito hum cut through the quilt so whats all this startled she shifted around on the stone sat up wiping her nose on the back of her hand the mahsar flowed around her curling up in her lap perched on the bow of the stovein boat was an absurd little figure ancient and bearded and brown no bigger than her fist with shaggy green fur like seaweed on his back and around his loins what are you her voice was hoarse she coughed swallowed he scratched the weedy fur around his belly found a water flea popped it between his wee thumbnails and flung it onto the mud riverman he said what do they he jerked a thumb at the planks over his head call you nervously shestroked ailikis fur uncertain what she ought to dobut shed been taught courtesy to elders even oddities like this little man besides friendliness and interest flowed sweetly from him like the incense the kassian tai burned for abeyhamal faan heshim riverman why you grievin faan she chewed her lip stared down at the dusty toes of her halfboots my mother does things for money she burst out the heads hurting words tumbling in her head she couldnt bear to say them so riverman kicked his feet against the rotting planks of the boat his shiny black eyes fixed on her ugly things her voice trailed off as she looked past him and saw a head poking out of the river features sculpted in liquid crystal delicate mouth opening and closing soundlessly great lambent eyes staring at her whats that riverman twisted round waved his tiny hand at the creature got a silent laugh from it as it sank gradually into the thick brown water water elemental he said come to have a look at you me why riverman shrugged your ma hes salagaum uh diyo the head she swallowed pressed both hands hard on her middle he told me likes to hurt y uh she nodded the two braids reyna plaited for her every morning bouncing against her shoulders y ma hurt you hurt anyone nayo vema tell me whos handsome whos ugly but its awful what he does reyna i mean makes me sick when i think about it how can i go home and look at him how can i look at my friends if they know of course they know did it matter before mateesee i dont think anything would bother her theres not much she doesnt know dossan shes never said she pressed her hands to her eyes and began feeling better a little she was still sick and cold she couldnt think about reyna others came tiny people soapbubble people smaller than her thumb they sang to her eerie sounds like a wet finger rubbed round the rim of a glass bubbles with eyes she couldnt quite see but knew were looking at her foamed up out of the ground bobbed in the air about her shimmering with rainbow ripples over a transparent silver base they danced along her arms where the flames had been cool touches that comforted her eased the terror that took hold of her each time she remembered how close shed been to burning up herself and everything around her then riverman sang a skein of hissing popping sounds and the bubble people went sliding away to sink into the levee taking their light with them leaving her in sunstriped shadow wild magic riverman said they like you she slid her palm down her arm feeling small tingles as if the bubble people had left something of themselves behind my teachers say theres no such thing riverman grinned at her after a minute she grinned back he scratched and waited his unhurry as soothing as the everyday sounds coming down through the planks as the porters finished the unloading so he said after a long silence called fire did y deeyo she wrapped her arms about her knees shivered scared yself uh she blinked at him what she mostly felt was numb but a nebulous queasiness stirred in her after a minute she nodded you need a teacher little faan someone wholl show you how to manage those things im not going back to that school not ever i dont care what reyna says or tai or any of them verna vema sorcerie sibyl thats who you need go see friend of mine ill send word and you go find her uh she blinked

clowngrimace relaxed into agrin come see me again uh faan stopped at the mouth of the wynd smoothed her hands over her hair and took a last scrubat her face then she stepped out onto the board walkway of verakay lane ailiki trotting beside her fa wait for us dossan and mateesee were running toward her weaving through the crowd on the street their school sacks bumping against their backs she felt like vomiting and for a moment she thought of running away but she straightened her shoulders and turned to face them oooo eeee fa mateesee swung into place at her right side and dossan settled more

mama kubaza was setting up for her band yipped again as the big woman swatted at her missing her intentionally ran through the legs of zinar the porter manasso kunin was here an hour ago the kassian tai sat in her massive visitation chair the takaffa cloth drapped over one heavily carved arm her visit robes sliding into heavy graceful folds about her thin body as she leaned forward reyna and areia oneeye arent back yet which is just as well i quashed him for the moment faan fidgeted and stared at her feet you called fire that was a stupid thing to do honey faan looked up startled the

starts up they need someone to blame faan dragged her boot toe back and forth across the floor she didnt understand all that only that tai was disturbed about something that didnt really have anything

murmured pull up that hassock and sit down faan ill tell you what i know reyna came into the sitting room looking tired and mussed he yawned threw himself into a chair ten kids and every one of them sick with something toothache to colic faan gulped ran from the room what was that about dawa shrugged shes been sneaking looks at us all afternoon rey probably one of those kids at the school said something reyna swore and pulled himself onto his feet wheres tai left a note saying she was going to see the sibyl and shed be back for dinner jea came quickly across the room ive heard some talk rey and panote said manasso kunin came storming in mad to his eyebrows about something that happened at school faans had a bad day maybe you better let her work it out herself i promised id be there anytime she needed help reyna slammed the door behind him leaned against it for a moment then went up the stairs his feet dragging he should have explained things the first time she had trouble but she was so young only eight years old how could he make her understand and i was afraid he thought if she couldnt accept it if she pushed me away in disgust klaan i dont know what id do he knocked at her door faan ive got to talk to you nayo the word was muffled by walls but he could hear the panic in her voice im coming in honey i dont know what someone told you but its wrong theyve made it wrong

agonizing as he felt the hardness of the muscles under his fingers what happened faan you can tell me you can tell me anything i love you bebe she gasped then pulled her hand away and clamped her mouth shut the only sound was a faint whine that escaped through her nose someone told you what i do thats tight isnt it silence diyo and they made it ugly because their minds are ugly faan shuddered at first she was pale then flushed a bright red then pale again all the time her eyes were tightly shut her face turned away from him honey my bebe im not going to ask you who said it or what he said im just going to say he doesnt understand he smoothed his hand over her hair pulled a wandering strand off her face dont you love me any more do you want to leave me faan gasped she flung herself around and lunged at reyna butting her head against his breasts hugging him nayo mamay nayo nayo nayoooo she started crying sobs tearing out of her shaking her whole body reyna held her and wept also much more quietly she loved him still she called him mamay a joy flooded through him so intense it was hard to tell it from pain chapter the shaping of the prophet begins wenyarum taleza high maulapam and hereditary general of the armies of the amrapake of zam fadogunun looked with loathing at his wife snorted and strode with military vigor to one of the windows on the east side of the cluttered sitting room he was not a young man but a vigorous one handsome in a bony way his blueblack hide gleaming with the oils from his morning massage the only wars hed fought were on a chessboard but he never appeared in public in anything but his leathers and halfarmor they reinforced his sense of his own importance fed his ambition which was as limitless as his lack of imagination allowed penhari banadah continued to ignore him concentrating on the stitches she was setting in the lushly burgeoning floral pattern painted onto the canvas stretched across the frame leaves writhed in flamelike double curves vines twisted in and out of elaborate knots and around heavy graceless flowers she used primary colors throughout saturated clashing colors that gave a nightmare vitality to the piece the robe she wore was wrinkled and stained around the hem from the mud she plowed through in her gardening her hair was neatly braided and wired into elaborate interlacing loops because her chief maid had scolded her into sitting down and letting it be done she had the traditional face paint on but only the min imum required by etiquette and her ears were as bare as her fingers she disliked jewelry and never wore it unless she was forced to with the bluntness her brother and her husband found disconcerting and distasteful shed say im not a cow i dont need tags in my ears over his shoulder wenyarum said i should have poisoned you years ago you didnt have the nerve then you dont now you shouldnt be so sure my dear ha because my brother despises me you know better an attack on me is an attack on him hed have you garrotted before my ashes were cold she set the last stitch in the color she was using pulled the needle free and began searching through the tangled skeins in her workbox for the strand she wanted he was silent for several minutes scratching his long goldpainted nails on the windowsill she shivered but said nothing your brothers patience has its limits when it comes to the boy and what youve done to him ah the boy she laid the end of the yarn in a small fold of parchment eased the parchment through the eye of the needle ran the yarn through the canvas then began setting stitches in the new color hes a mess he curled his hand into a fist brought it down hard on the sill kassocoddled cries if he squashes a mosquito tchah disgrace why you put him in that school for milklappers he scowled at her over his shoulder turning him into he pulled his heavy mouth into an exaggerated pout into a prancing kuash slobbering over those gelded donothings hes wasting his opportunities she continued to set her stitches without bothering to respond apart from a mild satisfaction that he was so disturbed by his sons idiocies she was in different to both of them these days even the angry malevolence shed felt from the moment morning sickness overtook her through the difficult delivery that had nearly killed her until she was able to pass the child to a wet nurse even that scratchy freeform fury was washed away by the tides of her indifference no more he shouted no katlin more im getting him out of that nursery for fools sending him to the cheoshim make a man out of him even a year ago she might have listened then maneuvered to thwart him now she didnt care he could do what he wanted with the boy as long as he didnt bother her its time he was betrothed hes old enough wenyarum said make connections for him allies he waited for an answer but got none rah woman youre his mother its your business to find him a wife she moved her shoulders impatiently from what you say he wouldnt be interested chumvey he will be if he knows whats good for him he tapped his hand on the sill and glared out the window you want a wife for him ask one of those whores youve been tupping for years she might know which girls not yours im sure i dont unless you find some titillation in the thought of the boy wedding a halfsister she looked at him stonefaced as he swung round and took a step toward her if you beat me ill kill you and him too unnatural woman hes your child born of your body and i nearly died of him unnatural child tearing his mother in his gieed to be born she smiled at him her hands clasped loosely in her lap tchah if i hadnt been besotted id have repudiated you when i found you not virgin besotted with power dont you think i knew that dont you

hell slit your throat me amrapake oh famtoche wasnt the first either my father had that honor i think i was four at the time by my eighth birthday i was too old for him so he passed me on to my brother and famtoche pushed me off on you and you took me and kept your mouth shut about my shall we say imperfections because you were ambitious youve been paid well for your silence and your complicity my dear husband get out of here i want to see you again as little as you want me he licked his lips not daring to look at her after a moment he swung around and stalked out penhari let her eyelids droop shut a moment then she shook herself and went back to her tapestry the quiambo prime walim korongo stepped back and let the general precede him into the workroom a tall boy all bone and skin faharmoy was bent over the holy thxts copying a page with meticulous care adding his own embellishmentsto the plain text hed already illuminated the first letter with an elaborate interlacing of angular lines and forms chumavayals hammer and anvil predominating overlaying the black lines with brilliant color and a touch of gilding now he was working on the columns of glyphs his fingers trembled between strokes but were ironsteady when he was laying down the lines of ink he was concentrating so furiously on making the page perfect he was unaware of the men standing beside him looking down at his work wenyarum taleza reached toward his son started to speak but the quiambo prime caught his arm wait the old kasso murmured wenyarum shrugged let his hand drop because he couldnt bear to watch his sons finicking work he moved across the room to one of the windows and stared out through the bubbled glass into the inner court with its sacred fountain he came back to the table when he heard the quiambo prime speak to the boy thats fine work mal faharmoy the quiambo said we will miss you here at the camuctarr miss me heshim korongo your father has come for you mal faharmoy your life will take another direction after this i hope you will not forget the things you have learned here the old mans hand closed hard on the boys shoulder a silent warning faharmoy stood silent contained his confusion and anger constrained by years of discipline wenyarum taleza stared at his son with concentrated dislike jerked his thumb at the door and went out faharmoy followed him so long ago their names were lost to memory and myth the builders raised gom corassos camuctarr on a black basalt cliff high above the inland sea they called the lakethatneverfails they built the great wall about gom corasso with the blocks of stone they quarried from the side of the firemountain choromalin when they leveled the space for the temple and chiseled the road down to the water gom corasso a gold and black city of towers and gardens she sits inside a starpatterned wall with four gates and twenty towers the shattered sapphire freshwater sea washes against her blue and lavender mountain ranges cup round her to merge just beyond fireheart choromal in faharmoy stood blinking in the blinding sunlight of the suppliants court watching his father stamp around muttering curses as the minutes passed and the chair didnt come he slid his hand across his mouth to hide his smile enjoying the sight of his father thwarted everyone had to wait here even the amrapake the mighty brought low equal in chumavayals sight with the sorriest of beggars the bearers quicktrotted across the court their tanned hides slick with sweat wenyarum taleza settled himself in the chair closed the door with a snap walk beside me silently faharmoy took his place his father slapped his hand on the door and the bearers started forward walking a few steps then breaking into a trot faharmoy loped along beside them blessing chumavayal that his road was down not up he brooded as he ran why now since he emerged from his mothers womb his sire hadnt bothered with him beyond the yearly ceremonies of his birth and he had to come to those or risk rumors about his sons legitimacy rumors ah its true then famtoches making me his heir he sneaked a quick look at his father but there was nothing to read in that somber profile whats he up to whats he mean by this by the time the chair reached level ground and approached the temple gate he was exhausted and panting but hed lost his fear he was too angry any longer to

the honeychild came nine years since the goddance began she closes her eyes her hands tighten on the finials the black opal gleams changes so many changes faharmoy the dedicated young scholar is a dedicated warrior now fervor is fervor he would be the same whatever he did the amrapake is pleased with him he openly speaks of faharmoy as his heir in spite of this he hasnt set his hand on faharmoys head and proclaimed you are he the sibyl chuckles shakes her massive head heirs have been known to hasten the day as obtuse as ever the general is busy making enemies with his arrogance changes so many changes the salagaum grow more discreet they carry their robes in a bag when theyre out and bind down their breasts and the honeychild ahhh poor little reyna poor little salagaum you picked up what you thought was a kitten and it turned to a tigress in your hands and it will get worse ah diyo faan dug in her shoulderbag brought out a stub of candle and worked it into a crack in the cave floor she poked at the wick with her finger drew her hand back at a word from the sibyl the sibyl sang a note and the candle lit focus on the flame she said thats your lesson this week that and nothing else focus on the flame be one with it understand it tease out the currents in it and see how they clash and meld to make the light take shape faan fixed her eyes on the fire reached within and found the means slowly painfully it began to come apart thread by thread she combed the light and separated the twisted strands abruptly it broke away from her expanded enormously and whooshed at her the sibyl spokea word that shattered air but made no sound the fire was gone banished faan brushed ash from her face and scowled what did i do wrong this time the sibyl laughed honey honey youve learned your lessons too well loosen up be flexibleor barbecued faan rubbed irritably at her nose but you said that was then when you needed it this is now when you need something else vema lets try it again next lesson honey for now were going to do wind lets see you catch the wind faan squeezed one hand inside the other tell me about my mother first you know who she is where she

blue flames danced on the backs of her hands tell me why the sibyl sighed the answer is the same now as it was yesterday and the day and the day before that consider honeychild the wind blows and has power but you cant see it it has layers and eddies like the river consider them touch them turn them this way and that consider the wind chapter one night and the morning after with ailiki running in circles about them and chittering with excitement faan dossan and mateesee slapped hands and hopped in a rocking tailswitching dance giggled linked arms and went strutting down the lane wascra girls

faan and dossan kicked and scratched but he wouldnt let go peshalla the ilivemer came roaring out brought a heavy rungo down on the muleheads wrist and broke his grip then grabbed his collar and the seat of his pants and threw him down the nearest wynd speeding him on his way with a heavy boot he came back dusting his hands and looking satisfied get outta here you scraps he chuckled shook his head wascra girls hunh two habatrizes leaned from an upper window applauding loudly and louok the nimble tossed a copper moju to the girls as he went into peshallas for his evening meal ahsan ahsan

forgot whats fun other women and sometimes old men leaned out of upper windowsyelling at them to shut their mouths and get where they belonged threatening them with shinda guards according to whim they ignored these shouts or stopped their strut screamed taunts at the person interfering in their lives gozi the ramp and his gang came prowling down the lane as faan was using tongue and imagination on mazabo the ragandbone man they milled about listening for a moment then added their own taunts and sassdances they were fourteen fifteen young apprentices out on a tear gozi the ramp cupped his hands about his mouth chooee hoop hoop hoop chooeeeee he howled bite m bebe chew m hard and spit in out chooee hoop hoop hoop chooeeee rag man bag man eat his own potz dossan chanted clapping and stamping slapping her arm her midfinger thrusting chooee hoop hoop fugo and wiswan hooted while they danced in a circle about their leader snapping their fingers jerking their heads their hair spikes swaying mateesee thrust two fingers in her mouth and started to whistle then yelped and danced back as a cascade of dirty soapy water flooded down from the upper window as she looked up she saw a pair of shinda guards running toward them tchika buzzit fleas comin the two sets scattered into the wynds and ways of the backbehind of the edge lost the guards after the first few turns the three girls sat on a deserted gatt swinging their legs over the side and watching the torches of the priestprocession climbing the sacred way mateesee poked faan whatd y learn today show us huh huh faan wrinkled her nose you spooky teesee i think you crazier bout this than me mateesee giggled you learn it me i figure ways of using it like the time we had rullah the snerk running down verakay

and began tickling first one then the other her strong agile fingers raking their ribs when theyd laughed themselves weak they lay on the worn planks staring up at the sky breathing in deep sighs blinking at stars drifting in and out of thin dry clouds after a while mateesee said fugo said theres gonna be a fire on the jang tonight wanna go dossan sat up fiddled with the leather thong shed tied about her wrist glanced sideways at faan faan looked down at ailiki who was stretched across her stomach looking back at her nose twitching ears laid back she sat up dislodging the mahsar diyo she said les do it the jang was at the end of verakay lane a vaguely circular tract of wasteland beyond the last tumbledown shacks and hovels of the edgea few patches of tough short grass stretches of dusty hardpan beaten into something likeconcrete by the feet of generations of youths rustling clutches of stunted trees rising from the firethorn scrub growing round the rim of the open space it was the unofficial meeting ground for those out of school but not yet nailed down to their life work for outcasts and castoffs and for those who never had aplace to be thrown out of a dance floor an assignation house without walls or roof a place to get high on anything cheap or fightthere were screaming hairpulls knife duels gang bashes and one night in ten bloody riots all three girls were forbidden to go anywhere near the place theyd been talking about going there for weeks now an immense bonfire roared in the middle of the jang dark figures jagged back and forth clots of them melding and breaking apart flowing between the three improvised stages scattered around the periphery where street singers and their bands were working out the bands came to the jang to sing things they wouldnt dare in the street to try modes besides the saccharine sentimental wails that brought the money from sailors and merchants or the wordless kalele jams they came for the wildness the sex and the drugs and always for the coin they could pick up there titillated by fear and uncertainty giggling nervously faan and her friends drifted along the fringes of the groups using the music to shield them from attention they werent sure they wanted two drummers tapped and caressed a triune beat from their skins a double reed horn moaned and shrieked an erhu keened over and around them the player perched on a weathered box fingers trembling as they slid up and down the two strings while he worked the arched bow delicately between them the singer stamped and belted out his words three light syllables and a long warbling one that lasted another three beats doin me ba a ad saippin m pr i ide suckin m li i ife making me ma a ad hey ey i sa a ay kiss m ba ack si ide hey ey i sa a ay suck m kni i i ife hey ey i sa a ay doin me ba a ad doin me bad gozi the ramp elbowed his way close behind faan she knew he was there gave him an absent smile over her shoulder and went on swinging her body and clicking her fingers he rubbed his thumb along her neck she let him for a minute or two then shied away she didnt want him touching her any more wanna dance she looked round raising her brows having heard only the rumble of his voice huh he leaned closer shouted in her ear dance y wanna dance she hesitated a minute she didnt know what she wanted he got impatient and gave her buttock a squeeze she yelped and flew away from him bounced off a halfdrunk porter wriggled away from him as he grabbed at her when she had her breath again shed lost mateesee and dossan though ailiki was still trotting close to her ankle the people around her were shadows and strangers busy with their own affairs and not interested in her so she relaxed and followed her ears over to mama kubazas band theyd been stretching and drinking exchanging friendly insults with the shadows standing round them now they got into a new set a fiddle an erhu and a horn with clog dancers for the beat a man in black with an eyepatch sang in falsetto and mama kubaza a big solid woman twice his size belted out her responses in a voice so deep she was almost a basso gonna gonna gonna get ya he sang gonna gonna gonna get ya she sang gonna gonna gonna get ya the shadowy listeners sang fighting with musicians to control the night that ant new nayo nay ohe sang nayo nay o she sang nayo nay o the shadows sang nayo nay so

ee they sang together gonna be free free ee free ee free ee the shadows sang thats right the dancers and musicians joined the singers for that last powerful shout the tension ran out of the group and they shifted to an aimless milling while the listeners snapped their fingers and whistled their approval mama kubaza leaned over took a bottle from someone faan couldnt see tilted her head back and began draining it faan watched fascinated as her throat moved and she leaned back farther and farther until it seemed shed strangle or fall flat if it went on any longer mama brought the bottle down aaah she said hoarsely real real then she laughed her laughter booming louder than the clogs had real rotyourgut whatd you do shunkh piss in the thing someone pinched faans arm she recoiled ready to

mateesee linked arms with her dossy is waitin for us down the lane she tugged faan along through the crowd he painted the jail roof last month you know midsummer comin up got a bucket of red left over and since you showed us how you can peel anything clean faan pulled loose danced in a circle ran toward dossan who was standing in the middle of the lane light from the wounded moon glowing on her fine pale hair red red red faan sang wascra wascra she slapped hands with dossan wheeled and slapped hands with mateesee they linked arms and went giggling off down verakay lane heading for the shop of bamampah the woodman the guard compound beside the jail had its walls freshly whitewashed for the midsummer festa beautiful smooth white as the clouds that werent coming this summer a watchman was perched up in the front tower but the wascrarumorline in the edge said he spent the time drinking and spitting since nothing much ever happened around there not wholly trusting the whispers the three hugged the heavy black shadow at the base of the wall until they reached the overhang by the ironbound front door with quick sweeps of their brushes they wrote three glyphs shinda guards eat potz fizzing with giggles they struggled to smother they scooted off halfterrified halfelated by their own daring dossan swore under her breath and held the bucket away from her the paint splashed toward the rim and the bail clanked like a guards danger as they ran along the lane slow up she called her voice held to a desperate whisper or we lose it faan flicked her dripping brush at a wall swung round and danced backward wascra she whis pered wascra waa she slowed lets hit the school next school mateesee scratched at her nose leaving behind a streak of red that the moonlight turned black spose we could she inspected the bucket got a lot left f we dont spill it dossan wrinkled her nose i wanna do fedunzi the silversmith gotta do him she jerked her head up as ailiki came galloping past them and she heard a distant metallic rattle her friends called her catears because she heard things most of them couldnt buzzit fleas comin she dived down a narrow wynd between two houses when the guard squads lanternman slipped the slide on his dark lantern and directed the beam along the wynd dossan and maleesee were already around the corner and faan had her body pressed into a shallow doorway the yellow light beam caught ailikis backside as she scratched industriously at the dry cracked earth the lanternman said something faan couldnt make out and the squad marched on ailiki sat on her haunches wriggled her nose a moment later she trotted unhurriedly after mateesee faan sighed and followed her guardsre itchy tonight she whispered when she was even with the others maybe we should give it up and go home mateesee shrugged drew the drying stiffening brush along the mudbrick of the backwall leaving scuffs of red behind then nothing as the paint wore off maybe she said dossan frowned shook her head no gonna tell everyone what that kuur is for the little un you go home f you want mateesee drew invisible lazy eights on the wall the brush scratching at the soft brick her tongue moved quickly along her lower lip flicking back and forth as it always did when she was disturbed about something after a minute she said zizi it was him dossan nodded bara the stick said so diyo but vema vema i know mulehead but i heard him tell it this is different the paint bucket clanked again as she shivered violently faan touched dossans arm whos zizi dossan grimaced her thin face drawn and oldlooking cmon dossy tell me a streetrat thats all little un bout five something like that well a bit more cousin of mine his mums my mums baby sister what she used to call her anyway one

do it again if we dont tell and no ones gonna listen to us were kids and wascra so we gotta make em talk maleesee grimaced it wasnt fun any more and she didnt like being serious faan sucked in a long breath and let it out the night had gone flat for her too but she was ready to back dossan wherever her idea led the shop of fedunzi the silversmith was closed tight against the dark heavy shutters over the windows and a halfstarved hound chained beside the door dossan looked round the corner saw the dog and drew back chewing her lip fa can you sleep him like you did the rat faan looked scratched at her ear i spose hes a lot bigger mateesee wriggled her body impatiently scuffdanced around in circles saying nothing faan glanced at her irritated then went back to her problem im kinda tired dossy why dont we just leave it paint something on the school wall no nobody but young uns pays any tendon there i want to start the old uns talkin you know dont take much or last long faan rubbed her back along the walls rough bricks you ought to come talk with kassian tai at the beehouse i cant fa things at home are she shrugged do it huh faan kept her back against the wall and slid down until she was sitting on her heels hands resting on her thighs she grimaced at the scummy dirt between the silversmiths house and the next one over ive got to clean us up too member takes it out of you she reached into a pocket in her belt squeezed out an odd shaped pearl a water elemental had given her and tossed it to the ground in front of her knees it lay there white and shining in the moonlight shimmering she focused on it began whispering the powerwords the sibyl had helped her find embarrassing words she didnt want the others to hear dossan looked repeatedly around the corner as soon as she saw the hound lower his drooling jaws on his forelegs and shut his eyes she caught up the paint bucket beckoned to mateesee and went running for the front of the shop dossan tapped faan on the shoulder carefully sliding from the trance as the sibyl had taught her faan let the spell evaporate into the night the hound surged onto his feet and started howling mateesee darted around the corner dropped the brush into the bucket buzzit her whisper was urgent faan scooped up the pearl staggered as she tried to stand mateesee and dossan caught hold of her arms heaved her onto her feet then they ran into the maze of wynds between the houses spurred on by the continued belling of the hound and the old mans hoarse yells with ailiki trotting before them they reached the river unnoticed tossed the bucket and brushes into the water and huddled under a gatt while faan worked another spell and peeled the paint off skin and clothing she was so tired by the time they were clean dossan and mateesee had to pull her onto her feet and hold her up for a few steps until she was in the groove again there was a crowd milling about in the lane muttering fedunzi had slammed his window down and retreated into a stubborn silence refusing to answer the yells of the shinda guards or the hammering on his front door zizimurder was scrawled in huge glyphs across the front of the shop a phallus and testicles painted on the door in swooping lines and fedunzi rapes babies dossan poked her elbow in faans ribs see she whispered vema vema mateesee grabbed a handful of shirt on both the others tugged them back les bouzh tchika i wanna hit m bed fore th sun come up she didnt wait for them but went darting off toward vallaree wynd and her mothers house dossan went with faan until they could see the beehouse ahead and two figures strolling toward it from the direction of the sokajarua faans hand tightened on dossans arm thats trouble she whispered you better go dossan nodded um see y tomorrow verna faan said absently she heard the soft scrape of dossans feet then she went slipping through the shadows of the lane intent on reaching the beehouse before reyna and jea got there faan lay in bed listening to the quiet footsteps coming up the stairs if reyna had noticed her hed be in to talk soon as hed washed up she needed to tell him about fedunzi to get him to explain why why she needed to know if hed ever he hadnt he couldnt have she lay a long time shivering and miserable he didnt come and didnt come then the door opened its way after midnight where were you what were you doing out this late it was like he was beating her with the words she rolled onto her side turning her back to him pulled the quilts higher and lay stiffly still his voice softened but it was too late his first words had wiped away everything but anger fury and hurt faan im not scolding you im worried about you the edge is no place ahhh honey so many things could happen to you bad things i wish you didnt understand though im afraid you do children do with angry angular movements faan bounced up jerked the quilt around her shoulders and sat in the middle of the knotted sheets glaring at reyna understand i understand a lot of things reyna snapped his head up and back as if shed slapped him whats that supposed to mean faan set her mouth in a stubborn line i wasnt out whoring like you if thats what you think reyna drew his arm back his hand closed into a fist but he stopped himself before he touched her he closed his eyes and stood shuddering faan could smell the anger on him and whipped up her own to match it he drew in a long unsteady breath i dont know what to do with you i just dont know he swung around went out faan stared at the door a moment then wrapped the quilts around her and tried to sleep sliding in and out of nightmare for the rest of the night the drums beat like tinny hearts ta ta ta tiiyi ta ta turn the heavy throb at the end of each phrase dying into a wobbling ta a a ta ta ta tiiyi ta ta tummta as a thedaround hummed and buzzed zou zoul za za za zing za a kalele singer stood on a wooden drum behind the musicians a slender coalblack man who looked

swaystampwheel his sandals pat tering on a sanded section of floor within a circle of limelights in tin reflectors that threw their glow up from beneath waking oiled blue glimmers on his skin watery shimmers in the blue satin lining of his robe he danced his ambiguity his sexualityand with his height his physical beauty with all his shadows running the wrong wayhe was strange and intimidating though he did not mean to be the cheoshim armsman slowdanced body to body with reyna hayaka then took him to one of the dim booths lining the sidewalls he pulled the curtains shut and began kissing the salagaum with rough impatience his hands busy on breasts and buttocks reyna placed his palm over the armsmans mouth leaned back against the mans knotted arm i am salagaum he murmured not habatrize the man rolled his head with an abrupt almost violent gesture wrenching reynas hand away i know he growled when his mouth was free you been paid havent you y well whats the problem as long as you know what i am none reyna drew his fingertips down the armsmans face come upstairs he whispered ignoring the mans roughness keeping his voice soft and beguiling theres no need for such hurry ill please you better if you give me time no think i wanna be seen with somethin like you his fingers tightened on reynas flesh his grip was bruising painful you do it here now he shifted his hold slammed reyna onto

fluttered about her ripe body oh ah oh pas si co she crooned an hour before moonset there was a small confusion at the heavy velvet drapes concealing the door as half a dozen newcomers pushed through five of them cheoshim youths their black spiky hair cut short predatory eagerness in their faces the sixth was a few years older a sleekly muscled mal descending the stairs for the fifth time reyna stopped to watch the mal thinking he was very like dawa had the same kind of bones and blaze to him although he had a finer polish than dawa ever acquired his hair was disciplined into a heavy braid that hung in a club down his back he wore cheoshim warrior leathers with careless ease and moved with the quiet liquid grace panote the doorkeeper showed on one of his better days he let the others scatter without him and stood by the drapes looking around his face expressionless reyna came down the last steps and drifted to one of the seats pushed up against the front wall he was tired and feeling battered but he couldnt leave yet the beehouse salagaum were hired till the enddrum went none of them would get their fee if any of them left early pay was becoming a problem these days the salagaum of bairroa pill had to deal with increasing interference from the secular city shindas bribes going up and their fees going down and there was nowhere they could troll for new clients the joyhouses that had been exclusively salagaum had been harassed then shut down by these officialsthe maulapam sent word it had to be done and it was done at the manassoa orders urging the shinda board had passed clothing laws that banned salagaum robes on the street and solicitation laws that were supposed to drive from the city prostitutes of all ages and sexes but were applied only to adult salagaum the childrenforrent and the female habatrizes were mostly ignored the young mal dropped onto the bench beside reyna hayaka and sat with impassive face watching the guests labor to have fun couples swaying in body to body hugs meant to be dancing feet scraping over the floor hands rubbing flesh and cloth bhaggan smokers sitting and holding hands in reeling babbling rings about a bubbling waterpipe pepepo drinkers hopping alone to music they alone seemed to hear habatrizes and the other salagaum going up and down stairs with and without companions parts of them a section of face a hand an arm a breast a thigh passing through spots of light the rest lost in the shifting swaying clots of shadow there were whispers all around voices drifting in and out of the desultory tumpzing from the drums and daroud its all very dreary the mal said suddenly reyna blinked he didnt feel like talking but he was being paid to respond i suppose so he said its late why do people do this huh you dont seem to be enjoying it alarmed reyna willed a smile to his face touched the mans forearm with his fingertips the muscle was tight under the skin and there was a film of sweat that his fingers slid on the man no he was more like a young boy on his first date he was nervous that pretended disdain was his attempt at controlling a situation where he didnt know the rules or have the kind of edge he usually enjoyed reyna had seen it before a hundred times and a hundred more but never in an adult as old as this even those boys the mal brought with him had more ease about them he shook off his weariness and got back to work oh diyo he said but you know how it goes an evening has its ebbs and flows and sometimes theres a need for quiet and sometimes theres a need to shout you know he stilled his fingers let them build small pools of warmth on the young mans arm that is true the mal smiled the quiet times can be good times though theyre best when theyre shared shared mmmh reyna lifted his hand laid it on the silk that covered his thigh bowed his head so the supple braids fell gleaming between him and the mal youre a visitor to bthrroa pili yes how did you know i havent seen you before id remember you you have a presence i dont know i cant describe it but its there diyo id remember you the mal fidgeted flattered but nervous he didnt seem accustomed to compliments weve been on a punish raid into the jinocaburs it just happened that we returned to fadogur this way ah ive heard stories what is it like what is it really like reyna straightened thrust his hand beneath the braids lifted them back behind his shoulder settled them with a flirt of his head hmm the mal sat stiffly hands on knees staring at the dark figures out on the floor though reyna had the feeling he wasnt seeing them after a few moments of silence he began talking hesitantly at first as if he had trouble putting words together into coherent phrases control reyna thought as he listened with the skill that courting strangers had given him thats it he hasnt opened himself to anyone for years probably abeys sting i hate this blood and pain and death punishment raid diyo oh diyo hes trying to justify the killing he knows surely he knows this is a blooding raid for those cheoshim boys him too i think virgin in several senses as he talked the mal relaxed and warmed to reyna who gentled him along flattered him with soft exclamations and most of all listened with an intensity that shut the two of them into a small world of their own we were working from target to target he said along the border between the western flanks of the jinocaburs and the land the last hit it was on the tenth day we were over there it was a mountain village a cluster of stone houses built around a sheep barn the barn was empty when we got there it was just on sunup though that was hard to tell with all the mist hanging about wed been riding since moonset running on rumor and the claims of our guide the men and older boys were gone the women said they were out with the sheep but they wouldnt say where they were lying of course it was a bandit pesthole what wed come to get we put the headmans wife in one of the houses and threw everything we could find that would burn in with her then we lit it she was an old hag of a woman had hands like nuts on strings they still wouldnt tell us where the men had gone how we could find them stubborn and stupid we killed the weak ones and the old and the babies they were useless worthless except as a message to the men strangled the guide gutless fool couldnt even bring off a betrayal the healthiest women we fetched back with us turned them over to the cheoshim commander here in bairroa pili just got in last night he was detached serene as he described it allas if it had happened to someone else reyna murmured and urged him on this was his profession and he was good at it though there were times when he let the braids fall between them to hide his face as anger turned sour in his mouth the head drummer cupped his hands and beat a steady monotonous toom toom toom toom reyna looked up the room was clearing rapidly the sriklcars slaves were hauling the last of the drunk and drugged up the stairs to the bedrooms dawa was nowhere in sight likely hed picked up an allnighter with someone even now he usually managed that jea was sitting at a table a melancholy curve over the remnants of a drink paying no attention to what was happening around him theyre closing i have to go i want to see you you havent told me your name better not im not what you think young friend im salagaum not habatrize whats that mean ah reyna got his feet i see let me tell you this find yourself a young habatrize a pretty girl more your age ask her what a salagaum is and shell tell you it will come better from her easier no let me go i have enjoyed listening to you he bent touched the mals shoulder briefly then straightened quiet shared is a blessing these days stay there please without looking around reyna crossed the room to jea they went out together moving in weary tandem in the changing closet by the front door jea unbuckled his belt curled it up and dropped it in the cloth shoulderbag what was all that with the leatherman thlkytalk and no action hmm innocent murderer reyna said he unlaced his sandals worked his toes what a night abeys sting ive got enough kpa in my gullet to well never mind he doesnt know what a salagaum is would you believe funny you wouldnt think it would be my feet giving me miseries jea pulled on his trousers twitched the laces tight king it on i dont think so reyna shrugged out of his robe rubbed his hands across his breasts chumvays nuhm one of them had more teeth than a waterhog he pulled a shirt over his head without bothering to undo the buttons no breastband tho sore howd the leatherman manage to stay that ignorant in training for a hero i think vigils and fasts you know reyna wiggled his toes again sighed and pulled on his boots i think he started a pash on me wish we could afford a chair the way home gets longer every time hmp jea took down his hooded cloak swung it around his shoulders well pash or no i have a feeling the less you see of that one the better off well all be the wounded moon was gibbous and low in the western sky and the nighttorches had burned down to faint red glows when they left jigambis rendezvous staying in the heavier darkness by the buildings on the west of the sokajarua so they wouldnt have to cross the street when they reached the edge eyes constantly moving cloaks pulled tight about their bodies reyna and jea strode rapidly along without speaking until they were off the pavement into the edge picking their way over the dirt ruts of verakay lane reyna pushed the hood back scratched vigorously under the pomaded braids behind his left ear aaaah he kicked at a dirt clod lurched as his foot dropped into a rut sicuzi says the chain i ordered s ready but hell have to wait for his coin till next party he stepped out onto the high crown of the lane his moonshadow jerking across the hardpan over his shoulder he said hows your girlfriend jea drifted across walked several minutes beside him before he answered frightened he murmured shes pregnant told me when i went to read the cards for her yesterday no day before counting from now reyna slapped his forehead hooah my friend youve got more nerve than me youre dead if her husband finds out cheoshim potzhead well its not something we can help you know reyna closed his hand over jeas shoulder squeezed then let go the baby its yours she wont say wont say anything just cries you better hope it isnt you know what the cheoshim think of bleach in their bloodlines what are you going to do if its yours and shows it i dont know she wont leave him ive tried ive said we can go somewhere else well wed have to wouldnt we shes afraid raised that way what can you expect i know they passed the scribbled walls of the school rounded a bend and saw a slight shadow gliding in and out of moonlight it reached the beehouse and went inside no yanking on the bellpull no waiting for panote neither of them said anything they both knew who it was locks and bars shifted for faan shifted so automatically she didnt even think about it reyna climbed to his room stripped and washed himself everything wiped from his head but faan and what he was going to do about her he shrugged into a worn fleecy robe pulled the belt tight and sat in a chair staring at his door and trying to think itd all gone wrong when she quit school and went to study with the sibyl if he asked faan about those sessions she got angry and accused him of spying on her if he didnt ask she accused him of being tired of her bored with her for a time she was obsessed with her mother she pestered him and taithe sibyl too for all he knewfor everything they knew about her where shed come from after a while though she dropped it there just werent any answers available abeys curse on the sibyl for teaching her how to open locks no keeping her inside after that abeyhamals curse was that it wouldnt let the baby alone gave her that talent a sorceror couldnt let her be a witch or something more natural a sorceror it was going to get her killed where did the baby go reyna pressed the heels of his hands into his eyes as if that would push the pain back the baby who loved me without question who followed me everywhere where did she go quarrels every time they talked anything he said he hadnt lost the memory of how hed been when he was that age but he was terrified for her he wanted to protect her from all the horrors hed had to face when his father threw him out he hadnt forgotten no but nothing he did was right and hed about run out of ideas at least she still came home and she still called him mamay when she didnt stop to think he sat for almost an hour without moving then he sighed got wearily to his feet and walked down the hall to the small room faan had taken for her own opened the door and went inside faan dragged herself out of bed before the sun was up she scrubbed her face with angry violence ignoring the stings as soap hit broken pimples and patches of rash from the face paint when she was finished she stared into the small cracked mirror grimaced at the pale pinched face with angry oozing red spots scattered across it then she shrugged and began dealing with her hair dragging a rake through the waxed spikes combing out the plaited tress and rebraiding it she fixed the beeclasp on the end shook her head smiling grimly as the braid flipped about the spikes shivered the paint was flaking off the colored patches but that didnt matter not this morning she rooted through the shirt drawer until she located a faded black pullover that reyna kept trying to throw away and she kept rescuing from the ragbag dug out an ancient black skirt that used to belong to areia oneeye she dressed and left the room carrying her sandals her feet silent on the grass drugget that ran down the hall she stopped in the kitchen a moment for rivermans treat then left by the back door he had a ferocious sweet tooth and made a sound like bubbles popping when she gave him honeycomb and pastrylace and taffys from the beehouse hed listen to her without scolding her the wild magic would go fizzing around her playing their obscure games and making her laugh she loved it when water elementals came by thrust ing their heads into the streaked and dappled air beneath the gatt so they could look at her they couldnt or wouldnt talk to her but that didnt matter she enjoyed watching them change shape pulsing like the water lapping against the piles and sometimes they brought her small gifts shells and bits of coral pearls and oddities off drowned ships and there was a bitty beast like a mix of mouse and boy who came and went as he chose and never spoke to her riverman told her one day that the mouseboy was a god sessa finder of lost rifles that made her laugh then cryfor wasnt she a lost trifle herself and neither riverman or sessa could or would tell her anything about who she was so it didnt matter they were gods or whatever magic they did listen to her though at least there was that she brought out the wedge of honeycomb shed taken from the kitchen unwrapped it and tossed to riverman while he ate she leaned back against the stones and watched the little people gather i dont understand whats happening to me she said finally theres theres she groped at air in crippled aborted gestures as if even her body was stumbling in its efforts to express what was in her theres too too much its like im going to explode barn barn splat bits of me all over the place and oh i dont know the riverman drew his tiny gnarled hand across his mouth then sat cradling the oozing comb be specific he said elucidate he brought the comb up to his mouth again and licked honey from one of the cells but never took his black beady eyes off her faan scowled past him at the head of a water elemental thrust up like a faceted lump of mountain stream in the midst of the muddy river when it merged with the river and vanished she said last night tai and areia oneeye were off to a clandestine rite in one of the biashar towers as soon as they finished supper theyre gonna be sent to the mines if they get caught they dont care i get so worried makes it so easy to blow up ive got a horrible temper sometimes i want to kill i cant let myself think like that or things happen you remember first time i came here i nearly burned down the school and me ah diyo diyo riverman i know stick to the subject reyna and jea and dawa they did the evensong then they left i cant help it i hate what he does how he can hes not like that hes mamay oh i know hes not my mother hes a man sort of um one time when i was crying because utsapishas granddaughters teased me when they heard me calling him mamay he told me i cant be your mamay in body but i am in my heart never forget that thats what hes like not but he goes and does what he does when im around him when he says anything i feel like im going to explode im afraid for him im ashamed he loves me but he tries to make me into i dont know a perfect child im not like that i want i want i dont know its like theres a hole in me that says want want want and it nor nothing else will tell me what it is i do want she laid her hands on her knees palms up grimaced at the damp green stains from the moss slowly painfully she told riverman about the quarrel last night thats it she said thats it i got some sleep hour or so i suppose came here soons it was light im afraid riverman i dont understand whats happening riverman listened with all his tiny bodysaid ah at the proper places uh huh go on he had no advice for herwhat did he know of family and its terrors he was sui generis unique but he let her talk and he listened interested in this strange thing not like the sibyl who seemed to know it all already a short while later she slipped from under the gatt and made her way to the beehouse through the morning throngs of verakay lane nothing resolved but the storm in her blood blown away for a while chapter prophet from pain late and nervous two months after his encounter with the mal warrior reyna slipped in the back door of the jigambi joyhouse scrambled into his salagaum robes in the grimy closet srikkar jigambi misnamed a changing room and loped up the service stairs to the third floor where the private rooms were he pushed past the thick red curtains into the hallway where the floor had a tenyear carpet and the walls were carved into the hammer and anvil of chumavayal and the polished famwood gleamed pale yellow in the light from the bronze lamps whose scented oils perfumed the whole passage itd been a while since hed reached these levels and never with an anonymous client the secrecy clamped over the rendezvous bothered him more often than not it meant the client had serious problems which might bring death or maiming for the salagaum involved he moved a few steps from the curtain stopped before one of the gilded mirrors and drew a comb through his long hair smoothing away the windblown straggles he wore his hair loose because he was too antsy to sit long enough for areia to plait it for him he touched a frayed spot on the sleeve of his outer robe sighed his clothes were getting shabby it was time he bought something new but the prices weavers asked for cloth these days he slipped a handkerchief from his sleeve cleaned exudate from the corner of an eye wiped dead skin from his lip he reapplied liprouge touched up his eyepaint made a face at himself for luck and turned away room six to the left three doors down he went quickly along the passage and tapped at the door there was no answer potzhead reyna thought do i really want to do this but the fee was too good he needed the money rventy cemmas broad silver coins in a leather pouch waiting for him in the doormans cageif the client released them to him more than hed earned the last six months he straightened his shoulders and tapped again come the sound was muffled the word clipped short reyna tried a smile sighed and shook himself into his working mode he squeezed the latch and pushed the heavy door open only one lamp was lit the rest of the room was in shadow shifting flickering shadow the window was open the warm night breeze bringing in smells from outside the sour waste of the sok and the dry dessication of the city the client was standing beside the window his back to the room reyna let the latch click shut i am reyna senho you asked for me his voice was soft with his working purr the caressing gentleness which most of his clients preferred the man at the window didnt move this reassured him the client was nervous needed soothing he knew how to do that your wish is my delight let me serve you he moved farther into the room stopped when he saw the mans shoulders stiffen he waited sit down there by the lamp reyna moved to the divan sat near the edge of the lamps glow where the play of light and shadow was most activeand most flattering he clasped his hands in his lap rested his eyes on the thick soft gold of his bracelets deliberately notlooking at his hands at the stringy tendons that grew more visible as the flesh melted off him he desperately wanted a hit of bhaggan tomorrow he told himself ive got to get through this go home first change clothes why doesnt he do something verna vema rey hard labor but you can do it come sit beside me we have the night theres no need to hurry things what do you wish me to call you never mind that ah reyna finally recognized the voicethe absurdly naive leatherman from that onefee allnighter when was it he couldnt place it exactly but then hell dropped into a bhaggjag haze for days afterward didnt matter he knew the man now and lost some of his fear this wasnt a pain thing he wouldnt have to play his tricks so the client thought he was getting more than he was i can handle it he told himself i can handle him it doesnt have to be your truename my dear he added the last words deliberately using them to prod a reaction from the leatherman the young mals body twitched violently and he moved a step to one side his hands closed on the sill and he stared out over the rooftop of the nextdoor shop touched by the moonglow coming through the window his skin glistened with sweat and a muscle twitched near his mouth reyna touched his tongue to his lips do you wish me to leave senho your desire is my delight he waited tensely no the answer came quickly this time it was only a whisper but it was filled with pain more gently than before he murmured come then sit down the chair by the window it wont compromise you the shadows are deep there and i cant see you sit down put your feet on the hassock lean back if you want we can talk or we can share a silence he hesitated wondering if he should hint he recognized the client no it would be more tactful and certainly safer to forget about that first meeting he kept talking using his voice to weave a net about the client to draw him down where the change of posture would do its business on him i saw something amusing today a boy down by the river skinny little imp with arms and legs no thicker than twigs wascram i think he had hair like cornsilk reyna smiled as the leatherman moved away from the window and sat stiffly in the chair his booted feet flat on the floor the boy was playing a game reyna went on jumping from rail to rail scooting across the decks dodging sailors as they grabbed at him he ran half a dozen ships before his foot finally slipped and he tumbled into the river the leatherman leaned back laid his hands on the chair arms a moment later his feet were crossed at the ankle his bootheels digging into the cushion on the rest the shipmasters were screaming curses at their men trying to sort them out the sailors were poking at the boy with their boathooks trying to snag him and haul him in he was agile as a fish in the water and got away from them all until one of the boats coming in from the koo dropped a net on him and brought him to land dangling from the netpole even then he fooled them he wriggled loose and lost them in the wynds the leatherman tapped his thumbs on the padding of the chair arms his head was back he seemed to be staring at the ceiling do you like boys what do you go with boys no do you want me to i dont want anything from you ah i see salagaum i dont believe in salagaum water is wet do you believe that does it change anything if you dont unnatural abomination we are as we were born the luck of the dip not something we asked for like any sport you should be strangled at birth every boy born until the breasts start growing a boys a boy like every other if you really are a man why do you pretend are those breasts real or padding shall i show you no why am i here i dont believe you i think youre a woman pretending to be a man i dont know why its not natural not right i couldnt the leatherman came onto his feet with swift surge of strength that was like an explosion inside his skin two steps and he was at the window again staring into the night reyna closed his eyes what do i do to earn my fee nothing go away you asked me to come i came without question or cavil the leatherman crossed the room without looking at reyna he tugged at the bell cord beside the door almost ran back to the window over his shoulder he said go that releases the pledge he was silent a moment when he spoke again there was a terrible compressed passion in his voice as if his control over it and himself was nearly gone go and respect this evil thing you dont have to do this woman marry have children you can be forgiven reyna got to his feet moving slowly and chewing on his lip he stopped beside the door opened it a crack so he could run if he had to the leatherman didnt realize it but hed keep coming back calling reyna to him obsession it was there in the mans voice in the lines of his body the cracking of his voice everything if he wasnt stopped now hed be back and back never believing reyna unable to escape his own needs unable to accept those needs back and back until he killed both of them it had happened before though the leatherman was close to breaking now forcing him to face the truth about salagaum seemed to reyna less dangerous than letting this thing go on hating what he had to do raging at the rigidity and blindness of the man across the room he slipped out of his outer robe dropped it on the small table by the door stripped down until he was wearing the chains about his neck his bracelets and his sandals and nothing else look at me senho look at me nayo i am salagaum senho and i am not ashamed of it look at me the leatherman was shaking every muscle twitching his neck straining as his head started to turn and he wrenched it back look at me leatherman are you afraid the leatherman whirled mouth stretched in a silent shout he stared at reyna his eyes shifting repeatedly up and down the lean length of the salagaums body reyna smoothed his hands over his breasts lifted them let them fall back soft heavy breasts the nipples dark and large still firm and well shaped though he was past forty now he slid his hands slowly down his body he was beginning to get excited the leatherman had a physical beauty that reached him and a suffering inside that spoke to him leatherman stared a moment longer then broke he swung around his shoulders bent his hands clutching at the sill go get out of here you you abomination thing get out of here snatching up his clothing reyna went faharmoy heard the door click shut then bent over the sill fighting the sobs that tore through him he was weak worse than a woman crying nayo nayo nayo chumavayal nayo he gasped and shuddered as he struggled to expel this weakness from himself control that was the thing it was loss of control that he raged against it was loss of control that was the thing not the soft weakness he felt for that that creature nayo it was the loss of control control hed burned it into his bones the past nine years or so hed thought there wasnt a man his age among the cheoshim who could outfight him or outthink him on the battlefield on this other field he was mired lost the shuddering and the tearing of the sobs he would not let escape him finally stopped leaving him exhausted he fell into the chair where hed been sitting before stretched out in it with his feet up and his eyes closed gradually he pulled himself back from the situation viewed it as a disembodied intelligence with no emotions to confuse his logic he was not at fault what he had felt was natural and goodor would have been if he had not been fooled and betrayed the traitor was not that creature he she diyo she was the tool of abeyhamal who was always the enemy of chumavayal the bitter bitter enemy softness against strength rottenness against purity abeyhamal diyo she and her accursed followers brought the drought on the land by their sins and their rebellion against truth abeyhamal set the shape of woman on men and by doing so betrayed all men mocked all that belonged to man when the sun pressed over the horizon and its red light streamed into the window along with the growing noise of the city coming awake he went downstairs and out the back door ignoring the female slaves scrubbing the stairs and chattering in corners whenever they got out of the overseers gaze slaves who went silent and stared at him until he was past whose whispers followed him out of the house when he stepped from the walkway between the houses boy shills for the chairmen swirled around him not touching him but giving him no peace as they shouted out the fees and excellences of their chairs irritated tired impatient he strode through them he wanted to kick them away from him slap them into silence to do what he wanted would show weakness loss of control so he ignored them and sighed with relief as he plunged into the sok and left them behind the sun wasnt fully up yet and there were very few buyers in the sok many of the merchants were still sweeping off their plots and hadnt yet set out their goods those with shops were taking down their shutters and replacing their displays a few of them stopped to stare at him a walking mal was a rare sight he found the kariam he wanted moved briskly through the lingering coolness of the morning shadows enjoying the play of his muscles as he walked the perfume from the hidden flowers the sweet seductive whisper of the unseen fountains the biasharim could still afford to be lavish with water from the aqueducts he crossed the inner ring road and heard instead of water falling the pounding feet of cadres of young cheoshim as they marched and jumped to the shouted calls of their drillmasters he smiled his soul expanding with the familiarity of those sounds he reached the outer ring road feeling a growing harmony between himself and the world but he needed more than harmony he needed to understand the reasons for all this he hurried along the ring road to the jiko sagrado where he joined the early trickle of worshipers and suppliants heading for the camuctarr the forge sanctuary was an immense chamber bronze lamps on bronze chains filling the space with light and shadow drifts of incense eddying around the kneeling stools anaxoa novices led by the anaxo prime were cleaning the ashes from the forge fire and renewing the coals and aromatic woods that fueled it the prime intoned the renewal prayers swung the censer as he circled slowly about the firewell the novices chanted their responses as they worked one by one they brought the bronze pails of ash and clinker to be censed and blessed by the prime then filed out singing as they walked their voices strong and deep and filled with power faharmoy knelt at the back half hidden by an iron column his eyes shut his head bowed he bathed in the sounds and smells of adoration and felt his soul unclench his mind smooth out some time later adjoa novices followed an adjo priest up the aisle the kneeling stools were filling up with anxious people from the city here to pray for the breaking of the drought faharmoy saw the numbers and remembered other morning services hed gone to in gom corasso services where there was only a small scatter of worshipers if the drought brought death it also brought the laggard back to worship perhaps that was what it was for to remind people of their duties duties they forgot when times were good he closed his eyes again listened to the service the ringing of hammers against small personal anvils a rhythmic tingtang that was the song of chtunavayal peace flowed into him and he felt strong enough to return to the aching uncertainties of the night he faced himself as honestly as he could tried to comprehend what had happened to him he could not accept that she was a man he had seen but he refused to believe that an abomination could attract him so powerfully why did she pull him to her even when he knew the evil that was in her that first night she seemed to understand everything even what he had no words to say her gentleness and her warmth that was it that warmth it had to be more than pretense diyo she was a whore diyo it was her business to make him feel good he understood that and yet there was something more he felt it she was part mother part lover part he didnt know and yet how could he forget her naked that tall lean figure that man that very male man showing how how excited he was the breasts the soft female breasts that he ached to touch even now the thought of touching them brought a sweet agony to his loins he wondered what love with that creature would be like and tore his mind away from the images that exploded in his head it was abomination there was no one he could talk to about this no one who would understand who wouldnt recoil from him in horror adjoa kassos and novices sang the noon praises beating their small anvils in time with the basso chant then filed out faharmoy knelt in shadows meditating hearing distantly what was happening around him immersing himself in the cycle of worship accepting everything without question bathed in the perfumes and colors and music of worship in the afternoon a biasharim funeral was held the anacho prime himself there to lay the two souls earth and spirit the manasso prime led his novices in for the cleansing of their souls when the work day ended the quiamboa priests brought their novices and students in sang their praises in massed voices to the clang of adjoa anvils finally he understood what he was born for his purposedestroying these unnatural creatures and all the other mocking manifestations of that bitch devil abeyhamal mating the land pure again gifting it fully to chumavayal so that the rains would come again the land would heal the earth would grow lush with his blessings that was it diyo that was it but not yet the day had shown him that he must purify himself before he was fit to purify the land he walked from the camuctarr into the hot dry sunset and went briskly down the jiko sagrada he had to collect his cadre and arrange for their transport up river he had to meet with the cheoshim commander and resign from the border guard and after that was done he had to confront the high kasso and renounce all wealth and position it wouldnt be easy but it had to be done he was tired and hungry but he floated as he walked full of light and joy all confusion gone goddance the eleventh year abeyhamal whirls the fimbo over her head lightning jags from the point crashes into the forge iron making it shudder and ring the coals of the forge fire shudder with the iron and grey ash creeps across the dying red faan danced on the jang studied with the sibyl was trapped into surrendering her will to the honey mother and ran a barrier about the low city reyna worked and played with equal desperation labored with juvalgrimthe high kasso to feed the growing numbers of the hungry and displaced chumavayal roars his fiery breath rushes across the coals waking them to fiercer life envelops abeyhamal whose gossamer wings vibrate more furiously dissipating the heat and whose face compresses to a scowl at the stench he brings his sword up in a steel curve across his chest stamps his feet to one side then the other slashes at her pulling yellow and crimson flametongues into high leaps from the smoldering coals the drought intensified the river sank lower and lower life grew hard for everyone fervor increased in the cities and the farm families began leaving the dry and barren land abeyhamal catches the sword on her fimbo deflects it brings the fimbo around in a quick curl and slashes at chumavayals hands drawing a trickle of blood as the point touches him juvalgrim strangled giza kutakich throwing the manassoa order into confusion making life margin ally easier for the humbler castes refugees from the land began resettling the low city chumavayal howls whir rage intensifies his dance the sword blade weaves in complex curves glittering red and white sending beams of light flickering about abeyhamal never quite touching her the prophet came from the desert and preached in the streets of bairroa pili the verakay beehouse burned abeyhamal leaps into the air turning and turning the fimbo held horizontal above her head she lands with her back to chumavayal cries out in triumph and hate leaps again before he can touch her jumping the forge iron to land beside him then somersaulting back heels over head she slaps her feet down drives the fimbos point at the center of his back chumavayal wheels strikes the fimbo away from him feints at abeyhamal then the two of them go round and round and round neither touching the other neither truly shaking the other not yet the goddance goes on sibyl the wheel is turning the change sets in high and low are caught therein the prophet appears the scourge without pity the high kasso turns apostate and weaves him a plait from anarchy death and true charity the honeychilds caught in the goddesss plot the thoglodite i watch ephemerals die the sibyl wrinkles her nose as things get worse so does my verse she says she crosses bare feet at the ankles wiggles her toes eleven years gone she says the lands drying up and blowing away the lakethatneverfails has fallen from the walls of gom corasso leaving behind a stretch of dead fish and dried mud the sewer outfalls are visible for the first time in any mans memory and the city stinks the river shrinks the fishermen net nothing there they go all the way down to the koo bikiyar for their catches these days they prosper despite this people still have to eat and fish is about all thats left that the poor can afford to buy reyna will organize a cadre of wascrams women and salagaum who carry supplies throughout the edge visiting homes leaving fruit and grain behind juvalgrim will use the gold he wrings from his demon dips to bring in barrels of salt meat sacks of tubers and grain he has ordered the holy fountain conduits open the water free to anyone who came to the cisterns for it he will work through the abosoa order because they live among the people and know the need the manassoate will be furious at what they consider a slight with giza kutakich spurring them on the manassoa kassos will spy on juvalgrim complain to the shinda prefect protest the waste to gom corasso do everything they can to sabotage his efforts aiai she says this never changes ephemeras are a constant mix of sweet and sour what does it matter what does it matter the end comes and the players switch the games the same the sibyl gazes a long time at the bright irregular round of the cave mouth she hears a rock go clattering down the slope the scramble of feet it matters this much she says ive grown fond of two of these emphemerals juvalgrim diyo and faan this angry imp whos coming up the path to badger me again and entertain me with her nonsense you taught me to control wind why cant you teach me rain i cant honey klann im tired of that stupid sickly name im faan faan she fumed a minute then calmed shaking her head so the bright red and green patches of waxed and painted hair swayed like grass in a strong wind why cant you listen to me fa chumavayal controls the rain the sibyl lifted a hand let it drop back you dont interfere with godbusiness little sorcerie even thk wakkerrcarr and settsimaksimin wouldnt take that on and theyre primes the best there is the name settsimaksimin twitched in faans mind she blinked but the faint fragrance that might have been a memory was gone gods she chewed on her lip sighed vema so what do we do search but through the demon worlds not this verna what do i do the sibyl lifted her hands held them curved a foot apart she spoke a word and a mirror spread between her palms look and tell me what you see chapter juvalgrim the demon worlds and various kinds of hunger reyna groaned awake as juvalgrim shook him again wha come come wake up luv juvalgrims hair brushed over reynas torso tickled his face as the high kasso of bairroa pill bent and kissed him a light brush of lip on lip tickled him again as juvalgrim straightened what time is it juvalgrim finished lighting the lamp set the candle aside before he answered midwatch the moons down his mouth twitched into a brief smile no luv its not time to go yet i need you thats all reyna sat up swung his legs over the side of the bed he rubbed at his eyes stretched dropped his hands on his thighs i take it youre not talking about sex this time hardly juvalgrim chuckled and no pun intended come on rey get dressed he walked into the wardrobe that ran along one side of the room his voice muffled he added youre the only one i can trust to help me reyna eased his legs into his trousers stood and pulled them up jerked the laces tight and tied them off he rubbed at his face again took his shirt off the chair back shook it out and pulled it over his head so what is this about open the chest there juvalgrim nodded at the long carved box at the foot of the bed took a black cloak from the wardrobe threw it over a chair there were three ancient crumbling leatherbound books in the chest and a newer one resting beside them books juvalgrim dropped his hand on reynas shoulder squeezed lightly relics of a time not supposed to exist hmm he stooped lifted one of the ancients take a look inside will you reyna opened the book frowned at the marks on the page what is this juvalgrim slid the smaller newer book into a shoulderbag the language of abeyhamal i thought you might know it no its scratchings thats all how sibyl taught me busy isnt she we all do what we must he reached for a small darklantern lit it from the candle left the slide open im going to show you some things i learned from those books rey and they arent for chitchat not even to tai vema do you want me to swear it no he smiled that sudden glowing smile that never failed to make reynas heart turn over youre not afraid of demons are you with faan living in the house ah i wondered sibyls teaching her too diyo i know vema rey keep close to me and dont talk hmm youve been through this often enough you know the drill he stepped into the wardrobe again leaned out after a moment and beckoned reyna followed the flicker of the lantern juvalgrims shadow jagging before him down and down they went through the narrow passage a way he knew so well he didnt bother with light when he came and wentdown and down turning right turning left ducking through halfsize openings edging along sections barely wide enough to let him pass down and around until the passage suddenly opened out into the volcanic blowtube where he usually left his own lantern theyd passed from the camuctarr into the heartstone of fogomalin juvalgrim bent with the grace that after all these years burned through reyna each time he saw it tapped the bronze case of reynas darklantern the wick was turned so low it put out barely enough light to announce its presence better bring this luv i want you to know the way you probably wont have to walk it again but who knows keep close to me hmm dont want you getting lost he was in an odd mood flippant and defensive all flash and fragility reyna followed silently growing more nervous with every step he took hed seen juvalgrim like this before when there was something coming that he found distasteful or frightening for one reason or another like the last time they were together before the amrapake was down for the reswearing of fealty or when the high kasso in corasso came to inspect the records and listen to complaints they emerged from the winding blowtube into a stone bubble with one side broken open the break looking straight west toward the jinocabur mountains above those distant peaks the serpent coiled beside the lion the stars brilliant in the cloudless sky juvalgrim set the lantern on a ledge of black stone housework first he said he reached into a vertical crack drew out a pair of twig brooms weve got to get this floor cleaned off then set up some candles he handed a broom to reyna push everything out the front hmm they worked busily sweeping a film of dust off the polished black stone i thought you left this sort of thing to skivvies reyna said juvalgrim pulled his mouth down flared his nostrils complaints complaints he flourished the broom sent a pile of dust flying then cursed amiably as the wind caught the insubstantial particles and blew them back in his face ill have you know my skeptical friend every page learns how to clean before he learns to read the bubble floor was flat smooth and shiny black with silver wire inlaid in the stone to form several five pointed stars each in its own circle three small pentagrams in a row along the north wall a much larger penta in the center with odd convoluted designs scattered about the silver lines shimmering like trapped starlight reyna raised his brows you did this juvalgrim shook his head not i nor she who wrote those books i doubt even the sibyl knows she a kassian long time ago here he thrust his arm into another crack pulled out an undyed wax candle that biggest penta there put this on one of those points reyna helped juvalgrim set up and light the candles then stood with his hands clasped behind him waiting for an explanation juvalgrim brushed his hands together grimaced at the incipient blisters then dropped abruptly to the stone in the center of the penta thats done faster with four hands and easier he said sit down rey rest your feet we have to wait till the plow rises reyna sat ive been patient ju youd have to admit that he brushed hair out of his eyes what is all this what are you going to do and why juvalgrim turned his head away stared out of the stone bubble at the night sky the treasury is empty rey nearly so nearly the difference doesnt matter ive milked all i can out of the maulapam and the biasharim didnt bother with the cheoshim they dont think anything outside their caste is human not even the maulapam the droughts going to get worse luv a year or two and the dying will really start he moved his shoulders his long blueblack hair slipping and sliding dark as the cloak he no longer wore the starlight touched his cheekbones the straight stern line of his nose the clean curve of his mouth im no hero rey but im curious you know that and its something i can do something i seem to need to do im going fishing for gold rey gold and food for the little ones the ones you and tai and the verakay beehouse dose and take care of fishing among the demon worlds and youre going to help me theyll burn you kutakich will find out and juvalgrim grimaced no comes to that im gone pfft nothing left but meat i dont want to think about it hmm remember the quake we had a few years back you ought to rey it was that year you got faan wall fell down those books fell with them nearly cracked my head for me after the sibyl taught me i read them they told me what i could do and how to do it and why i should if you dont mind im not going to talk about that juva could you teach faan those books nayo luv he frowned moved his shoulders i dont dare do you understand give them to the sibyl let her rey sweet rey sibyl doesnt need the books if she thought faan should know shed tell her chumvey knows what harm id do if i got between them he scowled down at his hands his hair falling forward to cloak his face when he spoke his voice was calm but reyna knew better than to interrupt again i dont really need you for the demon bit rey i brought you here so youd understand help me stiffen my backbone love me a little hmm im no hero i said that well its true tell me that im doing right that im helping where it hurts mostly though what i want from you and your friends is distribution you know the edge you can get haulers wholl keep their mouth shut take the food and pass it out where its most needed the gold id better handle myself no ones likely to tunk me on the head for it reyna sucked in a breath and let it out in a long slow exhalation vema whatever i can do thanks luv i knew youd agree ah the bulls horns are showing its time hejumped to his feet up up rey stand in the middle of the star that one over there when the silver starts shining dont touch the lines with flesh or leather got it good reyna hugged his arms across his breasts and watched as a huge insubstantial sphere formed at one of the pentas points floated there while images drifted through it nauseating terrifying images juvalgrim labored on growling and shrieking sounds that reyna found obscene and embarrassing juvalgrims voice changed grew harsher louder bluegreen grain poured suddenly from the sphere spread in a dimpled pile outside the penta flowed around the penta without entering it his voice changed again fruit like apples rolled out on the grain another change and coins fell in a golden rain atop the apple and the grain another change reyna swallowed in sympathy feeling in his own throat the rasping tearing syllables the sphere went opaque bulged and warped shivered in midair distorted swirled suddenly vanished with an absurdly tiny pop juvalgrim opened his throat in a blast of ugly sound that hovered in the stone bubble for an instant then was gone he coughed swallowed trembling he lowered himself to the stone and knelt with his shoulders bent his head hanging after another moments silence he said hoarsely its done ju do you think you could find your way here from outside diyo diyo rey youll have to i cant have this connected to me its too dangerous do you understand diyo ah luv im too tired to thank you the way id like reyna smiled save it up for another night it wont go bad for waiting faan was a small dark shadow huddled on the top step reyna sucked in a breath when he saw her fear turning him cold anything could have happened to her out here the edge was dangerous after dark more so than ever these days he opened his mouth to scold her then swallowed the words she lmew everything he meant to say what was the point of quarrelling one more time he sat on the step beside her couldnt sleep in the uncertain starlight he saw the lines in her face soften her mouth curve in a smile that vanished between one breath and the next nayo she said things she moved a hand in a shapeless gesture let it drop it was only a few hours till dawn but the night was hot the air scarcely stirring a cat yowled behind them somewhere someone screamed the sound cut off quickly music mostly the heavy throb of drums drifted to them from the jang not going to get better reyna said he touched faans shoulder she moved closer leaning into him as she used to when she was a child droughts worse out on the farms thats what he said mm hes going to open the temple cisterns for the edgers so they dont have to pay mal prices theyll let him do that reyna chuckled hes not going to ask a lone dog came trotting down the lane his head turned as he passed them but he didnt stop and vanished round the bend a moment later they heard some men start yelling and fighting down by the gatts the guard horn sounded the noise stopped a few moments later faan stirred sibyls been teaching me minors she said she cupped her hands muttered under her breath look she said in the dark shimmer between her hands he could see a dozen guards marching four men along the gatt road then the scene vanished i cant hold it long she said not yet i suppose it takes practice like everything worth do mm i went up on the roof tonight tried to find my mother reyna stiffened fear and jealousy made him sick after all these years faan caught hold of his hand nayo rey not that its just i need to know who i am i need to know he let out the breath hed been holding hugged her dont mind me fa i get stupid sometimes its just you havent said anything about her for a long time i thought youd forgot nayo she sighed unless youve bone for a brain you can bang your head against a wall only so many times before you say forget it it isnt worth the aggravation what happened this time nothing there was a picture of a lock and the mirror went away i was afraid i couldnt do it again i didnt try till just now he got to his feet reached down and pulled her up its time we were both in bed faan put her hand on the door after a few muted clicks from the lock and the bar it swung silently open wild magic reynas lips twitched let me tell you girl theres been a lot of times i wished you couldnt do that she giggled i know but it is handy isnt it point of view daughter its all in your point of view chapter honeychild copes veils veils no slaves veils veils mod des ty no slaves veils veils pure i ty no slaves veils veils the cheoshim youths marching along verakay lane howled the words as if they were curses stamped their boot heels to the beat of their chant they called themselves strikers because they were striking sparks for the forge fire and what they burned was sin they came surging at faan the minute they saw her walking alone what they meant to do with her she wasnt sure but she wasnt about to wait and find out she leapt into a wynd between two tenements ran around another corner and another the howls followed her louder and louder then chased ailiki up the side of a mudbrick house when she reached the top of the wall she jumped swung over the shaky splitwood fence onto the flat roof ignoring the startled indignant woman tending a tiny patch of herbs she ran across the roof went over the fence on the far side and halffell halfclimbed to the dry dusty ground below she scooted around behind the house next door turned into another wynd and ran along behind a warehouse fronting on the river behind her the chant of the strikers died away as they nosed about trying to find her again then moved off in the wrong direction she reached the end of the warehouse and walked down the wynd stepped over the legs of a sleeping mulehead grimaced at the avid circle of denge beetles gorging at the pool of vomit beside him trying to suck it up before the sun drew all the moisture from it she pulled her hand across her sweaty brow wiped it on her skirt sighed running in this heat was an idiotic idea she stopped when she reached the gatt road stood in the wynd mouth and frowned at the trickle of traffic moving along it toward the sokajarua the sun throbbed in a heatwhitened sky the river was down another five spans and the gatts were nearly deserted she could count three ships where five years ago thered been thirty she wiped at her face again her mouth was dry her throat sore faan slipped under the wharf and settled herself on the dead grass scowled at the river out in the center the water had a fugitive blue glint in close though it was thick and brown more like a gel than a liquid and it smelled bad she wiped her sleeve across her face rubbed her hands on her skirt pulled her legs up rested her arms on her knees as she moved thin lines of hot gold shifted across her face and arms the planks overhead had dried out and pulled away from each other riverman came plodding up from the water shaking himself and stepping delicately across the cracks in the mud he crouched jumped and landed with a grunt on the bow of the boat caught the bit of honeycomb shed fetched for him and licked eagerly at it behind her the wild magic gathered the bubble people shifting melding breaking apart their voices like the hiss of water over rocks trouble riverman licked his fingers off and dug into shaggy fur which had gone brown like the water its reyna its a week since hes been home the way things are she rubbed at her nose with the back of her hand fought the tears that prickled at her eyes tais worried too she asked around much as she could and panotes done what he could i made my mirror but there was the lock that jeggin lock and the sibyl wouldnt try she said she couldnt is he in the river no beady black eyes fixed on her for sure no the shindate did did the shindate get him i dont know rivers my place you have to ask the wildings that but will they tell me vema fa if they can they so little maybe the gods dont think to lock them ahhh she dropped her head on her arms crouched there eyes closed until the shaking was gone there was a rush of pops and hissing behind her a rain of dirt grains against her as the wild magic oscillated restlessly she straightened looked around riverman had left the boat he was standing in the middle of the bubble people while they clustered and flowed apart shifting like soapfoam around him a moment more then he whistled a short phrase and stood with his hands on his furry loins as the wild magic vanished into the earth he came bounding down the fill and leapt back on the bow no naysaying to stop them fa theyll find him if hes anywhere about he could have been taken away you know sent to the mines she brushed her hands across her eyes the mines i hadnt thought could the wildings go that far perhaps it would take longer and most likely would not be useful what could you do girl gird on your armor and go rescue him i dont know something he broke a sliver from the boat shredded it into dust brushed his tiny hands off fixed his eyes on her you wouldnt be let leave the city there are things i can say and things i cannot you too thats what the sibyl keeps saying the constraints are the same he got to his feet watch out for the gods honeychild it was abeyhamal brought you here and chumavayal waits to pound you come back at sundown ill tell you what weve found he sprang down darted along the mud and vanished into the murky water she stared after him for several minutes then shook her head and crept from under the wharf trusting her noseeme to keep away the eyes of the few laborers hanging listlessly about waiting for work that wouldnt come she came back in the hot red light of a spectacular sundown dipped into black shadow and knelt beside the crumbling old boat riverman was already there half out of the water clutching a mudcaked piling to keep his place his mosquito voice was sad and weary nothing he said we have asked the stones and the iron but they have no answers for sure the shinda prefecture doesnt have him or the camuctarr come back tomorrow sundown he let go and vanished below the surface before she could speak the jang was a darker meaner place these days the shadow predators and longgone druggers haunted the dance ground killing one more day preying on each other for the coin it took to stay alive preying on the young folk who swarmed there after dark these younger folk were lean and hungry searching for something to cut the heat and the monotony drugs alcohol sex music pain or pleasure there was desperation and weariness in their play but they came and faan came to disable her imagination with noise and exhaustion so she wouldnt think about what could be happening to reyna so she wouldnt agonize over tai and areia oneeye defying the edicts from the amrapake and the camuctarr and going to sing honey rites for the women of the edge and elsewhere when the other beehouses couldnt oblige she came for the music and the dancing the earhammering voices and the thick heavy stench of people around her who didnt care if she lived or died dossan and mateesee came with her dossan was tired from a long day in the woodmans factory but she would have come even if faan hadnt called her out she too needed some lift to her spirit whether it was terror or raw mulimuli or a tumble in the grass with a half drunk apprentice mateesee had her own reasons for wanting to forget her tomorrows they linked arms as they had so many times before and put a hop in their steps as they jigged down the lane giggling as they passed fedunzis end the silversmith had hanged himsflf a year ago shortly after a grim group of hooded men threw cruses of oil into his shop followed it with torches and burned it to the ground wascra wascra wascra girls they sang a darker note in their voices this night waste the wonkers paste the ponkers wascra wascra wascra we they quieted as they got closer and heard the clashing music from the bands whod staked claim to spots on the ground it was dangerous here they had to be ready to skip and dodge so they dropped arms and stopped their prancing but they kept on going dancing a step or two as a snatch of music blew toward them carried on the hot hot wind singing nonsense syllables as they dropped into the beat of the jang faan shied away from a shadowman crawling about on hands and knees which way dossy your turn to pick dossan crossed her arms hugged them tight to her chest widdershins im feeling contrary tonight lets work a curse on the laffy mais mateesee giggled then yelped and jerked her foot loose the crawler had grabbed at her ankle got a weak hold on it fingers slipping on the worn leather of her boots pichad she yelled jegg yourself she skipped back another step as the crawler wavered toward her again brought her heel down on his hand eat it she circled around him and pranced after the other two ailiki trotted along beside faan chittering almostwords at her the mahsar loathed this place always made a fuss faan ignored her as they passed one of the bands she caught hold of mateesee and began dancing in fastfooted loops with her then shifted to dossan then she danced alone utterly sunk into the music sensual abandoned the twisting and turning of her body reaching deep into the ancient soul of the land at the heart of every fadogur adopted or born young men grabbed at her but she burned too hot for them sucking their fingers as blisters erupted on them shaking hands that tingled uncomfortably they cursed then shouted to the rhythm of the band and danced in a mesmerized ring about her until the music stopped dossan and mateesee yanked faan from her trance and ran off before the other dancers could close around them they passed a man with a burning splinter from the fire he was a slave a northerner his fair skin covered with small sun cancers he pressed the splinter against his arm watched the fine curly hairs wither and turn to ash the skin beneath start to bubble he lifted the splinter blew the coal on the end to a cherry red and put it on his arm again they hurried away from him and nearly ran into two men grunting and hammering at each other with their fists it wasnt a fancy fight or a flashy one and no one was bothering to watch they just hit and hit and hit as if they were clockwork figures a circle of men stood around a habatrize as they passed a man got up wiped himself off with the towel a shadowy figure handed him another mantossed a moju in a can and fell on the woman mateesee wanted to watch but faan and dossan pushed her on toward the stage hot hot hot hot hot hot the singer screamed the words behind him the tin drums sang in angry polyphony the fiddle squealed in a floating line above the rest burn hot day hot day hot and hotter haaa ah aaa aaah ahhht hot hot hot hot hot hot burn dry day fry day dry and dryer dry aye aye aye eeeeee fry aye aye aye ayeeee over and over the same rhythm the same notes over and over burn burn the beat exploded inside faan throbbed in her the panting insistent urgency of that music she moved to it dancing as she had before seized by the music making it tangible with her body blind and unthinking she danced in a growing circle of watchers danced in an ecstasy greater than shed known before and felt a force stirring in her a power that grew and grew until it frightened her and she stopped moving a different power like something trying to crawl inside her skin someone she stood panting sweating the hairs on her arms erect and prickling the music was still going on and mateesee was bobbing and sweating her face shining in the dark red light from the dying fire dossan was quiet her arms crossed again as if she hugged herself to keep out the terrors floating around her the shadows beyond seemed to shake themselves and wake from a dream suddenly sick of the place oppressed by the people crowding around her faan yelled dossy les bouzh dossan twitched nodded at her they grabbed mateesee and started across the jang to verakay lane shadows collected around them thickened in front of them faan swerved to go around and the clot flowed round to block her again men shifting gleams of eyewhites and teeth and skin sheened with sweat the fire was down to coals and the cheating clouds were blowing across the wounded moon bringing darkness but no rain faan zagged the other way but they were there before her turning her turning them all toward the shabby rustling trees between the jang and the river dossan and mateesee kept close behind her she could hear their fright in the rasp of their breathing ailiki ran back and forth in front of the shadows hissing at them the hair standing up along her spine her tail erect faan stoppedso suddenly that mateesee bumped into her and dossan went a stumbling step past her though she shrank back immediately and pressed herself against mateesee faan brought her arms up stay behind me how ever i turn stay behind me then she called fire the fire that ran beneath her skin all the time now that whispered seductively to her promising her anything she wanted if she set it free wispy blue gold and pale red flames danced along her arms she thrust both arms before her then bent her right arm and slid her hand under a flame dancing on the back of her left hand she lifted it free then she flung it at the nearest of the shadow men her control cracked a hair when she heard a high delighted giggling as the flamelet arced away from her the other flames flickered erratically and their tiny hisses were demands to be loosed like the other the flamelet hit the man flared into a skin around him consumed him and went out with a satisfiedpop bile rose in her throat she swallowed caught up another flame but the shadows were retreating melting into the night with the pound of running feet whoosh that was close mateesee shook her shoulders her arms danced a few tentative steps to convince herself she wasnt still scared didnt know you could do that fa quiet faan sweated her voice rose to a shriek get away from me dossan grabbed mateesee by the upper arm held her still but neither girl backed off any farther they waited tensely while faan fought to dismiss the fire shed called for several breaths she thought she wasnt going to manage it she was so drained she could barely stand but she knew if she didnt get rid of the flamelets theyd eat her like the shadowman ailiki came to her and pressed against her ankles a thread of strength like a small cool stream flowed through her she gathered herself and focused the dismissal words came tearing from her throatand fire was gone she dropped her arms and walked blindly toward the lane dossan and mateesee following si lent behind her she could feel them starting to be afraid of her they hadnt been before especially mateesee who looked on faans magic as a peculiar sort of toy that was hers to play with whenever she wanted now a man was dead that he was dead didnt bother them all that much these days nearly everytime they looked out a window someone was being killed or hurt or something it was how she killed him how easy it looked as if she were a pretty snake theyd played with until they found out it was a viper snake girldossy called her that the first day they met she sobbed ground her hands into her eyes dont fa you couldnt help it dossan hugged her he was going to hurt us mateesee grabbed a strand of her hair and yanked silly ow teesee she leaned against dossan sniffed wiped her nose with the back of her hand you are a pest mateesee took her hand swung it back and forth wascra girls she chanted dossan giggled wascra wascra wascra we she sang she danced out ahead of them swung around and jigged backward clapping her hands wascra wascra watch us hey touch us nay all you ponkers walk faan looked from one to the other laughed shakily i thought stoopid mateesee reached for her hair again but this time faan skipped out of reach stuck her tongue out at her friend the three of them linked arms and went jigging along the street chanting dossans new verse to their theme wascra wascra watch us hey touch us nay all you ponkers walk away jo clayton faan lay in bed staring into the shifting darkness above her she hadnt lost her friends after all but she needed comforting she wanted to sit in reynas lap as she had when she was little and have him hold her and soothe her as she cried and cried she couldnt cry now dried out like the land shed killed a man she needed to tell reyna about it to get his call it absolution she needed him to tell her it was all right she wasnt evil she needed him but he was somewhere else maybe as dead as that bhaghead she ashed she pressed her hand over her mouth she wasnt going to be sick she refused to be sick it was a long time before she slept riverman was waiting for her perched on the bow of the old boat combing his fingers through his ruffed brown fur he grinned at her then the grin was gone and he was shaking his head found him hes alive just over in the low city house under the end of the iron bridge faan closed her hands so tightly her nails cut into her palms what happened whos got him dead man what giza kutakich manasso prime deader than a threeday fish wildings tell me he snatched reyna because reyna knew what juvalgrimwas doing and where he did it reyna didnt want to say wildings tell me the walls weep when they speak of it tell me the whole thing tell me diyo juvalgrim is using sorcery to find gold and food for the edgers he calls demons in this cave in mount fogomalin not the sibyls another one giza kutakich was fool enough to let the high kasso discover him spying juvalgrim strangled him threw his wild magic body to a firedemon handy for canceling your mistakes having demons round the place far as he was concerned that was the end of it he doesnt know about reyna you said reynas alive just he is the little black eyes blinked at her the round face looked drawn broken what can i do i told you beware the gods faan shes touched you but you fought her she wants you freewilled and fighting for her you can make a bargain with her surrender and let her indwell and shell heal reyna make him whole and clean her teeth clamped on her lower lip faan gazed at him you hers not me not against her either little uns like me and the wildings we get mixed up in god business we get stomped he scratched at his weedfur appreciate this honeychild i speak what she tells me shes dancing her war with chumavayal and by the dance shes built a cage thats caught you and catching you shes caught us he wrinkled his short broad nose blinked his bright black eyes im of the river honeychild its my blood my life its poisoned now and diminished im poisoned and diminished when the rains come again thatll be made right but itll only happen when the godwars finished abeyhamal needs you so i need you the wildings want to break from from the land and the bonds that hold them here they need you do you understand what im saying faan closed her eyes drew in a deep breath let it out this much you are using me as much as she as you use us honeychild i have a hope and a belief that it is different between us the take and take of friendship as well as need faan swallowed rubbed at her eyes hope not much of that around these days vema vema friend when he grinned so broadly that his beady black eyes shut to slits she relaxed tell me what i should do find someone to help you cross by the wood bridge not the iron dont touch the iron carry reyna back to the beehouse lay him before the altar and make your bargain with her how tell the kassian tai what you need she will do it gods diyo dont say more he jumped from the boat to her shoulder stroked her cheek leapt into the water and was gone faan pushed the door back hesitated in the opening pan the big man looked up from the boot he was cleaning and working back to suppleness what is it honey i know where reyna is where he set the boot down rested his large knotty hands on his knees you want help is it trouble diyo all of that well need a litter do you have a friend you can trust to help with this have you told no one no please after we bring him back thens the time why he got to his feet as he spoke turned his back to her and pulled on a pair of trousers he slid out of the houserobe and reached for an old tunic dark brown washed so many times it was softer than down faan stared at his back for the few moments it was bare shivered suddenly you always ask why and havent i taught you the same my honey he turned round sliding loops over the neck buttons so because i have to do something then what she shook her head you cant help pan not this time ive got to see reyna first see if she shivered he touched her cheek youll do whats right i know that mil me where a house in the low city its under the end of the iron bridge low city he frowned what ill explain after weve got him back here we nonsense charou and ill go get him you wait here have the kassian ready to help him no we have to do this without noise the guide will show itself to me not you and we have to use the wood bridge and not touch iron thats she fumbled for a word thats vital its god business pan he ran a hand over his bald head smiled suddenly at her thestreet urchins grin that sat so oddly on his square solid face god wars eh blessed be tannakes more gods like him and lifed be simpler and safer he reached a long arm out gathered in his staff ill wait you go get that cloak of yours with the hood shouldnt ha gone out with your arms naked like that your head uncovered just asking for trouble eh scoot the house under the iron bridge was squat and derelict its thick mud bricks crumbling the wooden shutters discolored with age and sealed to the frames as if both shutters and frames had turned to stone careful faan whispered dont touch iron not even with your sleeve avoiding the latticed metal support of the bridge creaking and groaning overhead she followed the pinpoint light of the wild magic willawis around the building to the back where a door sagged on one hinge the house smelled of dust and dead moss most of all of age yet the inner walls were in much better shape than the outside almost as if the crumbling were a kind of camouflage reyna lay naked in a small room near the front of the house smeared with his own wastes his body contorted all the major bones broken his long slender hands swollen and shapeless his face sliced into a horror that wasnt remotely human in the faint bluish light of the willawis faan looked down at him vema she said thats that she stepped aside so panote and charou could get at him faces impassive the two men lifted reyna as gently as they could and laid him on the litter without trying to straighten his limbs panote tossed an end of the sheet to charou and they laid the clean linen over him panote straightened has to be the wood bridge diyo as soon as they were out of the house she sent the willawis away and ran ahead of the men faan stood with her arms folded as panote and charou set the litter on the tiles in front of the altar it was very late by now long past moonset and not a breath of air was stirring even up here sound was oddly muffled as if the heat were layers of felt she shut her eyes a moment closed her hands aboutthe edge of the altar the price was her soul her life she had no choice none reyna no best not to think of him pan go wake the kassian and tell her to bring candles lb her about reyna tb her theres a bargain i need to make then if you want you can go back to bed would it make trouble if i came nayo my friend she swallowed it wont be pleasant i think ahsan charou i bless you for your help but go now please the kassian tai came with candles and strained honey from the jars in her room areia moha oneeye followed with tais ancient drum that shed inherited from the kassian who was her teacher whod inherited it from hers and so on tai poured the honey into a crystal saucer and set the candles beside it lit them with a coal from her fire holding the drum in both hands areia knelt beside the litter panote faan said the kassian tai smiled he wanted to be here but i forbade it this is abeyhamals work and tannakes has no part in it i see diyo honeychild take your place the kassian tai wanameh settled the embroidered talcaffa cloth about her neck lifted her hand for areia moha oneeye to begin the drumming faceted shimmers formed over her eyes her skin bleached to a dark amber threadlike antennas curved from her brow gossamer wings vibrated behind her taishe turned to face faan what is it you require honeychild a bargain o mother of bees faan sang the words she didnt know if that was right but it felt right or a battle you bargain flea the voice was honey sweet and thick with vibrato the amber hands moved continually in odd angular positions a bargain or a battle i could crush you with a thought diyo that is true i would be a smear on the tiles and about as useful this is your making no doubt you know my terms before i state them well say what you want speak carefully flea what you ask for you shall receive one if all terms of the bargain are not fully complete the bargain is nullified two reyna is to be healed of his body wounds and the addiction that is destroying him and you will see that he does not remember these past three days that he does not remember any pain or betrayal three you will do your best to protect him from further harm four i know this leaves large holes in the bargain but i will trust your honor to see it is done five on my side i will surrender my will to you and do whatever you wish to the extent of my intelligence my strength and mytalent i will do your bidding even unto death she thought a moment unto my death abeyhamal in pal laughed my honor she cried out you think to trust my honor diyo let it be done flea take my hand when i see reyna whole and strong then i will take your hand your trust is oddly limited flea it is my need that speaks bee mother not my distrust so be it behold the stained sheet melted away reynas limbs were straight his body clean his face had its usual austere beauty he slept sweetly deeply wild magic faan sucked in a breath it was hard terribly hard to reach out to the god in the woman to tak the cool honey hand and surrender her will to summon the god to enter and be one with her but shed made the bargain with open eyes and had the rivermans warning in her ears what the god had given the god could reclaim she let the air trickle through her lips and waited abeyhamal was at once cool and hot light and heavy coming into her like honey mead one moment she felt as if shed burn to ash another as if shed turn to ice then she was washed out of herself was prisoned in a cyst somewhere behind her eyes while the god wore her body like a glove the kassian tai wanameh crumpled to her knees glazed eyes fixed on the tiles the godshape gone from her body areia moha oneeye let the drumming fade she went on her knees beside tai and lifted her shoulders murmuring soft encouragements into her ear faans body walked across to reyna took the salagaums hand and raised him from the litter reyna came up with healthy ease his eyes still closed his breathing slow and steady the godinfaan led reyna down the stairs to his room on the sleeping floor helped him into bed and pulled the quilts up around him sheshe touched his brow gently affectionately then left him to sleep till he was ready to wake the godinfaan deposited faans body on her bed be ready she said the voice reverberating inside faans head when i ask give without hesitation and without stint the cyst about faan dissolved and she was herself again the god was gone she got to her feet poured a cupful of water into the basin and washed her face over and over until most of the water was gone its done she said aloud for better or worse its done she stripped climbed into bed and slept without dreaming for the first time in days chapter the prophet comes from the hills to disturb the land faharmoy woke with chumavayals touch on his brow and knew it was time his call had come no years ago he walked into the stony wilderness of the konduni piedmont leaving everything behind renouncing his father and his family renouncing power and personal glory he went hungry froze at night burned with thirst and was tormented by his own filth by the assaults of insectsand by memories he couldnt forget and couldnt bear to remember he walked blindly following the wind eventually he found a boulderstrewn wadi with a tiny spring that produced less than two cups of water a day it was enough he settled to pray to meditate to dieif that was what he was called on to do he slowed day by day to the unhurried flow of life around him lost the urgencies of his regimented existence though he kept the rigidity of the frameworkit was ground so deeply into him that he would never recognize how unchanging a pattern he laid over his hours he rose before dawn drank three swallows of water then three more he walked to the sandy hole he used as a latrine and let his body act as it would he scrubbed with sand then washed with meticulous care and half a cup of water then knelt naked in the morning light his arms out his eyes on the rising sun when it was directly overhead he rose from his prayers and meditations pulled on a coarse robe and sought food for his single meal of the daya furry bukie or a fat lizard a kizzai tuber or a tungah root the fiddle curls from the tender tips of a jiji weed or whatever else came to him he never knew exactly what he was going to find and that was good some days he found nothing and that too was good his beard grew and his hair he combed them with a scratchcone from a tiny twisted wiba tree cleaned his teeth with a twig he cut from that tree he grew calm at last out here the grains of sand blew across the cracks and undulations of the stone without reference to him out here the web of life let him be he was happy chumavayal came to him huge and powerful strong and male no ambiguities about him everything clear and pure and true chumavayal came and touched him gently lovingly and told him you are mine you are my hero my champion hear me what is is right change is betrayal those that try to change things have brought upon themselves the destruction of the land they will die of hunger and thirst unless they come back to meunless they follow me without faltering or questioning my hero my champion my word my prophet follow me without faltering and i will fill you with the hot iron of my forge that you may brand my people with my words your voice will be my voice you will scourge the people turn them away from their sins bring them back to me you will erase from the land all that is perverted all that is born monstrous i will take those poor crippled souls to myself and hold them until they are healed that they may be born anew i am not a cruel father but i do what i must for the health of my people discipline is necessary you know that hero discipline is health pain is given to man to teach him the right wayotherwise how is he more than animal chumavayal said these things to him reached down again and drew warm black fingers along the thorns faharmoy had woven into a scull cap to purge himself of thoughts he should resist there is no more need of this you have cast out your demons they will attack again but they have no more power over you you have cast them out and you are whole go now and speak the truth to my people that i may be moved and turn away their suffering demand that they cast out the misshapen and misborn among them demand that they send the foreign ers away rid themselves of that pollution tell them my prophet my champion go and speak my words faharmoy ate a tuber hed buried beneath the fire to cook during the night then walked out of the camp taking with him only the coarse brown robe hed worn there the old leather sandals that were near to falling apart the crooked hardwood staff hed found one day sandpolished and as tall as he was food he left to the whims of his god but he took the water skin pushing his arm through the fraying strap settling the damp weight against the small of his back the two years that had passed since he came here had seen the drought harden on the land streams dry up the river sink until the sandbars showed grass was dry and brittle most of the brush was dead he walked without hurrying his long easy strides taking him across the land with deceptive speed he could walk all day now without tiring swinging the staff chanting chumavayals law or meditating as he moved an hour before sundown he searched for food found a few meaty beetles and some withered tungah roots he made a small fire roasted the beetles and the roots ate them with a stolid indifference washed the food down with two swallows from the skin he poured sand over the fire and stamped it down to smother the tiniest embers then he slept on the third day he came to a scrub farm deserted and silent there was a dead cow in a rickety corral all ribs and skin mummified by the heat and dryness swaying listlessly in the desert wind a short frayed length of rope hung from the end of a cracking wellsweep when he reached its mudbrick coping he dropped a pebble into the well after a while he heard a clatter no splash dry deep and dry he sighed dropping to his knees and stretching his arms wide he chanted chumavayals blessing on the land and its people he kept up the cycle of prayer until his mouth was dryer than the dust his throat was raw and his lips crackinguntil he felt chumavayals touch on his brow he took a swallow of water from the skin held it in his mouth for several minutes then let it trickle down his throat another sip then he slapped the stopple home and started on his journey once again on the fifth day he came to a dry canal and followed it to a village three men sitting on a bench in the meager shade of a dead tree looked up as he stopped beside them the fields are empty he said where are your children crops ha fail again prophet one of them told him an unlettered naostam he was his ancient hands twisted and knotted by a lifetimes hard labor he jerked his thumb at the canal y see how that be no crop thout water nothin to keep em here mal rostocar he send rations for the old uns s we starve slow stead o fast but the young uns got to do fer theysefs do you have any kassos here abosoa adjoa anachoa the old men snorted slapped their knees and hid toothless smiles behind withered hands the one whod spoken before said last well he go dry suckin yungis run like theys tail on fire faharmoy shifted his grip on his staff frowned do you have ghosts that need laying the speaker shrugged theys good folk don bother us faharmoy scowled at the ancient defiant faces there was nothing he could do here these men were like stones they wouldnt hear anything he said he shook his head and started on clean the heart of the corruption and the body would have its health again but as long as there was poison in the cities there was nothing he could do for the land he walked through other villages some with other old men sitting on benches talking about other old times some empty except for the wind and now and then ghost fragments that he chanted to rest before passing on the fields were empty and slowly blowing away with the furnace wind the canals that watered this once productive land were dry even the dead fish stranded in them were so old there was no stink left only tatters of graybrown skin and arrangements of delicate white bone on his eleventh day of walking he came to the river and followed it east to the city which he reached late in the afternoon the sequba cloudbrushers in the abey groves were green and pleasant in the burnt land their roots were set so deep that droughts never troubled them there were many of these groves scattered about the low city abeyhamals chapels the edgers called them he saw them as centers of poison and corruption seducers with their green and their shade he circled wide about the first of them careful that even the shadow of a tree didnt touch him you will burn he murmured as he passed among the buildings you are perversion and will be destroyed heat wavered up from the dead grass and the hardpan sunlight glinted painfully off glass in windows whose shutters had been unbarred for the first time in centuries they were here all those farmers whod abandoned the land and with it their proper roles their needful communion with the iron god they were here in defiance of chumavayals law and of the amrapakes command this must be made right shadow from a wall touched him and he flinched away as if hed been brushed by nettles evil he saw no one but he could feel eyes on himunseen folk in those newly opened houses peering at him from behind improvised curtains he moved through the low city to the ancient sok circle at its heart and knelt in the dust there his arms outstretched his eyes closed after a while he heard whispers coughs the scraping of feet against the dusty paving stones the rustle of cloth and a hundred other small sounds as the squatters came warily from the houses theyd appropriated and stood in a ring around the outside of the circle he heard them but paid no attention to them they were just there like the wind like the suns heat he was touching tasting getting to know the ills of this place he wasnt strong enough to destroy it not yet but he could make a start he filled his lungs expelled the air in a braying raucous cry chumavayal eyes still squeezed shut he felt heat brushing at his skin then leaving him rushing away in his mind it was a hollow sphere of sunfire racing away from him eating up everything it touched he heard screams curses a brief hiss of fire then silence he was cold weary the god was gone from him he opened his eyes the walls that faced the circle bloomed with black char shutters were gone baring unglazed windows like holes in skulls in some of the kariams that led like spokes from the circle there were piles of rags charred flesh and bone he got to his feet his movements slow laborious from a throat scraped raw his strained voice dropping flat against the pitted walls he declaimed this place is anathema i call upon it plague and pestilence i declare that those who come here are corrupt and guilty i declare that as long as there is a living soul within these walls the drought and death will continue i am the word of chumavayal hear me i say what he has given me to say hear me i am the scourge of chumavayal refuse my word and die he shook out his robe ticked his hands in his sleeves and walked from the center of the sok circle with an approving glance at the black burns on the wall beside him he stepped over a pile of ash and bone in the mouth of a kariam and started for the iron bridge chapter honcychild joins the dance faan drew the back of her hand across her forehead dropped the scrub brush on the tiles and made a face at the two inches of filthy water in the bucket whatever else had to wait on water the kassian tai insisted on keeping the altar clean and the tiles around it and the cleaning had to be done properly when it was her turn faan couldnt spell the dust away she had to get on hands and knees and scrub ailiki was curled up under the altar head on her foreleg twitching as she dreamed aili my liki you have the right idea there sleep the heat away trouble is if i try that i wake up with a head stuffed with rocks she laughed as the mahsar opened one bright eye closed it again made a sound like a word potz tt tt child where you picking up that language as if i didnt know hunh i wonder if you really are learning to talk tai says youre magic from your nose to your tail my familiar whatever that is she reached for the brush and went back to scrubbing at the tiles despite the heat and the withering of the pot plants there were a few bees buzzing lazily about one landed on the rim of the bucket seemed to sniff at the gummy water and reject it it looked up at her faceted black eyes glittering she gasped as she felt the weight of abeyhamal come on her for a moment she sat on her heels with her eyes closed struggling to accept what was happening strug gling to disengage the core of will that threatened to rebel and drive out the intruder she forced her hands open rested her trembling fingers on her thighs the possession was different it was not sudden but gradual as if honey trickled down her spine slowly slowly filling her and she retained control of her body words thrummed through her low slowshe didnt so much hear them as feel them she got to her feet i have to change my clothes she listened again i know its late i know i know diyo of course most folk will be getting ready to eat thats why i cant get lost in the street crowd she listened again verna vema ill hurry there were more people than she expected inthe lane workers trudging home some beggars she hadnt seen before a number of foreign sailors wobbling from drink shop to drink shop scattered street musicians mama kubaza was outside perhallas tavern with tick the pitch a drummer and an erhu player she was trading zingers with sailors and merchants who lingered to watch the band setting up zinar the porter and some of his friends were hanging about the metal shops hoping to pick up work even if it was just carrying packages old utsapisha sat beside a brazier cart while one of her granddaughters fried fishrolls and mooncakes and sold them to the sailors other vendors and homing workers with enough coin to buy a meal louok the nimble was alternating between coin rolls huntthenut and an inventory of sleightofhand tricks she remembered from the first time shed seen him tricks that still packed enough interest to attract a small crowd down one of the walkways a clutch of streeter kids squatted against a wall hugging a meager patch of shade their faces were red with heat and drawn with hunger they watched those who passed by with feral eyes waiting for a chance to snatch and run the heat pressed down on everyone ailiki ran along close to the house walls keeping in the shade so she wouldnt burn her paws faan sweltered in the ample skirt the longsleeved tunic the hooded cloak she had to wear these days ill be lucky if i dont have a heatstroke she told herself and the god she carried there was no answer unless it was the tickle behind her left ear she paced along slow and steady her eyes on the ground abeyhamal kept prodding her to hurry but she refused to listen moving faster than a crawl in this heat would attract more attention than she felt like dealing with she didnt bother to explain that but abeyhamal seemed to understand after a while and let her alone there were a pair of twowheeled carts placed between the twin pillars that marked the approach to the wood bridge two sour sullen cheoshim stood watch there with crossbows and short spears punishment detail probably but they wouldnt be careless wouldnt let her slip past however cleverly she went you want us to get across that bridge anytime soon you better come up with some way to get them out of there she pulled the worn skirt closer about her folded the excess cloth into a pad and eased onto her knees then leaned forward so she could see the bridge without being seen the drays were heavy and ancient she recognized them immediately having seen them often enough when she waited for dossan outside the woodmans compound with pairs of plodding saisai hitched to them they carried crated furniture to the gatts and brought back loads of fine woods her nose twitched those saisai were winks of meat now barreled in brine the woodman slaughtered them when he couldnt buy feed or water for them the cheoshim must have collected whatever naostams were hanging about and forced them to haul the drays to the bridge probably didnt pay them so much as a moju either abeyhamel spoke if youre in such a hurry you shouldve got me out earlier abeyhamal spoke we could always cross by the iron bridge nayo verna then a boats best why dont we go for reynas cat ladrdavivis far enough on we wont have trouble with that pair abeyhamal spoke emphatically what can you expect if you dont bother explaining so have i got it right i cross to the low city on the wood bridge while someone else is coming across the iron bridge from the low city you going to explain why or who huh i thought not then weve got ourselves a knot and not much time to untie it id appreciate some suggestions abeyhamal repeated what shed said before the exact words without explanation or amplification faans nostrils flared but she fought down her disgust and told herself dossan had to face this sort of thing every dayan employer was an employer no matter hers was a god thick as a brick potz well youll live through it fa so lets figure this out she scowled at the bridge the drays werent that much of a barrier not with those huge wheels she could slip through easily enough shed hardly have to bend her head but the men silverygray bubbles came blowing up through the dry hard earth some of them drifted about her slid through the black twill cloak and rested like cool thoughts about her shoulders and neck others flitted restlessly about her rising and falling curling in a lazy vortex that stayed mostly at the edge of her sightwild magic in the open for the first time drawn by her need she heard the popping fizz of their talk sighed because she hadnt a hope of understanding it abeyhamal spoke well get on with it youre the one thats in a hurry gods she thought riverman was right best to keep far away from them if you can if you can potz miseries miseries miseries she shut her eyes and gasped as abeyhamal seized her brain drove ghost fingers through and through it stirring it and kneading it like sticky bread dough pain jagged through her she ground her teeth and culled synonyms from memory to reassure herself that her head still worked and to distance herself from what was happening to it agony affliction anguish tbrment tribulation torture when the pressure eased she rubbed the gummy paintears from her eyes you finished reknitting my brain there was no answer from abeyhamal just a vague sense of satisfaction faan shivered do you hear me fvildings the popping fizz grew more agitated then the babble increased enormously and the whirl of the bubbles went faster and faster until she was the center of a silvery tornado strange uncomfortable sense of something an arbitrariness without limits sliding slippery contact like touching she couldnt find a word for the feel she got except for the good will that was like a sweet smell over them the wildings were scary well no point in being a bigot about it i need to draw those cheoshim off the bridge can you help me she heard a rush of something like giggles then the bubble people swirled away from her and went darting off like a swarm of what the way they moved flitting and swooping in graceful arcs reminded her of a field of butterflies shining in the sunwhich she couldnt remember seeing but the image was sharp in her head abeyhamal spoke vema vema faan sighed and got to her feet shook out her skirt fire might burn the bridge down abeyhamal spoke the appearance of fire dont know if i can do that abeyhamal spoke vema vema if you say so ow do you have to do that she lifted her arms narrowed her eyes built her focus on the drays and waited the wildings fluttered about the cheoshim making the guards nervous with tiny nips from things they couldnt see they scratched stamped their feet jigged around stared at the drays and cursed them as hosts for lice the nipping grew worse clawing at themselves they put more distance between themselves and the carts faan smiled then loosed the thing shed built the drays seemed to explode in flames pale translucent red and orange tongues of fire whipping out and up prodded by abeyhamal she pulled over herself a harder cloak than usual of her noseeme and ran for the bridge ailiki lallopping ahead of her the cheoshim guards were yelling and following instinct getting out of there scratching and cursing the heat licking at them too busy to bother with a shadow like a drift of smoke that flowed past them and oozed between the burning drays by the time faan reached the middle of the bridge the wildings were back with her bubbling about her giggling and excited loving the game moreee moreee they fizzed at her givee moree tricky chicky ticklee donkee abeyhamal spoke vema vema she fluttered her fingers at the wildings later another day for sure another time i give you my blessing for your help and my promise repeated i told riverman and i tell you now i will serve you as i swore go i have to be quiet like a mouse she held her arms out from her body the cloak fluttering in the furnace wind running along the river the bubble people fell away from the bridge as if shed dumped them overside then they flowed in a silver streak across the water and melted into the riverbank abeyhamal spoke faan glanced downriver the iron bridge wavered in the heat haze but she could see a dark figure intermittently visible between the girders i see him who is it abeyhamal was pointedly silent and tangibly impatient faan stepped over a charred contorted body and walked with unhurried small steps into the center of the circle she pushed back the hood of her cloak and turned slowly her eyes sweeping along the burnbranded walls and across the dead lying in the kariams leading away from the sok what happened here she winced as her voice broke harshly into the silence abeyhamal spoke prophet a seer abeyhamal spoke oh scourge of chumavayal why didnt you just say that abeyhamal spoke with intense irritation you know if you told me a little about what was happening id be a lot more effective vema vema no more questions well this what am i supposed to do here abeyhamal spoke vema vema im all yours faan danced stamp sway shimmy turn in double loops the lazy figure eight abeyhamals sign dance to the music of the earth the deep heartthrobbing that was insignificant at first then began to boom louder and louder as waves of light and dark pulsed from her rings of honey light rings of hot dark fed by the fire that was with her always out and out lapping at the blackened walls driving before it the resident anger and anathema spread across the low city by chumavayal through his prophet faharmoy faan danced abeyhamal hummed in heryet was there only in part was lying concealed within her erasing through her chumavayals attempt to preempt her space the low city throbbed with the dance stones glowed in the pulsing golden light the squatters came into the street and danced toward her like water wheeling in a grand maehtruin they flowed round and round the circle humming at first then singing syllables of sound without meaning an antic sound that played a happy counterpoint to the earthhearts throb the sun dropped lower and lower stained the sky with layers of vermillion and shell pink faan stopped turning the song of the earth slowed the chant slowed with it the rings of light pulsed out from her nudging the crowd away like water through a bursting dam the squatters flowed along the kariams and into the wynds and ways of the city in moments faan was the only person visible she rubbed at the nape of her neck pulled the hood back up anything else you want abeyhamal spoke its getting dark i dont know if theres time for that abeyhamal spoke vema vema i swore and i will do if it takes the rest of the day and all night too faan walked across the circle to the kariam that shed come by trotted along it until she came to the approach to the wood bridge abeyhamal spoke vema vema faan kicked off her boots and dropped them by the approach pillars she wiggled her toes sighed that does feel good dont get in a snit vema vema ill hurry she dropped the heavy cloak over the boots if some potz steals these you going to replace them for me abeyhamal spoke im doing the job you want what i think and what i say thats my business she trotted along the low city gatt road until she reached the approach to the iron bridge she circled carefully around this guided by prods from her divine rider worked her way to the river through a double line of massive empty warehouses until she reached the last tumbledown building she turned her back to the river started loping along the wynd in this heat she thought its idiotic but she kept on circling the outer limits of the low city in a claiming run that would seal the place to abeyhamal chapter juvalgrim and the scourge of chumavayal faharmoy glanced upriver frowned as he thought he saw a fire on the wood bridge he set his hand on the iron rail and leaned out eyes narrowed struggling to see more clearly through the veils of heat haze nothing imagination and heatwaves no doubt he shrugged and went on the high city was hot red the windows and the polished metal accents catching and reflecting the sunset shadows shimmered with red edges the towers of the biasharim and the cheoshim made funnels of the kariams drawing furnace winds along them the leaves on the trees and shrubs whipped about more brown than green their suppleness gone the kichidawa hedges had died down to the deep roots their foliage was gone their crooked branches were as still and tangled as his uncombed beard their fingerlong thorns gleamed like curved steel needles the fountains in the womens gardens were dry silencing the hidden whisper of tiling water hed found so enticing on his first visit here the cheoshim towers were harder and blacker than he remembered redeyed from the sun sullenly silent though as the night crept down a night hardly cooler than the day but without the hammering of the sun the parade grounds were beginning to fill with listless unenthusiastic cadets faharmoy walked more slowly for a moment watching the armsmasters try to get some snap into the marching he shook his head corruption in little corruption in all this place was a sinkhole the iron tiles of the jiko sagrada seared through the soles of his sandals he accepted the burn as the cost of his sins and murmuring the laws of chumavayal he walked up the mountain with an unhurried step his staff sounding a steady tonk tonk tonk on the tiles punctuating his whispered chant he stopped at the ancient olive that marked the path to the sibyl diyo he said he touched his staff to the twisted trunk chumavayal bless he left the tree burning like a torch and walked on stepping on coolness now the sinuous black tiles frosting where his feet touched them the forge sanctuary was an immense room with soaring pointed arches the distant ceiling an intricate lacing of black iron and red firedbrick copper and silver inlays of chains hammers anvils and other signs of chumavayal danced in an angular rhythm across black iron panels set into the brick the polished metal wires shimmering into existence as they caught the flickering light from the forge fire dying back as shadow closed over them the fire was small a meager pile of split wood set in the center of the altar faharmoy paced slowly up the wide center aisle between the angled lines of kneeling stools his face grim as he watched the small weak flames the donors were scanting their dues maulapam cheoshim baisharim all of them were drawing in hoarding their resources letting their godduties lapse the high kasso in bairroa had gone soft or hed have kept them shivering in their sandals and contributing their proper share corruption in little corruption in all he knelt on the floorstones before the forge black basalt blocks worn by generations of knees into smooth ripples like windruffied water dropping his hands on his thighs palm up he gazed at the fire and sank into deep communion with chumavayal pierced by an ecstasy indistinguishable from pain three anaxoa novices came down the aisle heads bent two of them with hands hidden in the sleeves of their robes the third pushing the cleaning cart ahead of him it thumped and squeaked the instruments on the top tray rattled and scratched the wood in the bin rubbed and tunked dully faharmoy heard none of this his breathing was so slow he might have been carved from stone like the black stones he knelt on the novice with the cart stopped blinked at the long tangled hair and beard of the praying man the torn rough robe the staff laid beside him he caught the sleeve of the novice behind him pointed prophet he whispered dont know the third crowded up to them what we supposed to do dont know we better go ask diyo but who prime nayo nay not the prime teuzar hell know they left the cart and hurried out heading for the office of the house master to the anaxoa novices acolyte fitchon caught the tail of rumor and ran to the forge sanctuary crept round the edge of the chamber until he could see the prophets face he sucked in his breath went running out again outside the private apartment of the high kasso fitchon smoothed his stiff coppery hair into a semblance of order pulled his robe straight his sleeves down to cover his knuckles he knocked at the chambermassals wicket sagged into a loosekneed bow when the slide opened a crack acolyte fitchon heshim chambermassal he said head down and humble though palag rambazich had known him for over a decade knew he was in charge of the high kassos rooms and wardrobe knew he was free to come and go by the high kassos own orders but palag rambazich could make fitchons life one long misery if he didnt go through the proper forms pass the slide crashed shut fitchon stuck out his tongue and shimmied his hips then went more sedately along the corridor a brisk tatump on a panel of the deeply carved door a squeeze on the latch and a shove and he was inside he smoothed a hand across his chin grimaced at the sandpapery rasp too bad the rules didnt allow beards or maybe arranged it so his grew with a little less enthusiasm this shaving business was getting booooring or maybe i should turn prophet tchah im wasting time he scratched at his palm shrugged and went through into the sitting room juvalgrim was sitting at a table by an open window eating an apple and making notes in his journal he shut the book when he heard fitchon come in set the apple on the plate at his elbow youre early fitch finally developed an eagerness for work not dead yet my friend fitchon dropped onto a bench clasped his hands um might be trouble minh a prophet trancing in front of the forge fire throwing the little anaxoas into a tizzy when they came to trim the fire for evensong teuzar will deal with him not this one juvalgrim reached for a napkin began wiping his fingers why i recognized him he worked on a grin but it didnt come easy he was worried two years ago remember when whats his name faharmoy did the irenounceeverything thing its him faharmoy vema looking like five years bad luck in one lump juvalgrim stared out the window i see he said finally still turned away lay out the red robes ill take evensong myself vema anything else no you might as well go to bed be ready for anything tomorrow you need someone at your back high one juvalgrim laughed swung round again you havent called me that in ears fitch he scratched at his nose guess not ahsan friend there is one thing after you get the robes ready i want you to take a note to the verakay beehouse all the usual cautions fitch hmm gotcha high one he grinned again more easily this time as juvalgrim drew a sheet of paper from a drawer and began writing he jumped to his feet and hurried to finish his work juvalgrim smoothed his hands down the embroidered panels on the front of his robe it was a familiar feel but not a comfortable one not now he took the iron chain from its hook dropped it over his head centered the hemisphere of cloudy crystal the eye of chumavayal it was heavy but no weightier than usual the god was dozing or had his attention elsewhere he drew shaking fingers across the stone across again wondering if hed at last run out of wiggleroom if the sudden appearance of this highborn prophet meant that chumavayal was tired of his whites and about to squash him he paced back and forth back and forth across the oval rug that children from the edgeschool had made for him the hammer and anvil worked in black on a rusty orange ground he was fond of that rug told reyna it kept him honest but he wasnt seeing it now he was terrified his knees threatened to fold and his sphincters needed only half an excuse to let go back and forth back and forth he thrust his hand inside the robe closed his fingers over the waxsealed phial with the poison in it why wait for the stake and the fireman do it now get it over with back and forth cant keep this up ive got to do something if im going id better get started back and forth send for him bring him here keep him quiet keep it all quiet but what if he wont come chumvay he flung his arms wide do it idiot do something he felt at his hair walked quickly to the dressing table with its glass mirror took a brush and began smoothing down the long black mass settling it into ordered waves he inspected his face touched balm to his lips and along his cheekbones worked it into his skin until it had a supple sheen then slid on the heavy gold rings that marked his rank good as its going to get he smiled at himself amused at his own reactions how this small bit of pampering had driven out a very large terror vanity oh vanity he murmured how reyna would laugh as he moved through the corridors of the camuctarr he was surprised by a twinge of guilt he hadnt expected that but the fervent boy for whom chumavayal was father protector and source of all good was still there under the embroidery and the gold there were oaths hed sworn and later broken promises implicit and explicit hed made then forgot as he maneuvered his way to power forgot until now too late of course he paced along automatically smiling when he passed kassos novices and acolytes moving busily about their duties guilt was it really he wasnt sorry for anything hed done only the things hed left undone not guilt no just fear congealing in his belly he smiled broadly amused again at his own reactions then blinked as the leader of a line of foundling boys heading for supper responded to the smile with a giggle asslim high one the boy called out giggled again impressed with his own daring asslim imp no no he shook his head at the quiamboa novice who was herding them let him be fulan he thumped the boy on his head mind your manners kimkim and do what your teachers tell you and then perhaps youll live long enough to gain a little wisdom teuzar asslim kasso have you done anything about our visitor anaxo teuzar smiled tightly i sent a messenger to your office kasso i know when im out of my depth ah i must have just missed him your messenger send your novices in tell them to wait on the kneeling stools while i ascertain the reasons for the visitation evensong may be late but they are to be ready for it nonetheless curiosity and rumor will bring others have ushers ready to get them in place without fuss i think thats all let it be done he waved teuzar away and went into the forge sanctuary he smelled the prophet before he got close enough for a good look hasnt changed his clothes since he left or had a bath or shaved ah the joys of holy dirt bless chumavayal i wasnt called to that dirt and celibacy nayo nayo he crossed his long slender hands below the eye setting them on patches of old thread that showed of his blueblack skin and emphasized the elegance of lre and shape he moved with a quiet grace around de rough dirty hermit and stood between him and the fill the ecstasy on the mans face faded with the blocking of the light he glared up at juvalgrim he was almost unrecognizable twisted gaunt and hairy his youh eaten up by the fervor that drove him juvalgrim bowed slightly the eye catching the light from the wall lamps pulsing with it as he moved it is time for evensong heshim prophet you may resume your meditations when our duty has been made prophet faharmoy reached for his staff and got to his feet with a wiry nervous surge of his body his eyes peered out through a fringe of stiff graystreaked hair duty he cried his voice hoarse and ugly you make a mockery of it luxuriant whore i am the scourge of chumavayal hear his words you who should be the heart of the people you who should be the example you have betrayed him where are the people high kasso where are the suppliants come to pray for release from their sins you are the fountain from which corruption flows high kasso in bairroa pili you have betrayed caste and upset the divine order of life you have stepped between servant and master you have acted for the low against the high you have pampered the undeserving you have coddledno worseyou have advocated perversion you want change he spat the last word out as if it were the ultimate accusation chumavayal put his hand upon me chumavayal said this to me he opened his mouth wide and boomed out the words hear me what is is right change is betrayal those that try to change things have brought upon themselves the destruction of the land they will die of hunger and thirst unless they come back to meunless they follow me without faltering or questioning he cleared his throat and went on in the rasping tones of his first words chumavayal came to me in desert and solitude saying tell my servants this my people this once again he lifted his head roared the words in his fierce ruined voice your voice will be my voice prophet you will scourge the people turn them away from their sins bring them back to me you will erase from the land all that is perverted all that is born monstrous i will take those poor crippled souls to myself and hold them until they are healed that they may be born anew i am not a cruel father but i do what i must for the health of my people discipline is necessary discipline is health pain is given to man to teach him the right wayotherwise how is he more than animal thus he spoke to me thus i speak to you hear and obey without waitingfor a response he swung round and stumped out his sandals squeaking the butt of his staff thudding against the tiles of the mosaic floor iuvalgrim had come to the sanctuary with a poison phial tucked into his sleeve resigned to accepting whatever waited for him with a god involved there wasnt much else he could do at the end of the prophets scold resignation had turned to indignation there was new here hed listened to the same scold from the maulapam landlords from cheoshim commanders from biasharim merchants youre pampering the unfit let them help themselves let them leave if they cant feed themselves here weve got our own to worry about youre disturbing the order of things youre putting desires in these people they arent capable of handling nothing new nothing and hed been so terrified of this this idiocy hed nearly soiled himself but indignation wouldnt do not here he pulled himself together pressed palm to palm bowed his head and intoned we are all guilty of doing less than we might in the service of the iron father we are blessed by the gentle care of chumavayal i your high sasso do give thanks for the chastisement of the prophet i bless him for this reminder that i must myself do better take to heart what you have heard my children and give thanks yourself for his care for the first time in years he led the evensong letting his deep magnificent voice swell to fill the chamberand by the time the rite was complete he knew hed canceled out most of the effect of the prophets scold he kept a gentle smile pasted on his face as he returned to his apartment answering with genial dignity the greetings of the other kassos the novices the acolytes who found reasons to wander by the sanctuary and exercise their curiosity hed won the exchange this time but it was a temporary victory hed have to keep patching cracks and buffing egos hed been so busy that hed forgotten to keep touch with his supporters you idiot you really do owe the prophet gratitude for stirring you out of this laziness faharmoy felt the god leave him he stared at the impassive elegant face of the high kasso then swung round and stumped out he knew in his bones that juvalgrim had rejected everything the iron father said through his mouth the man would not be saved he was tired to the bone it was time to rest and restore his energies ignoring attempts to speak to him he strode through the halls of the camuctarr until he reached the water court with the fountain that never went dry even in the worst of droughts he drank sparingly from the fountain and settled for the night in a corner of the court ignoring the hunger that closed like a fist about his stomach after a while he slept he woke before dawn and went to the towers of the cheoshim it was time to begin the cleansing of the high city there was a faint pink glow on the eastern horizon and wisps of riverfog hugging the ground when faan limped wearily along southbank gatt road the circle was almost complete but she was worn to a nub hungry thirsty irritated with the god on her back who seemed to think she didnt need food or rest or anything as prosaic as that when she reached the approach to the wood bridge she sank beside her boots and cloak onto the ancient surface with its mosaic of different colored woods and rested her back against the weathered rails snapped her fingers smiled drowsily as ailiki jumped into her lap and tucked tail about legs she scraped up enough energy to stroke the mahsars back twice then dropped her hand guards still there abeyhamal spoke you chase them i couldnt light a match abeyhamal spoke this horse wont go you want me to get back to the beehouse you figure out a way sense of impatience faan let her head fall back against a post closed her eyes and waited i can be as stubborn as you its easy when its the only choice ive got in her lap ailild was a vibrating warm spot purring like a dozen cats abeyhamal spoke faan groaned you would vema vema give me a minute klaan her feet burned she was blistered and scraped stonebruised and nettle stungthey were dead nettles but that only meant they broke apart and rode away on her legs off you go liki yelping and groaning some more she gathered in the boots draped the cloak over her arm pulled herself up and tottered up the slope until she was standing on the dusty inlay between the first two piers that supported the bridge im here do it a warm sticky heat flowed through her honey mead fermenting in her cadentha honey the sweetsweet perfume of cadenthas strong about her it erased her fatigue smoothed out her cuts and scrapes healed her bruises and rashes filled her with energya temporary energy she had a felling it would burn away fast abeyhamal spoke verna vema on my way she started across the bridge working up to a fast lope her bare feet splatting on the wood wild magic came swooping up and whirled about her thick gray fog sweeping along with her a slightly darker scrap of mist among the other wisps drifting along the river the guards were leaning against the approach pillars caps pulled down over their eyes they were more than halfasleep bored with watching a bridge go nowhere faan slid between the drays and trotted past them a patch of fog flowing off the bridge she darted into the nearest wynd and stood shaking and panting the wild magic swirling around her giggling and niggling at her a thousand small voices impossible to understand because there were too many of them she wiped at her forehead made a face at the grime on her palm though it was hard to see the hand through the agitated mist ahsan ahsan my friends ill see you later hmm i have to rest i cant go anymore she made a dismissing gesture shed learned from the sibyl more moree sweetee honey the wildings teased at her tch ikee sweetee weee like thee go home friendlings therell be more i said it be fore and wasnt it true go rest and be ready she wiped the sweat from her head as the silver bubbles went swirling away vanishing like soap bubbles into the hardpan of the wynd without warning or explanation abeyhamal too was gone there were people in the wynds and the byways trudging to work in the first light she hurried across verakay lane and turned down vallaree wynd it was dark and empty except for the occasional sleeper recovering from a spree in a mulehouse on verakay she relaxed and slowed almost home liki ooooh i would love a long hot bath well ill have to be satisfied to crawl into bed and sleep a week ailiki made a sound another of her almostwords then pricked up her ears she scratched into an allout run vanished around a bend in the walkway huh i do wish you could talk aili my liki she rubbed drowsily at her eyes save a lot oftrouble ailiki came racing back every hair on her body standing erect she scrabbled to a stop in front of faan reared on her hind legs pawed the air dropped to four feet reared again ne ne ne she squealed at faan ne ne ne not something else abeyhamal hai god i need information you dont have to do anything just tell me whats going on nothing verna vema riverman was right you can only depend on them for muddle and messing up she listened i dont hear anything ah well liki well go along slow slow till you start having fits again hmm i suppose i could climb up the back of emaurs mulehouse and see whats happening you understand what im saying she chuckled as ailiki sat up clapped her delicate black hands together i suppose that means you do lets go my liki she left vallaree wynd followed ailiki deeper into the edge through several shadowy silent ways then back again until she was behind emaurs stepping cautiously over the sprawled drunks that were as ordinary here as the dead weeds along the back wall she rested her head a moment against the wall tired so tired sighing she caught hold of a protruding brick levered herself to a foothold on the sill of a shuttered window as she picked her way across the cluttered roofbroken tables cracked jars all kinds of debris from the bar emaur was a compulsive hoarder never threw anything awayshe was starting to hear an intermittent rhythmic roar it was far off still but it made her nervous she knelt by the parapet overlooking verakay lane scowling toward the sokajarua the rising sun in her eyes the roar grew louder and more ominous and the morning wind brought her whiffs of burning oil ailiki ran up her body jumped onto the parapet and stood hissing her body arched her tail stiffly straight for a moment longer the lane was full of people beggars street singers utsapisha and her grandaughters louok the nimble mama kubaza and her band muth maship and his dancers porters and sweeps traders from the ships workers plodding along to the factories on the far side of the iron bridge shopkeepers sweeping dust off their stoops and unlocking their shuttersthen they were gone as if some magus had snapped thumb against finger and banished them burn burn burn there was a flicker of light beyond the bend faint nearly lost in the brightness of the sun burn burn burn and a thunder of boots beating the hard dry dirt of the lane burst burn burn the front lines of a mob of young cheoshim marched around the bend torches held high black boots swinging and hitting the earth in unison a striker band much bigger than the one that had chased her beehouse i know it faan groaned pushed away from the wall come on liki weve got to warn them cursing the clutter she stumbled across the roof and climbed down ran along the wynd to the back door of the beehouse as doors always did when she needed to go through them the back door sprang open slammed against the wall faan caught it as it bounded back ran across the kitchen and up the stairs she kicked at reynas door up up theres a mob coming she ran on banged on dawas door areias hammered on the kassians door tai tai theyre coming for us we have to get out of here she stood panting in the hallway swaying with fatigue blinking sweat out of her eyes as the bedroom doors opened tai shouted the others to silence what is it fa whereve you been never mind that tell you later theres a mob i dont know how many cheoshim coming down the lane coming here im sure of it striker band yelling burn waving torches weve got to get away tai closed her eyes grimaced diyo i can smell it areia fetch panote will you reyna you and dawa collect bedding clothes any coin youve got stowed away fa i know youre tired but get what you can and be ready totta were going to need you she has said all of you well meet in the kitchen five minutes thats all youve got the mass of cheoshim filled the lane wall to wall boot heels hitting the dirt in unison torches waving burn burn burn a single man walked before them a tall ebon figure in a torn and ragged robe graystreaked hair in a tangle red eyes glaring over a graystreaked beard a staff in one hand the other held out before him palm out fingers pointing to the sky a bloody sky with a bloody sun just breaking free of the horizon burn burn burn in the wynd across from the beehouse reyna stirred faharmoy diyo tai whispered be quiet rey faan leaned against the wall of the tenement on the west side of the wynd her eyelids sagging her mind barely turning over she wanted to be away from here but tai wouldnt go burn burn burn the prophet stopped in front of the beehouse anathema he roared be cast out be purged from this city from this land burn burn burn the mob roared behind him male voices rumbling in their lowest notes burn burn burn the prophet stepped to one side folded his armsacross his chest a huge heavy youth in the front rank ran to the door of the beehouse an oiljar in his left hand he booted the door till it boomed out he bellowed out you kuashin guguns out or eat fire burn burn burn so angry she forgot her fatigue tiny tongues of flame dancing along her arms faan took a step toward the roadstopped at tais quiet no the cheoshim booted the door again then crashed the jar of oil against it dropped his torch into the puddle and ran back yelling burn burn burn burn the cheoshim chanted as they thinned into single file and trotted into the wynd on the west side of the house burn they formed a circle about the beehouse stamping their feet and howling burn burn burn in verakay lane the prophet lifted his staff brought the butt down hard on the dirt chumavayals blessing he cried out let it be done some heaved their jars high enough to get them over the roof fence so they crashed on the tiles some aimed at windows or simply splattered the walls with the heavy oil a howl blew like a gale around the house the cheoshim danced and whooped and waved their torches burn they shouted the sound ragged now wilder and more terrible burn the prophet tucked his staff under his arm and clapped his hands together a single crack that broke through the other noise the cheoshim swung their torches around their heads and hurled them at the beehouse then ran for the lane arms crossed over their heads like the jars some of the torches flew up and up turning in lazy circles curving over the roof fence others dropped into the pools of oil at the base of the walls the beehouse burned flames leapt a hundred feet into the air goddriven and terrible in hardly a breath there was nothing but ashes left faan gazed at the blackened smoking wreck of the only home she could remember her shoulders drooping her eyes burning with tears that wouldnt fall reyna dropped his arm on her shoulders hugged her against him i know he said for a moment she slumped against him then she sighed and pulled away its not finished not yet dont do anything mamay itll only make things worse tai tell him d yo rey well take what we can carry to the wood bridge faan will follow in a few minutes reyna stepped in front of faan what is this god business got no choice rey nayo he caught her by the shoulder held her at arms length and examined her head to toe whats going on fa whereve you been what happened to you abeyhamal let me go rey dont interfere you dont know what youre doing reyna dropped his hand so tell me tai why does faan look like shes been dragged through a thorn patch she made a bargain rey you have to let her keep it what bargain what are you talking about ill explain later the kassian nodded at the others crowded into the wynd in private she tapped his arm nothings going to happen to her rey i promise now wood bridge my friend hurry frightened but compelled faan walked into the middle of the lane ailiki pacing at her side tai a step behind her the cheoshim didnt notice her at first when one did pointed and yelled obscenities at her the rest of them left their triumphant jigging and moved to stand in a muttering crowd behind the prophet faan stopped and gazed in silence at faharmoy a thin waif with hair waxed into spikes splotches of purple and green hairpaint rubbed and shabby a soft black plait falling forward across her shoulder her face was smeared with gray dust her feet were bare and dirty her skirt torn and littered with the dead weeds shed run through abruptly towering over her abeyhamal stood in the lane singing with the wind insubstantial as a dream translucent her beewings vibrated creating a thin high descant to the alto hum of her powersong the ivory fimbo which she held in her left hand glowed palely gold aged by fasting and fervor faharmoy was gaunt and gray his hair and beard uncombed his hands eroded to dry skin stretched over bone chumavayal rose behind him towering dark and powerful insubstantial as a dream translucent his eyes red as forged iron the beeeyed woman sang her buzzing song and danced in figure eights behind the slight form of her champion the old man glared at the honey mother from molten eyes one huge ropy hand holding the great hammer he brought the hammer up and over in a powerfilled circle struck the earth in front of faan the wind of the miss stirring the spikes on her headgreen eye and blue eye she watched him unmoved abeyhamal slammed the butt of her fimbo on the earth her wings vibrating more rapidly her hum deepening and growing louder driven by the force of her anger and desire she buzzed in place wings vibrating larynx vibrating bee eyes on the black old man abruptly she flipped the fimbo up and over held it away from her body parallel to the ground she bent her knees turned her feet out and hopshuffled at a slant to faanwhen she was even with the girl she stopped glided backward to her starting point her feet moving the rest of her quite still then she hopshuffied at an opposite slant chumavayal stamped the road till the shops and tenements shook with the force of his power and his fury stamped with feet turned out his elbows pointed with his left hand he brought the hammer curling up over his head with his right he snatched the saber clipped at his side and brought it curling up over his head he clashed them together sparks flew like falling stars vanishing before they touched the earth abeyhamal whirled the fimbo over her head lightning jagged from the point crashed into the lane by faharmoys feet but none came close to touching him chumavayal roared his fiery breath enveloped abeyhamal and faan without touching either her gossamer wings vibrated more furiously sending the heat into the dry sterile clouds gathering over the city he brought his sword down held it across his chest stamped his feet to one side then the other then slashed at her pulling yellow and crimson flametongues into high leaps from the smoldering coals where the beehouse had been abeyhamal caught the sword on her fimbo deflected it brought the fimbo around to slash at chumavayals hand drawing a trickle of blood as the point touched him blood that fell on faharmoy sank into him chumavayal howled and made the saber weave in complex curves glittering red and white sending beams of light flickering about abeyhamal never quite touching her abruptly the images vanished faan stared at faharmoy he at her we will meet again he said in his ruined voice diyo she said we will meet reyna and dawa were waiting for her at the northbank approach tai and areia oneeye were already across you all right fa reyna touched her cheek when she nodded he set his hands on her shoulders clicked his tongue at the weariness he saw in her you better scoot across the sooner youre in bed the better fa venia to that rey come on we cant fa dawa and i were sealed out what jeas over there with his friend if hes all right why not you i cant set foot on the bridge i tried but theres some kind of wall in the way looks like jea was already across when it went up the barrier she said but she couldnt have meant you youre hers you always have been not any more apparently faan exploded its not fa aa air she shrieked she yanked out handfuls of waxed hair stamped her feet whirled round and roundfury fear and exhaustionslammed her body into one of the pillars beat at it with her fists until they bledall of this the toll taken by the repression of her will to allow control by the godflames spurted from her hands her face her clothing caught on firefrustration aggravation vexationshe screamed no no no no it was no to being stolen from her mother no to being different from everyone else no to daughterloving someone whod been working hard at destroying himself no to everything horrible in her life everything that piled up on her until she couldnt breathe any more all the nos shed been storing up since she came here ailiki ignored the smolders and the giggling flamelets she leapt to faans shoulder pressed her body against faans head warm furry soft draining off the fury with an absurd little squeak faan went still she dropped her arms and stood trembling smoke from burning cloth coiling up about her her eyes glazed over rolled back for the first time in her life she fainted reyna reached for her as she toppled but she fell through the barrier and his hands slammed into it he beat his fist against the thing cursing dawa caught his arm rey listen calm down ill go get someone shes just fainted shell be all right reyna swung round how do you know that how the jann do you know well yelling and thumping that thing isnt doing much good is it listen rey ill go fetch old utsapisha i saw her out there watching the house burn he went running off his long hair flowing out behind him in a blueblack wave reyna opened and closed his fists a few times then dropped to squat as close to faan as he could get she was breathing through her mouth he could see the dust on the planks shifting with each breath secrets he said honey what have you been up to why didnt you tell me i thought we were friends again the gray dust danced with her breath utsapisha lumbered up leaning on dawas arm two of her granddaughters with her ijjit gods she said what dawa here told us reyna slammed his fist against the barrier it hit hard and rebounded hunh utsapisha poked her finger at the barrier her hand went through as if it didnt exist like i said she waddled upthe easy slant grunted onto her knees beside faan thrust two thick fingers under the girls jaw verna good strong beat no need to fuss ysef rey she jes fainted girls do that she put out her arms and her granddaughters hauled her onto her feet the kassians across already reyna nodded verna then well get her to low city you better duck rey the two of you dont let those striker bassards get aholt a you they gonna torch you like they did the beehouse reyna nodded well be down at ladroavivi send someone to tell me how she is will you sure and dont you worry girls this age faint when they feel like it dont do em no more harm than a nights sleep when faan woke she was in a strange bed rain pattering against the window across the room tai was bending over her rey hush honey youre exhausted sleep and well talk tomorrow faan moved her mouth she meant to protest but instead sank into a heavy sleep goddance the twelfth year honey mother hums an angry scratching hum she dances faster flipping the fimbo about jabbing at chumavayal never quite touching him again lightning jags from the tip lacing a web of light about the broad black body of the iron father penhari banadah is moved onto the playing field a potential queen ranging behind the honeychild the women of bairroa pill watch their altars burn then take their children across the wood bridge and settle in the low stone houses built around the abey groves iron fathers eyes burn red

boiling free the city burns with fire and fear the culmination hurries near i am tired she says she smiles ruefully the verse is worse bad is one thing but this is really stretching she sighs the flush of humor draining away the life is going out of the land my students are too busy for me these days i miss them juvalgrim fights the shinda prefecture and the temple together and separately i fear that the forces assembling against him are building too strongly he cant last much longer honeychild she has a new guide i am not allowed to interfere diyo i do miss them and i am afraid for them theres a fire in juvaigrims future i can see him tied to a pole with the prophet waving a torch in his face and faanthe god will use her up and discardher like a dirty rag even her memories gone as she already has discarded the salagaum the sibyl brings her fist down on the chair arm i can do nothing i am tied to this place i can do nothing but watch her head falls forward her hands drop in her lap a moment later though she looks up a gleam in her blackopal eyes mmmh maybe a little more than watch when the cats are fighting the mice run loose well see well see chapter penhari banadah is shaped for service the amrapake used his toe to stir penharis unconscious body pulling a groan out of hera twitch of her fingers but nothing more he smiled sourly dropped the bloody flagellum on her back shouldve done that years ago he looked at his hands rubbed them together wenyarum towel why do i have to ask wenyarum talezas oiled skin had an ashy look and his eyes were uneasy vema vema amrap forgive me a moment he hastened out wiping at the sweat that popped on his brow as he stepped over the severed head of his wifes personal kassian hed seen too much he swallowed the bile that rose in his throat at the memory of famtoche kicking the door open and slashing with his saber at the maids who were trying to protect penhari then ordering wenyarum to throw the bodies in a pile he could only hope his usefulness still outweighed any flash of prudence that might strike his unpredictable brotherbylaw he seldom came into his wifes suite so it took him a while to find the water room long enough to wet him down with nervous sweat hastily he soaked a hand towel squeezed it out and went rushing back when he reached the sitting room famtoche was standing over his sister pissing on her face twisted in a grimace of fear wenyarum drew back and stood swaying and holding his breath until the sound stopped then he went hurrying in the towel folded on his hands hah famtoche strolled from the room cleaning his hands dabbing at the spots of blood on his tunic he looked over his shoulder at wenyarum following two steps behind clean your own house he says to me me jegging kasso true though too long i let family feeling sway me well its done he paused before the door into the public rooms one more thing general ive let the boy please himself hes got spirit didnt want it broken thats over he tossed the towel on the floor you go down to pili and bring him back dont care how you do it get him here well soon have that prophet nonsense knocked out of him he stepped aside and scowled at wenyarum taleza who hurried past him and opened the door for him nn days he said want him at the falmatarr no lateen that he walked briskly into the entrance hall his escort coming to practiced alert the instant the moment they saw him flies buzzed about the room one crawled up penharis arm tickling unendurably she twitched came painfully awake the fly kneaded at her arm with its thready legs then crouched by one of the flagellum cuts thrust its drinking tube into the crusted flesh hash she shook her arm violently arched her back and thrust herself up from the floor rested on her hands and knees as pain lanced through her groaning and gasping she staggered to her feet and groped blindly for the nearest wall she nearly fell over the bodies of her maids grabbed hastily for the back of a chair as her brain whited out and her stomach convulsed latermight have been a moment or half an hourshe stumbled on again forcing herself to move though she wanted to lie down like the maids and die in the water room she pulled the bronze chain and stood with her bloody back pressed against the cool tiles while the shell bath on the dais at the far end filled with steaming water it hurt but it was a duller ache than when she tried to move the bath overflowed she didnt know it until she came from a haze and saw water running across her feet she reached cried out as cuts tore open but completed the movement and pulled the chain ft lain to shut off the flow she went up the stairs on hands and knees and rolled into the bath the slave waiting for her in her bedroom was a stocky fair woman with fine brown hair and small brown splotches sprayed across her square cheekbones and hooked nose penhari eased herself down on the stool by her dressing table whats your name she inspected the woman again sighed where do you usually work desantro heshal her shoulders were rounded her worn hands trembling in the garden heshal diyo penhari closed her eyes who told you to wait here the chambermassal heshal he wouldnt let yeadah come or any of the chambermaids her thin mouth compressed a moment and there was a dull resentment in her eyes she wouldnt have dared show before this he said he made me come i see penhari managed a slight smile no matter his reasons i am happy to see you desantro she lifted an arm winced as the movement pulled at cuts but continued the motion go through the door there follow the corridor to the water room which hand do you use desantro lifted her right hand held it palm out toward penhari it was lined and callused with dirt ground deep into the skin diyo put your other hand on the wall and go in the first open door you touch you will see a chest just inside lift the lid and bring the red box you find there do you understand desantro bobbed her head diyo heshal her eyes shifted uneasily then she turned and went out sa saaah heshal desantro clucked over the ruin of penharis back and buttocks men she poured distillate of kuzury in a small bowl sopped a fiber ball in the liquid and began cleaning the wounds her big hands surprisingly gentle penhari chuckled then gasped she closed her hands into fists and ground them into her thighs as her back burned and throbbed there there luv thats over desantro crooned at her noi this should feel a lot better hmmm coolness the creamy salve killed the fire and eased the stiffening of her skin penhari sighed relaxed diyo she said you have good hands there was a short silence then a hesitant laugh was thinking of you like my plants heshal i mean your plants the ones i tend if you dont mind penhari smiled i am honored desantro plants have a proven worth i have none she grimaced in the eyes of my family desantro worked a while in silence then she said ive finished with the lotion therere strips of bandage in the box how you want me to do this penhari frowned touched her breasts smoothed her hand down her battered stomach she was sore bruised where famtoche had used his fists on her but the damage didnt seem to be that bad he was too flabby to have much power behind his punch bind the bandage round me but not too tight enough layers so the salve doesnt leak through desantro helped penhari to stand then eased her arms into a wraparound robe of linen so old and so often washed it was softer than fleece leaning heavily on the womans arm penhari shuffled to the bed with desantro supporting her shoulders she eased down on her side and lay in a loose curl with her knees bent to ease strain on her stomach bruises she turned her head wincing at the pull on the cuts have cook make some broth for me and an infusion of singizzia desantro shifted nervously ill tell the chamber massal penhari managed a smile i think youll find him urn more cooperative than you expect the wheel turns desantro hell be remembering that about now she lowered her head on the pillow closed her eyes tell him she murmured to send you again i find being tended like a plant comforting desantro brought the tray in planting her sandal soles flat with each step she shuffled to the bed set the tray on the bedtable with a loud sigh of relief then bent over penhari she hesitated touched the back of penharis hand heshal penhari blinked tried to move cried out as her body resisted and the pain shed briefly forgotten came stabbing back murmuring words in her own tongue desantro eased a strong arm under her helped her to sit up then shifted the bedtray over her knees s better to drink this when its warm heshal orwise id a let you sleep penhari wrapped both hands about the mug and with some difficulty lifted the fragrant steamy broth to her lips she sipped shivered with pleasure as heat curled through her do you follow abeyhamal desantro no heshal desantro stood at the foot of the bed her hands one atop the other at her waist her feet spread apart i come from whenapoyr its forests there and mountains my folk when they want a god they mostly follow geddrin the mountain groomer and isshann birthmistress rest a the time its the tree spirits we talk to whauraka we call them we dont take up much with strangers be they gods or men i see penhari ran the tip of her finger round the cups rim the kassian kurai and the maidshas anything been done with the bodies desantro looked uneasy nobody tells me aught i hear i dont know if its a true thing tell me they say general

walked down verakay lane angry eyes sweeping from side to side he stopped across the lane from utsapisha and her frycart glared at her for several moments then swung round and strode off the old woman wrinkled her nose lifted her veil and spat zazil her granddaughter looked nervously around wiped her sleeve across her face twiddlepoop couldnt find his ass if he had the runs zazeeee most of utsapishas vast family had packed up and moved across the bridge but she grumbled she was too old to shift her bones from the house her children and grandchildren had been born in and too mean to be driven out besides whod pick on a pore ol woman like her she tied a rag across her face in a mockery of a veil had a granddaughter sew huge floppy sleeves on her shirts and went marching along the lane swinging her arms and body like some superannuated clown giggling but nervous one or another of her granddaughters followed her pushing the frycart with the chair tilted over the oilpot utsapisha enjoyed these processions enormously bowed all round when she reached the deserted shop where she had established her claim on the boardwalk settled herself with a whoomph and a wiggle and after that traded insults with her customers she was an institution on verakay selling pies and kebabs to anyone who had the money mostly the sailors that ambled the lane hunting for whores drink and food chu ma vay yal chu ma vay yal the noise whispered down the lane along with the ominous rumble of a striker bands tramping feet utsapisha lifted her head swore vigorously you better duck she told the sailor whod just handed her a copper shabo for a pie she tucked the coin into a sleeve pocket jerked a long bony thumb at the bend in the land hear that them jeggers is trouble chu ma vay yal chu ma vay yal the short blond sailor licked juice off the side of his hand shrugged none a my business up to you bavv they feel like trompin you they gon do it huh might don like foraners thats you bavv chu ma vay

the boardedup shop behind her pemmie scoot get home now zazi you i mean it move y tail hon or im gon whip it off when i get ahold a you chu ma vay yal chu ma vay yal pemmie scowled unhappily at her grandmother then at the bend in the lane vema vema but you take care you hear scat pemmie walked away dragging her feet and repeatedly looking over her shoulder utsapisha kept an eye on her until she turned into a wynd then settled herself more solidly in her chair smoothed the rag of veil over her broad face chu ma vay yal cm ma vay yal the striker band came stomping and chanting around the bend the prophet a pace in front of them faharmoy stopped when he came even with utsapisha stood in the center of the lane staring at her woman he called come here utsapisha sniffed but shed lived long enough to learn a little prudence she bowed her head tucked her hands in her sleeves spoke as sweetly and softly as she could manage i am an old woman heshim prophet walkins hard standins worse she didnt move he grunted and crossed the lane to her why do you expose yourself in a public street woman why are you not in your house where you belong jeggin mal what the jann you know about how folks

heshim prophet what am i to do starve a contumacious and contentious woman i have seen you fouling your mouth and your sex by the filth that comes out of you obscene and froward forcing your daughters before the eyes of drunkards and foreigners utsapisha shivered frightened he was glaring at her but she didnt think he really saw her what he was seeing she didnt know and didnt want to know the prophet gestured and two of the cheoshim ran forward started rocking the frycart splashing her with oil from the pot she squealed with outrage as she slapped at the smoldering drops gathered folds of cloth crushing them between her hands to smother the small fires yelled as the cart crashed onto its side spewing oil over the boardwalk dumping the coals in the firepan over the oil the walk began to burn about her feet she struggled to get upyelled again as another two cheoshim grabbed her arms lifted her onto her feet and hurried her out into the lane the flogging posts the prophet said let her learn the cost of her acts chu ma vay yal chu ma vay yal this is how you treat you ma you jeggin potzheads she snorted tried to wrench her arms free you granma chu ma vay yal chu ma vay yal hai prophet be damn to your god for a rats ass you ma a poxy treez you pa got the itch been rid by every jeggin hero in jeezin royal guard she went on and on with every step digging up more invective from a life lived hard and colorfully the cheoshim holding her tightened their grip and began breathing heavily but the prophet walked in a cell of silence and nothing she said reached him chu ma vay yal chu ma vay yal in the center of the sok circle with the few merchants left and fewer buyers watching silently the cheoshim tied her hands to the iron circle of the flogging post wound another rope about her waist and a third about her ankles they cut open the back of her blouse and flogged her with the fivetailed flagellum the cheoshim doing it would have cut the flesh from her bones because she yelled curses on him with every blow her voice a hoarse whisper at the last of them but faharmoy stopped him at seven enough he said more would be the death of her we must always give time for repentance he walked around so utsapisha could see him old woman contemplate your sins and repent your frowardness think on the loving care of the iron father he snapped thumb against finger and went pacing off the striker band following him chu ma vay yal chu ma vay yal chu ma vay yal chu ma vay yal chu ma vay yal chu ma vay yal the minute they were out of sight pemmie dashed from a kariam and ran to utsapisha heavily cloaked with the hood drawn up over his head reyna followed more sedately zazi pemmie dug frantically into a sac hanging at her belt zazi say something hunh the grunt was feeble the voice shaky but utsapisha didnt let that stop her tol you t go home went for reyna stead the girl began sawing at the rope around utsapishas waist hold still will you dont want to cut you

honeychild why ah gods i loathe you all after a last look at the old woman he went downstairs to check on her granddaughter chapter death dance late in the afternoon some three months after the prophet returned to bairroa pili faan was kneeling on the damp dark earth under the sequbas in a grove on the east side of the low city with the wild magic drifting about her bubbling frothing gently popping she was using a pointed stick to dig a shallow furrow reaching into the basket beside her for the eye sections shed cut from ganda roots the claws closed on her brain again again every day day on day on day abeyhamal seized her and danced her through the high city drawing the women from the tenements and the towers seducing more and more of them across the wood bridge into the city faan jerked dropped the stick in the furrow her eyes blurred and vanished behind a faceted darkness she opened her mouth wide poured out a deep pulsating hum the wild magic flowed up and swirled about her head like shining silver bees she danced out of the grove and along the lanes and wynds of the low city into the kariams and out again and as she danced girls came from the houses and the groves from the rooftops and the gardens and danced after her mouths wide eyes dark staring into dream seeing with their feet and bodies swaying and humming silverbubble bees swarming about them the honey dancers followed the honeychild across the wood bridge into the high city she saw reyna standing by the bridge watching her angry and helpless if she could have spoken shed have told him mamay were all helpless i did what i had to dont hurt for me it doesnt do any good it only grieves you i wish ah wishes dont count do they go away from here mamay stay safe dont waste what ive done mamay dont hurt for me faharmoy gestured at the door take it down a cheoshim ran up the steps and swung an ax at the center panel before he could get in a second chop the door burst open and a wrinkled little fundarim jigged from foot to foot in a panic shrieking nayo nay what are you doing nayo nay you want to come in come im not stopping you faharmoy snapped thumb against finger and the cheoshim went back to his place you have bees in your house the prophet shouted at the little man i have chenz trees the fundarim said voice shrill and quavery come in heshim prophet see for yourself see that its the truth i make my duty to chumavayal every week i am loyal but i cant get chenza fruits without bees to pollinate the blossoms come see my garden prophet i give a full tithe of the fruit to the camuctarr ask them ask the manasso receiver hell tell you you are a silversmith not a farmer why do you do what belongs to the naostam i only have two trees and i dont sell the fruit it is my pleasure and harms no one certainly not the naostam contumacious take him faharmoy stepped aside as two cheoshim ran up the stairs to the others he said cut down the trees and bum the hive faharmoy watched the band march the fundarim toward the sok circle and the flogging post excuses he cried to the silent houses the empty kariam its always excuses why cant they just say i have done wrong in your sight iron father i repent and throw myself upon your infinite mercy is there so little virtue left in the land he dropped onto his knees in the center of the kariam lifted his face to the smoke smudged sky the red flags of the setting sun closed his ears to the sound ofaxes coming from the house tears of sorrow and adoration streaming unheeded past his ears and onto his ashy robe he began to chant the iron litany the praises of chumavayal the honey dancers circled around the honeychild in the kariams of the biasharim the spiraling towers caught the hum played it back to them immensely amplified the biashar women came out and danced with them mothers with babies in their arms children came boys and girls alike danced with their mothers danced with the honeygiris the hum grew louder and louder rose in a solid column from the kariam they turned into the inner ring road went round the city dancing calling more and more women coming more and more children coming dancing in the ring road abeyhamal forming out of the sunset before them forming out of the hum her fimbo lifted into the sky the ivory point glowing with yellow fire silver bees swarmed about the honeychild zipping round and round in horizontal figure eights trapped within the aura of the honey mother round the city until they reached the first kariam down the kariam to the sok circle as the cheoshim came with the fundarim for flogging abeyhamal shouted a soundless word that shook the air from her translucent shape small lightnings jagged out striking with hot zizzles and a thread of smoke gasping with fear and annoyance the merchants and their customers fled for whatever cover they could find the wildings rose in a roaring spiral and fell among the cheoshim like rain but rain with a sting in every drop batting at the air cursing the cheoshim fled the little fundarim crawled away no one paid any attention to him caught in the maelstrom of the ecstatic trance the women danced round and round the circle trampling everything that lay before them round and round until the sun was fully down and night was on them exhausted and hoarse faan came to herself in the middle of a crowd of unsure rather frightened women klann she muttered looked round uncertainly pinching up a small smile when she saw a friendly face mateesee you here chooee fa that was some stomp she giggled wrinkled her nose we better get out of here wheres dossy dont think you got her this time ailiki chittered impatiently by faans bare feet the mahsar reached up scratched at her ankle gggg she chittered lilci says its time to vacate she held out her arms cuddled the mahsar as the beast leapt into them lets get out of here teesee this place stinks chapter the generals conversion the royal barge moved ponderously along the shrunken river the pilot peering anxiously at leadsmen in boats far ahead they signaled with flags the water depths he translated these and passed orders to the helmsmen at the sweeps wenyarum taleza paced back and forth on the quarterdeck cursing the river the stupidity of the bargemen the heat the dust the stinking water anything he could dredge up most of all he cursed abeyhamal and all her works he couldnt afford to be angry at the amrapake or at faharmoy his idiot sonit was dangerous even to think of blaming them for his discomfort and the precariousness of his position he cursed his wife but under his breath one moment he wanted her to sicken and die the next he was nauseated by the fear that she wouldleaving him the sole credible witness to what was essentially her murder that beating had dug a pit in his future that he saw no way of escaping the sky was white with dust the sun hammered the land the river glittered at him the glare knives in his eyes as the barge crawled down the river he paced the deck angrier every day no place to dump his anger but abeyhamal and the pernicious upstarts who were using her to seize power back and forth back and forth his armor rubbed rashes wherever it touched back and forth back and forth three days after it moved away from the pier at gom corasso the barge tied up at the camuctarr gatt at bairroa pili and the general marched off followed by the elevenman hosta from the corassana royal guard knowing the amrapake sent them to make sure he did what he was told and brought the boy home wenyarum taleza hereditary general of the armies of the amrapake of zam fadogurum brushed past the young acolyte guarding the door and strode into the receiving room of the high kasso of bairroa pili juvalgrim was seated in his audience chair his embroidered robe pulled into graceful folds about his lean body shining black hair with streaks of gray like polished pewter hanging loose and long over his shoulders he was calm and smiling and a perfect maulapam the general hadnt met pilis high kasso before though hed heard things about him that displeased him it was hard to believe them now he saw the man this was his own kind he was facing born if not bred into his own caste juvalgrim lifted a hand its all right fitchon close the door he nodded at wenyarum we are honored heshim general wenyarum taleza swung round glared at the youth with the yellow face and the spiky copper hair close it with you on the other side kuk the acolytes eyes narrowed and a muscle ticked beside his mouth but he bowed backed out and shut the door with a controlled decisive click pollutes hunh wenyarum snorted this being the camuctarr i suppose you have to put up with them had my waywell didnt come here to waste time with compliments and chitchat amrapake sent me to look into this prophet thing we hear rumors of rebellion and the flouting of authority whats your opinion of the boy jo clayton that hes far from a boy your son isnt he or am i misinformed got nothing to do with this but diyo my son well he a prophet for real or has he got knots in his head oh i think theres no doubt of his call chumavayal has walked with him who says so some potzhead with an overheated imagination the high kasso smiled tented his hands touched the tips of his fingers to his chin i have never considered my imagination overheated heshim general yet i have seen chumavayal beside him more than once he stroked his thumb across the curve of the eye i have seen the god before so i know what im talking about the call is real your son has been chosen i need to talk to him verna at the moment hes elsewhere in the city i suppose if you wish i will send novices out hunting him but i have no power to say to him come here go there only the god can tell him that once they know where he is the youngsters could take you to him the general grimaced with every nose in the city poking into my business i see perhaps this will serve he usually comes to us for evensong and a few hours rest evensong must proceed as is prescribed heshim general and without interruption but i can turn his followers from the court and you can speak to him there with no one listening in that will be adequate the general bowed perfunctorily and marched out the general stood outside the pointed arch that gave entry to the fountain court until the hosts eleven had passed through it and established themselves with their backs to the wall then he strode into the court his bootheels ringing on the flags he stopped before his son appalled at what he saw is this what youve made of yourself mal faharmoys eyes were closed his lips moving steadily as he passed his fingers along the bronze chain he finished the prayer draped the chain across his knees and looked up at his father not i but one far greater than i so you say so i say his eyes went blank his hands tightened on the chain then relaxed the general stepped back and stared at the shadow spreading from the wall hovering over and around faharmoy the shadow boiled and solidified blocking out the great spiral tower beyond the court kneeling behind faharmoy chumavayal cupped immense powerful black hands about his chosen word and glared at wenyarum taleza the general stared into those molten red eyes and felt the breath sucked from his body behind him armor clattered and clanked as the hosta flung themselves facedown on the flags his own knees gave under him dropped him onto the stone paving chumavayal he cried out then he too was facedown plottings and fears forgotten everything evaporated before the terror and majesty of the god chapter flight plans on the fourth day after the beating penhari woke sweating with desantro bending over her wiping her face with a cool damp towel haihai heshal so youre with us again desantro set the towel aside and went away she was back a moment later with a mug of clear soup it was too warm and too salty but penhari drank it and felt better ahsan she murmured closed her eyes and slept she woke in the middle of the night her mouth dry her throat sore as she struggled up her bandages shifted cut into her breasts and her nightshift stuck to the salve mixture the shifting uncovered shed been hurt before but never like this never beaten half to death it changed things her changed her i cant stay here her mouth worked and she reached for the water jug that had always been beside the bed a stoneware bottle with a matching mug turned upside down over the neck it was empty desantro must have forgotten to fill it before she left for a breath and a half penhari was furious ill have her she stared at the jug dimly visible in the glimmer from the nightlight ran her tongue over cracking lips abeys sting what am i doing she lifted a shaking hand rested the back of it against her brow a month ago shed have laughed given the maid in charge a short scold and let the thing drop she got to her feet took the jug down the hall to the water room and filled it at the tap then gulped down a mugful of the lukewarm water filled the mug again drank half and splashed the rest across her face back in the bedroom she sat on the bed scowling at the doorwindows that opened into her garden famtoche had enjoyed the beating and hed be back given half an excuse hed be back and after a while he wouldnt need an excuse i cant stay here she said aloud i cant face this again i cant she got to her feet pulled on the old linen robe shed been wearing for days she could smell herself on the folds of the cloth something that she found comforting and at the same time disgusting slavestink she blinked then smiled as she tied the belt sisters under the skin slave and mistress the smell of their sweat much the same she moved restlessly about the room lighting lamps opening closets pulling out bureau drawers tipping back the lids to chests she ran her hands along the hanging clothing picked up things set them down again if she did leave this place she had no idea what to take carrying one of the lamps she wandered into the other parts of the suite the several sitting rooms the sewing room dressing room water room the small library she lifted the lamp as high as she could and stared half the scrolls were gone others were on the floor torn dirty mixed with shards of pottery from the holders books were thrown about stamped on soaked with urine the stench was appalling everything she cried theyve stripped me of everything pain forgotten in her rage she swung round and went storming through the rooms to the door into the falmatarrs common hall a cheoshim one of the royal guard stood slowly and turned to face her with barely concealed insolence barring her way with his lance go back to bed falmaree she shut the door set the lamp with careful precision on the cardtable built into the jamb and stood hugging her arms tight across her breast as sobs of rage and frustration shook her body honey mother defend me she cried help me help slowly the shudders subsided she rubbed her hand across her eyes clawed up the hem of her robe and wiped her nose her cheeks sleep i cant sleep she took up the lamp again and wandered aimlessly through the suite fetching up in the largest of the sitting rooms the one where famtoche had beaten her her blood was wiped off the floor but drops of it were splattered about on the furniture she scratched a fingernail across a crusted spot on the back of a chair desantro could tend plants but she didnt know much about cleaning she put the lamp on a table and settled in the bloody chair easing back until she was as comfortable as she was going to get lifting her feet onto a rest i cant stay here she repeated not in the falmatarr not in gom corasso where could she go how could she get away im ignorant worse than a slave lamentably dangerously ignorant if she tried to leave she wouldnt get two steps before she was dragged back she grimaced at the humiliation of that ignominious return the fear of being beaten again i never understood why slaves seemed so stupid and spiritless its pain crude brute pain they cant bring themselves to face again ignorant she had no idea how the city was laid out not a glimmer where she could hide if she did manage to get away from the falmatarr she touched the long gray hair tangled and hanging loose over her shoulders i cant even do my own hair i have lived fiftytwo years she said to the ghostly shape mirrored in the window across the room i can read and write im not stupid ive survived rape and politics sickness and childbirth lust and indifference i know the essays of chaldeysir the treatises on government by the quiambo kuigiza and his students the philosophies of the honey poet yarrai i have read history and studied art and i am more ignorant certainly more helpless than desantro who probably cant read a word shes come from the ends of the earth and ive never been outside the walls of this city barely outside the walls of this one building her feet were just at the edge of the circle of light she wiggled her toes and sighed i am going she said aloud whatever happens out there it will happen by my choice at last by my own choice desantro penhari called out when she heard the sound of sweeping come here i need you desantro came slowly into the room her hair tied in a kerchief a torn dustrobe over her dress chambermassal says i havta get the dust up tday heshal you can go back to that in a moment i want you to cut my hair desantro blinked backed up a step id make a mess heshal i dont care as long as its a short mess think of it as pruning that startled a bark of laughter out of desantro you want me to fetch the pruning shears heshal i dont believe we need go that far to validate a metaphor the scissors in my sewing box should be adequate penhari sat sideways on the garden longchair scowling at the grass famtoche had even driven the bees from the garden without them itd turned sour for her but desantro wouldnt do the cutting inside desantro drew the comb down through the thick oily gray hair we really should wash it first i think just cut till its even with my earlobes haihai and what if i cut them off you can sew them back on saa thatd be a thing she cut carefully and slowly her face brooding as she worked flicking the shears so the long long strands of hair fell around penhari onto the chair or onto the grass when she was finished she gathered every strand took the mass of gray to the nearest flowerbed and used a spoon from the lunch tray to dig a hole and bury it penhari shook her head relishing how light and cool it felt how naked she blinked at desantro why are you doing that desantro stood used the toe of her worn sandal to press the earth down about the bush y want to be careful with things that come off you she said f you have enemies they can use em gainst you witches she said they tell me there be witches here though i havna seen any myself witches hush what they mean is abeyhamals followers its an excuse for a burning theres no magic in the land except in idiots heads i dunno heshal no one talks to me bout that kind of thing desantro set her hands on her hips tilted her head better an i thought you look younger even penhari burst out laughing vema vema desantro one favor deserves another pour yourself some lemonade and sit a moment desantro hesitated penhari waved impatiently at the pitcher im still someone woman when desantro had settled to the grass muttering shed be more comfortable with ground under her penhari pulled her legs up and lay back in the chair tell me about your home desa what it was like how you lived desantro sipped at the lemonade set the glass down beside her long time gone she said i dont think about those days much better not she pulled a blade of grass free nibbled at the greenishwhite stem the mountains in whenapoyr theyd make those she flipped a hand at the jinocaburs whose pale blue tips they could just see above the garden walls look like gnat bites twas cold in the winter snow higher than the roofs always someun died from the cold old uns mostly or babes born too soon in the year it cd get so quiet you heard y hair growing the trees ah the trees she pulled another blade of grass a longer one stretched it vertically between thumbs pressed together and blew producing a harsh plaintive sound penhari rubbed her back cautiously against the chair the healing wounds were getting itchy what happened howd you come to be here hmm the usual way whenapoyr is next to hraney and hennermen were always raiding us still are i spose they came with the thaw killed them they dint want most a my folks had a brother n a younger sister took them an me dumped us in a boat sold us i

went blank oh no heshal i am content penhari sighed you dont think im going to run to the chambermassal do you and tell him get out the whip ive got an uppity slave plotting escape desantro pulled another blade of grass and began splitting it into hairline strips never trust a mal she muttered what the first fadogur i learned i dont understand penhari pushed up and stared at desantro what are you talking about youll be angry penhari had to strain to hear the murmured words then whats your word worth what i say it is have you ever heard else desantro rubbed green off her fingers after a minute she shrugged maulapam keep promises they make to other castes if they wanna and forget em if they dont mostly they forget their word dont count less its mal to mal slaves and wascra know t

leaving running away i need you if youll come is there anything anyone youd miss desantro cupped one hand in the other rubbed the sides of her thumbs together for a long moment she stared at penhari then she looked past her at the blue peaks sketched against the bluewhite sky her hands falling apart to rest on her thighs nayo nothing she said slowly ive forty years heshal ive birthed six children all of em taken from me soons they were weaned two boys fostered at camuctarr four girls with naostam families i dont know where any of them are now anyway they wouldna know me from the dog sometimes slave women are let keep their kids but never if they belong to maulapam like me s a good thing a slaves kids arent slaves too fadogur is better nor some places i cd e been took to but its hard losing a babe from the breast frowning slightly penhari watched the womans eyes go soft and wistful suddenly alienated from her by more than caste her own son had been born in terrible tearing pain had cost her the ability to have more childrenwhich she did not at all regret shed loathed faharmoy from the first day of morning sickness almost as much as she loathed the husband her father and brother had forced on her almost as much she loathed them both her father and her brother desantros face went hard why she said give me a reason i should risk the stranglers cord for you consider this what happens if im gone and youre here what happens if i go tell chambermassal what youre getting up to vema youve matched me there consider this then do you want to grow old here in the falmatarr youve

beaten also but no doubt ill live through it ah dont take this wrong heshal but i want to see the coin before i do the deed vema agreed you do get out of the falmatarr dont you you dont know penhari watched a single butterfly flit from bloom to bloom for years she said slowly i have refrained from mmm curiosity it has been my best defense i i dont intend to explain that assume i know nothing about what happens outside these rooms you wont miss truth by much desantro scratched at her nose verna les see theres a chumavayal festa every couple months the primakass he makes the rule slaves get out like the rest everybody has to follow it even the maulapam penhari smiled at her even the maulapam desantro slanted a glance at penhari her mouth twitched into a quick grin so you get out and desantro wriggled around until she was squatting on her heels hunched forward knees out with her forearms resting on her thighs we sposed to do the worship thing but all y got to do is sho y face then scat for the dancing and all that she twisted her mouth into a halfpout then clicked her tongue against her teeth the gates are left open till moonset which means we can get outside the walls and have some real fun most everybody go down beach dig clams and hunt the shallows for chitz an buagosh an whatever else we cn net an we dump them in pots and boil em an theres homebrew an you name it for drinking an bhagg for smoking an whats y pleasure an theres fires an someones got erhu or gitter or horns or sompn starts playing when they feels like it an maybe one or two starts dancing and then theres more dancing she jumped to her feet started stamping and clapping her hands after a few breaths she began singing in her home tongue then dancing to her own singing she had a strong contralto voice rough but not unpleasant sweat glistened on her face and arms her body moved with a powerful vigor penhari watched with enjoyment and angeranger at the constraints of her caste and at herself for her years of complacent acquiescence werent for famtoche and his flagellum id be a mole all my life blind and burrowing she laughed aloud as desantro whipped the kerchief off her head and wiped at her face without missing a beat of her swaying stamping dance or a syllable of her song corrupting the slaves too dear sister famtoche banddah lounged in the doorwindow one arm hanging the other curled about his belt his black eyes were empty as the windows his smile a grimace desantros face went blank and she dropped to her stomach stretched out flat on the grass her hands in front of her palms pressed together penhari turned slowly swinging her feet off the longchair pushing herself up so she was standing between famtoche and the slave what do you want brother when i hear my sister is ill how can i stay away easily dear brother what do you want he tapped his fingers against the leather of the belt his eyes softened and he smiled so sweetly she knew he was remembering and as the silence stretched on knew he was making sure she understood the images he was seeing she kept her face impassive shed had years of practice he straightened up word came to me you tried to leave your suite last night dont he stepped back into the room over his shoulder he said or well have another lesson penhari stood slumped her hands clenched an arm came around her shoulders with that gentleness of touch that always surprised her desantro hugged her then led her to the longchair haihai dont you fuss youself heshal rest y now while i finish the sweeping and see what notions i en dig up in the doorwindow she turned her face alive with laughter one thing still on heshal i wanna see coin before i do aught chapter the god on her shoulders a graybrown beast trotting beside her the honeychild

kariams but micabright wings like frozen light wild magic grew wings that vibrated and sang so high a note the sound pierced the ears ow ooo oum owww ooo ahhh um in convoluted double loops they danced filling the kariams crossing the inner ring road to the towers of the cheoshim wild magic dipped and rose undulating with the rise and fall of the humming howl ow ooo oum owww ooo aiihh um they circled a cheoshim tower stomping and weaving in time with the soundhundreds of women moving together ecstatic and terrible a maelstrom of magic force pressing against the tower wild magic merged into a fog that flowed in silvergray streamers along the lines of power windows shattered and women came out to join the dance the air shivered mica wings splintered the sunlight swept away honeychild honey beast honey dancers ran after them the women ran after them the wild magic coursed with them ow ooo oum owww ooo ahhh um another tower windows shattered men swarmed out and tried to beat the

along a kariam on the east side the dancers from the low city revolving in complex spirals about her more than a thousand ecstatic women dancing behind her maenads seized by their god wild magic came together and clustered about the honeychild like a veil of silver toile fluttering in unfelt winds ow ooo oum owww ooo ahhh um the prophet heard the humming howl but ignored it he marched over the meager piles of merchandise without bothering where he put his feet the cheoshim following him elbowed merchants and buyers alike out of their way nothing mattered but the lessoning and the purifying of the city and with it the land chu ma vay yal chu ma vay yal ailiki echoing her steps faan danced into the sok circle turning and swaying in lazy eights veiled and revealed veiled and revealed while the honey dancers split and spun around the edges of the circle the hordes of women dividing and dancing after then meeting behind the striker band on the far side of the circle swirling in a double whirl around and aroundan engine of power pouring into the honey mothers hands ow ooo oum owww ooo ahhh um the prophet spread his arms and glared at her yellow treez he cried begone rivers of red fire burst from his palms and roared at the honeychild wild magic became a thousand wings brushed and blew the fire harmlessly into the sky faan burned gold and white lightning leapt from her fingers

across the sok circle for every man four women died and another four were badly hurt but there were hundreds of women there in the center of the charnel ground the prophet and faan faced each other one burning red one burning gold abruptly the light vanished from both wild magic hovered in a fog about faan dulled and diminished the prophet looked drained and old though hed lost none of his loathing for faan and all she represented begone habatrize he croaked at her filth faan swept her eyes along his body feet to head then laughed a harsh bitter sound talk about filth louse breeder when was your last bath good thing im downwind or ri be upchucking my lunch she turned her back on him and sashayed off wiggling her behind at him with mocking exaggeration the suddenly sobered women from the towers left the dead behind and crept back into their apartments many of them took a last look around packed up what they could carry and went trudging across the wood bridge to the low city the prophet stomped angrily down a kariam heading for the outer ring road and jiko sagrada with ailiki trotting beside her brushing against her now and then faan limped away from the sok circle battered and exhausted cursing under her breath abeyhamal and all her works tbars slipped unheeded down her face all those women dead burnt heads crushed bodies slashed and broken those cheoshim boys clawed into bloody shreds all because these cursed gods were playing their nauseating games and using people as game pieces breaking them discarding them it was so wasteful so useless fa reyna waved the other salagaum on toward the sok and came running across the kariam honey faan tried to smile wiped at her streaky face grads she said slaughter diyo god business his mouth twisted we kept a lookout

some tea or something at least you can wash your face faan trudged in silence for several minutes glancing now and then at reyna he looked a lot older gaunt and graying his hair cut shorter shoulder length now instead of halfway down his back but his eyes were clear and he moved with the easy looseness of good health past few days she said the sudden smile that lit his face made her feel warm and happy brought back days shed thought were gone forever we keep a step or two ahead of the shinda prefecture its a game of hummer stools we move and they pounce two seats back he made a face reached over and took her hand nobody wants the salagaum these days its good to see you fa i swear youve grown two inches on me she squeezed the hand ive missed you mamay he chuckled i know hon even the shouting matches hmm diyo mamay i was an idiot i wish i tried to talk her into letting you come across the river down here he tugged her into a wynd began weaving between tenements at the inner edge of the edge dont mind it fa theres too much that needs doing over here you could get killed so could you hon gods diyo in here honey he opened a shaky stick gate at the back of a threestory tenement took her across the sunbaked stretch of earth that had once been a garden unlocked the kitchen door and led her inside a slender salagaum with the spiky coarse hair of the cheoshim twarra came with quick light steps into the kitchen snapped fingers in a greeting to faan who was sitting at a wobbly table sipping tea from a mug he shook his head when reyna raised an eyebrow we had to give grace to half a dozen women he said couldnt move them theyd fall apart in our hands anyone could crawl was gone rest were dead the striker band well looked like animals had got at them nasty reyna emptied the pot into a mug handed it to twarra then hitched a hip on the wash ledge any trouble iwarra gulped at the strong tea shook his head when his mouth was clear he said nayo rey if theres anyone watching he didnt stick nose out dawa took tothers to pick up handcarts and they went on to stash figured itd be safer to haul sacks now striker band and shinda guards not so apt to be nosing about reyna and dawa thammir and furrah pushed the handcarts onto the approach dawa and the others settled down to guard them while reyna took faan aside to talk to her mamay i she broke off lunged against him as shed done so many times before wrapping her arms around him and holding tight while she sobbed and shuddered her anguish brealdng suddenly through the weary numbness that had held until now he said nothing just held her close smoothing a shaking hand down and down her tangled hair until the sobbing faded and she lay against him limp with release then he sighed took the end of his sleeve and wiped her face how many times he murmured she managed a watery smile count the times ive made an idiot of myself honey tell the bitch god to go jump nothings worth this she caught hold of his hands but moved away from him stood holding them and shaking her head stubborn as a waterpig arent you diyo you should know by now mamay ill keep watching honey dont where do you think you learned that stubbornness tchi kee ah well she pulled loose twill have someone for the carts fast as she can manage be careful mamay when she reached the middle of the bridge faan waved to reyna and the salagaum then started trotting for the low city she was exhausted but she didnt want to keep the salagaum in the open any longer than she had to chapter fiddling the escape desantro squatted beside the longchair scratched at her nose first on where we going i thought down the river to bairroa pili penhari swept a hand along her body you see what youve got to work with desa im neither young enough nor insane enough to try crossing the mountains desantros mouth twisted into something half a smile and half a grimace jumps to mind that we need time to get far nough so they cant just put thumb out and squash us do you know anything about boats not many boats on skislope desantro pulled a blade of grass loose looked at the withered stem and tossed it away so we buy us a sailor afore we start she tilted her head looked sideways at penhari need coin for him not gold nayo nayo gold gets em greedy just the shine a it silver what i want maybe thirty fifty sompn like that vema i can arrange that be tricky slaves ant sposed to have anything to do with boat but you can do it desantro lifted a sturdy callused hand spread fingers and thumb rocked them back and forth as if to say so so ask me no

anyone notice im not back later an that when they find out you gone she slapped her handi against her side cn do t vema vema we can do it penhari swung her feet off the longchair and watched desantro go rushing out a quarter centurys caution washed away how easily she forgets trusts me or is she simply playing me as ive been trying to manipulate her she got to her feet and began moving about the garden nipping away dead blooms dying leaves casting the detritus on the grass behind her time to consider her resources there were the jewels wenyarum kept giving her at the moment there was no way to turn these into coin no jeweler would buy so much as a silver ring from a slave so she couldnt send a piece out with desantro the jewelry would be useful but only after she got away from here she straightened frowned at the withered brown flowerhead she was holding if i can keep the things from being stolen desantros tales of the street and countryside were lesson enough about the difficulties travelers faced men and women alike ill have to sew hiding places in my skirts and tunics put in padding to keep the shapes hidden she rubbed plant juices from her fingers glanced at the sun not now tonight i dont want anyone walking in on me while im doingit not even desantro particularly not desantro i may be ignorant but im not foolish she made a face at the flowerhead tossed it aside not all the time anyway there was her nameday gold wenyarum made sure that custom was kept up each nameday one broad millefur for every year of her life three months ago famtoche had presented her with fiftytwo millefurs she had no illusions about wenyarum taleza most of the hoard had probably gone on habatrizes and uniformsand on the jewelry he pressed on her conscience money no doubt and bragging rights but there should be something left the private passage between their bedrooms must be thick with dust and spiders by now he was the only one to use it shed never had the least desire to go to him but hed showed her the trick of the panels and she remembered she wouldnt have to go into the outer halls and face that sneering guard wonder if famtoche set a guard on wenyarums suite hmm i can send desantro there tomorrow to fetch what considering the condition of my library a scroll what does he have never mind ill think of something later if theres no guard then thats how i get out penhari held the lamp close to the panels on the right side of her bed shoulder diyo shoulder high him not me the panels were carved with fertility signs embarrassing even now when she was looking closely at them for the first time in years she snorted as she remembered the disgust she felt when he showed her what to move one half turn so what was hanging is now standing high abeys sting the minds of these men something clunked the panel opened a crack groaning as it moved she pushed at it and with diffi culty got it wide enough to let her move the lamp into the stifling darkness beyond spiders tchah she set the lamp on the bedtable and went for the broom desantro had taken to leaving in the water room so she wouldnt have to haul it back and forth each day the panel in wenyanims bedroom cracked open penhan froze as she heard voices and other sounds she placed the broom carefully in the corner between wall and paneling blew the lamp out set it down and leaned against the crack listening the voices were muffled a man and a woman not in the bedroom but in one of the rooms beyond she couldnt make out the words but she didnt really need to she caught hold of the panel tried to ease it farther open winced as it groaned whas zat a woman speaking the mans voice rumbled impatience sharpening a few of the syllables so she could hear them but she still couldnt make out what he was saying come from in here the woman sounded closer penhari held her breath and waited rats thats all come on you cant go in there that jeggers nose could sniff a leaky keups like you five days gone and fifty miles off chambermassal hunh talking about rats nay mice overrunning the place the minute the cats away how he dares wenyarum would skin him screaming if he knew i swear i heard somethi g cant have no one comes here but that yatz dont i dont like inhere if he found us klann hlakki hes down in pili groveling around in dung and ashes with his ass in the air tonguing ol prophets filthy feet you dont knooow sure i do comma heeer bebesha ahhh soft soft dont i dont like it here i wanna go penhari grimace at the sound of scuffling glass breaking then a slap and the patter of feet the slam of a door the chambermassal cursed stomped out was back before penhari could get to her feet she heard the clinic and clatter of the glass then the brisk rasp of a scrub brush a moment later the door slammed again she waited a long dreary time before she shoved at the panel again after lighting the lamp at the nightglow she went cautiously into the next room wrinkled her nose at the stink of brandy fool when the general got back she frowned if he came back she set the lamp on the desk went round it to inspect the elaborate carvings of the paneled wall this is harder not so many cues where was it where was he always brought her in here and had her take the gold from famtoches mizam made her stow it in the cavity diyo got it she pressed the bosses smiled as a small square of ironfaced wood sprang at her the opening was a foot square and an arms length deep she began taking the canvas bags from the stash setting them on the desk not altogether surprised to find some of them much lighter than they should have been she emptied the stash began going through the bags at least half of them were plumped out with crumpled paper there to make a show she tossed these back inside the hole put the others in the shoulderbag shed cobbled together from a pillow sham and some strapping penhari looked at the piles of coin scattered about the bed not much gold left in the mix mostly silver and copper abey be blessed the last sack still had its fiftytwo gold pieces intact the general hadnt had time to raid that one how am i going to work this im going to have to trust her thats all she counted out the fifty silver cems for the boatman and his boat set that aside counted a hundred more of the broad silver coins added two gold millefurs tied them up in a bag they were desantros fee she took the rest back to the shamsack and closed the panel on it it was as safe there as in her jewelry box safer probably she dropped on the bed rubbed her hand across her face then grimaced at the streaks of black dust and sweat bath then work on the clothing get the jewels tucked away i can sleep in the daytime five days it sounded like forever when desantro said it abeys sting im going to have to work my fingers off about an hour after sundown on the vungian festa on the night of the moondark a tall bent old woman dressed in coarse gray trudged out of the fahnatarr behind another younger slave hsst desantro tugged at penharis sleeve slow down she whispered tisnt a race keep y head down you forgetting everything penhari nodded her enveloping cloak shifting against her shoulders as her head bobbed she pulled the edges together again over the worn blouse and skirt desantro had found for her she was stifling in these layers of clothing weighed down by everything she had stowed about her body and she was sweating from excitement and an unfocused terror her stomach knotting and burning the streets they hurried along were canyons between straight black walls of the fundarim and naostam tow ers warrens that housed the corasso poor packed together in uneasy masses the noise from the towers was partially muffled by the stone but it fell on them like clubs as they went past is the city always this noisy penhari murmured folk been moving off land cant crop it without water we turn here desantro tugged penhari down a smaller side street dont want to get mixed with crowd at sok circle only place they cn go is with their kin so theres two three times as many bodies shoved in there thats a rowdy crowd at the circle i mean during festal penhari tugged the frayed veil so she could see through the uneven eyeholes desantro sounded wistful as if shed like to be there plunged into the middle of that noise and motion she followed desantro through turn after turn sweat streaming off her in the beginning she hadnt felt the weight of what she was carrying gold coins packed into straps and wound around her legs jewelry and more coins sewed into a thickly padded underskirt the rolls of clothing and other items wrapped around her body bulking out her lean maulapam form but after half an hour of walking she was trembling and panting hobbling along moving by will alone her knees creaking and her feet aching all those years of sitting about with my feet up theyre going to kill me yet desantro stopped in the inky shadow at the side of a shuttered shop that fronted on gate street hang on a moment she murmured she gave penhari a quick lookover clicked her tongue you all right ill last dont worry why are we stopping therere guards at the gate they dont mess with people much but y never know nobody coming long gate street right now we shd wait till theres a bunch going out hitch onto it thats the safest way verna penhari sighed eased her shoulders against the wall how long desantro listened hear that thats a big mob coming we gotta keep up with em can y do it ill do what i have to brave words i hope theyre not whistling at the moon abeys sting if h fall on my face they left the side street and tagged after a laughing dancing teasing mob of young newlymade fundarim journeymen and a sprinkling of young women who were veiled after a fashion as a concession to the new rules all of them noisily celebrating the the elevation of two of their members the mob reveled through the gate exchanging garbled shouts with guards leaning from the vigil windows of their turrets no one noticed the bulky gray figures hurrying along at the tail of that parade desantro plunged into the fringe a maze of mud and stone houses plastered like muddauber nests on the waste land between the black basalt walls and the widening ring of mud at the edge of the lakethatneverfails there were no straight streets only narrow eccentrically wandering wynds between the shapeless structures penhari labored behind her as long as she could then collapsed against a crumbling mud wall she tugged the veil off let it drop beside her and gulped in mouthful after mouthful of the hot stinking air whining and rasping spots wheeling and vibrating before her eyes desantro came rushing back stood over her said something penhari couldnt make out what she was saying the blood was too loud in her ears she managed to lift a hand palm out its ju breath whistled out and her struggling lungs sucked in more ju hum ju st haaaaa nee eed huuu catch banana breath desantro thrust a muscular shoulder under penharis arm pulled her away from the wall and eased her down so she was sitting on the sunbaked soil whew that stuff must weigh a ton y shoulda said something penhari rolled her head back and forth tried to smile she lifted an arm that seemed to have turned to lead tried to wipe away the sweat that was dripping into her eyes desantro clicked tongue against teeth felt around for the veil penhari had discarded she shook the dust off it wiped gently at the older womans face next time she said dont be such an idiot if you faint on me whatn jannan am i sposed to do ve ha ma good you sit there a minute make believe you a poor ol fat woman with no place t go here she wrung out the ragged veil dropped it over penharis head way it goes y have t have this think poor if y can think i got nothing to lose so i dont give a jegg what anyone do theres a jugshop a couple wynds over im gonna get you some mulimuli thatll have y on y feet and dancing she tapped penhari on the shoulder and went trotting off penhari sat in the noisome dark the noises of life loud and all around her unseen but very much there murmurs laughter shouts screams howls and yowls she was getting frightened sitting there alone and out in the open desantro said be calm dont give in t being afraid being afraids dangerous but this was so strange so unlike anything shed ever experienced she twitched at every sound and the smell was terrible appalling nauseating how people could live in this kind of squalor was something she couldnt understand it wouldnt take all that much effort to sweep away the garbage rotting in piles around her why didnt someone just do it she cringed from the thought of what she was sitting on what this dirt beneath her was made of this hard crusty soil with not even a gesture at paving the tremors in her arms and legs were smoothing out and her breathing was steadying she pulled her legs up and rested her head on arms she folded across her knees watching desantro dance that day had wakened in her the sense that there was an immense ocean of life lapping against the walls of the falmatarr but never coming inside now suddenly she was plunged into that life and finding it was one thing to dream of fleeing to freedom but something else entirely to sit in the filth of this wynd with a stitch in her side and the shakes in every limb i could go back i could knock on the door and show my face and this would all be over hot bath iced lemonade abeys sting id grovel for a drink right now she closed her eyes and mentally wallowed in the comforts of her old life reality catching up with me what a choice famtoches fists or this kind of thing for the rest of my life she lifted her head no she said aloud and startled a squat old woman picking her way along the wynd dragging a canvas sack behind her gray hair straggling about a greasy lined faced hardly visible in the darkness hands in knottedstring mitts the old woman glanced briefly at her dismissed her and went on down the wynd no penhari whispered to herself no i wont end like you i refuse the possibility there must be some way she moved her head back rested it against the wall settling herself to wait here drink this anything happen while i was gone old woman two cats and a drunk who spat at me by luck he missed penhari took a mouthful of the mulimuli sputtered with shock some of it went down her front the rest down her gullet burning as it dropped gah what foul koj people actually drink this slop you sposed to toss it down so it hits you belly before y taste it cm on zazi drink some more itll put stiffening in y bones we gotta get to boat or hell take off without us penhari tugged the veil tighter against her face so she could see through the eyeholes a boat swinging lazily at the end of the stubby pier had a single mast with a frayed sail hanging in messy folds over the boom sitting on a bitt kicking bare heels against it a short skinny naostam was watching them desantro left her hobbling along the planks and charged down the pier to confront the man where your jeggin water skins hanh she jabbed an accusing finger at the anonymous clutter in the bottom of the boat you been paid fr it we jannin ant gonna drink mud his eyes shifted under a naostams heavy brow ridge the yellowed whites gleaming intermittently as they moved with a silent insolence embedded in an exaggerated physical competence he got to his feet bent caught hold of a rope tied to a cleat on the bitt and lifted the muscles in his bare arm shifting like skinny snakes beneath his copper hide three dripping water skins rose from the lake he held them up with one hand yanked the knot loose then lowered the skins into the boat he swung over the edge went down a few steps of the slimy ladder and jumped lightly into the boat landing so evenly balanced that it hardly rocked he leaned over hooked a hand over the lowest rung and pulled the boat tight against the the ladder and stood there waiting for them to climb down or go away whichever pleased them desantro snorted but she didnt comment zazi im going first so i cn give you a hand hang onto the ladder till him and i steady you well get y in dont worry penhari leaned on the bitt and watched her go down the ladder neatly and easily despite the gear she was carrying the food and more clothing and her fee in coin and no doubt other things she liberated from the falmatarr she swung into the boat with an ease that almost matched the mans slapped his shoulder and pointed up at penhari time to move honey mother defend me she lowered herself to hands and knees reached backward with one foot until she could feel the rung grunting and fumbling about she finally got both feet on the ladder and started clumsily down it the rungs were slimy with moss and smashed crawlers she loathed having to touch them but she told herself i can do whatever has to be done she said it under her breath several times as she lowered herself but never fully believed it even when she felt hands on her steadying her taking part of her weight and in the end lifting her bodily into the boat getting her seated on a folded square of canvas placed a few inches before the mast desantro knelt beside penhari wiping her hands with a damp cloth fussing over her like a mother with a sickly child she looked across the older womans shoulder popped out her breath in an impatient tssht the naostam sat by the steering oar watching stolidly he might have been carved from red sidawood except for the occasional glimmer from his eyes what y waiting for hahlaz get the sail up les get going huh women he said and spat over the side his voice was reedy with as much modulation as there was expression in his face gi penter a jerk she come loose an siddown y fall in it yr problem been paid fr pili not fr swanin about the night was calm and hot the boat zagged across the northern end of the lakethatneverfails catching the vagrant breezes and using the fugitive currents to work toward the twin black towers that marked the beginning of the river penhari leaned against the mast feeling every shimmy and twist of the boat through her spine she was deeply relaxed now a heap of couscous without a bone in view but she wasnt sleepyher mind cycled around and around all the thoughts that had passed through her head from the moment she surfaced after the beating leapt from that to what lay ahead compulsive speculation insecurely based on stories from her scrolls and the few books shed managed to get her hands on leapt back to the pain and fear she was escaping from past and future equally futile over and over until she rebelled against treading the same ruts again and began noticing what was happening around her her body was shifting with the boat ballasted by the gold tilting one way then another as the boom slammed side to side behind her the sail bellying out sinking popping out again at first she didnt understand this toing and froing but she had the habit of study so she watched carefully what the man was doing and considered the results of those actions what wind there was came into her face not from behind wind out of the eastyet they were moving into the east there had to be a reason she listened to the sounds the sail made looked over her shoulder at it considered the way hahlaz shifted the angle of the boom how he turned the ship and sent the boom crashing to the other side how they kept gliding for ward the black wardtowers getting closer and closer after an hour of this she had some dnderstanding of the principles involved along with an itch in her palms to take hold of the rudder and that rope and do it herself it was frustrating sitting there letting herself be carried along by someone elses skill but what else have i done all my life let my maids coddle me the kassians guide my thinking desantro carry me now that man who despises both of us abeys sting fiftytwo years and im still in the egg desantro was sitting on the other side of the mast watching hahlaz turning occasionally to see what was happening in front of them what about those she swung her arm her finger sweeping from tower to tower trouble naah nobody home jeggin guards like soft livin ant gonna fry nu hms off way out here good she settled back zazi how you doing not bad im starting to enjoy this desantro laughed chooee swanning ma pen hari woke cramped and stiff with her bladder distended an ache throbbing over her ears her tongue a dead mouse in her mouth mulimuli never again the boat was moving slowly around a long shallow curve the land on both sides of the river flat and dull no green just shades of brown even the few trees that grew on the banks were half dead the remaining leaves thickskinned and gray with dust hanging limply from dessicated petioles the sun was molten and red only halfway up the peaks of the kondunis like jagged black teeth across the disk but the day was already so hot and dry she could feel cracks opening in her skin she eased out of the slump moving carefully so she wouldnt wet herself desa she croaked water zazi desantro cleared her throat shifted enough to put a gulp in the smooth glide of the boat water i need to get rid of desantro clicked her tongue shifted again hahlaz hai gnuh that bunch trees cd y make it pull in over there thought you in a hurry hurrys over hai turn this thing old fish landing round next bend trees n a shack desantro snorted gotcha do it hahlaz squatted by a ring of smokeblackened stones shaving curls off a piece of the shacks door penhari was so stiff she could barely walk shed been heaved out of the boat like a bale of cloth and now she had to lean on desantros arm or she couldnt have put one foot in front of the other when they were behind the shack she stopped this is enough help me out of these windings will you rm about to add heatstroke to everything else desantro took the cloak snapped it out flat on the ground then started unwinding the spare clothing from under the blouse as the wandering breeze stirred over her sweaty skin penhari sighed with pleasure abey its almost worth it just for this desantro chuckled helped penhari out of the underskirt she didnt comment at the weight just dropped it on the rest of the pile she rolled the cloak and its contents into a neat bundle set it near the corner of the shack can you wait a minute more if i have to we need some dry leaves for wiping i know you used to water and towels zazi but you roughing it now she went hurrying off into the scatter of trees penhari leaned cautiously against the wall it creaked but it held there was a touch of satisfaction in desantros voice talk about enjoying this should i worry nayo shes a kind creature she wouldnt do me harm discomfort doesnt count or humiliation getting her own back or a piece of it wouldnt i too if i were her oh jannam do i ache hurry up woman i dont think i can hold it any longer desantro came hurrying out of the trees her hands full of decaying leaves here she said when she reached penhari you crumple them like this make a wad outta them she grinned her face flushed i learned that when i was hardly hatched you do your thing and ill go see what hahlaz has got up to penhari squatted and let go feeling more pleasure as the urine hissed than shed ever got from sex she followed instructions as best she could crumpled the leaves together but either she did something wrong or fadogur trees werent like those in whenapoyr the leaves broke into fragments that clung and started scratching her and absorbed nothing she used the ragged veil to finish the job and flung it away she hated the thing anyway she stretched groaned as her muscles protested opened and shut her hands shook herself all that padding and weight off her body made her feel almost a girl again she danced a few steps the coarse gray skirt flaring out from her long thin legs shifted into the moves desantro showed her in the garden that day stamping and kicking and swinging in circles diyo diyo i can do it i can do this i can i can diyo di i can do it chuckling and breathless she scooped up the bundle grunting at the weight of it and started round the shack hahlaz was adding a few twigs to the small fire hissing beneath a battered copper pot while desantro slapped the stopple back in the spout of one of the water skins as she bent with an easy shift of her body to set the depleted skin beside the others she smiled at penhari feeling better hahlaz looked up froze a second later he was on his feet running at penhari with his knife out shrieking maaaaaal desantro gasped and dropped to one knee caught up a stone from the ring about the fire flung it with hard accuracy at his head it hit him behind the ear with a dull thump he fell sprawled hands coming open knife dropping hilt down beside him penhari stood clutching the bundle to her middle her mouth open too startled to be afraid desantro scrambled to her feet ran the few steps to the unconscious man she knelt beside him felt under his chin swore in her home tongue looked up the jeggers still alive penhari licked her lips why come at you desantro shifted her position pulled her skirt closer to her legs face it hesla mals ant the favorite people outside the sirmalas she grunted with satisfaction as she saw the knife no doubt he had his reasons she wound a hand in hah lazs hair jerked his head up and away from her and cut his throat desa desantro wiped the knife on his shirt set it down away from the body im done with being slave she said she jumped to her feet couldnt trust him after this hed a killed you and sold me first chance he got put that down and come over here help me carry him i dont penhari gazed in bewilderment at the bundle she was clutching to her middle i move ass woman i owe y something i coont be getting loose without the coin but i swear if you dont get y tail over here and grab those ankles im outta this you cn do what y want they carried the body into the middle of the grove heaped leaves over it desantro left immediately but penhari stood beside the mound for several moments trying to work out a way of living with what had happened the last remnants of the indifference and withdrawal shed cultivated for decades were wiped away shed faced shock after shock the beating the death of her handmaids and the kassian who was her closest friend the exhaustion the alternating terror and exhilaration of the escape now this slaughterwith her the trigger that brought it on she turned hastily away leaned against a tree and vomited up a few spoonfuls of yellow bile then shuddered with dry heaves desantro was squatting beside the fire stirring something in the pot she looked up as penhari came round the shack you all right not happy but surviving what are you doing making tucker tea the kind that crawls out the pot if y ant careful i cut bread and cheese s over there she nodded toward a board laid a short distance off you better eat something long day ahead of us eat penhari shuddered desantros face went hard her eyes glittered diyo eat my mother was raped and murdered before face i ate long as i stayed alive i knew some day henriermen would die you told me i can do what i havta well do t penhari pulled a hand across her face tsah i was thinking heroics desa eating didnt come to mind nayo nay she fluttered a hand at desantro give me time ive spent years being a slug it slows you down that kind of thing desantros mouth twitched her expression softened never met a galloping slug she wrapped a scrap of cloth about the pots handle poured some of the turgid brown liquid into a cracked mug here drink a this and you be dancing on water penhari looked into the mug do i kill it first nay jus cut it with that bread n cheese now do it shestopped talking as a small sailboat nosed round bend out in the middle of the river a leadman in the stem taking soundings zaz turn round y back to the river and sit she flung a cloth over her head and brought the end around her face then calmly poured herself a cup of the tucker tea and set the pot on the ground beside her penhari swung round and dropped into a squat beside the bread board her shoulders hunched her head drawn down whats happening barge coming up river look over top a those trees left side you can see tip a the mainsail that there going past us thats a lead boat river being low like it is barge has to stick to the deepest part they draw lotta water them leadman reads channel she laughed suddenly danger and death seemed to spin her high penhari glanced at her but desantros eyes were lost in the shadow of the cloth so there was nothing there to read father a my third kid was leadman we got together at festa midsummer lakeshore anyway tween this n that i learned more an i want to know bout leadmen penhari ventured a sip of the tea it was thick and bitter but her mouth felt clean once she swallowed it she reached for a hunk of bread and some cheese and ate quietly listening to the splashes and creaks from the river behind her desa theres one thing i dont understand and the longer i know you the less i understand it why didnt you get out a long time ago the money cant have been that important desantro snorted mal verna then it was still why did you stay penhari blinked because there was no reason to leave she said slowly id made a comfortable and reasonably bearable life for myself same thing i like plants m good with them full belly and no bothering y gardener he doubledance with salagaum so he leaves me alone through m first two ldds i was hot t get out kill me some hennermen find m kin get em loose an go home got the fivetail on m back bout every

half a dozen little uns waving fans at him chooee they creeping bout nough wind t blow out match air gets lighter poor jeggin sailormans theyll be out front rowing and towing penhari took another sip of the cooling tea grimaced its bitter bite was getting to be too much for her what are the colors of the ensign huh there should be a banner of some kind near the front end diyo i see it hard to say its all crumpled together urn some blue an some green theres another ah there tis a dart of red quiambo then must be prime korongo he spends half the year in pili half in corasso so faharmoy said when he was still talking to me after desantro was pointedly silent for several breaths penhari added my soloving son thinks hes a prophet now goes about flogging people for their sins down in pili well have to avoid him some family m the barge crept past keeping near the far bank of the long bend where the current had scoured a deeper channel the sailors and the others on board ignoring the dumpy gray figures by the old landing careful desa i dont know if you can swim but i surely cannot the sail lay limp and fluttering against the mast as desantro struggled with the rope coming off the boom it was hitched about a cleat with a knot she didnt know it seemed to have swelled in place and might as well have been glued there she swore as she knocked another knuckle against the cleat and ripped off more skin another minute a this and i take a knife to the jeggin thing ahhhh the knot suddenly came apart in her fingers she turned to grin at penhari and nearly got kicked in the head as the rope rushed through her fingers and the boom went crashing around the sail filled as she closed her hand on the rope and they were suddenly going backward heading for the far bank penhari leaned on the tiller yelled desa bring it round like it was before sting hastily she shoved the tiller the other way as the turn to land grew sharper the sail began to slat and shudder as desantro fought with the rope then it seemed to vomit the air and go limp the current took them again and they drifted back the way theyd come chooee zaz maybe wed better let river take us we dont either a us have a clue bout handling this thing nayo we cant afford the delay hang onto the rope wrap it round your hand or put the end under your knee or something and let the boom swing out a little other side this time just a little till the ends about halfway between the mast and the side vema vema good thats it there we go little more hall nothing like learn by doing eh desa they went downriver in a series of jags and jerks and almost disasters the bends in the river the shifts in direction the changing winds all giving them moments of high terror and equally high exhilaration when they survived the land on both sides of the river was parched dead and empty the small landings they came across were deserted and starting to fall apart under the punishing sun there was no shade in the boat desantro dug into penharis bundle and tore up one of her spare skirts dipped the cloth into the river and fashioned turbans for them which she kept wet by filling hahlazs copper pot and splashing the water over her head and penharis sundown penhari moved her aching shoulders well desa what do you think its moondark still and the winds picking up you want to stop for the night or shall we take a chance desantro unwound her turban dropped the damp cloth into her lap and ran her hands through her thick curly hair we could take turns sleeping mmm i have a feeling les keep going far as we can chapter honcychild sees the high city dying curled up in the windowseat at one end of the long narrow parlor waiting for dossan and mateesee to finish packing their baskets in the kitchen faan stroked her hand along ailikis back and watched with satisfaction tempered by anxiety as the rain hissed down on the small garden outside it would keep the pests in shelter chase them away from the beehouse most of them anyway they werent that eager for her company though sometimes she wondered how far theyd go women a lot of them waving beadstrings for her to bless waggling their children at her bless them she thought more likely ill get them killed one good thing rain meant abeyhamal was too busy herding clouds to start the dance again anyway shed been quiet for over a week nowas if she were waiting for something faan scratched behind ailikis ears and let her irritation flow away rain was rest but if the downpour didnt let up soon she and the others would get wet and that was the same as shouting theyd come out of the low city which wasnt healthy in the northbank edge such a stupid thing just because the mums were slaves and their owners wouldnt bring them or give them leave to come they couldnt cross the wood bridge the barrier stopped them like it stopped reyna and dawa stupid she sighed reyna was right nothing you could do about it abeyhamal was horribly powerful but thick as a rock arguing with her was like butting your head against a mud wall you knock off a little dust she told the mahsar curled in her lap but the wall just sits there and all you get for your trouble is a roaring headache she made a face wiped the back of her hand along the window glass where her breath was making a patch of fog ailiki pushed at her arm with her cold nose made sounds like more more more faan laughed and smoothed her hand along the mahsars back tai had prowled the southbank edge until she found this house and moved them in the low city squatters were annoyed with her for refusing a fancier place near the largest of the sacred groves but tai paid no attention to their grousing control she told faan thats what they want they want us surrounded where they can get their hands on us any time they feel like it especially you child well let them want the new beehouse was a low rambling structure with rooms like beads on a string laid out in a double spiral with pocket gardens of trees and flowers and grass more grass with mossrose borders along the paths faan didnt like it much having to walk along arcs to go from room to room irritated her and she missed reyna and the others jea she never saw she didnt know why maybe because he was shamed that he was here safe while rayna and dawa were kept out sometimes when she lay in bed at night and the loneliness got to her she thought about trying to find him and talk to him but she never did loneliness dossan and mateesee were her best friends but they werent part of the beehouse like the salagaum had been they just lived here and went out to work at the same kind of thing theyd been doing on the northbank and there was so much she couldnt talk to them about and they were changing mateesees jokes werent that funny any more they were getting mean dossy was out a lot running around with farmboys she didnt listen even when she was here always thinking about something else and lki was always busy besides talking to her was like talking to the god it turned faans stomach when she thought about it why did everything have to go so rotten the rain lost force diminished to an intermittent drip dossan came in followed by mateesee fa you ready dossans voice was hoarse io the remnants of the cold shed got from dancing in the rain with that miugi she was so dotty about these days she was tired and in a temper she jabbed her elbow toward mateesees ribs this one would dawdle on her deathbed mateesee winked at faan pulled her wide mouth into an inverted curve moons got her huh fakes her temper out to sea faan slid off the seat ailiki flowing down beside her she reached back thrust her arm through the basket of fresh greens and herbs she was taking to reyna just as well you took more time she said as she crossed the room the rains stopping the three cloaked figures hurried along the wynds of southfslge ailiki riding unsteadily on faans shoulder except for several herds of young boys stamping the puddles throwing mud at each other using broken cobbles to scratch insults and their vauntnames onto the walls there were few people out the peddlers had rolled their carts or hauled their bags to the nearest shelter the old men and women had taken their gossip inside drunks and visiting sailors had learned to stay at tavern tables during the hours each day when the thunderstorms swept the low city near the wood bridge faan handed her basket to dossan tapped ailiki off her shoulder and folded her cloak back so her hands and arms were free thieves sometimes lay in ambush here to catch newcomers at their most confused and vulnerable several times shed had to singe muggers who tried to jump the three of them as they went back and forth across the bridge there was no sign anyone was about which was a relief shed improved her control since she ashed the man on the jang but she never felt sure of her hold on those capricious and deadly flamelets stepping onto the bridge was like stepping into an oven panting and drenched with sweat they hurried up and over the high arch beneath them the river was a grayishbrown an unpleasant smell drifting up from the muddy water there were a few coasters tied up at the southbank wharves only one on the north side at the temple landing east of the iron bridge the fishboats were gone they were down in the koo bikiyar and wouldnt be back till tomorrow night it was a twoday trip now everything near the mouth of the river was either dead or too poisoned to eat the wild magic came swirling up as faan passed the midpoint went shooting by her in a silvergray arrow they slipped between the approach pillars on the northbank and spread into a cloud that shimmered a neutral gray mateesee shifted her basket to her other arm made a face at the fine mist at the end of the bridge i hate going through that stuff fa makes me feel itchy faan slapped at her friends arm not stuff teesee i told you people wildings i see stuff i call it stuff hunh tsah teesee theyre just telling us theres no problem that end no striker bands hanging about dossan snorted dont waste y breath fa mateesee pinched her arm swung around and danced backward chooeee chooee miugi the lump she chanted dump her ooh hee he dump her dump her dump her dump her shut up leesee faan put her hand on dossans arm you all right dossy dossan glowered at the worn wood mosaic of the bridge floor shrugged faans hand off walked on a few steps i dont want to talk about it she said finally they trotted from the approach and turned into the nearest wynd walked quickly along it a few of the wildings drifting with faan flittering about her like flies ailiki swung her head from side to side as she trotted along now and then baring her teeth and hissing at the hovering specks they rounded the end of a tenement shied to the far side of the wynd as four looters came through a window the leader grinned and started for them faan let fire flutter on the backs of her hands and the skinny scarred boys went gliding off vanishing into shadow before theyd gone half a dozen steps mateesee clicked her tongue yaras she whispered i wonder who they got dossan glanced over her shoulder shivered every time i see something like that i think it could as easy be mums placeshe hugged the two baskets closer against her hurried ahead of the others buzzit thesee faan muttered likely one of em has a paymaster in a striker band chooee mateene pulled the cloak closer around her and hurried after dossan fa you dont think rey said faan trotted past the two girls slowed but kept a step ahead of them everything over heres chance these days you dont know whos buying what with your life mateesee shifted the basket rubbed at the red mark on her ann that jeggin barrier whats honey mother thinking ts i dont know i dont even care any more wait here a minute she ran along the last bend of the wynd and stopped in the shadow of the tenement frowning along verakay lane good theyre setting out the barrels now and ah mutri maship and his band they just this minute come out of peshallas tavern soons they get started we can cut across the lane dossan gave faan the basket shed carried for her whistled a quick trill repeated it waited the kitchen door opened a crack it was dark inside except for the leftover sunset filtering in through the dusty cramped windows a vague figure peered through the crack whispered hoarsely dossy fasirill dossans mother diyo mum shh dossy the door opened a few grudging inches more hes drunk come on in quick faan pushed mateesee ahead of her turned and waved to dossan see you n an hour dossy mateesee banged on the back door mum she called keeping her voice low come on open up faans mouth thinned as she heard the undercurrent of pleading in her friends voice it was the same every time though she came on the same day each week almost the same hour half the time ogadeyl forgot her daughter was due she was fond enough of mateesee but the girl was simply not important to her teesee ogadeyls high sweet voice floated into the dusk as the door swung inward and the lanterns of the kitchen painted a yellow rectangle on the rutted wynd she was a pretty woman smallboned skin like amber velvet more charm than maleesee would ever have loa mum mateesee moved quickly inside turned and waved to faan before she pulled the door shut see y n a hour faan heard the music blare out and the singing begin before she reached verakay lane she shook her head irritated by the bubble people that flitted about her flies around a carcass she said to ailiki the mahsar reared on her hindlegs snapped her teeth at a floating mote faan laughed shook her head again to the wildings she said youd better go back to your sisters little ones i appreciate the warding but ill be safer on the lane if im not noticednay nay they chorused in tiny whining voices canna canna do she say hanga with you true true faan sighed so tuck yourself in under the cloak and keep out of sight what she says we do but we dont have to flaunt itthere were three or four bonfires burning in the middle of the lane fueled by wood torn from abandoned houses on the boardwalk the taverners and mulemen had set up planks on barrels as temporary bars there was a curfew of sorts in the edge decreed by the prophet and enforced by the striker bands all businesses had to be closed at sundown or theyd be burned out and their owners flogged the drinksellers and the pimps got around this by moving their stock outside none of them liked it but the dark was their time and they werent about to let the profits go mama kubaza and mutri maship were out with their musicians and dancers slave women who doubled as habatrizes between sets taking their customers into one or another of the burntout buildings the customers were sailors bored by the tame nightlife in the southedge slaves and tiedworkers from the maulapam sirmalas young biasharim and cheoshimsome of whom were in the striker bands by day drawn to the violence then as they were to the vice after dark no real crowds but enough custom to let the edgers keep existing ailiki gliding behind her faan slipped into the lane her cloak pulled close about her the basket beneath it out of sight verakay was dangerous for a girl alone but the wynds and ways around it were worse at least there was some light here and people about dressed in gold tissue trousers and vest mutri maship stood on an upended barrel swaying to make the sequins glitter on his vest and along his arms singing kalele style while his drummers tapped and brushed and the daround players fingers crabbed across the strings so fast the blurred ou sing zuul maship sang almost shouting to break through the noise of voices and mamas band though he kept an icing of lyric tone na gid a mee yun du sing zuul gidda meeyin three young women in studded dresses danced in front of the musicians two of them moving with lazy twists and turns to show off their bodies to the men gathering around the third was different she was lost in the music and happy inside her skin enjoying the play of her muscles bare feet stamping kicking high body wheeling through flips where no part of her touched the rutted dirt a film of sweat spread over her face and arms and she seemed to glow with pleasure faan stopped to watch her smiling for the first time since she crossed the bridge then a cheoshim youth more than half drunk bumped into her grabbed at her ailiki hissed a warning raked her teeth along his leg slicing through cloth into muscle faan hurried on keeping close to the buildings flitting from shadow to shadow reminded that this was no longer her homeplace when she reached bamampah the woodmans abandoned compound she ran round the back touched the gate and plunged in as soon as it flew open ailiki trotting beside her tail high a satisfied grin on her small flat face reyna dawa and several other salagaum had moved into the woodhouse when bamampah packed up his lathes and benches and everything else he could stuff in handcarts and trundled his household and business across the wood bridge into southedge woodhouse was a big place with a tall brick wall around it and heavy gates of ironbound hapuawood reasonably safe from the prophets torchmen and from shindate persecution though the shinda prefecture was too weak and disrupted these days to make a serious nuisance of itself during the day this back yard was a busy place using the salagaum as his labor force reyna ran an infirmary from the larder next the kitchen got sacks offood to edge families and anyone else who needed it andthrough a web of abosoa kassos as poor as their neighborsissued forged silver coins to buy the little water that came down the aqueducts into cisterns ofthe shinda prefecture faan hauled the heavy gate shut again and slapped her hand against the wood willing the bars into place she didnt wait to see them chunk home but moved quickly past the supply sheds to the kitchen door thammir and raxzin were sitting at the kitchen table sharing a pot of tea and waiting for the wash water to boilwash water because faan could see jugs standing beside the sink with stained cloths draped over the wide mouths like the rest of the edge woodhouse salagaum used river water for everything but drinking and like them strained and boiled it first with all the aban doned and halfcharred houses about firewood was cheaper than good water thammir looked up grinned he was a little salagaum with hair like copper fuzz and the yellow eyes of a cat here in the house he wore salagaum dress again a long white robe with a wide red leather belt cinched tight about a narrow waist the apron he had ready for the washing up was bunched on the table beside his cup hows it goin fa his voice was a basso rumble so deep it sounded as if he were growling faan waggled her hand at him so so she said reyna in ailiki trotted off sniffing at sacks and cupboards rearing up to peer into the water crock emergency came up one of mama kubazas women a kid really she ran into a pain freak already theyre just getting set up out there didnt take this shrat long to get going raxzin snorted he was fundarim like rey with a thin bony face and eyebrows like inverted vees his long black hair gathered in a tail tied with a leather thong you always leave everything out thamm fa this kid her names zembee she went to see her mum on the sly mum being a slave in one of the sirmalas and she was coming back to mamas house when this shrat jumped her and hauled her off into one of the greens though you cant call it green the way things are these days i hear they cut off fountain water even to the biasharim well this shrat wouldda killed her but this striker band comes stomping by as usual they dont know whats happening they so into that poop they do but the shrat he dont know that and he takes off zembees tough she gets on her feet and buzzits back to mama tore up pretty good from what the boy said when he came for rey but not gonna die want a cup while you waiting he lifted his raised a peaky brow ahsan rax not now faan scratched at her arm frowned at the door into the front of the house about how long do you think thammir rubbed at his nose bout an hour ago he left shouldnt be long you said mama kubaza was out on the lane diyo then hes probably on his way back now he nodded at the basket what you got good faan set the basket on the table fresh greens and some medicums tai sent along she settled on a stool so what else has been happening reyna dropped his cloak and his bag of medicines hugged faan vigorously then pushed her back and stood with his hands on her shoulders smiling down at her you look better he drew the tip of his forefinger in a shallow curve under her eye no black bags shes been leaving me alone its like shes waiting for something she walked beside him snuggled up against him his arm around her shoulders as he moved from the entry toward the stairs ailiki came from shadows and glided at her heels he stopped by the newel post go on to the sitting room honey i need to change my clothes and wash up dressed in a crisp white salagaum robe his hair brushed and wound into a loose knot atop his head reyna looked ten years younger he smiled at faan nodded to dawa and the other salagaum sitting round the single lamp repairing hems darning holes working over their old clothing cloth was almost as expensive as water these days he dropped into a chair reached down to touch faans head as she settled on the floor beside his knees furrah set his work down how is she ive seen rough we all have nothing so ugly reyna shivered rubbed his thumbs across his fingertips he did a job on her face especially her mouth and nose i sewed the wounds up but shell have scars he shook his head she gets a look in a mirror maybe shell wish he finished it cut her on the breasts and legs she says he was going to gut her then rape her again it got him excited telling her all that where the cuts were going and how deep a biashar she said mamas putting the word out well find him goandee touched a scar slanting past the corner of his mouth he get her eyes left them alone so she could watch him strut he thought he cut her throat when the striker band came by but he was in a hurry and she got her arm in the way and he didnt stop to make sure faan twisted around and looked up rey you remember the time i nearly sliced my thumb off she held up her hand fingers spread turned it slowly in the yellow lamplight to show them there was no scar anywhere when shes well enough to walk take her to the sibyl fa what sibyld do for you make it a visiting night and ill go with you faan stroked her fingers down the side of her face shivered when she thought of the girl not that much older than her we cant let the jeggers win all the time silence stretched out for several minutes furrah went back to embroidering with tiny precise stitches over a tear in a white shirt dawa smiled at faan took up another pair of trousers and began darning a hole in one of the knees reyna lay back in the stuffed chair his eyes halfclosed his face weary faan leaned against his legs quietly happy it was almost like being in the old beehouse again on one of the nights when reyna and the others stayed home and rested if she had a choice this was where shed live she closed her eyes sighed choice tsah the way she was now she killed people she stayed around goandee ran his finger around the cuff hed been mending snipped the thread loose and began folding the trousers went by ladroavivi this morning chezs place hes down with fever saw three dead rats in the wynd reyna opened his eyes a crack made a face klann it just needs that theres already cholera about he pulled his hand across his face wed better organize flea baths and get ready to dunk the laggard druggers dont give a rats ass what happens to them theyll spread plague like fire goandee spread his hands maybe

the first load of silver tonight pack it in your basket hmm verna rey faan yawned and ill go see the sibyl tomorrow morning see what she advises she grimaced if im let the door opened thammir came in with a platter of small cakesand raxzin followed with a teapot and cups on a tray time out he said move the lamp hmm with ailiki running ahead and back along the top rail faan dossan and mateesee walked slowly across the wood bridge faan brooding over what shed heard halfway over she shifted the heavy basket to her other arm dossy teesee were your mums all right not sick or anything why dossan grabbed her arm you know something youre joupy as threelegged flea shwart dossy shwart yourself maumyo drinks and vomits and spews potz all day he runs a fever but he wont take anything for it lb me faan moved across to the rail set the silverheavy basket by her feet she leaned on her forearms and stood gazing down at the dark slow water oiling below ailiki came back to balance beside her rey says theres cholera in the edge maumyo probably got it from that straw mule he drinks rey said aboso shakiyr is getting water to them so they wont catch it from the river he says wed better wash down good once we get home dump our clothes in a tub with plenty soap teesee kiffins a pernickety jegger wouldnt get near a jug of mule he makes mum boil everything and cook it till its mush actually you could eat off the floor in his house mum even makes me take away my garbage when i come see her mateesee leaned over the rail dropped an apple core into the river that stuff is so gungy it doesnt even splash dossan was frowning back along the bridge fa cant you do something make her let the mums cross faan rubbed her hand along the ancient wood smoother than silk from generation after generation of sliding hands i tried dossy i yelled at her till blood come out my nose she doesnt listen to me she tells me fa mateesee pushed her hood back caught her lip in her teeth pointed theres a boat coming downriver more trouble faan looked along mateesees arm saw the glimmer of starlight on a sail ailiki jumped onto her shoulder and hissed in her ear you thinking trouble too liki my aili as the boat came closer she saw it was a small onemaster like reynas cat that got burned a few months ago no people in it i doubt it probably just a river smuggler trouble would come on a barge like the general she pushed away from the rail grunted when ailikis hind claws bit through her shirt as the mohsnr jumped down buzzit tchika the kassian will be worrying about us dossan went quickly along the bridge her head down worry worry worry mateesee went after her glancing uneasily at the river every few steps talking a steady stream vema vema look its turning tward southbank you probably right fa coming down to connect with someone off a coaster coomma coomma dossy stop being a snerk think about honker hell give you a rub where it itches your mum reynall take care of your mumsides fa says shes going over tomorrow shell see the mums get what they need youll do that huh fa faan shifted the basket again her eyes on the river vema vema thesee early tomorrow the boat nosed toward one of the wharves twitching awkwardly swinging out to go on by because it was moving too fast it cut across the river toward northedge then circled back unsteadily heading for the wharf again abeyhamal took faan the moment she moved past the approach pillars the wild magic came pouring from the river swirling in a silver helix around her a silently screaming mist that she could hear but the others couldnt she tried to say something to them but abeyhamal wouldnt let her speak the god sent her loping down the gatt road ailiki bounding at her heels heading for the gat where the boat was trying to tie up she trotted out onto the planks and stood watching in enforced silence as the two women climbed from the boat women wrapped in clumsy gray robes with lengths of cloth bound about their heads and across their faces abeyhamal spoke through her falmaree penhari banadah be welcome daughter chapter abeyhamal advances her queen desantro looped the mooring rope over the bitt pulled the nose of the boat closer to the wharf and went up the ladder she knelt on the damp planks and reached down to help penhari weird she said as the older woman came laboriously off the ladder and straightened been raining here y can smell it penhari didnt answer she was staring past desantro desantro eased hahlazs knife from the sheath shed taken off him and turned slowly keeping the knife behind her mist like cold smoke twisting about her a girl stood halfway out on the wharf carrying a basket that dragged on her arm and wearing a heavy black cloak a small beast beside her sitting up with black paws folded across a white ruff the girl was wascram or slave too pale for anything else smooth black hair cut even with her shoulders and something odd about her eyes those eyes changed suddenly into black faceted rounds that glittered in the starlight mica wings vibrated behind her shoulders when she spoke there was an eerie buzz to the words fahnaree penhari banadah be welcome daughter penhari pulled the cloth from her head and stood holding it what are you saying receive my blessing faithful daughter you have come in the proper time to fill a great need this girl is my voice and my focus follow her the overlay faded and the girl was simply a girl again desantro pressed her lips together took a step back grimacing as her foot hit a bit of gravel the scrape was loud as a mules bray penhari turned her head desantro the boat desantro said id best see about getting rid of it she took another step back as she spoke half a chance geddrin ill plant a hundred trees for you let me get out of this and you can ask what you want the girl moved impatiently never mind that it doesnt matter come on ill take you to the icassian desantro shifted again you dont know what youre talking about baby her hip touched the bitt next the ladder big bros gonna be sniffing after us any minute now the girl shifted the basket on her arm rubbed absently at the discoloration of her pale flesh verna vema i hear you you dont want that boat any more heshal falmaree my name is penhari child its all i claim these days no we dont want it desantro stood silent cursing under her breath she knew better than to speak up again to say let me take it down past the bridges and turn it loose to float away float away hall shed be in it out of here if she got the chance my name is faan i stopped being a child a long time ago step back please the girl whistled made a sweeping movement of her arm the silvery mist swirled faster round her then swooped at the boat round around it spun in a wide flat vortex then it melted into the water and the boat was gone not even dust left where it had floated verna faan drooped wearily her voice was hoarse will you come now ill take you to the beehouse two girls about the same age as the first came from the shadows and joined them whispering vigorously breaking off as they saw desantro watching them with the beast trotting before them faan and penhari walked down the gatt road desantro followed a step behind the other two girls beside her nudging each other and whispering again one reminded her of the wharaka shed seen when she was a child slipping out to play in the moonlit forest shy dark sprites flitting from tree to tree or dancing in whara circles in the night mists the other was an imp with a spray of sunspots across her upturned nose the imp whispered furiously with her friend then edged closer to desantro is that really the falmaree diyo desantro smiled straight from the falmatarr chooee desantro looked around as she walked beginning to enjoy herself the smells of damp earth and wet wood werent the same of course but they did remind her of whenapoyr her minds eye saw soaring roughbarked trees as huge and old as the mountains themselves the whitewater stream that danced down the slope beside the sheep cote the mountain peaks visible from the porch kappawhay the cloud breaker rawhero the sun spear whentiaka the land guard the imp tugged at her arm again she going to stay with us i dont know desantro shook herself shed forgot for a moment where she was it was long after moonset the night was quiet except for the sounds of their feet and occasional irregular drips as leaves shed their burdens into the pools below the wynds were empty the windows dark she thought about falling behind and getting lost in this maze of twisting ways but it would brand her a runaway and she didnt think that was a good idea penhari promised to get her passage on a ship she was filled with good intentions that mal good intentions haiti that and six mojus would buy a slug of mule faan put her hand on the door and it opened she led them into a roughly furnished sitting room lit by a single nightcandle if youll wait here she said ill fetch the kassian tai wanarneh dossan mateesee come on you both have to work tomorrow they went out the beast stayed behind leaping onto a window ledge sitting with its tail wrapped across its tuckedin forepaws penhari settled herself on a couch and contemplated her mud covered sandals falmaree tsah she yawned i look like that beggarwoman i saw in the fringe mmh desantro moved to one of the windows she couldnt see much in the starlight a tree and some bushes maybe some grass sorry about the boat desa should have let you take it desantro caught her lip between her teeth sighed well i suppose id ha drowned myself or run it into a mudbar be patient a few days desa ill penhari stopped talking as the door opened and a tall thin mal walked in followed by faan and a young acolyte with an eyepatch desantro slipped away from the window went to squat in a corner behind the couch where the falmaree was sitting the kassian tai wanameh tilted her head in a sketch of a reverence as if to say i recognize your status but thats all im going to do she was a thin stick of a woman with deep laugh wrinkles about her eyes and a wide mouth that kept trying to smile she was fifteen maybe twenty years older than penhari though these mais were hard to judge they didnt age like the people she knew penhari passed her hand over her rumpled gray hair wanameh she said family wannamm diyo pilis mal prime is my brother was when i acknowledged the family penhari gave a shout of laughter cleared her throat acknowledged the family i like that ill use it if you permit words are still free like the air we breathe though these seem to be the only free things left in the land all too true kassian tat youve had rain here abeyhamal claims this patch as her domain she defies chumavayal by breaking his drought i see the kassian made a brushing move what brings you here falmaree penhari banadah penhari was silent for several breaths then spread her hands in a weary gesture im too exhausted for pride kassian my brother acquired a taste for beating me i thought id leave before it became lethal i see you know about the general oh diyo his heads gone soft and my sons his match but dont underestimate them they dont need intelligence theyve got power she sighed again power in the hands of fools think about that and shudder kassian tai wanameh what do you expect crum us falmaree what youd do for the lowest sanctuary the lowest dont have your liabilities falmaree true but this is also true sooner or later youll have to face what i bring on you why not when you know its coming the kassian tai thought that over her thin brows sliding together her mouth knotted she nodded fi nay relaxed her face faan told me abeyhamal greeted you so it seems seems honeychild is the gods mouth no seems about it the kassian glanced around motioned to her apprentice to bring up an armchair faan settled on a hassock behind the kassians chair the beast jumped from the window and came to lie across her feet a corner of the kassians mouth lifted in a quick halfsmile i must say im glad to see you falmaree she tented her long bony hands ive neither training nor inclination for rule but these idiots over here keep bothering me with their disputes sanctuary eh well fine its yours but youll need to work for your bread and bread comes high these days just about everything we eat has to be brought in another thing tai waved a hand at desantro no slaves order of abeyhamal your companion there if she stays shes free desantro stopped being a slave the moment we left the falmatarr the laws of the land say otherwise but thats how i see it which reminds me she needs passage out of here safe passage as soon as possible that might prove dificult we dont get many ships here these days and those we do the kassian shook her head safe isnt a word id use faan touched the kassians shoulder i saw a ship at the camuctarr gate when we went across the bridge the kassian clicked her tongue him i wouldnt trust him with a pet rat let alone a friend thats zmios the phrasi and his gidyebar connections with the slave trade if um desantro is willing to wait vroliko ryo is due in with a load of corn hes safe enough penhari twisted around desa ive had enough of slavers heshal wait the kassian shifted in the chair vema falmaree theres a house near the sok grove the people here wanted me to take it for a beehouse but my calling is to serve the poor and outcast not the smugly respectable well get you settled there tomorrow then you can start organizing the chaos in the low city she moved her shoulders grimaced there are too many people here and no rule but mob rule ill back you with whatever influence i have be glad to get this place off my shoulders abeyhamal has already welcomed you through faan so theres that too penhari sat up why me she said diyo theres bait desantro told herself run the place she looked past the falmaree at the gods girl faan was trying to keep her face blank but she was too young and probably too pampered to be good at it she was bored with all this annoyed with something maybe these mals sitting here and playing with peoples lives youre the falmaree hah you know how much that means penhari it gives the faction leaders cover for compromise they can go to their people and say we did it because the falmaree said to desantro said to me once never trust a mal its the first thing she learned and on the way here a man tried to cut my throat because i was a mal theyll trust you before they trust each other falmaree that doesnt mean theyll love you besides folkre used to having maulapam tell them what to do penhari slapped her hand on her thigh then im going to be more than a rug you put over a stain tai ive been reading for years about governance she

are kumms to judge disputes and set law you know these people the women i want women as kumms not kassians just ordinary women all castes then kassian tai laughed slowly slowly penhari banadah its only a few hours till dawn time enough for planning when youve got some sleep chapter juvalgrim contemplates his fate juvalgrim hitched a hip on the windowledge looked down into the fountain court as he combed nighttangles out of his hair father and son he murmured touching isnt it on the far side of the long narrow room fitchon snorted he filled a cup with hot steaming tea straightened the forks and spoons shifted the vase with the half opened tashba bud so a petal with nibbles off the edge wouldnt show ready he said if you havent lost your appetite in the court the prophet stood against the back wall with arms outstretched leading the iron litany before him on their knees the general the royal hosta cheoshim from the striker bands and a scattering of men from the city slaves and workers from the maulapam sirmalas chanted the responses in deep burring voices that made the water shake and hammered at the glass in the tower behind them juvalgrim slipped off the sill strolled to his dressing table dropped the brush and slipped a clip over his hair to keep it out of his mouth while he was eating he leaned closer to the mirror ran a finger along the deepening line between his nostril and the corner of his mouth it would make life much simpler if i grew a beard fitchon paused on his way into the next room chuckled in competition with the prophet juvalgrim straightened id keep it clean at least and free of crawlers he settled himself at his breakfast table which was set up near one of the outer windows join me fitch you can finish your work later at the foot of the mountain lay the shrunken deserted river and the smoldering high city in the edge a building suddenly belched streamers of black smoke into the red streaks lingering from sunrise fitchon spread jam on a piece of toast with a liberal hand took a large bite out of the triangle juvalgrim frowned at the tea in his cup the goldbrown liquid shivering with the barely perceptible shake of his hand the long nights were getting to him and this business it wasnt going to be easy the best he could think of was to approach it obliquely have you ever wondered about your parents fitch fitchons lips twitched and his eyes narrowed as they always did when he was thinking up some sass or other but he drew his napkin across his mouth and with the jam wiped away his flippancy diyo we all do you know but no one says anything he rubbed his thumb along the handle of the butterknife i always wondered his eyes lifted for an instant to meet juvalgrims dropped quickly if id got you on one of my bedwarmers fitchon set the knife down scratched at a smear of jam on hisnapkin diyo juvalgrim shook his head sorry fitch no way im sterile as a stone lots of activity but no results he ran his finger along his upper lip amused and flattered by the disappointment fitchon couldnt hide singularity limp it has its points he cut a piece of sausage looked at it laid his fork down weve been friends a long time fitch his amber skin darkening with an uneasy flush fitchon fiddled with the napkin juvalgrims shout of laughter was loud enough to shake the tashba petals nayo nay my friend im not hustling you to my bed though ive no doubt gossip has put you there often enough diyo and got me a lot of perks even you didnt know about high one fitchon leaned back grinningas much with relief as enjoyment i told reyna once you were a conniver from the womb juvalgrim sobered jabbed his thumb at the window look at that will you order of the day what you cant control destroy fitchon scratched at his wrist pulled his mouth into an upsidedown curve isnt that much left to burn maybe so fitch but ive a proprietary interest in the tinder thats left one of these days im going to look down and therell be bundles of faggots under my feet and the prophet dancing round me with a torch and a smug grin on his filthy face that cant nayo fitchon slapped his hands on the table hard enough to make the dishes jump we wont let it happen ghalighali my friend such passion youve been thinking about it havent you nayo nay diyo mavi or you wouldnt be so quick to deny high one you know we support you us young ones and a lot of the primes the prophet wouldnt dare the prophet does what he wants juvalgrim shook his head friends and allies fitch theyll run for shadow when the crunch comes that doesnt bother me mavi id do it myself its you im worried about were too tight its made enemies for you them jegging bigots theyre jealous thats all he pushed his chair back and got to his feet i wont listen to this high one whistling at the moon mavi i appreciate the effort but i havent survived this long without keeping my eyes open even if i dont like what i see i recommend the practice fitchons shoulders jerked he turned his back on juvalgrim and pressed his forehead against the window glass his hands closed tightly about the edge of the sill im sending you upriver tomorrow quiambo prime will take you in put you to work in a corner somewhere keep you out of sight until this is over nayo diyo mavi either you walk onto that barge or ill have you carried on in chains fitchon pivoted caught hold of the back of the chair where hed been sitting leaned tensely toward juvalgrim come with me this scum youre feeding and coddling theyre not worth your life scum fitch youve a mother down there perhaps even brothers mother she threw me away i should care about her there are other mothers mavi mine among them i was born with a mal face but she was a slave what choice did she have ahhh all thats he waved his hands as he searched for words air dream nothing i dont understand you druggers thieves cheats lazy chuggs can you deny thats what they are what does that matter do they have to earn my attention juvalgrirn leaned back rested his hands on the slender arms of his chair listen mavi mavou everyone else has someone or something to stand with them temple order family caste law and obligation my scum have me he sighed and the foundling school has me and the acolytes and novices depend on me its a heavy weight sometimes but i he paused his mouth twitching into a deprecating half smile i like it he looked at the pieces of sausage on his plate wrinkled his nose pushed away from the table i know you do fitchons grip tightened on the chairback dont send me away you need me i need you alive juvalgrim crossed the room to the wardrobe paused with his hand on the knob over his shoulder he said the third ways the best way remember that fitch when you see two bull saisai nose to nose snorting and kicking dirt and blocking your path go round them one way or another slip and slide fitch slip and slide and there youll be peacefully on your way while theyre locking horns and trying to trample each other sall homilies i get enough homilies from my housemaster fitchon blinked his eyes swimming if youll stop dawdling high one ive got work to do he sniffed scrubbed his sleeve across his nose if im gonna get packed by tomorrow four days later juvalgrim sat sweltering in his visitation robes and contemplated the group gathered before him in the council chamber tchah i thought manasso spite went with kutakich looks like i removed a constrictor and got a viper in its place fuaz yoyote manasso prime does the office do it to them or does it take that kind of man to make it there never been sure which it is sure fuaz surely knows how to chose a time for his strike juvalgrim leaned forward looked slowly from face to face his strongest supporters were both away quiatnbo prime in corasso aboso prime in the infirmary recovering from a small stroke he lingered on the adjo prime saw him look away drops of sweat oozing out of his burnt caramel face as if he were starting to melt under the pressure he always was a feather in the wind anacho looked troubled but he was a man of ritual and pattern with little imagination or empathy he didnt like having to stand against a high kasso but he hadnt the strength to oppose the prophet anaxo juvalgrim slid a hand across his mouth to hide the twitch of his lips anaxo prime had put off his black robes for the prophets coarse brown let his beard and hair grow his eyes were fierce and his posture so humble it shouted hubris and there was young fuaz smug and serious the prophet himself stood apart from the primes with the general crouched at his feet like a dog an adoring dog and so juvalgrim said what is this about fuaz bowed high kasso we have come to say the conduits from the fountain to the city cisterns have been closed off juvalgrim straightened my instructions were to leave them open chumavayal the father of waters requires it the prophet has given chumavayals command and we have obeyed juvalgrim leaned back pressed his palms together and set his middle fingers against his lips hisforefingers fitting into the dip above his chin he was angry very angry but he didnt think it politic to show it he brought his hands down crossed them above the crystal of the eye and spoke softly reasonably using his deepest most musical tones there are good people in that city poor people hardworking people who cant afford to pay mal prices for aqueduct waterif there is any water left after the maulapam and cheoshim are finished with it they will be driven to the river and you know it is unclean do you want disease in the city along with everything else and what of the true and faithful ironmen in the edge families that give generously from the little they have are they worth nothing to chumavayal the prophet strode forward banged the butt of his staff on the floor chumavayal is just and compassionate if those you speak of are truly good and faithful servants let them come to the fountain and be blessed they will be given what they need if they are sinners and recreant it is better that they die his eyes widened went suddenly a brilliant red chumavayal says look to your own soul foolish man it may be that i will require it soon his mouth worked halflost in the tangle of mustache and beard chumavayal says water is my gift if it is misused i will take it back he shivered the red faded the fountain will go dry if the conduits are not sealed off i see i do indeed the lot of you are so frightened by this stinking fanatic youd castrate yourselves to please him he snorted and im no better if i had a spine ah well the third way ju remember what you told fitchon find the third way theres no point in disputing with this lot chumavayals will be done he paused straightened and let his anger show next time however be more faithful to the rule inform me before you act not after for your lapse he smiled sweetly at the new manasso prime i decree to each of you a penance a chant of ten chains before the forge blessed be chumavayal reyna tightened the laces of his trousers tied them off he shook out the blousy black tunic stood holding it and looking across the candlelit bedroom at juvalgrim who was sitting naked on a windowseat his legs drawn up his arms draped loosely over his knees his long long hair falling like black silk down his back and off the edge of the seat he was gazing down the mountain to the dark mass of the city juvalgrim sighed more ofthe edge is burning come with me reyna pulled the tunic over his head settled it on his shoulders theres not much you can do here any more theyre pulling the noose tighter and tighter about you they you know what i mean juvalgrim moved his hand in one of his graceful meaningless gestures let manasso carry the eye if thats what he wants its not worth this this reyna spread his arms wiggled his fingers a sign for all the things that hung between them come with me ju once youre out of it nobodys going to bother you juvalgrim moved his shoulders shook his hair loose dear rey thats no answer reyna caught up his cloak swung it around his shoulders clipped the neck cords to his belt i cant give you anything like youve got here but youd be safe id be dead the wounded moon was the finest of nail parings only three days past dark but the sky was clear and the starlight lit the planes of juvalgrims face slid along a body still firm and lean despite his age what you heard me he swung around dropped his legs over the edge of the padded seat i might manage to escape the men but the god never rey listen the instant i cease to be of use to chumavayal ill be a grease spot on some floor i just have to keep hanging on and hope i can outlast the change youve lost me again klaan sibyl warned me not to talk about that trust me rey if i can keep on long enough everything will be all right he slid off the seat and came quickly across the room he took reynas hands held them gently prisoned within his own listen luv take your own advice get out ill find the money for you next ship that leaves you be on it what about faan you know the answer rey shes caught you cant help her the god has her honey mother will use her till theres nothing left then i stay too she comes to me for shelter ju all those people pulling at her the gods fooling with her life she has to have some place to rest he freed his hands lifted one of juvalgrims and kissed the palm shes my daughter as long as she needs me im going to be there juvalgrim sighed take care luv a corner of his mouth curled up i should tell you not to come again its too dangerous but i need you too he drew the pad of his thumb down the side of reynas face eyes laughing not for rest at the passage panel he closed a hand about reynas arm come to the cave tomorrow ill have silver for you youll have to find a smith to turn it into coin ah rey the times they do corrupt us he squeezed the arm dont try to buy water yourself luv get abosoa kassos you can trust to do it reyna ducked through the short narrow opening d yo mamay ill be good reyna tugged at the knob on his side of the panel to make sure juvalgrim had turned the latch sometimes he was careless about that he started off through the inky blackness one hand drifting along the wall of the passage ahead of him there was a scraping sound like a heel against stone he froze a click he held his breath silence he ghosted along the passage ears straining one hand in front of him the other drifting along the wall nothing there were other exits from this passage his fingers read the wood as he went past them read the accumulated grit and tickling cobwebs if any of them had been opened whoever it was left no sign of his passing no disturbance to tell reyna he wasnt dreaming he went down and down through the complex of passages wondering if hed begun imagining enemies afraid he hadnt if someone had been outside the panel listening to them he didnt want to think about that warn ju tomorrow all i can do the lantern that hed left where the passage became a volcanic blowhole cast a welcome light in the darkness he wound the wick a little higher and went along the branch that led up to the sibyls cave his feet knew the way well enough after so many years of traversing it but there were too many offshoots for him to trust himself without light to see landmarks besides there were bats in here and other things hed stepped on a poison lizard once when he was late and the lantern had burned dry escaped by luck alone a bite that could have crippled him there was someone sitting in the sibyls chair he blew out the lantern tucked it into the crevice where he kept it between visits loosened the rungo in its loops the polished armlength club hed taken to carrying the past weeks fan looked up as he came around the chair loa rey she wasnt doing anything just sitting perhaps thinking she was thin and wornlooking dark circles under her eyesloa fa then because he couldnt help it he added you could smuggle saisais in those bags under your eyes i dont sleep much these days she said bad dreams i dance for abeyhamal and kill people and the low city folk they want blessings all the time as if some potzy word from me would make anything better well you should really be in bed sleep or not at least you could rest he said come ill walk back with you to the wood bridge still protecting me mamay she laughed and stretched out her hand so he could pull her to her feet as they strolled from the cavern she said none of your edgers would lay a finger on me theyd be afraid of getting it burnt off reyna flipped a finger against her cheek then you can protect me faan took his hand squeezed it they walked together in companionable silence along the twisty trail turned at the black ruin of the ancient olive and started down the jiko sagrada near the last flight of stairs faan touched his ann you love him dont you whats it like being in love with someone reyna was startled he felt his face grow hot it wasnt something hed ever thought to talk about with his daughter but he glanced down at her she was staring at the jiko as her feet kicked out against her skirt what he could see of her face was intent and serious in love he said slowly nayo thats not it fa thats pretty pink pleasures sweat and sweet agony i went through that a few times when i found my first clients he went down the stairs thinking about it his hands clasped behind him under the cloak without questioning it he was suddenly very happy so it was almost a dance he was doing nayo this is different love i dont know theres friendship and fondness oh diyo and passion its not bad you know its not bad friendship and fondness and passion does he love you its hard to say with juvalgrim hes a secret man he needs me thats enough i think need she shivered i hate that word they turned down a kariam walked in wary silence between the dark towers of the cheoshim past the burnt and blackened gardens of the biasharim stepped into the silent starlit sok circle faan glanced at the flogging posts clustered dark and ominous in the middle of the circle small bluish flames licked along her hand nayo fa youll just make things worse she looked down at the little fires after a moment they vanished i know faan leaned against the lefthand pillar on the bridge approach i want to stay here mamay im sick of all that over there reyna grimaced i wish you could honey i hate not being able to he slammed his fist into the pillar gods my he caught her wrist ran his thumb up her arm youve all that power honey use it get out of this place once youre over the border she cant oh diyo she can riverman says it was her brought me here i know hes right and so do you mamay you told about dikhans pipedream power ts im as helpless as i

barrier for you she wont listen to me she wont do anything i ask she just uses me gods she reached up caught a strand of his hair tweaked it youre repeating yourself mamay getting senile huh kimkim respect your old ma huh forgetting abeyhamal hows it going southside she rubbed her shoulders against the pillar its a mess rey arguing all the time fighting people getting hit on the head robbed farmers fighting woodmen cooks fighting brewers everybody yelling pulling at me she pushed at her hair it was cut short just brushing her shoulders fine and black blowing in the warm wind they all want me all those factions as if having me support them validates them she grimaced brought reynas hand up rubbed the back of it against her thin cheek im so tired mamay so tired reyna smiled caught a strand of her hair lifted it off her face i never thought id say it but i miss your purple spikes wasnt much point keeping that up no time for fun cant play or sass the paint made my head itch anyway she leaned against him with a small sigh that squeezed his heart youd better get on home honey and be careful ill still be watching youll see me when you dance she sighed again her breath making a small warm spot on his ribs mamay high one high one something banged hard against the door to the audience room there were more bangs and scrabblings the door opened a crack slammed shut juvalgrim lifted a brow set his tea cup down and crossed the room he pulled the door open stood there with his arms crossed startled by the scene unfolding in the anteroom shouting wriggling vigorously kicking and biting the young acolyte whod replaced fitchon a wascram page was struggling to break free and get back at the door its all right lettin let him go juvalgrim grunted as the page cannoned into him calmly calmly catch your breath and tell me whats wrong the boy lifted eyes the color of verdigris on bronze the prophet hes gonna flog sivvy in school says hes a blasphemer says hell have the evil outta him if it takes all day you gotta stop him high one i hear you what is your name houen high one and who is sivvy my friend we came to creche the same day and they put us in the same cot though his body shouted a terrible impatience he spoke with the politeness that had been trained into him it had taken better with him than it had with fitchon more than ever juvalgrim missed his acolytes acerbic tongue high one if im to interfere houen i have to know everything the prophet will scold him for a while theres no hurry how did this get started thll me the truth and no excuses houen was so frantic he was shaking he tried to talk but he couldnt juvalgrim scooped him up stood him on the table where tettin sat during the day working on files and arranging appointments now he said bake a deep breath look me in the eye and start at the beginning he held the boys hands in his smiled at him he spoke softly deep breath thats right now let it out slowly slowly vema houen how did it start houen dropped his eyes chewed his lip his fear having diminished caution came flooding back ununm juvalgrim put his hand under the boys chin lifted his head the truth he said well um sivvy was put here cause his mum belonged to a ma you know but she looked for him and found him his mouth curved into a quick grin wasnt hard hes the only one with blue eyes anyway she came up here all the time to see him but day before yesterday another woman came said his mum was well the woman didnt say exactly except she wasnt gonna come up here any more she was afraid shed get beat again the woman started to say something else then a manasso come along and chased her and slapped sivvy for fooling around with nits and slaves and sivvy dont say anything but hes real mad well out behind kitchen theres these bins where they dump guts and stuff sivvy finds some real ripe fish guts and he wraps em up in this gunky paper you know what they give out when you learning to write and he sneaks into manasso primes sitting room its just over where the prophet does his morning prayers you know and he drops the gunk on the prophets head when hes right in the middle of a chain and ol prophet goes round smelling hands till he lights on sivvy and hes gonna beat sivvy and sivvys not gonna let him and and hes gonna get killed i just know it no houen we wont let that happen juvalgrim swung the boy back to the floor tettin keep quiet about this do i have any appointments this next hour there was a gray tinge to the young acolytes face and his hands were shaking he scurried around behind the table and consulted his lists anaxo pelekal with a list of complaints about supplies a petition from the sok merchants about moving the flogging posts if any of them arrive before im back have them wait high one the prophet even a prophet can make a mistake young tettin remember that he smiled down at the page give me your hand houen show me where your friend is in the classroom sivvy was stripped naked and stretched over a desk held down by two of the prophets cheoshim followers a third waited for the prophet to finish his scold before laying on with the fivethong flagellum which he was slapping idly against his leg the young quiambo kasso teacher struggled in the hands of another pair of cheoshim you have no right here prophet or not you have no right here leave the boy alone he grunted as the cheoshim twisted his arms higher behind his back out in the hall juvalgrim tightened his grip on houens hand be quiet he said sternly stay here i mean it houen caught his lower lip between his teeth he blinked past the high kasso at the scene in the classroom nodded reluctantly juvalgrim tapped him on the head then swept into the room whats this let that man go the cheoshim looked insolently at him the prophet tells us not you old man the prophet has no authority here let him go all the arrogance years of power had given him he focused on them anger giving yet more force to his words they shifted their eyes after a moment took their hands off the teacher and backed away prophet come here the gaunt bearded man turned slowly you do not command me o kasso in these walls i do o prophet that is true the prophet said slowly he came across the room his feet moving more slowly than his words had the humility that he felt was proper before man and god was struggling against mal pride subtly reinforced by his status as the chosen of god the scourge of chumavayal he stopped before juvalgrim stood with his body tense but his head bowed o prophet explain why you have violated the quiet of this place the prophets head snapped up as the child so the man the fractious and froward boy is seed ground for evil you are lax o kasso i am not here to trade aphorisms with you o prophet though i could say break the boy break the man if thats what you want then youre well on your way to getting it silence you can speak when i have finished what you do in the city is your business o prophet but you are a guest here and i require of you the demeanor and acts of a guest you and your companions will leave now the prophets face hardened his nostrils flared that boy that boy will be punished appropriately not by flogging his skin off juvalgrim ran his eyes scornfully over the man before him consider this o prophet it is your pride that has suffered your soaring selfexalting pride it was not chumavayal the boy played the trick on it was you it is not for chumavayal you wish him punished it is because he made you look a fool youre the fool pretty man the prophet roared his eyes reddening with fury and a hint of the godinhim you and your kind have brought the drought on us by your stubbornness and your corruption o kasso think well what you are doing sooner than you expect it you will be required to answer for all yciu have not done but not to you o prophet i do not expect to see you and your he ran his eyes over the sullen cheoshim bunched behind the prophet your cohorts within these walls again the fountain court is open to all be free of it as for the forge room come and worship as all are free to come at other times and other places you are not welcome the prophet thrust out his arms lifted his face his eyes turned back he waited a moment later he shook himself straight a last fulminating glare then he swung round and marched out juvalgrim snorted turned to the boy hastily pulling his clothes on sivvy the boy went still the young quiambo teacher sighed you know better siv answer the high kasso and politely if you please sivvy did a perfunctory bow his face tight with rejection his eyes like blue stones high icasso he said consider this a punishment for your foolishness sivvy what you did has understandable reasons behind it but passion young wascram is a very bad master you accomplished nothing but putting your teacher in danger and alarming your friends i want you to consider this and remember how little you got from your joke as you are scrubbing out the offal bins for the next five days he nodded as sivvy started to protest then clamped his mouth shut diyo youre not stupid merely rash finish dressing youll find a friend of yours waiting outside you can have half an hour with him then report to the kan lougatar in the kitchen he watched sivvys eyes shift you wouldnt make it down the mountain boy he didnt wait for a response but turned to the quiambo kasso have you had trouble before from outsiders nayo heshim kasso the young quiambo glanced at the boy not outsiders i see youre darslin arent you i remember you when you were giving your teachers fits your favorite word seemed to be why true heshim the housemaster would tell you i havent changed he signed permission for sivvy to leave and the boy went trotting out that was close to being a declaration of war high one he wont forget it i dont expect he will juvalgrim resettled his robes grimaced i have more problems waiting id better get to them in the doorway he paused if you have trouble because of thisor for other reasonslet me know immediately its easier to fight devils when theyre newborn juvalgrim sat in the window looking down on bairroa pili the river was a curving thread of silver the high city on the north bank a black mass with a few red glows from smoldering fires and the scatter of torches being fired up along verakay lane where the edgers struggled to keep going he smiled fondly at the staccato red line my scum takes more than a jegging prophet to squash you on the south bank the windows of the low city showed yellow between the dark masses of the groves the spray of lights muted by the dwindling rain he folded the letter the courier had given him an hour ago tore it in half tore it again and again the amrapake was coming with his army to reclaim his sister and clean out the low city it wont be long now he said aloud ah rey i wish youd been sensible and got out he shook his head slid off the windowseat dropped the bits of paper into the fire and went to bed goddance the twelfth year abeyhamal towers over the forge taller juicier stronger by far than shed been as the dance began her fimbo is as thick as the ancient gods arm it shines with a darkly golden light she dances power around the iron father around and around as if she is spinning a web about him gradually tightening the strands so his movements grow more restricted with every circle more feeble with the kassian tai and the honeychild reinforcing her commands the falmaree penhari banadah pulled the low city into order honeychild and honeygirls danced the wynds and kariams of the high city called women to them leading them across the woodbridge emptying the high city of all but slaves habatrizes and shadowside women chumavayal iron father swings his tools with increasing violence and decreasing effect sweat runs down his face he strikes out at her again and again his footing is less stable he stumbles nearly falls on the forge the fire flickers many of the coals gray over and start to cool he strikes again at abeyhamal and by the luck of the game he cuts a shallow groove in her arm and she drips honey ichor on the forge floor it sizzles and boils on the stone the sound it makes is like a whimper the amrapake arrived with his army the attack on the low city begins juvalgrim fell taking the salagaum with him the goddance goes on the end draws near sibyl the sybil stands beside her chair one hand resting on the stone back her eyes have a distant look on them she herself is insubstantial little more than shaped and shadowed smoke i sit and see the change is nigh one by one the signs drift by life force flows to low from high the forge wind blows the lands sucked dry strangers fly and so must i i can do nothing for my pets my mouth is sealed my reach is gone if either comes here or calls me im nowhere gods this is the point i loathe im a fool for growing fond of these ephemerals power why is it the stupid the greedy the mean who have it is that inherent in the weave is there something about power that repels intelligence and compassion and yet there is juvalgrim a flawed man but a good one he played with power like a pretty bauble never took it seriously why is one emphemeral corrupted another almost untouched i am as old as the earth and i have not resolved that question yet power my limits grate on me honeychild high kasso salagaumsomehow ill manage to keep you clear life is better than burning memory or not at least one can say that id best go now and think of ways of managing this rescue if rescue theres going to be chapter attack mateesee wriggled out on the limb high in the sequba until she reached the bald spot shed seen from below she settled herself and looked south across the roofs of the low city toward the south eka kummata chooee she whistled with surprise then called down to the others i can see most the eastend weird theres a army out there she giggled a shrill sound that sent the moththeries wheeling in the air flying away from her and one jeggers just bounced off the barrier he went riding at it flags flying and now hes on his back and his horse is running off silly

at them some of them slapping and pricking the horses who reared screamed and bolted some of them hitting heads butt first knocking the men from their mounts she enjoyed their misery her laughter a faint snuffling at the back of her nose it was chaos compounded by the taras of the signal horns the rattle of the cadence drums so excited that more than once she came close to falling off mateesee called down what she saw the moththeries belonging to this sequba flittered around her sipping at her laughter like bees after nectar she scratched absently where they landed and therere people out on

time one of the lancers seated his spear and rode at the barrier her skin twitched and her pulse jumpedand her cramps got worse she swung round pulled herself onto the rail and sat balanced there her boot heels hooked over a lower rail her back curved her hands dangling between her knees a while later she wiped at the sweat beading up on her face dropped her hand again she could smell herself and she didnt like it and the monthlies sponge was rubbing her raw felt like it had grit in it of all the times for the blood to come down now when she was supposed to be ready for anything all she felt ready for was curling up in bed with a hot bottle on her stomach just what we needed she muttered more potzheads on a tear tai resettled the takaffa cloth about her neck smoothed the embroidered panels over her breasts began folding back her sleeves to bare her forearms fa youve been a running sore for a week now she was frowning graywhite brows drawn together the lines from her nose to her mouthends cut deeper faan hunched her shoulders im tired im tired of everything tired of being jerked around every time the god gets a notion im tired of having to cross the bridge every time i want to see rey im tired of worrying about him im tired of thugs looking to jump me im tired of potzheads on this side trying to use me for everything they think they want im tired of not having any fun any more and im tired of listening to you godwoman she thought but she didnt say it there was no point in making an enemy where she didnt have one already she brushed at her hair plished it behind her ears it just keeps going on and on and on doesnt it tai set her hands on her hips inspected faan monthlies fa huh dont talk to me bah she crossed to the rail took up the fimbo shed leaned against it here comes the herald on your feet fa dignity child never let them see you squirm she hugged faan against her when she came down off the rail then arranged her face in its sternest lines and started for the northbank the amrapakes herald was a mal in bicolored clothing riding a tall pinto the left side of his face was painted green his right glove was green his left glove black his right boot was green his left black his tunic and trousers were divided down the middle the right side green the left black two masked boys ran at his stirrups the right was black from head to toe the left green they carried bicolored pennons that flapped limply in the hot still air of the high city the pinto reared when the herald tried to force him onto the bridge if the mal hadnt been a superb rider hed have been on his back in the dust he calmed the beast then sat scowling as the kassian tai wanameci and the honeychild came walking slowly down the slope of the bridge and stopped on the riverside of the approach pillars faan nudged the kassian with her elbow clown she whispered shh dignity thats the word the kassian tai wanameh stood tall and commanding one hand on faans shoulder the other clasped around her fimbo the pinto snorted his hooves scraped on the dirt as he shifted nervously the heat was melting the heralds facepaint it was dripping onto his tunic his scowl deepened send forth the falmaree he brayed suddenly renounce this blasphemy and come humbly before god and amrapake the magnanimity and compassion of chumavayal are beyond your understanding trust in it and abase yourselves before him refuse and be declared anathema nothing will come into that place neither flesh nor fowl your children will starve you will eat each other until only bones are left before the kassian tai wanameh could say anything abeyhamal enveloped faan and nudged the kassian aside the translucent image of the god grew quickly immense straddling the bridge feet in the river head in the clouds fimbo like a rod of light bright wings buzzing in a voice that hummed out over both lobes of the city the god cried corrupt son of a feeble father behold how your threats trouble me in all the groves the honey dancers rose as one ow ooo oum owww ooo ahhh umm their mouths gaped wide their eyes glazed over ow ooo oum owww ooo ahhh umm in convoluted double loops they danced stomping and swaying in time with the hum hundreds of girls danced in the groves ecstatic and terrible weaving through the great trees sucking strength from the earth dancing up earthfire for abeyhamal above the low city black clouds swirled and boomed more clouds came sweeping in from the sea great spiraling curls of black thunder crashed lightning walked across and across the city then it rained hard and copiously and not just water flapping and vigorous thousands of great meaty fish fell into the streets and onto the roofs of the low city and the southedge laughing and shouting the people ran into the rain and scooped them up dumped them in barrels and crocks and whatever was handy went back for more herds of boys and girls capered inside the barrier waggling fish at the lancers jeering at the men taunting them the rain stopped the fishfall stopped the honey dancers fell exhausted to the ground men and women of the low city cleaned up the last of the fish and went to figure ways of curing and storing the bounty the kassian tai wanameh took faans arm and began walking back toward the southbank faan was exhausted aching and sad her family was scattered her friends distracted and not really friends any more she was too powerful and too strange now it was as if another barrier stood between her and them yet the power was useless she couldnt get the things she wanted most all she could do was ruin everything she touched it wasnt fair it just wasnt fair then the wild magic came flowing up from the river in a stream of silver that coiled around her caressing her singing their fizzing songs to her blessing her they didnt mind her weirdness they liked it they liked her that was comforting and it gave her the energy to move her feet and follow tai back to the low city chapter gods and rulers share the same tunnel vision ignoring the scandalized anaxoa novices and the mutterings of the crowd of suppliants waiting on the kneeling stools famtoche banddah stalked down the aisle major of the public audience room three hostas of royal guards behind him he reached the stairs to the dais clasped his hands behind him and inspected the primes seated in the middle three chairs of the seven down he said manasso prime fuaz yoyote leaned forward your authority stops at the blessing gate o amrapake famtoche nodded a short sharp jerk of his head i see he stepped to one side waved his hand to his chief guard do it he said seated in the center chair famtoche banddah clicked his painted nails on the wood and smiled down at the three groaning forms stretched out on the floor their backs bloody from a guards flagellum their faces in the dust where the suppliants mat had been my authority stops where i say it does fulaak the chief guard stepped over the legs of the adjo prime bowed stiffly amrap boot up one of those robes out there send it for the high kasso tell it if i have to go looking for that dhun theyll regret it more than this lot he waved a hand at the primes famtoche banddah ran his thumb along his jaw and scowled at the high kasso as he came quietly into the chamber juvalgrim wore a plain black robe his hands were bare of rings his hair brushed smoothly back hanging in a silverstreaked fall down past his waist his only adornment the cloudy crystal on the heavy black iron chainchumavayals eye the sign of his authority despite his annoyance with the man famtoche was tempted to applaud the high kasso dominated the room without saying a word juvalgrim stopped as he reached the feet of the groveling primes moved a hand in a graceful gesture that took in them and the rows of terrified suppliants and acolytes shivering on their stools youve made your point heshim his voice was like honey butter on hot bread rich and satisfying famtoche lost his scowl and the hostas stirred their leather creaking metal clanking against metal juvalgrim brought his fingertips together bowed his head slightly his hair whispering across the rawsilk robe how may we serve you o amrapake famtoche banddah brought his hand down flat against the chair arm a sharp splatting sound that shattered the mood the high kasso had created that barrier or whatever it is it mocks us and chumavayal why do you permit it to exist high kasso juvalgrim tilted his hand in a gesture that conceded the disruption of the mood hed tried to create permit amrap it is godbusiness not mine his caressing voice once again drained much of the crackle from the air i thought god was your business if chumavayal wishes it gone hell take it down i can do nothing without his willing it i am his servant not his master words famtoche banddah leaned forward youre good at words kasso saying is you can talk your way through a wormhole talk your way round this fulaak the chief guard stepped behind juvalgrim set the point of his gracedagger at the kassos throat juvalgrim was silent for a breath his face was as calm as it had been from the beginning there was a look to him that famtoche didnt like a resignation that took away one of his most powerful weapons the fear of death you can kill me easily enough the high kasso said honeybutter voice beautiful and tranquil but what will it gain you will you bring the barrier down i cannot try do you think chumavayal is a dog to come when he is called try no fuaz yoyote lifted his dirtstreaked face the children he said the foundlings if you want him to act bring them into it ah the worm speaks stand worm betray your fellow worm if you will betray fuaz got stiffly to his feet grunting with pain its him who betrays us donothing thats what we call him his pretty little bedmates are all he listens to famtoche banddah pursed his lips eyed yoyote with interest run away little prime bring me back some leverage famtoche banddah stroked his thumb along his jaw and contemplated the two boys your names the blueeyed boy glared at him pressed his lips into a thin line the other one bobbed his head in a hasty bow houen heshim amrap and my friend is sivvy famtoche nodded clicked his fingernails on the chair arm well kasso do i have to explain if your imagination fails you fulaak would be happy to provide details the high kassos eyes glittered so briefly famtoche was unsure he saw anything then they were blank and dull as smoked glass i will make the attempt amrap but i tell you this the barrier is abeyhamals work no man has power over a god more than an attempt kasso or these toys of yours will blood the dirt juvalgrims nostrils flared and his eyes flickered again over his shoulder he said i will remember this

bridge when the kassos ready to work wake up fa come on you gotta see faan groaned and turned over teesee she muttered tai said you slept long enough you should get dressed and do some walking around

open below hem fluttering about his sandals quietly easily he came the chant from those who marched before him flowing around him like a river down the sokajarua turn onto the gatt road down the gatt

diyo worm im talking to you why dont they just get on with it heshim amrap the thin man with the coppery skin of a biashar and the spiky stubble of a cheoshim rounded his shoulders and bobbed his narrow head in bows that seemed to have no end to them the calling must be done without flaw or the allpowerful allknowing great one will not answer and the high kasso is doing what is required and moreyoyote said grudgingly the sweat on his lined face was not from the sun but from fear his fate and juvalgrims were knotted for the moment and he could do nothing but support the man he loathed i judge by the results worm not the elegance of the attempt now get away from me you stink the kassoa choir repeated the godname over and over in their deepest voices melding together in a solid sound

dong donnng dong donnng a red mist rose from the forge and spread along the iron bridge turning the struts crimson as it flowed over them when it reached the southbank approach it oozed along the river on both sides and seethed against the barrier like acid burning holes in leather it ate into the invisibility that barred them from the low city on the roof of the warehouse the amrapake sat up stretched his mouth in a smile with satisfaction but no humor in it chavash the yatz is actually getting somewhere klann reyna leapt away from the parapet and ran for the stairs thammir caught his arm jerked him around rey dont be an idiot you cant do anything reyna swore wrenched himself loose and slammed into thammir who wrapped his long arms about him and yelled in his ear rey its nonsense goandee furrah help me hold him reyna relaxed seemed to listen as thammir went on the barrier you cant get through that and even if you could theres the army you know what theyd do to any salagaum they got their hands on their hands loosened as reyna sighed let his head fall forward with a sudden burst of effort he broke free and was running down the stairs before they could regroup honey

yellow light that thickened and darkened boiled and seethed it drove back the red mist filled in the eaten places it grew higher and thicker and stronger magic amber swallowing the houses and the people the red mist faltered on the iron bridge the primes beat faster and harder grunts torn out of them with every stroke the kassos chant grew louder hoarser then began to tear apart as the strain took its toll of individuals within the choir old and young driven beyond their strength collapsing to the iron tiles of the bridge floor the high kassos voice soared strong and serene singing on and on without a break somehow as if breathing were not necessary on and on until the red mist came rushing back and whirled in a funnel round and round the primes and the high kasso then it sank into the anvil on the sacred forge the hammers fell to the tiles the primes collapsed juvalgrims voice soared a moment longer then cut off as he fell in a heap on the iron tiles the choirs chant shattered into discord broke off the pages fell their drumsticks clattering on the pavement of the north gatt road reyna ran between the warehouses if he could reach the water there was still a chance he heard a scrape behind him tried to throw himself aside but something crashed into his head he saw blackness filled with jagged lines and dots of white light then nothing the amrapake got to his feet waved his guard back and went to stand gazing down at the chaos below his face impassive worthless he said i stand by my word he turned his head glanced at the boys then at the men holding them do it he said the guards cut sivvys throat first then houens and threw them from the roof fuaz yoyote swallowed nervously stared at the roof tiles as if notseeing could keep the same from happening to him famtoche snapped his fingers and the hosts moved back when there was a clear space around him he beckoned to fuaz yoyote here worm an ashy look to his skin the tip of his tongue fluttering along dry lips the manasso prime hastened to the amrapakes side bobbing in a series of jerky bows heshim amrap famtoche pursed his lips watching him from narrowed eyes then he smiled i dont interfere in the internal affairs of the camuctarr he murmured yoyotes eyes flicked up then he went back to staring at the roof tiles bat if you dont mind a little practical advice manasso this would be a good time to revise the ah authority structure after this ah debacle i expect you wont have much difficulty dealing with the ah present high kasso breathing raggedly yoyote bowed lower i hear heshim amrap it will be done chapter dungeon juvalgrim woke in darkness and pain there was an iron harness on his head that trapped his tongue and held his mouth immobile he couldnt speak he could barely grunt his hands had been forced into iron gloves his arms strapped to his body he couldnt move his fingers and the tiny shifts he could make with his arms were useless for anything but easing cramps they know they have to know reyna tried to warn me klann why didnt i listen i thought i could ride this out till the change wrong guess ju stupid stupid it the fire for me fire fire it hit him suddenly and he panicked struggling desperately against the unyielding iron and the broad leather straps that bound him immobile he screamed tried to scream all that came out were animal grunts he rocked on the cot banged against the wall pulled at the gloves and surged against the straps tearing open his arms and wrists scraping skin and hair from his head his sphincters let go and the stench of feces and urine filled the cell he struggled on and on until he finally crashed off the cot and knocked himself out why us gahhh that stinks why dont they make those milklapping quiambos do it i mean thiss slave work fit for those pollutes not us shut up chutso yoyay he dont trust em thinks theyll let this potzpile loose you want that let him he slapped juvalgrim on the flank get to talking and well be doing worse witchman they say you wanna be a frog hunh yatz almost bled hisself juvalgrim groaned as they shifted him roughly about but they ignored that finished scrubbing him clean wrapped strips of bandages about the skin breaks threw a blanket over him and went out taking with them the rags of his tunic and trousers he shivered chilled by the cold water and the damp in the cell not many damp places this side of the river i must be down by the cisterns he sneezed klann rey oh rey i should have listened to you i should have gone with you taken my chances out there no thats not true id have sucked you in with me thats all blessings be youre out of this he swallowed sank into a drifting lethargy enduring the pain and discomfort his panic was over there was nothing he could do but prepare himself to endure what was coming with as much dignity as he could dredge chapter defense no days after the collapse of the attack at the iron bridge penhari pushed straggles of hair back from her face and

hell find it she frowned at the notes shed been making struggling to put together a coherent plan for managing low city and codify the practices that were developing out of need and those that were already in place sometimes she was terrified things would get away from her she tightened her lips it was like trying to close your hands on tadpoles they wiggled away in every direction no patterns no order i have to do something no time to think about that now she moved her shoulders shook her arms and went briskly out the door when penhari stepped into her private garden at the center of the rambling house desantro hit the grass in front of her came curling up and went at panote who turned his shoulder into her and flipped her again told you he said patiently inside and low he saw penhari

roofs other women and girls got their own cauldrons ready filled also with fish oil and melted lard with water if there was nothing else available in the kitchens the men bound knives to staves to make crude lances farmworkers shepherds and exslaves carried stones for their slings onto the roofs and piled them beside the cauldrons farmholders edgers and naostam porters accustomed to acting as night watchmen strung bows and laid out the arrows theyd been making in their spare time dossan and miugi whod dumped the other girl and come back to her and dozens like them fastened washlines across the wynds neck high ankle high then carted rubble and furniture to make barricades across the wynds children old enough to throw stones piled them up through their neighborhoods small unobtrusive cairns ready to hand when the need appeared throughout the city men and women youths and girls collected everything that could possibly serve as a weapon then they waited chapter pyre the manasso acolytes came for juvalgrim midmorning of the day after he woke in the cell they threw an old patched cloak over him then set him on his feet unbuckled the straps about his legs and made him walk ahead of them it was time for his burning he knew it though the only words they spoke were curt commands to get a move on turn right turn left hurting and hungry he didnt know if he had the strength to walk all the way down the jiko without falling on his face but he set himself to the task one foot then the other and after a while his body took over and his mind floated free fear was something far off like a stain of smoke on the horizon reyna he smiled as he thought about reyna the salagaum that yoyote despised was a better man than both of them twenty years of something love who knows it was good what they had no need to put a name to it one of the acolytes grabbed his arm and turned him onto the ramp that led down to the outer ring road sinking fingers into one of his larger bruises and startling a sound from him a low gulping moan that he cut off as soon as he could the pain went away the cloak fluttering about him he walked on the cheoshim towers were silent the parade grounds emptied out the windows like holes in a skull the biasharim towers were desolate with broken windows char marks from the fires that burned to ash the driedout womens gardens the prophet had purified the city all right it was so pure so sterile nothing could live there sadness drifted along beside him he remembered what had been and mourned it a little the sok circle was dusty and deserted the hot wind blew scraps of paper straw cloth across the paving stones plastered them against the pyres built there one in the middle and a dozen others scattered around the rim of the circle stacks of wood torn from abandoned houses and limbs from dead trees were piled neatly around the tall poles to make platforms for the prisoners to stand on the salagaum were there all of them that were left not many tied two to a pole their feet sunk into the wood piles reyna was alone in the middle tied to the pole that was waiting for him when juvalgrim saw him he struggled to say something but all he could make was a breathy gurgling sound that no one could hear two steps away be quiet you one of the acolytes slapped him hit the wound on his head and he catapulted into darkness he woke as cold water splashed into him heard a splat and clatter as the bucket man jumped down he was strapped to the pole his hands were pressed against reynas back he could feel reynas hands against his his detachment frayed blew away fire hed never been ole to deal with pain all his life hed slipped and slid to avoid even the hint of painand not just for himself there was that not just for himself a flare of pleasure at the thought it died fast pain was now he swallowed and struggled to keep his resolution dont give them the satisfaction dont let them see you crawl a drift of oily smoke blew into his face stung his eyes torches theyre really going to do it pervert destroyer of families demon lover juvalgrim blinked away the smoke tears that blurred his vision angled his head so he could look down prophet he gazed at the man with weary contempt satisfied prophet behold your labors and rejoice youve killed love and happiness joy and sharing youve killed the city as thoroughly as your no our god has killed the land the sibyl says it was unavoidable i spit on unavoidable he managed a kind of chuckle a gulping gurgle at the back of his throat or i would v you gave me back my tongue afraid of a word are you my doom is yours fool another gurgling chuckle too bad i wont be around to see it he trembled wrenched his mind away from the torches and what they meant drooping against the straps that bound him to the pole he watched the prophet stride about mouthing curses and anathemas overriding the manasso prime who wanted to get the burning started good boy keep it up the longer you go on the

she whined through her teethand danced she drew strength from the earthfire from the honeygirls who came and danced with her weaving through the grove from the wild magic swirling in a silver mist about her and almost none from the god the moththeries that belonged to the trees came dripping like rain down the sequba trunks and flittered about her drawn like mundane moths to a flame blood bruises lacing every inch of her body swaying and groaning goddriven through an endless wheeling dance she fought to hold while the prophet ranted and strode back and forth across the high city sok circle juvalgrirn drifted among his memories it was difficult to breathe the pressure from the straps and plates of the cage on his head numbed his skin and made his tongue swell and he was thirsty the heat from the punishing sun made that worse with every breath he drew there was nothing he could do no way he could escape this and he was no longer waiting for the change to rescue him there was an odd comfort in this passivity a rest from the weariness that had weighed him down hed been working so hard for so long he blinked watched with contempt as the prophet threw his arms out flung himself to his knees burn faharmoy howled head back eyes shining reda red glow about his wasted body burn and return to the father eyes like furnace holes fixed on the hot dustwhitened sky he began to mutter the praises manasso prime patted down his vestments and sent acolytes scurrying to form up his kassos so he could get the rite started the manassoa kassos were more familiar with balance sheets than music scores but they fumbled themselves into the proper order cleared their throats settled raggedly into the basic chant chu ma vay yal chu ma vay yal juvalgrim let his eyes drop shut and once more he was playing games in the back courts of the camuctarr swimming in the river sweating and breathless in the bed of the first woman hed had he refused to think of reyna it was too painful he wanted nothing painful now reynas head ached his body was one great bruise but no bones were broken and his skin was intact lots of crackling when i fry his swollen lips twitched into a brief painful smile at the thought he could feel juvalgrims back against his hands crackling together they say if you breathe the smoke you wont feel the fire gods faan my faany my honeybaby take care of yourself weary and so dry his skin was beginning to crack driven by a summons he couldnt break free of riverman reached the jiko sagrada and flinched from the searing heat of the black iron tiles please he said aloud youll kill me i cant i cant the summons intensified he shuddered then sat on a rock and began wrapping strands of tough sundried grass about his webbed feet chumavayal swings his hammer about his head faster and faster until it whistles through air that glows red with the heat of its passage round and round then he looses it sending it wheeling about abeyhamal wrapping a chain of fire about her cursing the south eka boys jigging unreachably in front of him champion onunad brought his saber round in a powerful circle and for the first time felt the barrier quiver then yield beneath the edge he shouted and struck again again the fourth time the saber sank in and stuck it felt like slicing through muscle into bone he wrenched it loose here he cried wallal famkon uchovu come here coordinate with me he brought the saber down through the softening barrier in the great grove faan screamed a bruise on her arm broke open blood sprayed over the clotted wild magic the sequba moththeries screamed and fell like wetted thistledown onto the churned black earth a strand of the silver motes flew at the honeychild pasted themselves over the wound holding it closed when the healing was done they peeled off leaving behind a silver scar that wound like a snake about her forearm she screamed again bruises burst blood soaked her blouse and skirt but she kept dancing round and round she danced spraying blood on trees and earth and the honeygirls dancing with her her eyes rolled back her mouth stretched wide in a soundless howl she fainted the barrier fell at south eka the attackers collapsed into confusion as the resistance theyd been fighting melted away warhorses stumbled lancers went to their knees swordsmen staggered at the iron bridge the blowtorch which the primes had evoked whooshed into the warehouses and the rambling low tenements of the edge burning to ash everything in its path until it beat against the rim of an abey grove and fell apart stunned by a success they hadnt really expected the kassos let the beat fall to silence until the macho prime threw up his arms drummers follow he cried and plunged in the path of the fire chu ma vay yal chu ma vay yal doom doom da doomweighted sticks wheeling the drummers marched across the bridge tinka tinkhammer against anvil the kassos picked up the beat again and crossed into the low city mateesee wrenched loose from the disintegrating dance and ran to faan who lay in a limp heap sequba roots like arms curled around her dossy ampmere help me she knelt beside faan straightening her out then slapping lightly at her face come on fa wake up everythings crashing we need you she pressed her fingers under faans jaw sighed with relief as she felt the steady thumpthump of the pulse looked up as dossan stumbled over to her we gotta get her to tai help me make a chair dossan gazed vaguely at her fumbled with her hands let them fall bouzh it dossy we dont move we gonna get killed panting and half dead riverman stumbled into the shade of the sibyls cave it wasnt much cooler there but at least there was no sun he moved his tongue over dry and cracking lips limped deeper into the dark there was a small round hole gouged in the stone in front of the sibyls chair cool clear water lapped at the edges with a fizzpop of intense pleasure he plunged into the pool sinking deep deep into the coolness and wet that was life itself healing the ravages of the long climb when he surfaced finally he looked up to see the sibyl sitting in the chair why he said what have i done to you nothing godlet i need you thats all need he pulled himself up and sat on the edge of the tiny pool his aching feet dangling in the water got more need put on me than i got skin he scratched at a pointed ear then dug for water mites in the rough brown weed growing about his loins the sibyl tapped a long forefinger on the stone arm of her chair then spoke a word that shook the air but made no sound a shimmer drifted to hang in front of riverman a streak of silver light the length of his arm there was a loud ping the shimmer solidified into a miniature saber then splashed down in the pool just missing his webbed toes youll need that riverman itll cut through anything you want severed the sibyl laughed at the face he made dont worry godlet it wont cut you now heres what i want you to do abeyhamal whirls her fimbo held horizontally and waist high gold fire flows from the tip fighting and dissolving the red fire she roars her rage and leaps across the anvil the butt of her fimbo striking the brazier and knocking it over the coals skipping out across the forge floor the red life in them slowly fading to gray the kassos and the primes marched off the iron bridge chanting chu ma vay yal chu ma vay yal ghost drums beating hammers and anvils tinka tinking tramping on the ash of the folk and buildings burned by the fire then the stones came from every side the stones came an arrow pierced the throat of the anacho prime a half dozen skewered the anaxoa prime the kassos scurried for the shelter of the iron bridge falling to stones falling to arrows dead and wounded abandoned where they fell champion ommad yelled for his warhorse cursing as his twelveyearold page fought toward him through the stream of riders plunging into the south eka kummata he swung into the saddle roared at the mob get back you jeggin meat form up ill have your guts for gitter strings formation you sucking tsous a few heard him and slowed their charge came back to form up behind him their faces carefully blank only a few confident in their training and their weapons filled with contempt for these squatters these peasants furious at the taunting theyd endured lancers and hostas alike charged into the city theyd been blooded in slave raids and bandit chases had never faced a hostile city roused to resist them they expected to ride over the feebs and slaughter as they chose the wynds were narrow and crooked and the squatters had built their barricades around curves the warhorses crashed into these before their riders saw them or they stumbled over ropes strung low between the houses the higher ropes caught the riders in their throats knocked them onto the rutted earth where they were trampled by the horses behind them and the hostas running along beside them on the flat roofs of the onestory buildings the women howled an ululating eerie sound then they tipped the cauldrons over the low parapets and sent the boiling fluids cascading onto the attackers children ran from houses into side wynds threw stones at the intruders scampered back inside giggling and triumphant more stones rained frum the roofs from the slings of the shepherds and the others squatters with hammers and kitchen knives darted out of houses and sidewynds swanned over men thrown down cut throats and hammered heads some were killed but most got away with scratches and bruises the blundering attack degenerated into a rout leaving their wounded to the knives of the squatters the lancers and the hostas staggered from the city the naostam runner came panting into the kummhouse reception room so excited she could barely speak theyre buzzitin zazi we did it we did it penhari lifted a hand calmly runner itll be harder when they come again much harder she smiled at the girl but we did beat them this time one by one the other runners came in with reports from their kummatas reports of rout and people dancing in the wynds and on the rooftops dancing in the groves of cheoshim and hostas running with their tails between their legs of kassos fleeing like frightened rats vema vema penhari said all this is grand but its not time for celebrating yet theyll come again and this time theyll come as warriors not as a mob theyll come by inches and slaughter as they move she smiled grimly into the suddenly sobered young faces i depend upon you runners if you get yourselves killed you blind me after this go in pairs if ones cut down the other can carry the word run the rooftops not the wynds its slower i know but safer she paused until they decide to clear the roofs watch out for that she scooped up a pile of sealed packets from her desk dont let anyone see this but your kumms get it to them safe and fast as you can bring me back any questions or objections do you understand good she handed out the packets with the plans shed labored over for hours consulting panote the kassian tai and desantro pulling together the reports from the kummate about the people and resources of their kummatas adding in all she remembered of the ramblings of the general about the cheoshim and their training all shed learned from faharmoy runners stuffed the packets in their pouches and went trotting out sting to be so young and so eager i never was she shivered swallowed the bile of ancient anger that rose in her throat i never had a chance to be faan woke in the kummhouse infirmary blinked up into the kassian tais worried face fa tais voice cracked on the word she cleared her throat howre you feeling faan pushed up without answering she could hear sounds coming through the windowpans banging the small drums that everyone seemed to have over here toomtooming away shouts and laughter i couldnt hold zazi dont worry honey we drove them back tails tucked faan shivered what listen to me fa it doesnt matter theyre gone even the kassos theyre back across the iron bridge chewed up enough to respect our teeth juvalgrim not there this time i expect our high kasso has lost his footing at last mamay faan swung her legs over the edge of the cot looked frantically about if they got him they got reyna i know it wherere my clothes tai i have hush hush honey tai reached out to touch faans cheek but faan jerked away i dont know whats going on over there child no one can cross the river now no one i can faan got to her feet swung her arms out for balance as her head swam she stiffened her back drew in a long breath exploded it out i can she repeated grimly she looked down at the skimpy shift which was all she had on my clothes where are my clothes abeyhamal abeyhamal can go jegg herself the deal was she kept rey out of trouble well thats off and sos the rest i mean it tai if i have to go like this i will tai looked suddenly older vema fa what you were wearing well well have to burn it i had dossan fetch some clean things she gestured toward a small chest beside the door then turned to leave in the doorway she paused looked over her shoulder i do want to remind you honey abeyhamal has a lot more than you to worry about she closed the door gently behind her faan grimaced vema she muttered then began the loosening exercises panote had taught her working the dizziness from her head the knots from her muscles you and i never did count zazi you dont want to know it but its the truth when she was feeling steady again she dressed and left the room scowling wondering where ailiki had gotten to riverman jogged down the path trying to get used to the soft shoes the sibyl had spelled about his feet so he could run the black iron tiles without cooking himself he slowed as he came to the charred stump of the old olive tree a small limber shoot with shiny green leaves had grown up from the roots he hadnt noticed it when he passed on the way to the cave but this time the wind shook it and it seemed to wave to him he laughed his fizzy laugh returned the wave and started down the jiko sagrada he crept along the deserted kariam clinging to the ashy shadow of the dead kichidawa hedges cautious despite the empty silence of the towers he wrinkled his short broad nose shifted his grip on the horn hilt of the saber annoyed at the sibyl for not providing a sheath for it he reached the circle ducked under the raised boardwalk in front of the shops and began circling behind the kassos and the strikers any sounds he made lost in the ragged chanting of the manassos the reedy voice of the prime going on about something he didnt bother puzzling out the primes words it was all human nonsense anyway this breast beating and reading profundities into the accidents of appetite a god was a force you dealt with like a blizzard or a tornado when they were around you kept your head down when they werent you did your best not to arouse them he wouldnt be here now if the sibyl hadnt laid this geas on him fond as he was of the honeychild it wasnt him she was going to lead to freedom and as for the riverlet abeyhamal finish this thing the rains would be back and the water clear again ah well ah well wouldbe was as useless as regret best to just get on with it juvalgrim and reyna were atop the pyre in the center of the circle he eyed them sniffed with exasperation into the mouth of the beast he squatted under the boards scratched his drooping weedfur and tried to figure out how he was supposed to cross that empty space without some fidgeting wandereye spotting him and raising a shout eyes everywhere i cant do this sibyl o sibyl im just a little riverman theyll throw me on the fire and burn me to ash sounds from across the river drifted to him on the freshening wind sliding through the pauses between syllablesshouts womens howling screams crashings the second attack was beginning that must be why the towers were so emptymost of the cheoshim had crossed the river now that the bridges were open too bad there was going to be a lot of hurt and death this day humans ephemerals sibyl called them minh pain was pain if you lived one year or a thousand let evil be driven from our midst fuaz yoyote intoned all praise to all powerful all knowing iron father chu ma vay yal chu ma vay yal chanted the manasso kassos the torch bearers ducked the oilsoaked batting corded about the ends of the long poles into the sacred brazier marched with cheoshim strikers as escorts to the pyres at the edge of the circle four went to the center two torches each for juvalgrim and reyna sweet man that prime the kassos jabbed the butts of the poles against their feet held the smoking torches at an angle and waited for the sign to fire up the wood the prophet knelt arms stretched out mouthing the words of the praises the sound of his voice lost in the louder noise of the ritual chumavayal dips into the dying coals of the fire scoops up huge handfuls and flings them at the bee mother flings them to the right of her the left of her and before her and pulls flames from them driving the fire tongues at her wind howled through the empty wynds and lcarinms of the high city threads of black cloud swirled overhead black and heavy with wet a spray of rain spattered on the dust and grit of the pavement let the evil be routed the souls of the sinners fly to the father now fuaz yoyote sputtered as a spate of raindrops hit him in the face he wiped the water away smiled as he saw the torch bearers whiri and thrust their fire into those piles of tinder wood riverman crouched under the boardwalk gnawing his lip the dry wood was going with a roar oh my fur oh my feet he wailed ducked under the support timber and scuttled for juvalgrims pyre abeyhamal roars sweeps her massive fimbo in a circle that scatters the coals jabs the point high wet black clouds swirl from it lightning jags from it wind howls round and round the floor in the land wind snatches faan off her feet whirls her across the river thunder boomed lightning danced in jags among the pyres the wind rose abruptly to hurricane force sweeping around and around the sok circle the wind pushed at reyna battered at him but the ropes held though they cut into his wrists and twisted his left arm until a long bone broke the wind flopped him again and agdm against the pole bone grating against bone breaking through the skin blood dripping down mixing with the rain juvalgrim heard himscream felt him sag against the ropes he wrenched at the straps but he couldnt move smoke from the pyres was curling round him he tried to speak he fought to form the words of power in his head and force them to work nothing the kassians and the cheoshim were blown out of the circle slammed into the shuttered and boarded up shops the wind swirled around the kneeling muttering prophet it didnt shift so much as a hair of his beard the smoke was thick and low raindrops the size of olives drove through it and beat at riverman knocking him flat several times each time he scrambled to his feet and scurried on he reached the pyre sprang and caught a protruding branch pulled himself onto it peered through the smoke for another hold the saber was a nuisance slowing him down but he couldnt leave it behind he had to have some way of cutting the ropes and straps flames tickling at his feet he fought his way up the pile faan dropped to the paving in front of the prophet an amber fimbo glowing in her right hand for a long moment they stared at each other then faharmoy got to his feet faan turned her back on him no she cried stop this stop it the fires no no no i will not abeyhamal drives the point of her fimbo at the iron fathers chest he lifts his hammer to smash it but she laughs a mocking humming laugh shifts direction and drives the point into the clouds above them rain falls in silver sheets the last coals die rain fell in battering floods drowning the fires riverman wrapped his alms around reynas ankle grabbed at his trousers and hung on as the wind and water threatened to wash him off the pyre faharmoys hands closed about faans throat she shouted a word wind roared round them swept them off their feet flung them against the paving stones faharmoy hit first he was stunned and his hands were jarred loose by the time he was thinking again faan was a bodylength away the dance began feet stamping to the beat of earth heart they circled danced breast to chest broke apart oscillated through arcs shuffle to the right shuffle to the left back and forth back and forth as if a resilient sphere rolled between them blocking each from the other lightning walked around them the rain had diminished to a drizzle the droplets settling on every fold of their clothing on their hair and arms riverman swore under his breath and began struggling up the pole using the ropes and straps to help him climb hold still he whispered in juvalgrims ear im going to cut you loose sibyl sent me and im a friend of your friends daughter you hear juvalgrim stiffened then produced a low gurgle deep in his throat that riverman took to mean assent he inspected the hinges and straps then began cutting cautiously cheered to find the sibyl was right the saber cut steel like cheese and left living flesh alone he finished with the cage and the neck strap juvalgrim started to shake he was trying to hold still but he couldnt the cage fell off hit the top of the pyre rolled off and clattered on the paving stones swearing under his breath riverman lowered himself to the chest rope that bound reyna and juvalgrim together slashed through it scrambled between them to the iron gloves that immobilized juvalgrims hands the wind whipped grit past him the drizzle made the pole desperately slippery though the wet did increase his strength he used the saber to hack toe holds in the wood worked his way round until he could cut the straps that bound the right glove together it fell with a satisfactory thump he glanced at the dancers snorted then wriggled around to deal with the other hand getting nowhere round and round idiot gods theres not going to be anything left if they dont he dealt with the left hand and scrambled back to cut through the ropes that tied reynas arms to the post saw the jut of bone the wash of blood and hissed with annoyance sibyl you want this one alive you better do something he crawled along the arm until he reached the break well a snatch of breeze stirred his brown sagging weed fur hold tight and lay the sword alongside the bone came whispering in his pointed ear tongue between his teeth he wrapped his hand in the rags of reynas blouse slapped the sword down flat on reynas arm the arm bucked and twitched the sword sank into the dark copper skin the wound closed over riverman pulled himself back down the arm clutched reynas trembling wrist tsah tsah he muttered now how am i supposed to no answer he wrinkled his nose then started chewing at the rope the fimbo slipped in faans sweaty hand she shifted her grip wiped her palm on her shirt the cloth was soaked so that didnt help much she switched hands again and tried to relax into the dance abeyhamal was jerking her through she didnt understand the point of this posturing and she was sick with anger because she couldnt escape the grip of the god power power she danced power power power i will not she screamed inside i will not i will not let it happen again i will not i will not get it done she told herself get this over with faharmoy slapped his hands together tbngues of fire licked at faan she snorted with disgust brought fire leaping along her arms blue flamelets that wriggled and chattered their hunger at her she loosed a pair of them and they engulfed the red fire ate it and plunged toward faharmoy chumavayal roared his anger reached down and swatted the fire elementals into another universe then slapped out intending to crush faan abeyhamal kicked the brazier over scattering the coals as a part of the same movement she brought the point of the fimbo hard against the old gods chest striking him over the heart the coals died chumavayal shriveled until he was a tiny black baby lying on the forge floor as the tenuous black hand swept at her faan dropped to her stomach it passed over her and was gone she leapt to her feet ran at faharmoy the tip of the fimbo touched him over the heart went driving through empty space she scrambled frantically to keep from stepping on the baby wailing in the rags of his brown robe when she was steady on her feet again she looked around the people in the circle were indistinct shadows fading silently away into rapidly thickening fog moving toward the river juvalgrim was helping reyna down from the pyre they started off together mamay she ran after him caught at his armgasped as he looked down at her from eyes empty of all mind or understanding she dropped her hand he turned and walked after juvalgrim with a grim mechanical deliberation a small hand slapped her leg honey give us a lift mmmh she looked down riverman what its over fa the change is starting she pulled her hand across her face he didnt know me he looked at me and he didnt know me its the change honey hes forgetting thats the way it works if you keep after him any longer youll forget too you want that no then you need to get to the sibyls cave she bent cupped her hand he stepped into it and held onto her sleeve as she lifted him waist high mild i dont know fa he settled into the crook of her arm quick there isnt much time left she looked around a last time there was no one left in the circle even the baby faharmoy had vanished this is what its all about all the starving all the fighting all the dying a touch on the chest timings all faan you and her touching together waste she blinked shook her head then started trotting for the nearest kariam she was too tired and too numb to feel anything yet grief or triumph the forge floor melted into the air leaving a circle of crisp green grass with a conical hive in the center a garden filled with the sound of water and with flowers whose perfumes drifted aimlessly on wandering breezes gossamer bees like bits of sunlight hummed from bloom to bloom and back to the hive a grand sequba grew beside a stream its moththeries flittering about changing color in a visual song of pleasure in their new freedom abeyhamal laid the baby on the grass leaving him for the sun to feed him the rain to quench histhirst his excretions were perfumed and ephemeral sublimating into the garden air like dew evaporating in the morning she settled herself on a sequba root and contemplated with intense satisfaction the realm that was now hers alone the low city was silent the wynds and ways filled with yellowwhite mist the dead lay where they fell but the wounded rose and stood staring at nothing their bones and muscle healing as the mist eddied about them penhari sat in the heart garden of the kummhouse staring vacantly at the mist there was a weight in her lap she looked down a baby the baby wailed without thinking she unbuttoned her blouse and put him to her breast which was suddenly heavy with milk at the first swallow the baby stiffened his body convulsed began to change in minutes what had been a boy child was a girl a hungry vigorous little girl penhari laughed and shook her head and forgot ailiki came lollopping from the sibyls cave circled round faan reared on her hind legs and clapped her forepaws together faan smiled the lump in her throat eased a little she set riverman down straightened her shoulders and walked into the shadow her gear and faans were in two leather bags by her feet desantro was squatting beside the sibyls chair looking angry and confused she stood when she saw faan maybe you can tell me whatn janns going on here the beast of yours went crazy it kept biting me like i was a sheep it was herding the kassian said to pack up and follow it sibyl the old woman looked tired it was necessary youll need a companion faan someone to teach you how to survive once you leave the land leave you have no place here honeychild not any longer no home no family nothing faan clenched her teeth her eyes prickled with tears she was too angry and too stubborn to shed desantro slapped at her thigh gaangah dont i get any say what i do or dont the sibyl turned her head looked down no desantro snorted got to her feet one jeggin thing atop nother well least i get outta here faan swung round walked to the front of the cave and looked out across the land all she could see below the black points that were the peaks of the jinocabur mountains was a billowing yellowwhite fog her breathing was ragged she scrubbed the heel of her hand across her eyes the rage that filled her was trapped inside her there was no one to vent it on and it frightened her i cant deal with this i cant ailiki brushed against her legs wove around her warm and soft faan gasped shuddered when ailiki reared on her hind legs she caught her up held her against her face the mahsars purring vibrated through her eased the tightness a little and reminded her that there wasmaybesomething left the thing shed wanted to know and couldnt find outwho she was where she came from maybe now she turned and came slowly back to the sibyl my mother can you tell me now give me a hint or something the sibyl tented her fingers looked over them at faan her bright black eyes were twinkling more than a hint honeychild your mother is a sorceror called kori piyolss youll find her in the myktat tukery on an island called jal vith i see and how do i get there when the fog clears youll find a ship tied up at the camuctarr gat vroliko ryos rostokul the crews sleeping through the change but theyll wake for you she smiled dont forget your studies little soreerie faan shivered went back to the cave mouth and stood watching the fog boil goddance the beginning riverman on her shoulder the sibyl stood at the mouth of the cave and watched faan run down the path desantro close behind her the change was complete the fog had cleared away the morning was crisp and cold the sky gray with clouds underfoot fogomalin was rumbling riverman tugged at her ear whats bothering you mmh faan what a mess these gods make and they never clean up after themselves abeyhamal godlet she set a shell over jul virri i doubt even a sorceror could break through now that the change is done she has no doubt forgot all that and even if she hasnt the sibyl shrugged by tomorrow godlet your river will be flashing itself clean stay with me a while then we both can rest until it starts again it already has
