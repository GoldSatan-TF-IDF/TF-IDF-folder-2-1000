the predators brian freemantle chapter one none of it should have happened but all of it did and the mounting coincidences and innocent errors fatally confused the initial search for mary beth mcbride and by the time that search evolved into anything like a proper investigation it was too late mary was already a victim it began with something as ordinary as a puncture which briefly caused a traffic jam on the rue du chene along which the embassy driver a local belgian named claude luc was taking a short cut to the school the us security officer william boles agreed that it was a bastard even as he was strictly following the wellrehearsed routine before allowing luc to change the wheel he telephoned the embassy from the car phone for a backup vehicle to collect mary and then he called the school to warn of the delay the confusion arose when the embassy duplicated that warning call misunderstanding the second contact the school secretary thought that the relief vehicle had already arrived and it was no longer necessary to keep the child on the premises the last of the stragglers were just being collected or driven away when mary beth mcbride emerged on to the rue du canal and realized there was no car waiting for her marys security briefing was as well rehearsed but far simpler than that of william boles she should have turned back into the building and asked someone to telephone the embassy to find out what had happened but mary beth mcbride was a wilfully precocious bracetoothed tenyearold who welcomed the chance not only to prove she was quite capable of finding her own way unescorted around brussels but also to see her usual driver and escort who she knew didnt like her take the blame during the later tellingoff it was they who would be punished not she no one ever punished her to make sure she thoroughly worried everyone mary decided to take the most roundabout route possible to get home she would use the metro and let her mother find the ticket in her pocket mary was absolutely forbidden to use the system had never in her life been on an underground train anywhere in the world but was sure she could work it out from the map at the street entrance theyd hardly be able to believe it in class tomorrow when she told them she knew all the other girls admired her she wasnt frightened of doing things as they all were thats why she was the leader the person they all copied it would cause one of those fights between mom and dad too mary never reached the metro although she could see a station at the next road junction she frowned sideways at the car that suddenly drew up beside her irritated at the disruption of her plans and by the shape of the mercedes different from the car that normally picked her up her escort wasnt normally a woman either mary didnt recognize this one although she knew there were women among the embassys security detachment a car behind them began sounding its horn impatiently are you from my father mary demanded imperiously theyd already know they were in trouble for being late yes lied felicite galan speaking in english because the child had get in wheres bill and claude asked mary demandingly offering her backpack for the woman to take before sliding into the rear beside felicite it was grownup to address the men who normally came for her by their given names would let these two know how they had to behave the car behind hooted again they had to do something else improvised felicite she was looking intently at the girl smiling in anticipation to henri cool at the wheel felicite said in french shes lovely weve done well mary couldnt remember any of her escorts talking french which she knew well enough to interpret the remark although not understand it youre going to get into trouble for being late no were not said felicite the driver laughed mary knew brussels sufficiently to identify the cathedrale de st michel she said this isnt the way to the embassy momentarily felicite hesitated off balance aware of cools startled look in the rearview mirror she said were not going to the embassy where then demanded the child youre going on an adventure promised the woman prepared for the question the driver pressed the central locking system and the buttons on all the doors clicked down even though the reardoor childlocks were already in place disabling the handles what sort of adventure demanded mary this woman wasnt as respectful to her as bill was shed tell dad wait and see i dont want to you dont have a choice at that moment the second security man in the backup collection vehicle reported to the american embassy on the boulevard du regent that mary had vanished and the panic began in the office suite of the united states ambassador to belgium james mcbride chapter two they usually got frightened during a drive as long as this crying wetting themselves hysterical but this one didnt rather she was defiantly unafraid arrogantly unafraid and felicite a constant seeker for anything new anything not tried before was excited would the child fight later none of the others had ever tried not seriously hysteria gave way to cowed bewildered acceptance submissive apathy boring it really would be exciting if this one fought back defied them she was small maybe no older than eight although that would have been very young to be walking by herself the prime requirement to be as young as possible young but aware hair good lustrous hair in plaits oscar wildes hair all her bright golden hair tarnished with rust she that was young and fair fallen to dust felicite mouthed the creed part of her article of faith this childs hair was golden tarnished by a suggestion of redness pity about all that metal clamped in her mouth proof if it were needed that mary beth mcbride was an american why did all american children have to have the output of a steel mill in their mouths never had an american child before have to get rid of the brace felicite reached out to stroke marys cheek but the girl jerked away although still without fear it was an impatient irritated movement where are we going i told you an adventure i want to go back to brussels now if youre a naughty girl ill slap you part of the fun the control the best part shed make her cry plead but not now too soon now when she chose to maybe just the slightest correction no one slaps me i might be careful an idea was forming in felicites mind a new fantasy it would give her the sort of absolute supreme control shed never had before her very own marionette show a jumping contorting cast of dozens if not hundreds performing to her will as she pulled the strings i have already told you my name is mary beth mcbride and that my father is the american ambassador to belgium i heard you so had henri cool felicite knew he wasnt excited as she was sufficiently aroused for her voice to be fragile he was scared very scared driving erratically out of brussels until shed warned him he was driving erratically again now youre going too fast she said sharply what the hells wrong with you he slowed but only just to within the limit weve made a mistake weve got to get to do something about it shut up snapped felicite wondering how good the american girls french was take me back to brussels immediately demanded mary again in english giving the woman no indication of her language comprehension felicite managed to pat marys leg before the child pulled away dont be a silly girl youll get into dreadful trouble both of you cool took the beveren road better to bypass antwerp but too abruptly the tyres screeched the rear of the car sliding slightly felicite said almost there now to the man at the wheel whose eyes were more often in the rearview mirror than on the road in front she said i told you to slow down do something get us out of this said cool his voice was cracked i make the decisions you do the driving so drive whats your name mary demanded of the woman at the opposite end of the seat felicite laughed i know yours but you cant know mine its my secret i know what you are what youre going to do this was an adventure much better than riding the metro do you smiled felicite aware of henris startled reflection my father will pay hes very rich the womans smile widened the childs remark chimed with the idea that had already occurred to her of course hell pay for someone as pretty as you so you understand demanded the child totally i meant what i said about no one slapping me im sure you did so dont forget abruptly reading the signpost as they passed she said antwerp is that where were going to a big house on the river youll like it i wont well see the child looked away to stare out of the car the rain had started almost as soon as they left brussels and the clouds were thicker heavier nearer the coast ushering in the nighttime darkness felicite lounged back as far away on the seat as she could get studying the girls mirrored image in the window glass it was a good idea would be an experience she hadnt enjoyed before but had to savour now shed thought of it as she had to taste every forbidden fruit the others probably wouldnt like it theyd be frightened like henri but theyd do as they were told as they always did shed have to rearrange things with the estate agent in namur and speak to eindhoven and lille to tell them everything was postponed simple reorganization she was good at organization thats why everyone had been so happy relieved for her to take over after marcels death yes felicite decided shed definitely do it cool was forced to slow by the volume of traffic on his backstreet negotiation around antwerp but it wasnt until he was almost clear of the city that he was brought to a positive halt at traffic lights felicite didnt move when mary snatched for the door handle exaggerating her laugh at the childs helpless yanking on the useless unconnected lever the woman did react though when mary opened her mouth to scream sure of not being seen from the outside rainsodden gloom she lashed out hard before the cry was formed catching the unsuspecting girl fully in the face to strangle the sound into a whimpering gasp as much of astonishment as of pain i told you id slap you didnt i said felicite casually as the flat grey ribbon of the sluggish schelde river broke occasionally to their left through the vast skeletal forest of cranes and container rigs of the port youve got lessons to learn rules to obey mary glared malevolently across at her lips tight against any blood leaking from the split inside her lip and cheek youre still not going to cry are you demanded felicite hopefully no mary allowed herself tongue against the cut the blood tasted nasty metallic im going to enjoy you said the woman enjoy you a lot mary didnt understand the remark and couldnt think of anything to say although she wanted to so she tightened her mouth again she was very proud of not crying despite the pain in her mouth where the brace had cut she didnt have anything really to cry about be frightened of dad would pay and hed punish them he had men to do that men with things like hearing aids in their ears and sometimes little knobs pinned to their jacket lapels that they talked into shed have to be careful not to miss anything out when she got back to school it really would be difficult for the rest of the class to believe the beach house wasnt really on a beach although there was a shoreline and shingle and a bathing hut collapsing from neglect and the constant battering from north sea winds the main building was just short of the dutch border where the river fanned out into the westerschelde isolated by at least two kilometres from its nearest neighbour a major consideration for its use its basement encompassed and utilized with specific modifications the impregnable blockhouse constructed by the nazis in the second world war to protect such an essential waterway the north sea gale was driving the rain horizontally by the time the mercedes reached the threestorey shutterprotected house in front of which three other cars all mercedes already stood henri cool had to stand against the rear door to hold it open to release felicite and the child as she got out mary was caught by the force of the wind and became entangled in the straps of her backpack she would have fallen completely if the woman hadnt grabbed her widearmed and protective cool propelled them towards the house in its lee the wind was only slightly less fierce and still more than enough to defeat the sudden dash that mary had intended she didnt even try allowing herself instead to be shepherded through the unlocked door into the vaulted highceilinged entrance hall the relief was abrupt and disorientating felicite and mary staggered afresh without the need to brace themselves against the storm although the wind continued to hammer at the closed shutters as if trying to get at them felicite still clutched mary a hand on each of the childs shoulders she hurried her across the hall not giving her the chance to recover alongside cool had the basement door already open mary was gasping finding it difficult to breathe when they got to the bottom of the stairs she stood there trembling from the cold wetness but still she told herself not from fear she felt instead bewilderment and she did her best to hide that too not wanting the woman who had hit her to misunderstand not wanting to give her any satisfaction it was a huge room extending the length and width of the house which was in effect a lid put over the entire original german bunker its metrethick concrete concealed now behind lighter wood panelling than that in the upstairs hall totally silenced the outside tempest more important it contained any sound from what now regularly occurred inside making its remoteness from neighbours unnecessary the floor was thickly carpeted too except for the very centre where there was a cleared wooden circle for dancing the ceiling was entirely glassed there were lounging divans around three walls dominating the fourth was a huge television or movie screen on either side there were five separate doors all were closed two were solid their only break an eyelevel sliding metal viewing strip both were shuttered in the furthest corner was an array of musicplaying equipment incongruously surrounded by disco and strobe lights it was very warm almost too hot and there was a cloying perfumed smell mary shivered for the first time positively uncertain quickly she said im cold my clothes are wet its too warm here for you to be cold but take your clothes off if theyre uncomfortable there was harshness in the womans voice no the child said quickly more through instinct than understanding weve got to talk to the others insisted cool impatiently at the doorway we dont want her to catch cold in wet clothes come on protested the man felicite hesitated before shrugging reluctantly she grabbed marys arm again holding too tightly thrusting her towards the blank peepholed doors this is the room where we play games she said as they scurried across it she opened the door to the left pushing the child through and this is where youre going to live there were five men waiting in the upstairs room they entered minutes later and the excited expectation was palpable we saw you arrive said jean smet shes pretty theres a problem blurted cool the atmosphere was still palpable but very different from when they had entered felicite sprawled in the huge encompassing chair shed adopted as her own her throne when they used this house not trying to hide her contempt at their instant response to what they had been told there were six men in the group that marcel had brought together a disparate gathering with only their sexual predilection in common none in fact particularly liked each other jean smet and michel blott were lawyers smet usefully in the justice ministry blott in richly rewarding private practice august dehane was a senior executive in belgian state telecommunications belgacom and henri cool who had just identified mary mcbride as an ambassadors daughter was a deputy headmaster gaston mehre ran an antique gallery in antwerp and provided a home and protection for his mentally retarded brother charles it was charles who maintained the beach house when they were using it a willing slave to them all he was also the most unpredictably dangerous no definitely no said smet leading the opposition he was a tall thin smoothskinned man whose receding hair was greased straight back from a longago forehead yes insisted felicite mildly the side of the lounge to her left overlooking the river was glass and the shutters werent closed it was double glazed keeping out most of the sound but the waves churned and crashed to the boundary wall throwing up spray against the outside pane idly with no intention of provoking any of the men with all of whom except charles mehre shed had sex felicite unbuttoned her shirt she was not wearing a bra and just as casually as shed unfastened the shirt she began massaging her nipples shes seen us you and me protested cool a burly disordered man whose clothes never fitted she could identify us and she was paying attention to how we got here from antwerp i saw her in the mirror who said anything about letting her go demanded the woman henris right said blott a glandularly fat man whose eyes blinked in constant nervousness behind wireframed glasses it was a mistake easily made its no ones fault but now she should be killed there was no shock from any of them at the easy insistence upon murdering a child as there hadnt been when cool and dehane had made the same demand earlier a year before a boy theyd snatched had died during a party in the house since then they had used child prostitutes usually brought in from amsterdam perhaps she conceded the idea upon which she was by now quite determined stemmed from the excitement shed got then knowing she was being hunted but always able to evade suspicion or capture because of how cleverly smet had inveigled himself which he could do again now she knows were near antwerp asked gaston mehre she read a sign out when we passed it confirmed cool taking off yet again thicklensed heavyframed spectacles for another unnecessary polish then its madness to keep her alive said dehane he was a slightly built selfeffacing man always eager to follow where others led its an unnecessary danger agreed gaston mehre he and charles had been born just nine months and seven days apart both redhaired their features practically matching even to identically twisted teeth it was charles who had been with the rent boy when hed died hed badly hurt another young male prostitute three months earlier what danger said felicite shes in a cell where shes going to stay and we cant be traced to the house in which shes being held it had been felicites idea that the houses they used should be owned by others with the same interests who lived in conveniently close neighbouring countries the antwerp beach house was registered in the name of pieter lascelles a sixtyyearold eindhoven surgeon georges lebron a parish priest in lille owned the country cottage near herentals where the dutch met and felicite had a bigger house at goirle for larger parties james mcbride is the american ambassador implored smet its his daughter downstairs you cant imagine what sort of outcry theres going to be which is precisely why its going to be so exciting said felicite before it was the son of a bankrupt jewish shopkeeper in ghent and the investigation was handled by police who would have been overstrained by a bicycle theft argued smet this wont be anything like that this will be enormous youre just going to have to be as clever as you were last time smiled felicite enjoying the mans terror she wondered if she would ever weary of the weakness of these men the ease of manipulating them she knew marcel was becoming increasingly bored just before his heart attack she still missed marcel not only for the loss of the sexual avenues along which hed led her marcel would have seen the thrill the pleasure in what she wanted to do might have tolerated this dispute as she was tolerating it but wouldnt have allowed it to go on for so long whats the point demanded dehane its something we havent done before said felicite simply the thought doesnt excite me said the lawyer nor me said cool but it does me insisted felicite i got her i decide what we do with her and ive decided that before the party at which our ambassadors little daughter will eventually be the star im going to organize the perfect crime a kidnap its an insane idea protested smet i wont have it you wont have it challenged felicite recognizing her moment please muttered the tall man in immediate retreat i want you to do what you did before she switched to dehane and you must make it impossible for them to trace us when we start making our demands its your chance august to show us all how clever you are she let her voice trail looking around the assembled men determined to end the dispute whos the link with lille taking the risks no one else does no one spoke immediately then smet said you are and with eindhoven you said the justice ministry lawyer what would happen to all of you if i abandoned you gaston said please dont do that jean she persisted smet shrugged its a good group which you dont want broken up no he conceded weakly good said felicite briskly so were agreed about what i want to do their yes came as a muted chorus pieter lascelles said the postponement was unfortunate his friends had been looking forward to it it wont be for long felicite promised youll love what ive found in namur an actual medieval castle with turrets and towers and dungeons how long asked the surgeon a couple of weeks thats all she gave the same reply to georges lebron the priest said well wait before we choose someone then we dont want to attract attention yes agreed felicite do that hans doorn the namur estate agent with whom felicite had agreed the rental of what was in fact a sixteenthcentury chateau said he hoped it was only a postponement felicite reminded him that he already had the deposit doorn reassured hoped to hear from her soon felicite promised he would chapter three the ambassadors study was overcrowded with people and wideawake nightmares no one wanted or knew how to confront the very worst obviously was the everyparent horror of james and hillary mcbride the ambassador was hunched at his enormous desk all courtesy forgotten his birdlike sharpfeatured stridentvoiced wife close beside him her hand on his shoulder in what everyone mistook for reassurance it was in fact to urge the man on it was also the closest they had physically been to each other publicly or privately for years and the first occasion for an equally long time that theyd come together with anything like an agreed purpose apart from their consuming political ambitions paul harding the portly strayhaired resident fbi station chief was moving jerkily about the room he was engulfed by the scale of his own problem just three years three miserable fucking years from retirement from a damagefree bureau career and his world was threatened with cosmic destruction just one misstep the tiniest mistake was all it would need william boles accepted he had already been vaporized despite having done everything strictly according to the book from the tyrepunctured car being entirely blameless was no defence in an hysterical scapegoat hunt that was in the book too just unwritten hed explained this philosophy to claude luc on their nervous way back to the embassy and the bewildered belgian had already warned his wife that the job of a lifetime was probably over harry becker the security dispatcher whod taken boless call had four times lied unwaveringly that he had not made the confusing duplicate call to the school he was ready to go on denying it although he knew he wouldnt survive lance rampling the crewcut normally energetic cia officer hadnt yet contributed to the discussion for once not wanting to attract attention to himself he wasnt sure what the pecking order was in this situation and until he got guidance from washington he was going to keep his head well below the parapet lets go through it one more time we could have missed something said mcbride desperately i dont think we have sir said elliot smith the legal attache was a late arrival behind all those actually involved whom mcbride had assembled personally to crossexamine to find culprits the lawyer wasnt yet endangered but he still wasnt comfortable when shit hit the fan it sprayed everywhere burt harrison the chief of mission was thinking the same thing although not in such crude terms as gently as possible not wanting to cause hillary mcbride any further distress although the woman actually wasnt showing any the plump career diplomat said i think its time we accepted its not a good situation five hours agreed mcbride dully an unnecessary reminder he was a large beetlebrowed intimidating man who wore a thin moustache and an overly sweet cologne neither suited him his bulk was exaggerated by the closeness of his wife she was normally a neat perfectly kept and preserved chatelaine of the embassy empire colourcoordinated clothes never creased scarlet nails impeccably polished expertly tinted hair lacquered in wavefrozen ridges now the hair was disarrayed and her crumpled blouse had pulled free from her skirt on her left hip she was chainsmoking the extralong cigarettes she favoured it could still be a game she said you know what shes like its the sort of thing shed do mcbride abruptly emerged into the reality he had been trying to avoid swinging from one extreme to the other no he insisted brutally someones got her some bastard the selfabsorption was unavoidable its to get at me get her back said the woman more an order than a plea we will said harding unwilling to speak to make any commitment he might not be able to keep but knowing he had to because the ambassadors wife was looking expectantly at him knowing too from the expression on mcbrides face that he hadnt said the right thing of course well get her back said the ambassador i dont care what it costs or what it takes just do it now i understand immediately said harrison in too hurried agreement wishing from the stare he got from mcbride that he hadnt spoken either mcbride went to speak but apparently changed his mind straightening further recovering further instead he said ive got to tell the president it wasnt an exaggerated shockaffected remark political commentators in washington dc had speculated openly that the belgian ambassadorial posting was the first supposedly comfortable stepping stone to higher and more glittering rewards maybe even the secretaryship of state for the largest single financial contribution to the presidents successful firstterm election it certainly gave mcbride personal access at the lift of a telephone harding fervently thanked whatever guardian angel had prompted him to send an alertbutdontact message to the bureau in washington when hed excused himself earlier to fetch the legal attache he said i need to send a full report to washington as soon as possible what about the local authorities asked the lawyer it was elliot smiths first embassy posting and he was uncomfortably aware that he looked too young for it which was why hed grown the moustache unfortunately instead of giving the intended impression of maturity it looked as if hed glued it on for a costume party what about them demanded mcbride the young man steeled himself belgium is a foreign country part of the european union neither the bureau he hesitated indicating the silent rampling nor the agency has any operational jurisdiction here colour suffused mcbrides face and he rose further at his desk as if physically meeting a challenge are you telling me neither the federal bureau of investigation nor the central intelligence agency of the united states of america can do anything to find the missing daughter of one of its ambassadors dont be damned ridiculous said hillary in rare agreement with her husband another embassy tenet was that she was even more politically ambitious than her husband to the extent of seeing the white house as a future mailing address it was the only reason each remained married to the other she to be the presidents wife he to avoid the slightest electoral hindrance a divorce might create neither sought outside relationships totally focused political achievement was sex enough for both of them of course every bureau facility will be available said harding but elliots right sir weve got no authority no legal mandate to work on the ground here at best the bureau is accepted as liaison seeing mcbrides colour deepen he hurried on speaking faster theres only one requirement here to get mary beth back safely and quickly so everythings got to be done correctly from the very beginning trying to mount an investigation any other way will just obstruct things he was pleased with the final blurted reasoning it would read well sound well at any later review knowing he had to contribute rampling said i need to talk to langley obviously a task force will have to be assembled and pretty damned quick agreed hillary so far im not impressed with how you guys are treating this mcbride gave his wife an irritated side glance before switching his attention between the lawyer and the two intelligence officers now listen up he widened the audience to include burt harrison all of you listen good if its necessary diplomatically or for any other halfassed reason to involve the belgian police then do it do whatever youve got to do to find mary beth but i want american investigators feds who know what theyre doing and know whatll happen if they screw up in charge of finding my baby we all clear on that yes sir said harding and rampling in unison asshole harding thought the other two men nodded not speaking it was midevening when the brussels police commissioner andre poncellet reached belgian justice minister miet ulieff at home they met there within the hour this is the tenth child to disappear without trace in eighteen months ulieff said without preamble i dont need reminding protested poncellet then let me remind you of something else said the politician a normally urbane whitehaired man whod replaced the previous justice minister because of the ineffective investigations unless we get her back safe and well we wont have jobs i know that too said the police chief a fat asthmatic man who perspired easily he was sweating and wheezing now even before the emergency cabinet meeting that followed they decided there were overwhelming reasons for an investigation into the disappearance of an ambassadors daughter to be headed by the european unions fbi chief among them the need to spare themselves as much responsibility as possible if it ended in tragedy which these sorts of cases invariably did but publicly we have to appear very much involved insisted ulieff we will be promised poncellet ill initiate all the obvious things before they arrive mary accepted she was uncertain but definitely not frightened but thought she was hiding it well where the woman had put her and the men in scary masks had come to look at her was like a real cell in a prison as if they were going to lock her up for a long time its total quietness unsettled her most the walls and door so thick she couldnt hear anyone outside until the flap snapped open and unknown eyes stared at her as if she were a pet like her rabbit billy boy in a cage there was a bed with blankets and sheets and a toilet which she didnt want to use in case anyone looked in when she was going and a table in the middle of the room with food on it that the strangely giggling man also masked had brought a long time ago it was cold meat sliced sausage but she didnt want to eat it even though she was hungry because it might be drugged or poisoned shed read books about people wicked uncles or mothers or witches who drugged and poisoned children she didnt believe them of course they were just madeup stories but what was happening to her wasnt made up it was real happening shed been kidnapped like in the madeup stories although it had stopped bleeding her mouth hurt where the woman had hit her and she wanted to go home to her mother be in her own bed she wouldnt cry though she definitely wouldnt cry and she wouldnt cheek the woman so much next time she didnt want to be hit again it really did hurt she slipped the brace off to lessen the discomfort she wanted very badly to make pee pee and knew she was going to have to soon she hoped mom remembered to feed billy boy hed do it decided henri sanglier he accepted they would be using him for his name but then he would be using them and his name for the same purpose it meant he would initially continue to live as hed always lived in the shadow of his father but politics would give him the opportunity to establish his own public recognition europol had served its purpose as hed always intended it should this one last case would be the bridge from one career to the other no mistakes and no misjudgements like the ones in the past he warned himself thats all he had to be careful of chapter four coincidentally claudine carter approached the elevator to the executive floor at the same moment as peter blake he smiled slightly uncertain and said sanglier yes an assignment not a review of a previous case any idea what it is no it didnt matter what it was she thought entering the lift ahead of the english detective with whom presumably she was going to be partnered whatever it was it would be an investigation in which she could totally immerse herself to the exclusion of everything and anything else she was blurring her selfimposed boundaries she realized she had been appointed to the fbi of the european union because of her unquestionable brilliance as a criminal psychologist an ability she guarded jealously the most essentially observed protection was never to allow anything in her personal life to become a professional consideration now she was permitting it to happen she was eager to submerge herself in her job hoping to shed for as long as possible the frustration of being in love with a man whom religion and honour prevented from letting their relationship become anything more than platonic claudine wedged herself into the corner of the elevator facing the englishman blake was a tall heavy man with a lot of blond hair he still wore long from the time hed spent under cover on special branch secondment in northern ireland for which hed been promoted to detective chief superintendent hed been the lead witness at a trial the prosecution claimed had virtually destroyed the iras army council and although hed given his evidence anonymously and shielded behind screens hed been transferred to europol immediately afterwards for his own protection it was understandable although contrary to the homogeneous intention of a police organization empowered to operate anywhere in the european union that each of the fifteen nationalities formed its own social ghetto claudine was not antisocial simply not a group person but on the few occasions shed been among the english crowd shed twice heard blake asked about infiltrating terrorist cells knowing just one mistake would be his death sentence hed avoided the questions turning the conversation aside with an amusing anecdote against himself as the lift started to ascend she wondered if he found the hague holland itself boring after the irish experience certainly she couldnt professionally detect inherent signs of stress but it was fatuous to attempt a psychological assessment from their few brief encounters automatic though it always was for her to try whats sanglier like claudine was known to be the only criminal psychologist in europol to have worked operationally with the french commissioner and guessed she had been asked that question as many times as blake had been pressed about northern ireland likes to play by the rules its a useful name to have when dealing with national police forces that resent a federal organization like ours which all of them do any guidance for a new boy blake was examining claudine as intently as she was studying him class he decided the simple jewellery the singlestrand gold choker and blackstoned gold ring looked real and the black dress expensive it was too loose for him to decide about her figure but she was obviously slim good legs too proud of the legend attached to his name obviously hell take advantage if hes shown too much deference but he expects a certain amount you like him we worked together well enough blake seized on this at once so you dont like him he stood back for her to leave the elevator ahead of him like or dislike doesnt come into it claudine said evasively unhappy at having been backed into a conversational corner he keeps things strictly professional as they should be kept she hurried along the corridor hoping blake recognized hed been given a ground rule by which she intended to operate the difficulty of how a european fbi should operate had been tentatively resolved by forming a ruling commission of senior police representatives from each of the fifteen countries with each commissioner acting as chairman on a monthly rotating basis and one of them acting as the task force commander for each fully fledged investigation claudine decided it had to be nothing more than coincidence that sanglier was again to lead whatever assignment they were on their way to be given just as it was a fluke that her father at the time chief archivist at interpol in lyon had twenty years earlier assembled the wartime material upon sangliers father for its entry into the national archives in paris it was in any case an intrusive reflection to cloud her mind with unnecessary reexamination of their previous association would be not just ridiculous but totally unprofessional and the basis of claudines know thyself creed was at all times and in every circumstance to be absolutely professional after the personal disaster of england and the confused mess of what little private life existed here in the hague her unquestioned professionalism was the only thing of which she felt sure sangliers matronly personal assistant ushered them immediately into the mans presence the french commissioner was in his preferred position at the far end of the room confronting any visitor with the intimidating approach that claudine had several times endured from the beginning shed mentally listed the long march and the overly large desk among several peculiarities hinting at an inferiority complex clinically possible in someone carrying the name of a french national hero she wasnt overpowered by the charade and from the easy way he was walking beside her strolling was the word that came to her mind claudine didnt think blake was either there was still some way to go when sanglier rose politely to greet them an extremely tall outwardly courteous man with only the slightest suggestion of grey in the thick black hair he was as always immaculately dressed the suit a muted light grey check the black handkerchief in his breast pocket matching the black handknitted tie worn over a deep blue shirt claudine had anticipated a larger meeting but there were only two chairs set out in readiness sanglier steepled his hands in front of him elbows on the desk the daughter of the american ambassador to belgium has disappeared how old demanded blake sanglier consulted the single sheet of paper before him ten any history of running away asked claudine impressed by the immediate nounnecessaryquestions atttitude of the fairhaired man beside her not that weve been told ransom demand asked blake not yet but the belgians favour kidnap why if there hasnt been a demand persisted blake sanglier shrugged theres no indication from what weve been sent so far when was she last seen leaving school yesterday there was some mixup over transportation some classmates saw her walking away by herself and theres been no contact from anyone pressed claudine not according to what weve been told so the belgian police are pushing a kidnap theory because thats whats been suggested to them by the americans wholl want to believe it because its a lesser horror than what else could have happened to her predicted claudine her job as a criminal psychologist was to examine clues left at crime scenes invariably violent crime scenes to create a physical and mental picture of the faceless perpetrator she had never been involved in a kidnap and was unsure what value she had at this early stage the embassy will have its inhouse security said blake intelligence personnel as well and probably there are a lot more in the air already on their way to brussels sanglier had collapsed his steeple and lounged back in his encompassing chair making his own assessments if his transition from policeman to politician was to go as he intended it was essential that these two were the best available in europol hed made a mistake with claudine carter on their first assignment he now acknowledged behaved stupidly in the belief that from her father she might know something damaging to the sanglier legend which he himself doubted nevertheless she had performed brilliantly it was important that peter blake was equally good their success would become his success sangliers initial impression was of a man verging on overconfidence but he accepted that blake would have had to be to have done half of what his personnel file listed in northern ireland that file was specially designated recommending that blake be armed at all times his responses so far showed an operational intelligence that had probably got him to ireland in the first place and in addition to whatever weapon he carried kept him alive while he was there and further again listed in the file was the degree in criminal law showing he was as strong on theory as he unquestionably was in practice physically bigger than sanglier had imagined although there were photographs and statistics on his record it also said that blake was a bachelor and sanglier wondered if there would be any sexual attraction between the man and claudine the thought was an uneasy reminder of one of those stupid mistakes introducing claudine to his predatory wife he said its going to be a minefield diplomatically and operationally the beginning of the walkoneggs lecture about incountry jurisdiction and diplomatic protocol claudine recognized only half listening she went back to studying blake as determined as sanglier against being burdened by someone of doubtful ability so despised was europol by national forces that it was all too frequently used as a graveyard for dying police elephants blake was sitting attentively and slightly forward in his chair but she suspected hed heard it all before it really was the standard day one induction speech that came before directions to the cafeteria or the lavatories if there were any psychological scars from what blake had endured in ireland she would have expected telltale signs however slight at the moment of being briefed to go back into the field when the commissioner had finished blake looked briefly sideways at claudine just the two of us we dont know what we are investigating at the moment sanglier reminded him until we do we cant decide what manpower is needed when we do every provision will be made claudine said kidnapping is more an american than a european crime over half end with the child being killed ive heard the statistics said sanglier im not underestimating how delicate any negotiations are going to be the implication startled claudine im to be the negotiator if it is a kidnap that was the specific request from belgium disclosed sanglier they say they havent got a qualified negotiator which was a lie he was sure europol was only ever asked to help when a national government wanted to escape the responsibility one of the first things he intended to propose when he transferred to politics was that europol should be empowered under federal legislation like the american fbi automatically to investigate major crimes kidnapping as it was in the united states would obviously be a federal offence quickly he finished if it comes to negotiation europol will have the unquestionable authority and jurisdiction if its murder we will still be the responsible investigating force in view of who it is and there will be the same need for your involvement i havent heard anything about it on a newscast said blake the americans have asked for a publicity blackout which means they want to negotiate themselves and possibly pay any demanded ransom said claudine and thats two different things negotiating weve talked about paying we havent ultimately i suppose thats the decision of the parents said sanglier claudine and blake erupted in unison stopping just as abruptly blake waved his hand invitingly to claudine and said after you paying should be the last resort not the first insisted claudine if they get the money theres no reason to keep the child alive if she is still alive that is i agree blake confirmed and i agree with both of you said sanglier we havent established that it is a kidnap yet so we cant answer any of these questions we have to wait claudine hesitated aware that sanglier had avoided a commitment well operate out of brussels this time their previous investigation had been into a europewide series of horrific murders committed by a triad group terrorizing young illegal immigrants into prostitution without a central focus a coordinating incident room had been established at europols headquarters at the hague i would have thought that was obvious said sanglier were going to need proper communications from the beginning declared claudine now it was sanglier who hesitated looking at her steadily you want kurt volker hes brilliant he also operates unconventionally sanglier reminded her knowing the protest was a weak one because it had been expedient during the triad investigation hed unwillingly condoned the german experts method of hacking his way through every computer system in europe like some lost explorer cutting a path through jungle undergrowth our previous case was europols first and established the need for its existence our existence we wouldnt have been able to do that without kurt claudine said simply confident she had an unarguable case she went on if americas involved the very fbi that were modelled upon we cant afford to fail any more than we could have the first time at any time ill have to see if hes available he is said claudine i checked before coming here she stopped short of adding that the german was as anxious as she was for another assignment that was extremely prescient of you said sanglier testily it had to be the father concluded claudine the fear maybe even the knowledge that the old man didnt fully deserve all the homage for his wartime exploits and that claudine knew it would she ever be able to find a way to tell this confusing deeply uncertain man that his fathers genuine bravery totally justified every accolade and honour blake said will you work from brussels with us sanglier shook his head intending to be instantly available for any call from paris not on a daytoday basis brussels is easily reached ill come as and when i judge it necessary as they rose to leave sanglier said this could be even bigger than the triads dont forget that claudine doubted that they would be allowed to on their way back along the corridor blake said you two have any personal problems the last time not really said claudine if she were right about sanglier the bastard had virtually offered her to his lesbian wife which was difficult to conceive unless he was sexually perverse it could explain their marriage she supposed why thought the atmosphere was a little chilly at times just professional as i told you on the way here hes right about its importance unless shes found safe and well by the time we get to brussels he stood directly opposite her in the elevator looking at her unblinkingly his eyes had a strange blueness seeming to vary from light to dark he said well how did i do you could have been a little more deferential replied claudine honestly the easy smile came at once what the hell he cant put electrodes on my balls or shoot me can he shit thought claudine at once recognizing the psychological flaw hed survived ireland and convinced himself he was invulnerable so everything now had to be a test pushed to the limit such people were dangerous claudine did not return to her own office but went immediately to kurt volkers on the floor below the plump habitually dishevelled german beamed at the announcement but agreed there was no purpose in his travelling with her to brussels until they learned what sort of investigation it was the man gestured to his terminals i dont really need to be with you at all these can take me anywhere i want to go without getting out of my chair id feel more comfortable with you closer said claudine ill be there he assured her the late afternoon train connections gave her time to lunch with hugo rosetti although in the cafeteria not in one of the better restaurants outside the europol building the forensic pathologist was already at a table when she arrived a lot of supposition he said after she outlined the assignment thats what kurt said its the familiar europol shell game everyone shuffling responsibility it might not even be a case at all lets hope it isnt shes just ten years old claudine abruptly cut herself off alert for any reaction from the italian sophia had only been three when shed died in a car crash with rosetti at the wheel so the circumstances were entirely different apart from the loss of a daughter but she always tried to avoid reminders rosetti gave no reaction kurts part of the team questioned the italian as their meal arrived were going to need him if it turns out to be a crime but not a pathologist theyd met when rosetti was appointed to the triad investigation we dont have a body yet hopefully we wont get one she paused momentarily uncertain what the hell she thought and it might be a good idea for us to give each other a little space dont you think he sipped his wine to give himself time do you now it was claudine who didnt immediately reply i believe you know how i think and how i feel and you know how i feel claudine pushed her plate aside round and round we go in a circle i havent misled you ever im bloody glad i dont have any religion she said with sudden bitterness it isnt just my being catholic in fact thats the least of it as you know are you going to see her this weekend claudine could not think why shed asked he went most weekends to the rome clinic where flavia whod suffered brain damage in the car crash lay in the irreversible coma into which shed lapsed after being told sophia had been killed of course he said whats this british detective like claudine was momentarily thrown by the obvious change of subject big the rumour is that he did something special in northern ireland but no ones found out what it was maybe you will claudine shrugged maybe did you like him claudine began to concentrate curious at the remark ive not really met him before havent now really i havent formed an opinion if it becomes a proper case kidnap i mean not anything professional as far as im concerned maybe i could come down brussels isnt far your choice said claudine heavily she added like everythings your choice i just want you to make it mary couldnt understand why it was taking so long shed been held for almost a whole day from the time shed been tricked into the car and dad still hadnt got her out maybe the woman and the stupid men in masks had been caught that could be it caught while trying to collect the money and refusing to say where she was except that one man hadnt been caught the one who giggled a lot like some of the girls at school martha especially when they were nervous or expecting a surprise shed managed to make pee pee twice and do the other thing without him seeing her through the peephole and shed eaten all the bread hed brought for breakfast and the roll at lunch you couldnt poison bread could you but she hadnt drunk the soup or the milk that morning just in case it wasnt difficult to cup her hands and drink water from the sink faucet in the cell she wished dad would hurry up she still wasnt properly frightened not all the time anyway it was just boring in this silly room silly room and silly men she was glad the woman hadnt come she didnt like the woman gently she put her tongue against her cut cheek it still hurt she jumped startled at the sound of a key turning in the lock but had recovered by the time the heavy door swung open the sniggering man blocked the opening am i going home mary demanded at once youve got to come into the big room for exercise said charles mehre he scarcely moved aside forcing her to brush against him to get by she didnt like it mary looked cautiously around the huge underground chamber it was empty apart from the man and not as hot as the previous day there wasnt the sweet smell either where are the others not here where mary insisted dont know the police have probably got them she declared id have known said the man although uncertainly how persisted mary i would insisted the man with childlike logic youre to shower in there he pointed to a door as if recalling a mislaid instruction hed probably look at her with no clothes on through a peephole she couldnt see mary said i dont want to shower she said you must she doesnt like smelly girls protested mehre who said you know you tell me no said mehre looking away as if to avoid her direct stare dont shower if you dont want to that had been easy mary decided easy and interesting youre to walk around exercise ordered the man although weakly mary began at once not to obey him but because she wanted to think to see how far she could take things she was right not to be frightened of this man there was nothing to be frightened about she could bully him the way she made girls at school do things when she wanted he stood in front of the large screen making small grunting sounds and mary was sure he hadnt realized she was gradually making her way towards the door leading up to the panelled hall she was very close when she lunged at it grabbing the handle and pulling at the same time the door remained solid unmoving and behind her mehre expanded his childish giggle into an open laugh i knew youd do that i locked it im clever but youre a bad girl mary who hated appearing foolish in anything turned furiously back into the room momentarily not knowing what to do how to recover she pointed to the huge screen and said i want to watch television there was a snicker we only watch special films ill watch a film then not until youre allowed until she says why not shes got to say so who mary tried again the others he generalized who are the others youre not allowed to know what are your names youre not allowed to know that either do you know who my father is yes hes a very important man it doesnt matter hell be very angry it doesnt matter if you let me go ill tell him you were kind to me ill tell him not to be angry at you as he is going to be at the others at her i think you should go back into your cell said mehre youve been bad naughty now you wont get any supper he held her wrist with one hand and put his other on her buttocks but not to push her forward mary twisted away from the groping fingers before pulling her arm free to enter the cell by herself she hadnt liked the way the man had touched her bottom because it was rude but otherwise she felt very sure of herself he was what mom called simpleminded did what he was told there was a gardeners help like that back home in virginia shed make this man do what she wanted like the gardeners boy trick him so that she could get away the way girls got away from bad people in the adventure books he caught her making pee pee but she didnt care she had to let him look if he wanted let him think there was nothing she could do it wasnt as if he could see anything she didnt want him to squeeze her bottom again though she hunched on the bunk watching the second hand on her watch bring the time round to six oclock the time she usually fed billy boy she couldnt trick the silly man tonight maybe not even tomorrow she hoped mom and dad werent arguing about her as they often did didnt imagine that shed run away on purpose she couldnt understand why no one was doing anything to get her away a lot of people were preparing to at brussels airport the us military aircraft touched down carrying twentyfive fbi and cia personnel under the overall command of the bureaus deputy operational director and chief hostage negotiator john norris paul harding was waiting at the bottom of the ramp when norris disembarked harding said theres nothing new if there had been youd have patched it through to the plane wouldnt you norris was impatient with empty words and gestures at her creeperclad brussels mansion off the boulevard anspach felicite galan personally poured the champagne for the two men with her and said so there its all going to work perfectly when neither replied she said to jean smet theres nothing to worry about and to august dehane youve done very well very well indeed reluctantly they followed her lead raising their glasses in a toast to something we havent done before the woman declared and claudine carter and peter blake reached the metropole hotel on the place de brouckere this is the first time ive arrived on a case without knowing what it was said claudine ive done it far too often said blake chapter five john norris who tried hard to know everything knew that more than once local fbi stations had been advised by bureau headquarters of his impending arrival with the words the iceman cometh and liked it although there wasnt any similarity between him and the way he operated and any of the hasbeen characters in oneills play which hed particularly gone to see when he discovered the intended inhouse mockery norris didnt see it as a lampoon of his style and character he was quite happy to accept it as an accurate description he was a sparse bespectacled man who had learned totally to control what emotions he possessed which were limited to begin with he neither drank smoked nor swore and his devotion to the bureau was to the absolute exclusion of everything else whenever he spoke of the bureaus founder norris called him mr hoover his marriage to a college sweetheart his one and only relationship had ended in divorce and her accusation that he preferred to be at pennsylvania avenue than at home with her norris had agreed with her what little physical need he had was met once a month usually on a friday always in the missionary position and lasting no more than fifteen minutes by a discreet but expensive professional who worked out of an apartment in the watergate complex shed long ago decided hed get as much satisfaction riding an exercise bike but she was a working girl and wasnt going to argue with how he spent his hed telephoned before leaving washington to tell her he was going out of town and couldnt make that friday shed said shed miss him and to hurry back hed cancelled the paper and magazine delivery too his masters degree was in psychology as the bureaus foremost expert on hostage siege and kidnap negotiations norris lectured on behavioural science at the fbis national centre for the analysis of violent crime at their training academy at quantico when his operational commitments allowed he knew the iceman tag was common knowledge there it was useful being preceded by a hard man reputation saved time having to make people understand that when john norris said jump they had to jump through fire hoops hell and high water he didnt take prisoners he got them released from the nervous way he was driving both hands whiteknuckled around the wheel it was obvious paul harding had heard about the iceman idly norris wondered if the term had even been used in the overnight advisory cable he listened in disconcerting unmoving silence while harding obeyed his instruction to go verbally through everything that had happened since the first alarm at the embassy people sometimes spoke more openly more carelessly trying to express themselves verbally than they did writing official reports listening without movement or interruption letting echoing silences into conversations hurried people into unthought revelations i dont like it that there hasnt been any contact by now that doesnt fit said norris he had a nasal new england accent you think shes dead i will do if theres nothing in the next twentyfour hours i hit the button the moment it became a crisis harding reminded him quickly backcovering time recognized norris what about the others our man boles and the local driver luc they clean absolutely it was a puncture pure and simple how harding snatched a frowning glance across the car how norris sighed impatiently youve got to understand something about me paul i dont believe in god i dont believe in coincidences i dont believe in accidents i dont believe there are good people only bad people i work on the principle so youll work on that principle too that everyones guilty until i me no one else decide otherwise and it takes a lot for me to decide otherwise you got all that neatly memorized so there wont be any misunderstandings between us two positive indications that he was going to remain part of the investigation realized harding relieved i got it so how single nail wall or tread of the tyre tread just the nail no base to keep it upright in the path of the car just the nail youve kept it of course as evidence havent had the wheel fixed harding swallowed with fresh relief all kept good very good what about the school anything wrong there harding hesitated knowing there was no way of avoiding the answer but wishing he could vetted the place myself before the kid was enrolled quite a few embassies use it so the principal and the governors are as careful as hell knowing what there is to lose theyre shitting themselves over whats happened norris winced at the profanity so they should who made the mistake with the duplicate call survival time thought harding sorry harry becker says he didnt but he was on security dispatch duty boles says it was harry he spoke to from the car you checked beckers background ive gone through everything weve got locally at the embassy hes been here for two years theres never been any trouble he drink no more than anyone else there was the impatient sigh again so he drinks yes gamble not that i know of local friends none that i know the ambassadors been told i want to see him immediately hes waiting i want you to sit in on that as soon as its over i want you to check becker again but better than you already have i want everything washingtons got on him for starters take as many people as you want from those i brought in i want to know if hes in debt or has got a drink problem or is involved with a local woman or man if hes gay i want to know anything that could have compromised becker exposed him to blackmail any problem with that none at all lied harding glad they would soon be at the embassy it was difficult to conceive the problems he was going to have with this deadfaced rigormortised sonofabitch it was chilling just being close to determined not to be caught between a rock and a hard place harding said the cia station here lance ramplings the residentincharge are pissed off not being included in the meeting with the ambassador langleys been told whos running the show rampling should have been messaged by now making it clear theyre subsidiary ill see him after the ambassador straighten him out he asked for a meeting dismissive of any cia distraction norris said what about the kid herself awkward little brat knows shes the daughter of an ambassador and doesnt let anyone forget it makes a lot of peoples lives a misery anticipating the question seconds before norris asked it harding added hurriedly but definitely not enough to make anyone snatch her do her any real harm she just needs her ass slapped is she wilful enough to have run away staged the whole business that was my first thought like i said i didnt wait to hit the button but i expected her to show up with some fancy story but she wouldnt have stayed away this long norris remained silent for several minutes so whats the local situation weve been given total belgian cooperation guaranteed at justice minister level the police commissioner andre poncellet is personally involving himself and theyve called in europol which is i know what europol is snapped the other man we advised when they were set up same rules as with the local force well take everything theyve got to offer but i dont want them getting in the way of our investigating he shifted in his seat for the first time that means maintaining the closest daytoday contact officially we accept theyre in charge running the operation you know how big a force europol are committing no i havent got any names either just know theyre coming in tonight ive scheduled a leaders conference at the embassy tomorrow included poncellet good deal said the thin man anything else that needs saying not that i can think of at last they reached the boulevard du regent harding gestured ahead and said theres the embassy weve filled in the journey very well said norris got to know each other thats good paul harding couldnt remember a man whod made him feel so unsettled ever in his career and that included three proven killers one with a magnum in his hand ever conscious of retirement just three years away he said it has been good ive enjoyed it liar thought norris james mcbride was waiting in his study jacket off tie loosened around an unbuttoned collar hillary sat some way away the customary distance reestablished in contrast perfectly composed perfectly dressed every hair starchily in place the ambassador already had a large jack daniels on the desk in front of him and gestured them towards the open cabinet while the introductions were made harding was already going towards it before he realized norris had refused and thought fuck it with no alternative he carried on desperately seeking a soda then again he thought fuck it defiant this time and took at least three fingers of jack daniels too it looked even larger from the amount of ice he added it had been one hell of a drive the following days were going to be hell as well maybe worse i heard through state that youre the bureaus chief negotiator said mcbride thats good thats how its got to be his hand was visibly shaking when he lifted the whisky glass everyone with me is an expert in his field assured norris he sat primly and very upright his concentration absolute on the politically appointed diplomat with more backdoor clout than anyone in the new administration we want our daughter back mr norris said hillary there was a note of impatience in her voice ill get her back for you maam all i need is the contact there was no doubt in the mans voice the headon ego clash was deafening thought harding ive made arrangements with my bank about money ive guessed at three million said mcbride they were in touch before i left pennsylvania avenue the director dealt with it himself the numbers are already being computer logged and itll be marked before coming here in the diplomatic bag will three million be enough demanded the woman its enough to negotiate with what else can we do asked mcbride let me talk a few things through with you said norris mcbride appeared to become aware of the hand tremor and put the glass down on his desk anything what for the first time norris indicated the other fbi officer the day your daughter vanished you told paul that they the people whove got her had done it to get at you i dont understand that sir mcbride looked blankly at the strangely still man wishing his hands werent shaking so obviously trying to reassure himself norris would imagine it was solely concern for mary to gain even more time he turned to harding i dont remember saying that you did sir insisted the resident officer i was very upset if i said it i probably meant directed at me as the official representative of the united states of america not that it was personal have there been threats against the embassy any reason for thinking that persisted norris not directly but theres a great resurgence of fascism neonazism throughout europe quite a lot of antiamerican feeling he didnt want to go on down this road it wasnt sounding convincing enough lets look at it from a personal viewpoint what about your business before your appointment mcbride felt the first twitch of uncertainty deep in his stomach he wanted even less to go in this direction i founded and headed a legitimate armaments corporation that always conducted business at official government levels he pushed what he hoped would sound like outrage into his voice im not aware of offending anyone which is what i guess youre implying it was too long ago if the motherfucker had wanted to hurt him hed have done it years ago i wasnt implying anything specific said norris easily just trying to cover all the bases arms dealing can have its uncertain aspects cant it the opening for further outrage i was not operating in dark alleys with people whose names i didnt know mine was the corporation governments came to with a few exceptions one in particular the ghost always there to climb out of the closet but he hadnt known genuinely honestly hadnt known they had to understand that if it ever leaked luigi della sialvo had been a government procurer credentials a mile high sold a lot of stuff to italy every deal one hundred per cent kosher every end user certificate stamped sealed and countersigned except for that one occasion luigi fucking sialvo working on the side building up his own special pension with a bullshit line about having known the smiling mr lee for years personally vouching for him an introduction between trusted friends and there had been an end user guarantee singapore a toehold in the asian market a new business opportunity thanks luigi youre a buddy sure the commission can go into the zurich bank not unusual accepted practice good deal too twenty million to open all up front thirtyfive to follow same payment arrangements and it did arrive timed to the second and a singapore address a bona fide company to go with the end user requirement but the sidewinders and the cruise and the antipersonnel stuff hadnt ended up in singapore just passed through the arms dealers law of perpetual motion new company in korea shuffleshuffle to indonesia where the transport planes were waiting for the direct flight to baghdad all greased and ready for the start of the gulf war he hadnt given in to the blackmail when it came not james kilbright mcbrides style faced down the no longer smiling mr lee when hed set it all out embarrassment after embarrassment to force the order so urgent there wasnt time to ship through all the cutouts if i drop youll drop you bastard youll be the pariah in the arms business never operate again so go fuck yourself there was much further to drop now though if it ever came out and it wouldnt be a chinese entrepreneur falling with him us president funded by saddam gold a no defence catastrophe mcbride made a conscious determined effort to curb the panic pressing one shaking hand down upon the other all in the past too long ago in the past before the appointment hed been bureau vetted as a matter of course come through squeaky clean like he would again ridiculous to think there was any danger what about you mrs mcbride hillary gave no outward surprised reaction to the question she said i may have offended a few people in the past but none that would have done a thing as unspeakable as this you sure about that demanded the emotionless man im talking secretaries or staff ive had to let go for inefficiency i dont like inefficiency secretaries and staff have kidnapped in the past you got names hillary frowned i suppose therell be records somewhere not here home in virginia can you arrange for them to be made available to the bureau there said norris i suppose so if you consider it important everythings important to get your daughter back i dont need to be told that snapped the woman ill arrange it mcbride discovered his glass was empty and offered it sideways to harding who hesitated and then took it yesm boss thought the fbi man fuck it he thought again filling his own glass while he was about it he didnt bother with as much ice this time the last one had become very watered down at the end well need to filter everything coming into the embassy certainly to you or mrs mcbride personally said norris that includes everything in the diplomatic bag in the event that this might be a conspiracy starting out in washington the directors arranging for state to confirm my level of security clearance some of the people with me are communication experts therell be a tap on every landline in and out of the embassy scanners will monitor mobiles well get a daily telephone printout from belgacom those precautions will of course cover the ambassadorial residence and extend to the homes of every senior official in the embassy ill need a list i accept its an invasion of individual privacy but i want it made clear that has to be secondary to recovering your daughter my sole interest the sole interest of everyone with me is the whereabouts of mary beth he paused to emphasize the importance of what he was going to say everything that comes to our attention during the investigation will be considered with the utmost discretion nothing that isnt part of this case is of any interest to us whatsoever id like that assurance circulated throughout the embassy along with my request for absolute cooperation from everyone give me an honest answer mr norris demanded hillary how bad does it look bad you think shed dead the womans voice was quite firm i think we need to hear something very soon how long said the ambassador twentyfour hours mcbride closed his eyes the despair genuine i keep thinking trying to imagine what shes going through dont urged norris it doesnt help doesnt achieve anything what does asked hillary nothing in the position were in at the moment as they walked towards the bureau offices norris checked turning fully behind him to ensure no one was within hearing before saying shaking a lot at the beginning wasnt he hes lost a daughter for christs sake said harding emboldened by the whisky sos mrs mcbride she was holding herself ok what did you expect from mcbride asked harding more outrage exaggerated threats about what hed like to do to whoevers got her that happen always its a common reaction youre the psychologist add a request to what youre going to ask washington for on harry becker i want everything that came out of the vetting procedure on mcbride before his ambassadorial appointment was confirmed and get that stuff on mrs mcbride picked up ill message the bureau myself authorizing every single person shes ever fired to be traced and interviewed did you mean it about not being interested in anything other than what might apply to this specific investigation queried harding i told you how i operate on the way in from the airport norris reminded him theres no such thing as a halfright or a halfwrong we wouldnt be doing our duty if we looked the other way when we discovered a wrongdoing would we no harding managed holy shit he thought claudine liked the vaguely faded turnofthecentury ambience of the metropole complete with its overfurnished art deco lobby exuberantly potted foliage and rattling opengrilled elevator peter blake was already waiting wedged into the corner of the inappropriately small bar for a complete view of the lounge the lobby beyond and the hotel entrance to the sidewalk cafe his beer glass was half empty she chose white wine they touched glasses more guidance for a new boy demanded blake whats europol like for expenses claudine frowned ok i guess i never got a query the last time but they like receipts why the concierge recommends la maison du cygne which is just around the corner on the grande place said the man but says its expensive chez francois is good for fish and is slightly cheaper but its not so close on the quai au brigues your choice gettingtoknoweachother time realized claudine that slightly surprised her too on the train from holland blake hadnt made much of an effort engrossed for most of the journey in a book by elmore leonard whom hed called the best detective writer in the world the name of the fish restaurant was an unfortunate reminder of sangliers marauding wife francoise lets walk around to the grande place la maison du cygne was old with a lot of dark wood and an air of being sure of itself without conceit it reminded her of the michelinstarred restaurant her mother had run in lyon until her death eight months earlier claudine had the lobster which was superb blake had moules and chose the wine without consulting her which is what hugo rosetti had done during their first outings claudine was curious although not apprehensive about this initial encounter it hadnt taken her long to realize that sex and the pursuit of it was the only way europols ghetto barriers were breached the majority of the polyglot male detectives and crime staff appearing automatically to consider the majority of the polyglot female contingent available prey to be hunted with no closed season there was an irony she recognized in the fact that after becoming so adept at rejection it was hugo rosetti the one man she wouldnt have rebuffed whose principles prevented his attempting what most other men in the organization tried all the time careful not to be obvious determined against any irritating misunderstanding she studied the man as intent upon any signs she might professionally isolate as she was upon his physical appearance he didnt have the awkwardness of a lot of big men and on balance she decided the always direct look from those oddly blue eyes was polite unstraying attention not appraisal she liked too the fact that he hadnt invaded her space escorting her from the hotel there had been no physical contact cupping her elbow or putting his hand at her back to guide her extremely confident she thought again without the need for gapfilling gestures or movement she guessed the barely discernible irish accent had been exaggerated on the assignment that preceded europol whos going to go first he demanded openly i didnt think you liked talking about yourself the observant psychologist you made it pretty obvious whenever anyone tried to make you i cant be bothered to help people get off listening to imagined james bond exploits werent they james bond exploits he held his wine glass in both hands staring at her over its rim she was too strongly featured to be a beautiful woman but there was a very positive attractiveness he found intriguing he liked the way she wore her black hair short cut into her neck and how the grey eyes met him in neither challenge nor flirtation if there was a message it was that they were equals strictly professional he thought remembering her remark at their first meeting i didnt drink vodka martini get seduced by any bigbreasted virgins or drive a car that fired rockets claudine recognized the selfparody avoidance she went only partially along with it but it was one bloody great gamble blake had been half smiling inviting her to join in the mockery abruptly he became serious there was an attempt on you during the serial killing investigation an attack i read the archives after sangliers briefing i got trapped into some publicity french police wanting their pictures on television mine was there too claudine slightly lifted her left arm along which the knife scar ran from shoulder to wrist thats why i have to wear long sleeves the advice was to wait another year before considering cosmetic surgery she looked steadily at him we were talking about you in ireland no were not there were mental scars and she guessed they were deep youre not showing any signs it took a while to get rid of them to get rid of a lot inpatient for three months what about medication now i carry it as a precaution worried about the pressure of this i dont think so itll be a lot different from what i did before sure you dont want to talk about it positive its locked away was there guilt as well as stress the sort of eroding remorse that a mentally well balanced person would suffer if hed had to go as far as killing someone angrily she stopped the reflection she was behaving thinking at least like his cocktail party interrogators if anything starts to become unlocked and you think i can help professionally while were here it wont he insisted ive thrown away the key but thanks claudine knew she should move on but she didnt want to it was impossible for her to make any proper judgement without knowing what hed gone through but in her professional opinion traumas werent adjusted to by sealing up the experience and pretending it never happened shed lost a husband whod thought he could handle a mental problem like that how was it for your family there isnt one no wife current or prior only child both parents dead i was well selected there was bitterness so the door wasnt as securely bolted as he would have liked to imagine selected she challenged you would have had to have volunteered surely i did he admitted so you got yourself into whatever it was you werent pushed into it unwillingly blake nodded ruefully thank you doctor there was a grin to show there was no offence so far this has all been a bit onesided hasnt it claudine didnt mention it was through being an english representative at the lyonbased interpol that her father had met her mother nor did she mention that her fathers archival investigation into sangliers fathers wartime heroism had created the fluke she was now convinced formed the basis of the mans uneven and at times bewildering attitude towards her she talked of her husbands death but not that it had been suicide from workstressed depression shed been too professionally preoccupied even to notice and she didnt say anything about hugo rosetti and what about kurt volker he demanded you seemed very keen to get him aboard kurt youve got to see for yourself blake regarded her with raised eyebrows sorry if im venturing on a personal situation youre not not that way just wait if this comes to anything how do you want to handle tomorrows meeting she asked in a suddenly decided test thered been some distracting whosincharge problem with the french detective with whom shed worked during the serial killing investigation he shrugged according to all the warnings about how europol is viewed it looks as if its going to be you and me against the world i think it should be a double act dont you it wasnt the reply claudine had expected but she liked it she thought she was going to enjoy working with this man only of course professionally your fault screamed hillary you agreed mary beth should go to a local school mcbride yelled back i didnt want it its too late to talk like that now if shes dead if anything happens to her itll be your fault on your conscience chapter six john norris and his squad swept through the american embassy with the washingtonbacked force and disruption of a force nine hurricane by am the following morning less than twelve hours after their arrival in brussels the boulevard du regent legation as well as the official residence of james mcbride was totally isolated electronically as well as physically no telephone fax or email communication could be received or sent without passing through the specially installed twentyfourhourmanned communications centre complete with its own roofmounted satellite dish all incoming letter mail including the contents of the diplomatic bag had first to be opened and examined in an adjoining room transformed into a sorting office norriss only concession was to agree to the demand from burt harrison the chief of mission for a member of his staff to be present when the supposedly inviolate diplomatic exchange was sifted some of the thirty embassy staff whom norris considered sufficiently senior to be blanketmonitored had been awakened overnight at their homes to agree to listening and recording devices being installed on their telephones and to their incoming personal packages and letters going through the embassy sorting procedure the assessment in the fbis much more comprehensive personal file upon harry becker which was faxed in its entirety from washington was of a completely responsible and absolutely competent operative but after only fifteen minutes interrogation by norris the man broke down and confessed to lying about duplicating the call to mary beth mcbrides school upon norriss authority becker was immediately suspended from duty but not as quickly repatriated kept in belgium although virtually under embassy house arrest to enable further investigation into his local associations and habits during his posting in the country norris personally briefed five of the agents who had arrived with him before assigning them to the task with the warning to forget becker was or had been a colleague whatever happens hes finished he isnt any longer one of us he doesnt qualify the full fbi evaluation of james kilbright mcbride was of a man fulfilling every requirement to be a united states ambassador with nothing questionable in his prior personal or professional background norris responded with an action this day priority demand for the armamentdealing background to be gone into again in greater depth norriss encounter with lance rampling which the cia station chief had entered believing it to be a meeting of equals lasted precisely ten minutes rampling emerged whitefaced from a combination of fury and shocked bewilderment to demand from harding whether the sonofabitch was fucking real or not harding said he thought john norris was a mutant alien from another planet although hed prefer not to be quoted the sceneofcrime forensic expert thought there was nothing whatsoever suspicious about how the nail was embedded in the tyre of the original collection car but norris had wheel tyre and nail shipped back in the returning military aircraft for detailed scientific examination in washington dc claudine and blake were early for the coordinating meeting but norris flanked by harding and rampling was already waiting in a hastily contrived incident room created from the largest unit of the normal fbi accommodation andre poncellet was early too but from the way he hurried the introductions norris managed to convey the impression that the perspiring tightly uniformed brussels police commissioner had kept them waiting neither harding nor rampling wore jackets and the cia resident had his tie pulled loose norris sat with both buttons of his jacket fastened he was facing the window and the light flared off his rimless glasses making him appear sightless it was rampling a freshfaced man with an extremely short crewcut who gestured to the cona percolator steaming on its hotplate when claudine nodded acceptance he poured a cup for her a technician with recording apparatus sat by the door seeing blakes look norris said i like keeping tight records about everything anyone got any objection blake shook his head claudine didnt make any response intently studying the newly arrived american poncellet said no of course not very wise he spoke too quickly too nervously in answer to your obvious question norris began the embassy has heard nothing of or from mary beth since she was last seen by two of her classmates walking off alone up the rue du canal so shes now been missing for thirtysix hours he paused looking towards the recording technician who nodded at the adequate sound level ive satisfied myself that she has not run away of her own accord the most obvious conclusion is that she has been grabbed and is being held against her will i fully accept and recognize under whose authority this investigation has to be conducted he stopped again looking directly at blake we greatly appreciate your involvement and want to work extremely closely with you my government is committing whatever additional support might be necessary i brought twentyfive men with me from washington last night to be part of whatever force you are assembling today we need to evolve a strategy wont that be difficult until we know what were investigating claudine broke in it could be worse than shed feared far worse norris frowned both at the interruption and because it came from a woman he needed to know what her function was i think we should proceed on the assumption that she has been kidnapped why demanded claudine thirtysix hours is a long time without a demand isnt it not necessarily in my experience harding managed not to show any reaction although norriss reply directly contradicted what he had said on the way in from the airport the previous night so norris was the negotiator claudine thought and clearly the man in charge of the fbi and cia contingent she could have been attacked be lying injured somewhere had an accident and be or need to be in a hospital i dont see the point of maintaining the silence about her disappearance that i understand has been asked for i dont want to panic whoevers got her said norris flatly we dont know that anyone has got her protested claudine how long do you think we should sit around doing nothing norriss face became tinged with pink at the unfamiliarity of being confronted so openly before he could speak poncellet declared with triumphant eagerness the brussels police force hasnt sat around doing nothing i have assigned squads to the rue du canal at the precise time she walked along it everyone and i mean everyone will be stopped and questioned and shown a photograph of the child in the hope they regularly use the road at that time and might have seen her in addition there will be road blocks stopping all vehicles for their drivers to be questioned checks were started within an hour of our being told of her disappearance on every shop business and private house along the entire length of the road not just in the direction in which she was seen to walk but also the opposite way he looked proudly around those assembled in the room saddened at the lack of approval whats come out of the premises check demanded blake in his disappointment poncellet tried condescension if there had been anything i would have obviously told you unperturbed blake said how longs it been going on since the opening of commercial business this morning said poncellet tightly blake nodded as if the reply confirmed something and this afternoon one of the citys busiest thoroughfares is going to be virtually closed off by this evening it will have leaked that the daughter of the american ambassador has vanished it would be better to have a media release with a photograph than run the risk of speculations getting out of hand and having to be corrected i do not consider thats the right way to operate at this time said norris i thought our understanding the only possible jurisdictional understanding was that it was how we considered it right to operate said claudine so much for diplomatic niceties they were always bullshit anyway shed expected antagonism come prepared to confront it which she was doing but not to be as worried as she was becoming norris grew redder kidnappers are frightened once theyve got a victim premature publicity can panic them as ive already tried to make clear i dont want he stopped in apparent awareness of the implications of talking in the first person it would be a mistake for anyone to be panicked its better for negotiations to be conducted as quietly and as calmly as possible quantico text book identified claudine with which i am extremely familiar said norris whod contributed two of the manuals from which it had been created so am i ive read it said claudine who had as part of her hostage negotiation lectures throwing the mans condescension back at him she said we dont yet know were investigating a kidnap were looking for a missing child missing children are best and most often found through public appeal and as europol is the jurisdictional investigatory body into the disappearance of mary beth mcbride this is the way we consider this investigation should begin a lot of time has already been wasted i hope not too much norris was astonished at the effrontery and then furious have you forgotten who the victim is its because of who the victim is that we are here blake reminded him lack of contact for thirtysix hours hardly indicates panic it indicates the very opposite if she has been snatched inwardly harding and rampling wished they could wave flags or punch the air poncellet could hardly believe either the dispute or his good fortune in being safely on the periphery norris was momentarily dumbstruck struggling desperately he said its an official diplomatic request that this situation is not made public for at least another twentyfour hours whats diplomacy got to do with it challenged claudine if it is a consideration and i cannot imagine how it can be then perhaps it would be better if my colleague and i discussed it personally with the ambassador were not achieving a lot here this is ridiculous norris was floundering i agree totally ridiculous said blake we came here today to arrange cooperation a strategy to use your word this discussion so far isnt doing that if the child is in danger all were doing is furthering it norris looked sideways suddenly reminded of the tape he couldnt retreat it wasnt his style and certainly not on record compromising wasnt retreating compromising was an essential part of negotiation give a little here to gain much more there and what was the point of confrontation anyway these two werent going to be actively involved just given the impression that they were running things and on the way in from the airport hed put a time limit on what he considered might be the worst scenario and thought there was a way he could avoid losing face looking from the recording apparatus to the plump belgian norris said the road block and street checks do create a risk of illinformed speculation which should be avoided reiterated claudine the man had to be given a way out in front of his own people the release could be timed for this evening that would catch television and radio and ensure fuller cover in tomorrow mornings newspapers that effectively fits with the time scale you were thinking about doesnt it i think so yes said norris the bitch was patronizing him claudine was conscious of blakes attention she didnt respond to it instead she said as were devising strategy the quantico guidelines favour paying ransom dont they the prime consideration is a safe release said norris seizing his escape the perpetrators can be pursued afterwards what about the victims becoming disposable if a ransom is paid asked blake once the kidnappers have got the money the consideration is minimizing their risk of being identified its better to pay insisted norris youre a negotiator challenged claudine the bureaus chief negotiator youve always paid yes norriss colour had been subsiding it began to return at the obvious direction of the questioning he looked again at the recording equipment how many victims have you lost ive got six released unharmed declared the american all the kidnappers were arrested in every case that wasnt the question claudine reminded him why did the silly bastard run headon into every argument contrary to his own because she reasoned he was unaccustomed to having to argue in the first place but this wasnt negotiation this was confrontation her unease deepened as her professional assessment of the man hardened two died admitted norris what about the kidnappers they werent caught norris looked between claudine and blake positively settling on claudine youre europols negotiator i will be if it comes to that he should at least be allowed the appearance of revenge she supposed but only the appearance he was the creator of his own problems she didnt want him to be the creator of hers or those of a missing child how many kidnap victims have you successfully freed norris pounced none admitted claudine at once i havent yet been called upon to do so norris stretched the silence exaggerating his astonishment in his determination not just to recover but to crush this arrogant woman in the process spacing the words as he uttered them he said you havent operated in a kidnap situation until now no said claudine easily but before joining europol i freed a hundred and twenty people from an airliner hijacked by islamic fundamentalists and ended four separate sieges one by a convicted murderer who took a hostage to avoid capture she paused no one died touche she thought mixing the metaphor she added game set and match blake appeared to think so too smiling he said i think that covers the relevant cvs dont you rampling couldnt avoid the brief smirk although not at claudine and was glad they were sitting in a way that prevented norris from seeing it claudine was unconcerned that the thin american could see her brief sideways smile which wasnt in any case an intended sneer at the man norris took it as such but more than matched it when blake disclosed that the europol force at the moment consisted of just himself and the woman i cant believe what youre telling me europol isnt taking this seriously this isnt an investigation on europols part its a joke itll be an investigation within an hour of its becoming clear what there is to investigate promised blake unimpressed by the other mans obviously overstrained amazement norris shook his head the woman had irritated him into pointless argument but it didnt matter any more his only annoyance now was at himself for allowing it to happen these two their entire cockamamy organization were of no importance they had just made themselves irrelevant by admitting casually admitting they considered that the disappearance of an american ambassadors child could be handled by just two people with the further incredible admission that the appointed negotiator had never conducted a kidnap release in her life mcbride probably the president himself would hit the roof when they were told not just hit it go right through it it all came down to giving him a clear unimpeded run all he needed to do was go through the barest of motions which he reflected was all hed intended from the start and get them out of the way out of his way it took them thirty minutes to agree the wording of the proposed media release and that the greatest impact would come from the ambassadors personal appearance at any requested press conference norris promised to put the idea to mcbride and poncellet brightened visibly at blakes suggestion that the belgian police commissioner should also appear commissioner henri sanglier would be europols representative added blake to claudines welldisguised surprise norriss contempt grew as he inferred that neither blake nor claudine was permitted to represent their organization it perfectly summed up their inadequacy it was as they decided upon daily morning and afternoon conferences that norris apologized that there was not enough space at the embassys fbi facility for blake and claudine to work from there andre poncellet at once offered whatever facility and accommodation europol might need at brussels central police headquarters the entire charade lasted five minutes short of an hour and ended with an exchange of emergency contact numbers and smiling assurances that they had made a good beginning for whatever they were going to face in the immediate future claudine held back until she was safely halfway across the open embassy forecourt before exploding what a fucking pantomime blake showed no surprise at the outburst ive seen better he agreed mildly it was frightening insisted claudine she turned looking directly at the man and i really mean that frightening although the road checks hadnt started the rue du canal was already congested they were still early for their meeting so they abandoned the taxi and found a pavement cafe some way from the school in the direction in which mary was known to have walked as they sat there two detectives one a woman visibly carrying a photograph of mary beth mcbride were escorted from inside by a shouldershrugging manager blake shook his head against making contact and claudine held back as well so whats so frightening demanded blake in my professional opinion norris is very close to being mentally ill declared claudine starkly i believe hes severely obsessional which is a clinical condition that needs treatment blake stared at her coffee cup half raised yes he agreed that would be something to be very frightened about you sure hes beyond challenge wont consider any argument contrary to his own because he doesnt believe there is any opinion other than his own you saw it yourself if you examine it hard enough he wont countenance any possibility beyond kidnap thats not the rationale of a psychological investigator its the very antithesis of it everything is possible at this moment at the beginning i dont think hes capable of being either objective or subjective she paused most worrying of all i think john norris is on the edge of losing control and if he loses control during any negotiation for marys freedom then shell die if she hasnt already been killed blake held up a halting hand we went in there today knowing that the bureau were going to give us a load of runaround bullshit and empty promises and try to handle the entire show themselves ok so norris is a supremely arrogant asshole who made it more obvious than we expected but were equals people to whom he didnt have to prove any professional ability he might be entirely different when hes negotiating norris doesnt for a moment consider us equals he thinks were grossly inferior he thinks everyone is inferior to him john norris is god in his own heaven im frightened he could make mary beth mcbride one of his angels blake regarded her doubtfully can you be that positive from just one meeting until he realized id picked up on it virtually every sentence or opinion began with i hes got more victims back than hes lost and probably been able to manoeuvre the failures into being someone elses fault never his hes become the great untouchable the great unquestionable its affected him youre the expert but all ive heard since ive joined europol is that its not just us against the villains but us against every national force and their dog as well claudine shook her head the attitude of national forces is resentment pure and simple no one wanting their territory encroached upon thats not what were talking about here i think norris is operationally dangerous to the child i mean whos probably in enough danger as it is so what can we do about it nothing conceded claudine thats what upsets me most recovering the child if she can be recovered is all that matters claudine frowned yes why not feed the obsession use it to our advantage say you need his help cant do it without him and let him believe he is in charge couldnt you control him if you got in on the negotiations dont give up the day job said claudine smiling at the amateur psychology he doesnt need to believe hes in charge hes sure he is hed see that approach as me patronizing him what about getting sanglier to intervene in what about what theres no way we could make any official protest based upon my impression she hesitated again incidentally you took a lot upon yourself naming sanglier as our representative before knowing hed agree to a press conference appearing with ambassadors and commissioners is sangliers level he more or less said that at the briefing i think he might have liked prior consultation blake shrugged if he doesnt want to do it he can refuse more kamikaze disregard thought claudine to go with a mentally disarranged man and a lost tenyearold child and a controlling commissioner whom she didnt trust her cup was being filled to overflowing and they hadnt even started yet we were right to argue for a press conference it would have been a miracle if something hadnt broken before tomorrow norris conceded on that suggested blake we gave him the time he wanted im not arguing against you said blake before making his point but wouldnt it be great if in that time there was an approach and norris managed to get her back claudine looked quizzically at the man disappointed for the first time great she agreed but it wont happen even if there is an approach norris might have been able to do it once but i dont think hes capable of doing it any longer which was suffering the greater delusion of grandeur wondered blake he checked his watch time to go henriette flahaur the school principal was an autocratic greyhaired stiffly upright woman trying hard to conceal a disaster behind aggression the severe black suit reminded claudine of how her mother customarily dressed to greet customers at the lyon restaurant shed been autocratic too the meeting was more for claudines benefit than blakes but the detective led at the beginning confronting the womans insistence that she had already told as much as she knew to both american and belgian investigators with smiling sympathetic politeness that impressed claudine and coaxed a third account from the woman within minutes it was a terrible inexplicable misunderstanding the first time anything like it had ever occurred at the school a new system had already been introduced with security guards individually checking pupils in and out of the school the world seemed to have become a dreadful place the whole school was praying for mary berns safe return blake said he was sorry but he didnt think the schools name could be withheld from the publicity have you or any teacher or official ever thought your school was being particularly watched he asked by someone intending to snatch a pupil you mean yes madame flahaur vigorously shook her head anyone would have seen how careful she began trailing off in midsentence that doesnt sound right now does it it wasnt the answer to my question anyway blake said gently im talking about recent weeks or days a car or a person hanging around that made you curious she shook her head again although less forcefully theres a specific rule if any member of staff notices anything like that they have to tell me immediately and i would have informed the police theres been nothing that sounds as if such a situation has arisen in the past never the principal insisted thats the tragedy i thought wed anticipated everything to prevent something like this happening mary beth would have known she should not have walked off as she apparently did suggested claudine choosing her moment she needed to decide how well mary beth could face the terror of being seized upon the childs behaviour her strengths or weaknesses depended the way she would be treated literally perhaps her survival before she became a pupil someone from the embassy visited the school talked to me about security he told me mary had strict instructions never to leave the premises unless her transport was waiting thats our rule too with every child i made sure mary understood that when she arrived briefly the womans composure wavered her lip trembling i know and accept she should not have been released in the first place but having found there was no car waiting she should have immediately returned inside why then do you think she didnt asked claudine i dont know is she a disobedient child the other woman hesitated shes extremely selfconfident walking away as she did knowing it was forbidden indicates wilfulness doesnt it madame flahaur nodded reluctantly she liked being the centre of attention to shock to be the centre of attention insisted the woman was she a loud child exuberant the woman frowned loud i dont understand claudine gestured through the window to the road outside its a very busy street it would have been crowded at the time she disappeared if she was snatched actually grabbed into a passing car would she have tried to fight shouted or would she have been too terrified to resist i think she would have resisted so shes not a nervous child sometimes wilful disobedience hides nervousness no shes definitely not nervous the photographs i have seen are facial portraits is she a welldeveloped girl madame flahaur looked quickly at blake she is beginning to form has she reached puberty yet the woman flushed very slightly is this important everything im asking you is important madame flahaur the shock of whats happened to her could cause her to menstruate if she isnt familiar with it even if her mother or a teacher here has told her about it it would add to whatever difficulties shes suffering shed most probably have to tell a man im sorry of course no she is not yet menstruating but it is something about which we instruct our pupils very thoroughly to take away any fear when it happens does she look her age the principal considered the question no i dont think she does she is developing as i said but only just and shes quite a small child below average height for her age has she had any sex education it began this semester you know her madame flahaur and can answer my next question more objectively than perhaps her parents could would you say mary beth mcbride was a wellbalanced child again the woman hesitated before replying yes i think i would there is no proof of it yet but the americans believe she has been kidnapped is being held somewhere if that is the case how do you think she would respond behave it would be terrifying for any child im not asking about any child im asking about mary but lets make it general if you like considering the terror of being held by total strangers and not knowing what was going to happen to her would mary stand up to it better or worse than most children of her age there was yet another pause for consideration better i think sport activities are part of the curriculum yes is she enthusiastic or doesnt she like it shes a very active participant in everything competitive madame flahaur looked steadily back at claudine understanding the point yes shes competitive someone who likes to win in everything yes mary beth likes very much to win well demanded blake as they walked out on to the rue du canal good news and bad news analysed claudine shes a wilfully disobedient child who doesnt frighten easily thats good if shes being held shell be able to stand up to the trauma the bad news is that if she confronts too hard too forcefully anyone holding her will probably hurt her kill her it would make it more likely youre supposed to make the forecasts he reminded her shell try to do something predicted claudine theres something we havent talked about yet blake pointed out what about her having been snatched for sex its something were overdue considering agreed claudine i think its a far stronger possibility than a straight kidnap mary should have been taken home by a car waiting to collect her at the door but it had a puncture it was pure chance that she was walking up this road which she shouldnt have been doing no one snatching her could have known who she was until after they got her this isnt a wellplanned abduction of the daughter of a millionaire ambassador id say that makes it even more likely theyll kill her if they havent already said blake id say the same said claudine james mcbride was furious redfaced temple veins throbbing hillary who insisted upon being part of every discussion about mary in which her husband was involved had actually leapt up from her seat incensed just two demanded mcbride and the womans never been involved in a kidnap before she admitted it openly confirmed norris he sat primly on the chair facing the ambassador across die desk but inwardly he felt very relaxed very satisfied everything was going precisely as he wanted at the speed he wanted hed cleared his decks got everything in place when ive finished kicking ass this fucking country this fucking continent is going to regret the day they didnt take this seriously sir said norris quickly you made it quite clear in your first message to washington how you wanted this handled by the fbi which the bureau and the president completely understood thats where we are now ive made all the necessary gestures at this mornings meeting i even allowed them to think theyd outargued me into having the media release but theyre behind us now unimportant im asking you for the sake of mary beth to let it be lets wait for the approach which ill personally deal with to get mary beth back and weve got the perfect rejection when they complain about being kept out they didnt behave professionally enough to be included i dont need a perfect rejection insisted hillary but i need a clear field in which to operate which ive got at the moment said norris and thats exactly what i need to save your daughter mcbride was about to speak when the study door burst open paul harding remained at the threshold formality forgotten in his excitement come quickly he ran and automatically mcbride hillary and norris ran after him not knowing where they were going six additional computers had been installed to supplement the embassys regular four in the emergency communications centre and they reached it in time to see every screen filled by the same message mary mary quite contrary where do they think you hide not in silver bells or cockle shells be patient mr mcbride even as norris yelled whos it from whats the sender address the message flickered just once and disappeared from the screens the fbi man turned triumphantly to the ambassador marys alive and i was right its a kidnap were going to get her back safe and well as usual mary was alerted by the sound of the key in the lock but wasnt prepared for it to be the woman standing outside when the door swung open there was a jump in her stomach but she didnt think anything showed on her face she hoped not come on out said felicite hardvoiced beckoning the child into the outer room mary obeyed because to have held back might have indicated she was frightened she didnt want the woman to think that because she wasnt but she didnt want to get slapped again behind the woman was the man who always seemed to be there not giggling now and another man the womans face thin and sharp and deeply tanned with brownish blond hair tightly pinned to her head was uncovered the two men were masked are you taking me back instead of answering felicite raised her head animallike and sniffed the air smelly child nasty smelly child there was nothing to say mary stood legs slightly apart showing no uncertainty looking back at the woman if you wont wash yourself youll have to be washed announced felicite ill shower myself said mary hurriedly then are you taking me home your father knows that weve got you that youre safe what did he say he hasnt been able to say anything yet i dont understand hasnt he given you any money not yet we havent asked for any isnt that what you want felicite laughed we want lots of things whys it taking so long because i want it to i dont understand mary repeated you dont have to understand you just have to do as youre told i keep telling you that youll be punished if you dont listen unthinkingly marys tongue strayed to her healing lip she stopped the gesture hoping her mouth hadnt bulged to show the woman what shed done ill shower myself she said again and ill watch to make sure you do it properly said felicite we all will i dont want you to are you asking me to slap you again harder than i did before it wasnt right for the men to see her with no clothes on not even dad saw her like that she didnt want the woman to see either but she didnt want to be slapped ill do it by myself mary flinched back when felicite started towards her unable to stop herself and backed towards the door the giggling man had pointed to the previous day she moved abruptly suddenly quick trying to get inside and close the door behind her but felicite caught its edge and jerked it back open she hit out with her other hand catching the unsuspecting child fully in the chest thrusting her further into the bathroom which was much bigger than mary had imagined there was a bath against one wall and three glassfronted shower stalls arranged along the far wall there were three separate handbasins and a toilet open to the room not enclosed by a cubicle and two stools side by side mary stood in the middle of the bathroom staring back at the open door the woman was in the middle with the two men close behind her for the first time there was a snigger from the man who normally guarded her do you want me to undress you no undress yourself then mary turned her back she dropped her skirt and her shirt on the floor as she usually did and behind her felicite said fold your things up neatly mary stooped doing what she was told it wasnt going to be as bad as shed thought with her back to them all theyd see was her bottom nothing else that wasnt so bad although she wished they werent able to shed tell dad hed be very angry angrier than he got sometimes with mom when they were fighting as she half ran to the shower stalls she heard them laughing behind her she stood with her back to them inside the stall aware theyd be able at least to see her outline through the glass door there was shampoo as well as soap so she washed her hair even though she hadnt seen a dryer outside she could use a towel to get most of the wet out and leave it to dry by itself she hadnt seen a towel either and when she got out of the shower shed have to face them she stopped soaping herself arms limply to her sides as the water poured over her not knowing what to do she wanted to cry tears burning into her eyes why hadnt dad paid shouted at them and told them to let her go and given them the money and got her back why it wasnt fair would mom and dad be shouting at each other this shouldnt be happening it was rude nasty they were nasty nasty rude people in scary masks she wanted to make pee pee she did knowing they wouldnt be able to see what she was doing with the shower gushing over her the woman would probably hit her if she knew but she didnt it was good doing something they didnt know about defying them thats what she had to do defy them but not let them know so the woman didnt hit her any more she didnt feel like crying now but she still had to get out so theyd see her maybe there would be a towel just outside thats where towels were just outside a shower stall she wished she could remember determinedly mary switched off the water turning to the door she could vaguely make out the grownups through the clouded glass she hesitated pushing her wet hair back off her face and then reached out with her left hand to slide the door open she put the other hand in front of her penny box she kept it there as she stepped out immediately bringing her left hand and arm up across herself although it didnt cover everything the woman was standing in the middle of the bathroom holding the towel out poor little bedraggled mary come and get your towel it meant uncovering herself to reach out but if she got the towel they wouldnt be able to see anything she put out her left hand but at the last minute the woman snatched the towel away and unthinkingly mary tried to grab with her other hand and they all laughed at her when she realized her penny box was uncovered and jerked her hand back to hide it mary and felicite were dancing awkwardly round the bathroom now the woman always lifting the towel just out of marys reach the woman said dance mary dance for us and the masked men laughed and one said this is good suddenly the woman flicked the towel to the left but lowered it so that mary had to twist to get it as she did so the woman released it making her stumble further and then mary felt herself grabbed from the side and bent over as the woman slumped down on the bathroom stool to bring her across her lap with her bottom exposed and then the woman began to hit her chanting with each slap they were very hard and stung this is for being a naughty girl and not washing and this is for trying to run up into the hall when you were allowed out yesterday and this is for thinking you could trick the nice man who is looking after you into letting you go and this is for thinking you can get away from us and this is to show you what will happen if you try to do it again felicite stopped breathless she brought her hand down hard once more and said and thats for taking your brace out although i like you much better without it it hurt worse than when she was slapped in the face and the men were looking at her and still laughing but mary didnt cry she hoped the pee pee hadnt all washed away and the woman got some on her hand the message from kurt volker was waiting when claudine and blake returned to the metropole its started then said the german enthusiastically when claudine returned the call what there was a brief silence from the other end didnt you know the people whove got the girl have made contact with the embassy no admitted claudine how did you find out i hacked into the embassy home pages as soon as you told me i was involved it was the obvious thing to do wasnt it oh yes said claudine feeling a sweep of euphoria thats how the approach was made by computer anonymous email confirmed volker a kidnap first as far as im aware isnt that fantastic fantastic she agreed you want me to come down yes said claudine and transfer me to sanglier he needs to come too it was marcel who had taught felicite his own definition of hedonism the pursuit of ultimate pleasure in all things without bounds and felicite accepted shed been an eager pupil thered been a sexual excitement still was in working the stock markets of europe which hed been so adept at plundering rarely losing as she rarely lost but most of all in laughing at other peoples naivety even those in their special sex group who imagined they were bound by a common bond when all the time she and marcel had laughed at their inadequacies mocking them laughing at everyone else too it was still amusing to serve on the charities two of which marcel had actually founded for tax reasons and hearing herself described as a good person she had deeply and genuinely loved marcel she knew she could never love anyone else chapter seven henri sanglier was furious it was procedurally correct that he should publicly represent europol at the ambassadors side the following day but blake should have consulted him first there was nothing he could do no protest or rebuke he could make but by appearing at a press conference he would be identifying himself as a controlling europol executive the controlling europol executive shortly to ascend even greater heights while knowingly involved in an act not just flagrantly illegal but of incalculable diplomatic implications if it ever became known he would also be appearing beside a us ambassador aware but again helpless to protest that the americans despised both him and his organization it was like being cuckolded which in fact he had been for years by countless women in the marriage of convenience that had provided francoise with a husband of legendary name and him with the adornment of one of frances most beautiful and legendary models who by her outrageous lesbian promiscuity was increasingly becoming a career risk and finally there was claudine carter sanglier found it difficult to believe how many mistakes hed made about her in his inability to believe that her appointment to europol had been a coincidence yet that was surely all it could have been had she known the truth about his fathers wartime exploits the truth he himself only suspected she would have given some indication by now all hed done in his determination to protect the family name and reputation was probably to make himself look ridiculous he would be adding to that stupidity if he tried to make amends and he would anyway soon be away from her and europol how much he wished he could free himself from francoise too hed make a superb justice minister all he had to do was avoid any scandal or embarrassment like being involved in hacking into a us embassy computer system until the conclusion of the final negotiations now interrupted by having to be here in brussels instead of in paris the value of visiting the belgian police headquarters went far beyond accepting the offered working accommodation andre poncellets obvious ignorance of the computer contact confirmed the contempt with which the americans were treating the belgian police as well as europol the local police commissioner was effusively attentive personally escorting them round the firstfloor fiveroomed corner suite and then insisting upon dispensing drinks in his own lavish quarters to discuss the following days public appearance and an intended meeting afterwards at the justice ministry it was therefore two hours after taking up their accommodation before sanglier was finally alone with claudine blake and kurt volker even then it took another thirty minutes for volker to access his online computers at europol to check for any further messages before closing that tracer down to log on to the embassy circuits from the newly provided belgian machines by the time any worthwhile discussion was possible sanglier had become tight with frustration stumping aimlessly around their allocated space and for a lot of the time gazing unseeingly through the panoramic window in the direction of the eus palais dberlaymont building trying to rearrange the mental disorder into some comfortable logical sequence he failed he turned at the germans entry and said well nothing said volker you sure you would have picked it up had there been anything demanded blake volkers customary amiability briefly faded at the question there are two obvious pathname words mary and mcbride before i left europol i created programs to record both either separately or together in any communication into or out of the embassy theres been nothing ive downloaded everything on to my system here now claudine sat back easily in her chair for the moment content for sanglier and blake to go through the preliminaries even able mildly to amuse herself at blakes lingering surprise at meeting kurt volker for the first time as always the german looked like a scarecrow that had been left out in the rain the blond hair a disarrayed thatch over the owlishly bespectacled face the shapeless suit crumpled and strained around an indulged figure unaccustomed to weighing scales or tape measures blake wasnt allowing any timewasting reactions but he was still regarding volker like a rare species in a natural history museum i want to understand how it was done persisted sanglier simple said volker patiently and like most simple things its brilliant whoevers got mary knows about computers and how to hack in and out of them the embassys email address is available on the internet through the us information web site server all they had to do was access it and send their message that doesnt help us protested blake surely the sources of email messages are recorded so we must know where it came from volker nodded his chubby cheeks wobbling in the majority of correspondence yes otherwise the receiver wouldnt know who to reply to but whoever sent the message didnt want a reply the man hesitated looking apologetically at claudine and they beat me i didnt time it i will the next one obviously but i calculate that the message was displayed for precisely sixty seconds not long enough for me to get a printout but i do know there wasnt a respond address it was the logical thing to look for the embassy uses the unix internet server i went straight into it when the message closed down there was no trace claudine said so how did the sender remain anonymous ive introduced my own entry code as a bug to their main terminal said volker only i know what it is so the americans arent aware im there and theres no way they can discover me i can go in and out whenever i want he gestured to the three newly installed blank screens glowing in the adjoining room im permanently linked waiting for the next communication using the names mary or mcbride he paused frowning at the lack of comprehension from the two other men then explained i believe thats how whoevers holding mary is operating with a slight variation they certainly wont be working from their own traceable terminal they will have hacked into somebody elses system thats their initial concealment quite apart from avoiding any user costs and installed their own entry code in whats usually referred to as a trojan horse thats a program in which automatic commands can be stored in this case im guessing they didnt want their trojan horse to be permanent as i want mine to be i imagine theyll have added to their bug a program that selfdestructs to a certain trigger a timed suicide in fact i believe they got into somebodys system like a cuckoo in the nest and sent their message and after sixty seconds the trojan horse destroyed itself instead of the host system which is the normal way such viruses work claudine said they wanted mcbride to know theyve got his daughter but didnt give the man any way of responding that doesnt fit a usual kidnap pattern what are they doing then demanded sanglier needing to catch up at the same time like a mantra in his head he was thinking what am i doing sitting here calmly discussing breaking the law condoning it agreeing to it learning how its done amusing themselves taunting mcbride said claudine she looked briefly at blake and it fits how mary was grabbed in the first place i think shes being held by paedophiles what demanded sanglier incredulous just ahead of blake who said how the hell do you reach that conclusion speaking more to the detective than the commissioner claudine said weve already decided it didnt start as a planned abduction she was snatched by chance a child looking younger than her age the message is derived from a childs nursery rhyme thats paedophile thinking maybe more subconscious than a positive choice its a taunt arent you literally reading a lot from very little broke in blake thats what im supposed to do claudine said unoffended and i havent finished there are variations of mary mary quite contrary recited in continental europe but its really an english nursery song she paused again looking at volker and the message sent to the embassy was in english yes he confirmed and although its a pretty rotten poem the english was good continued claudine one or more of the people holding the child could be english by birth although i doubt it i think its more likely that they were educated at an expensive private school where english was well taught as a second language it might be even that the person who wrote the message had an english governess or nanny so theyll be rich suggested blake prepared for the moment to go along with claudines reasoning possibly she agreed or were once how does that square with the computer use demanded blake he looked at volker the contact method might seem simple to you but its not to me to me its complicated and technically obscure only someone who uses computers all the time would have that level of expertise how many rich people need to reach that level of computer literacy mary is being held by more than one person said claudine paedophiles usually hunt in packs and take their pleasure in packs it doesnt follow that the person who wrote the message was the one who physically sent it blake switched his attention fully to the german now you think you know how theyre going to communicate will it be possible to trace a source before the thing selfdestructs next time maybe said volker cautiously im ready to go into unix the moment another message appears but dont forget it literally is the world wide web the next message could originate from somewhere in belgium right next door to this building if you like and ride piggyback through two or more totally unsuspecting host systems in two or more countries anywhere around the globe before appearing on the embassy screens back here momentarily there was complete silence as the awareness settled in the room blake said are you saying we cant stop them or find them volker said its not going to be easy they can come from anywhere and close down before weve alerted any local police force and i really mean anywhere in the world but at some time therell have to be proper contact if they want a physical handover of a ransom said blake if they make it a proper kidnap claudine pointed out the messages might just be an additional amusement that theyll tire of she hesitated and even if they do try to get money theyll still use mary in the way they originally snatched her for volker who doted on his five children said are you absolutely sure she was originally taken for sex thats my professional opinion said claudine bluntly the german shuddered very slightly would they let her go afterwards exchange her for a ransom i mean there are too many variables for me to give a definite opinion claudine replied the most difficult to assess is the americans and their negotiator norris were not on the inside by invitation remember no were inside illegally protested sanglier we cant officially do anything about what we know we cant even tell the belgian police with whom were supposed to be working can you imagine how it could affect us affect europol looking directly at the frenchman claudine said pointedly i can certainly imagine how it could affect a tenyearold child sanglier flushed dont misunderstand me no one spoke because no one had to hurriedly sanglier said there cant be any question of the americans keeping us out claudine hesitated momentarily undecided if it was the right time to introduce her concern then she said whether they do or not its my professional judgement that john norris is incapable of conducting a proper negotiation even if the opportunity arises what are you talking about said sanglier knowing how the other three had interpreted his concern at legality and hot with selfanger because of it in clinical detail itemizing her indicators against norriss attitude and remarks claudine recounted that mornings meeting with the fbi negotiator people like norris on the verge of losing personal control invariably overcompensate by imposing as much external command as possible on those over whom they believe they have authority she concluded the operational danger is in their thinking they have authority over those with whom theyre negotiating thats the road to disaster for a victim caught between opposing sides each believing they can manipulate the other quite literally its the rock and a hard place syndrome sanglier who hated betraying any weakness felt totally helpless at his inability to think of anything the other three were actually looking at him expectantly i think i should meet the ambassador before the conference it sounded positive but only just mcbride will be guided entirely by norris claudine warned him sanglier said and i can use your opinion as a counterargument youre clearly right about a planned kidnaps being the wrong assumption from which to begin the investigation if i can make mcbride see that realize norriss fallibility his attitude might change im sure ill get any more email correspondence said volker if theres something as positive as a suggested meeting are we going to hold back from acting upon it claudine saved sanglier from having to admit that he didnt know she said nothing is going to be as positive as an arranged meeting were watching a game thats only just begun the relief was incomplete and shortlived and ended in bitter ill temper the combined disbelieving fury of james and hillary mcbride was the greatest and most easily understandable when the amateur poem had faded from the computer screens hillary had swept in to join the inquest in her husbands study shouting for answers that no one had what the fucks going on i hear from someone whos got my daughter but doesnt tell me how to get back to him mcbride said it doesnt make any sense hillary added how can we pay without knowing who or how or when or where i dont know admitted norris uncomfortably you demanded the ambassador jerking a wavering finger at the computer programmer in norriss team what the hell happened why wasnt there an address to get back to its not always automatic said howard williams he was a thinhaired facially twitched young man whose elbowscaled psoriasis was on fire from the nerveracked tension of being in charge of a communications team that appeared to have failed its first test williams was an excellent technician who could dismantle and reassemble any known make of computer but a virginal stranger to the shadowed side roads of cyberspace along which kurt volker prowled with the surefootedness of an alley cat you didnt even record the fucking message it closed down before there was time said williams miserably we didnt expect it to come like it did then why the hell were four supposed computer experts included in the task force you told us youd set up a foolproof system hillary directed the question to norris not the dejected specialist norris who never allowed himself a single mistake inwardly squirmed at having to accept the ultimate responsibility telephone links go down all the time he tried desperately is this what happened here something stupid like a bad connection mcbride asked williams who shuffled uncomfortably refusing to meet the ambassadors bulgingeyed stare i dont think it was an actual line collapse sir i think it was intentionally wiped at source mcbride went back to the fbi commander purplefaced but speaking once more with ominous quietness mr norris we were connected to the bastards whove got my little girl and they got away you want to explain mat to me in a way ill understand so that i wont think you and your team are a bunch of losing fucking incompetents because thats what id like you to do starting now there was a sweep of mindblanking dizziness and norris thought he might have stumbled fallen even if he hadnt fortunately been sitting in one of the few chairs fronting the ambassadors footballpitch desk although he despised his superior thought him a total offthewall jerk paul harding momentarily felt sorry for the man lance rampling was trying mentally to compose the message to langley that would convey the full extent of the fbi fuckup without letting the intercepting bureau realize every error no matter how small would go into the cias infighting armoury to be broken out and fired at the first skirmish of a political battle between the two agencies im waiting threatened mcbride it wasnt a demand norris said desperately it was to tell us theyve got mary for us to be ready theyre softening us up proving theyve got all the winning cards the last part admitting that he wasnt orchestrating everything hurt almost with a physical pain whoever had the child would pay for making him do that hed teach them who was the boss the moment they began proper negotiations and then really teach them once mary was safely recovered theyd know what it was like to be hunted by the time hed finished with them you saying weve got to wait until they feel like getting back to us asked hillary norris fervently sought an alternative but couldnt think of one its a negotiating ploy i dont give a shit what it is said mcbride im not waiting we are ready the moneys here i want to get back to them how are we going to do that norris felt a sink of helplessness unthinkingly half turning towards williams anxiously the technician blurted we could log a message on the browsers what the hells that said mcbride sharply a browser is like a subject directory or index in a classified telephone book people surf the net through browsers searching for information logged there were doing the press release tonight so theres no need for secrecy any more why dont we make an entry its called starting a thread naming mary through newscape and microsoft explorer it would be inviting them to come back to us it sounded good some positive action conceded norris eager to contribute and to illustrate his psychological ability he said to let them know its aimed at them and that we want to deal our response should be along the lines of their message to us whatever it takes insisted mcbride get it done get mary back they were very late returning from antwerp they hadnt driven down until after jean smet had left his office but he still invited felicite galan into his house off the rue de flandres to watch his latest movie from amsterdam afterwards felicite said one of the boys was at least sixteen and a professional it was still good defended smet the others will like it i wonder what mary will think of it you said she wasnt going to be touched said smet i said no one else was to touch her and it was only a little slap on her ass it was a hiding you hit her too hard she knew the man was right a necessary lesson shell do as shes told in future so i wont have to do it again dehane did very well with the message didnt he i knew it was technically possible and i told you it would be completely undetectable i still dont like it said the man weakly why hasnt the justice ministry created a supervisory committee the way they did when the boy died she asked ignoring the mans protest smet smiled it was proposed before i left the ministry this afternoon and asked felicite smiling too im responsible for establishing it just like before and i head the legal advisory team that will sit with it felicites expression broadened in satisfaction so everything will be as foolproof as last time the americans have brought in a huge team of people apparently and europols involved we anticipated it would be more highpowered than before felicite said dismissively would you have done it broken up the group if we hadnt agreed about mary asked the ministry lawyer no longer smiling i want things my way said the thinfaced woman i get tired of telling you mat the military aircraft repatriating harry becker and his family was delayed for two hours that night to enable the even more distressed howard williams to travel back to washington on norriss personal authority from the us embassy norris sent a respond this day reminder to washington for the requested indepth reinvestigation into mcbrides business affairs that request as well as the browser message to the unknown holders of mary beth mcbride were both instantly picked up by kurt volkers ever attentive trojan horse chapter eight the americans internet message read where is mary mary quite contrary and was signed off with the embassys email address it appeared a lighthearted joking invitation except to those aware of the desperation of the plea claudine acknowledged the need for the nursery rhyme connotation but at the am conference for which she blake and sanglier had to be awakened volker alerted by his computerlinked pager warned the result would be chaotic on a never sleeping world wide web as usercrowded as oxford street or fifth avenue on christmas eve volker had been proved right by am when they assembled again in sangliers metropole suite to discuss their preconference encounter with the ambassador by then there were two hundred and twenty responses with more arriving on average every five minutes the majority mostly eager to participate in an imagined internet mystery game predicated on childrens doggerel five were analysed correctly as it subsequently turned out by claudine to be disguised paedophile approaches although she decided none came from marys captors which also proved correct not one reply emanated from brussels the only belgian response from charleroi proved to be from a wheelchairbound crippled twelveyearold boy only able freely to wander the world from his bedroom computer to blakes unasked question at the breakfast strategy meeting sanglier announced at once all right theyre excluding us and now weve got proof we can confront them with theyve identified themselves with their email address so how do we do it he was inwardly ecstatic at his escape from the problem of illegally entering the embassy system hard declared claudine at once knowing the question was directed at her weve got to establish our control officially you really serious about norris asked blake absolutely what do we do about him said sanglier as volker moved the coffee pot around the breakfast table the same hes guiding everyone at the moment weve got to show hes wrong then its got to be you psychologist against psychologist insisted sanglier he was supremely confident knowing he couldnt lose the forthcoming encounter he hoped the woman realized his acceptance of her ability not an attempt at amends he reminded himself the proper establishment of a proper team arrangement after personally challenging the ambassador hed insist europol officially protest direct to washington too a disaster which was the most likely outcome if the womans assessment was even half correct could now be proved the result of unwarranted technically illegal american interference while a successful recovery could be manipulated into a brilliant example of europol police work personally headed by commissioner henri sanglier either way any condoned illegality on kurt volkers part would be smothered henri sanglier was an extremely contented man james mcbride clearly wasnt the american ambassador made the pretence of politeness when they entered his study his attitude a mixture of his usual aggression tempered by a growing acceptance of defeat his eyes were redrimmed and bagged and he coughed frequently to clear a throat that didnt need clearing hillary mcbride appeared far more controlled than her husband she was smoking unusually long cigarettes john norris sat looking out into the room on the left of the desk with paul harding and lance rampling alongside elliot smith the young legal adviser was beside burt harrison the chief of mission to the ambassadors right i want to say at once how much i appreciate the involvement of europol and your coming personally said mcbride anxious to get the diplomatic niceties out of the way and conclude the meeting as soon as possible to get back to where norriss team were assessing the incoming internet messages i hope commissioner that when you and i appear publicly later well be able to build upon whats in this mornings papers the overnight press release dominated the front page of every newspaper with the issued photograph of mary beth mcbride im afraid mr ambassador sanglier said quickly discerning the imminent dismissal i think there is something extremely important for us to discuss before talking about todays press conference immediate hope overrode mcbrides irritation at being interrupted but before he could speak hillary blurted youve found her no said sanglier bluntly addressing norris more than the parents he went on and our chances of doing so are seriously endangered by the interference of your own law enforcement agencies acting without any jurisdiction im giving you notice as the senior europol representative in charge of this investigation that as well as my protest here this morning there will be an official europol complaint to both your state department and the federal bureau of investigation in washington claudine was astonished this was a sanglier shed never seen before although the persona fitted her impression of a man with a deeply rooted but wellconcealed inferiority complex shed never intended sanglier to be as direct or indeed as undiplomatic totally confident of their strength sanglier was emerging a bully and was she decided actually enjoying it in fact dropping all his pretension and for once actually being himself it was oddly like curing a patient whose mental illness prevented his being the person he actually was only in reverse mcbride was also visibly astonished he flushed and said i think sir that you need to remember who i am as well as giving me an explanation the legal attache leaned sideways whispering to harrison claudine wondered if blake was as surprised as she was i think we should both give each other explanations said sanglier before europol was given its operational convention it was a computerized centre collating criminal intelligence between member countries as such its operators learned the internet was extensively used by pornographers pornographers exclaimed hillary her composure going the two fbi men exchanged looks norris shook his head dr carter will explain that sanglier said hear me out as part of our investigation an investigation we believed your government your central intelligence agency and your federal bureau of investigation fully accepted to be under europols operational jurisdiction our experts accessed various internet web sites claudine was intently watching the interaction among the americans facing her mcbrides face was beginning to burn hillary was expressionless but looking fixedly at norris the chief of mission a professional diplomat remained impassive too despite the legal attaches frantic whispering norris was blinking rapidly and as she looked the man straightened in his chair and pulled his tightly buttoned jacket down as if wanting to remove some creases harding was staring down at the floor and rampling was suddenly engrossed in a manicure problem affecting his left hand a gamut of guilt claudine thought late last night we read what appears to be a message sent generally through a large number of browsers from the email address of this embassy sanglier bulldozed on it obviously referred to your missing daughter thered been no prior consultation with any of my officers about that which contravenes our understanding it was also curiously worded almost in code suggesting some earlier correspondence of which my officers were also unaware he paused again as if inviting an interruption before finishing thats my explanation ambassador id welcome hearing yours claudine calculated that sanglier the high priest of diplomatic correctness was on the very edge of going too far it was unlikely with the fate of his daughter involved but if mcbride became offended enough to order them from the embassy the situation they were trying to correct would in fact become even more difficult but mcbride wasnt sufficiently offended he said lamely im trying to get my daughter back seemingly anxious to curb sanglier blake said and this isnt the way to do it this is the way to lose her permanently say something hillary demanded of norris theyre wrong he replied dogmatically ive promised ill get your daughter back and i will the first person delivery again claudine thought she was right about the man and he was inviting his own confrontation for christs sake lets sort this out implored mcbride a child my child is at stake here dr carter sanglier said claudines concentration was absolute upon john norris the only controlling authority to which the man would defer would be mcbride here in brussels or recognizably tided officials in washington she had to face the man down now in front of the ambassador it would destroy any possibility of a proper working relationship between them but the alternative was the destruction of mary beth mcbride and claudine was unafraid eager even to make one enemy she didnt doubt she could defeat to get to the far more threatening adversary she didnt at the moment know how to challenge norris was equally intent upon claudine isolating her as his opponent he was smiling faintly claudine attacked the puncture was entirely accidental there are still some tests to be carried out norris settled back comfortably considering the encounter a further establishment of his position claudine saw hardings eyes flicker sideways towards his superior rampling was frowning at the man too at this moment is there any evidence to suggest that the puncture was anything but accidental im awaiting the results of the test it wasnt going to be difficult thought claudine could the misunderstanding at the school have been anticipated no it should not have happened the culprit has already been disciplined mary should not have been permitted to leave the school no nor should she have walked off alone she should have returned to the building there was a vague wariness yes could it have been anticipated that she wouldnt beside the fbi chief harding was looking down hard at the floor again mcbride and his wife were moving their heads back and forth with each question and answer norris said no claudine prolonged the silence until mcbride shifted impatiently she said youve just admitted totally misunderstanding the crime we are investigating and by your refusal to listen to anyones voice or opinion other than your own youre putting yourself your reputation before saving a child there was an audible intake of breath from the legal attache mcbride swivelled to the fbi man but before the ambassador could speak norris shook his head the smile broadening and said this is quite ridiculous were wasting time here sir how could mary have been targeted as a kidnap victim without its being known in advance that the car would have a puncture the school would misunderstand a telephone message and shed walk off up the rue du canal when there was no one waiting to collect her demanded claudine the room was frozen by silence she had little right to condemn sanglier for bullying claudine accepted but there was a very important difference she was knowingly doing it to achieve an essential end result i really dont think this should norris started but mcbride stretched sideways stopping the man with a wardingoff gesture he leaned forward over his desk towards claudine and said youve got an audience doctor im going to listen to everything you say but by christ youd better be right claudines attention hadnt wavered from norris his mouth was moving the words barely held back and she decided that in his outrage the man was only just acknowledging the ambassadors authority remembering their supposed ignorance of the incoming mary mary message claudine demanded tell me what their approach was for a moment the fbi chief remained motionless until mcbride made another gesture a beckoning motion this time norris reached into the file propped against his chair extracting a single sheet of paper read it to us claudine insisted forcing the imperious tone it was a thin tightrope trying to impose her will upon norris at the same time as impressing the ambassador and his wife with her assessment to convince them that she should conduct any negotiation norris did his voice cracking in impotent fury that an original printout persisted claudine following the courtroom crossexamination principle of never asking a question to which the answer wasnt known a copy the screen cleared before we had time to get a printout analyse it for us insisted claudine remorselessly this was appalling she knew she didnt have the slightest doubt that norris was suffering the clinical mental impairment shed earlier suspected and by doing everything she could as relentlessly as she could to expose the professional inadequacy she was actually treating the man in a way diametrically opposed to the path she should have taken know thyself she thought was her behaviour justified by the excuse of trying to rescue a child in every sort of physical and mortal danger or was it worse even than bullying wasnt she guilty of her own impairment the need always to show that claudine carter was the best and prepared to trample any opposition underfoot to prove it more than that even wasnt she really performing after all to impress peter blake its the initial contact from people who have kidnapped mary beth mcbride said norris formally his confidence recovering from whom she jabbed refusing to let go norris hesitated the people whove got her doggedly her kidnappers tell us about them norris looked uncertain more than one it would have had to be a car to grab her off the street at least one to drive the other to subdue her when she realized what had happened enough money to own or gain access to a vehicle computer literate with access to a modem money again i meant from the message claudine interrupted thats police reasoning not psychological profiling tell me what you learn from the message itself what it tells you about mary too norris broke his direct gaze looking down to the paper as if he expected more than the message to be there he became aware of mcbrides attention and briefly looked back before saying beginning of a familiar kidnap pattern abductors knowing they are in charge the absence of any initial demand or how to respond is to impose pressure poor bastard claudine thought poor mentally confused mentally blocked bastard youre not properly interpreting a single indicator mary was abducted by chance not design the only intention of those whore holding her was to get a child theyre paedophiles oh dear god no moaned hillary softly not that her composure left her completely her face crumpling i dont think using a childs nursery rhyme was necessarily intended to identify their sexual predilection although in my opinion it does claudine pressed on her sympathy switching to parents who from the beginning would have feared what shed just openly declared but the choice of that particular rhyme was most definitely intentional far beyond the coincidence of the name marys disobedient a contrary child she might have got willingly into a car but shes resisted defied them since is she alive demanded hillary what will they have done to her claudine didnt want to create any false hope it was difficult at that moment to imagine any other sort but she believed there was a fragile straw at which the couple could clutch she has to be alive for them to know how contrary she is doesnt she what about groped mcbride unable to say the words would they have i dont know admitted claudine the message does mean theyve turned it into an abduction as long as it remains that theres a possibility shell be safe safe in every way it wasnt the absolute truth but it wasnt an absolute lie either but there was no purpose in reducing to total despair people who had already lost their child perhaps for ever destroying one man as she feared she was destroying john norris was more than enough the thin american had brought his head up to look at her again his face fixed several times as she talked harding and rampling had nodded as if in acceptance so had the legal attache she assessed burt harrisons facetwisted frown to be both an acknowledgement of her judgement and disgust at what it meant the ambassador was as crumpled as his wife his whole body seeming to wither a man a father brought face to face with the most unthinkable horror desperately mcbride said you could be wrong you could be the one misunderstanding its my job not to be replied claudine and i dont think i am weve got a kidnap situation which has always been my opinion persisted norris his voice was still cracked there are young sexual deviants juveniles even but the people holding mary are adult predicted claudine ignoring the other profiler theres an intellectualism almost a sophistication in their message that young people wouldnt have and there is access to money going beyond the obvious of a cars being involved theres access to a house or somewhere where mary can be held prisoner without fear of discovery and theres a high degree of computer literacy she hesitated her throat jagged the strain of what had become a virtual lecture beginning to pull at her the one message thats been received isnt an initial kidnap approach its a challenge how we balance that challenge and i really do mean balance entirely determines our chances of saving mary claudine paused again looking at norris shed had to be brutal she convinced herself it was nothing personal certainly nothing done to impress anyone and definitely not peter blake from the ambassadors very obvious anguish claudine was sure quite apart from whatever censure might officially come from washington that it was time to attempt whatever flimsy bridge was possible with norris she said thats why there can only be one finely focused negotiating stance and one set of negotiators work independently and youll never get mary back intact she began looking among the americans arrayed before her but abruptly stopped that was performing uncomfortable with the realization but sticking with her point claudine said your decision ambassador i believe youve only got one which is the one were asking you to make do you want to get mary back alive at least horrifying as the implications of that question are or do you want your law enforcement agencies to go on working independently she allowed a gap our way theres a chance your way there isnt there was momentarily another chilled silence then norris began to speak but once again mcbride quietened the man with an impatient gesture it was hillary who said for gods sake shut up mcbride said theres been a bad misunderstanding for which i apologize now its been corrected nothing will again be attempted independently you have my word but i want yours can you get our daughter back alive at least yes blurted norris at once i dont know admitted claudine i want you to lead the negotiations mcbride told claudine he turned to the fbi man beside him do you understand norris was unable to reply for several moments yes he managed at last as claudine had anticipated the press conference was frenetic she had also anticipated correctly that by the time it began the email appeal would have been discovered by the already alerted media and advised mcbride and sanglier to respond to every question in the apparent belief that marys disappearance was a ransommotivated kidnap with no sexual implication there was fractionally more time for her to prepare them than andre poncellet who ascended the lightwhitened platform more relieved than confused by her urging which he accepted without argument that he should let the other two men take the majority of the questions restricting himself to agreeing with whatever undertaking they gave he wanted to hear from those who held his daughter declared a chokevoiced mcbride his wife rigidfaced beside him he was prepared to negotiate he pleaded for mary not to be harmed in any way towards the end he cried openly and unashamedly accepting hillarys offered hand claudine was delighted because the helplessness was so genuine and conveyed exactly the impression she wanted that whoever held mary was in total control able at a finger snap or rather a keyboard tap to manipulate not just the nations of the european union but america as well john norris understood everything hed underestimated the woman who was activated entirely by jealousy envy of his reputation and ability and had managed to mislead everybody only a temporary setback a mistake of stupid people traumatized by the loss of a daughter have to put it right of course he had a child to save the woman could even be part of it the idea settled in his mind that was brilliant her being part of it deceiving everyone everyone except him because he was cleverer than any of them cleverer than her certainly this could be his best case proving that she was involved wouldnt be easy have to put a squad on her strip her down to the bone that was the way always was discover their secrets everyone broke down confessed when they were confronted with their secrets play it cleverly though dont let her know that he knew go along with everything while he had her checked out got to the secrets then save mary hed get her back he knew all about kidnapping knew the way their minds worked knew the way everybodys mind worked thats what he was a mindreader dont worry mary im coming ill save you no one else but me norris sensed claudines attention switching from the closed circuit television upon which theyd watched the conference i thought that went very well didnt you she said attempting some rapport lets see what the next message is claudine turned to face him lets talk about what were going to do she said urgently talk to me about how youre thinking what youre thinking we both know shell die if we dont lets try to save her together youre right said norris weve got to save her together if he told her what he was thinking shed know and then she could tell the others who had mary she might be able to fool everybody else but she couldnt fool him the justice minister himself miet ulieff greeted the delegation by unspoken agreement it was peter blake not the weary claudine who for the benefit of the ten assembled belgian officials repeated what they believed to have happened to mary beth mcbride he said nothing about the fbi dispute which had also been kept from andre poncellet the impression was that everything had come from the closest liaison between europol and the americans i want to be kept in the closest touch with every aspect of this investigation announced ulieff when blake finished im therefore appointing a member of my legal staff to work permanently alongside commissioner poncellet until this poor child is recovered he turned gesturing a man forward allow me to introduce jean smet thanks to the communication system he had introduced john norris was able to read the messages the ambassador sent to both the state department and bureau headquarters and from the cables that came in personally directed to him later that day he realized the europol commissioner hadnt been bluffing about making a direct complaint to washington either he responded as was required with the assurance of total future cooperation with europol but with the reminder that by initially working independently he had been following not just his instructions before leaving washington but the ambassadors clearly expressed wishes too it was late in the day when he detached duncan mcculloch and robert ritchie two of his best men from the squad now sifting the responses to their internet message and briefed them in detail on the investigation of claudine carter keep it tight he ordered report back to me no one else this case is being allowed to go wrong weve got to get it back on track chapter nine mary cried finally although not for herself for her mother and father for her father mostly mom had just sat there saying nothing her face not moving like when they played statues at school with the person who moved first losing the game dad had looked so helpless weeping as he had not being able to talk properly when hed asked whoever was holding her to tell him what they wanted so that he could do it and she could go home shed never known him like that not crying not knowing what to do that wasnt like dad grownup men didnt cry not dad anyway he always knew what to do thats why he was an ambassador an important person she didnt like it dad not knowing what to do it wasnt right made her feel funny unsure of what was going to happen to her she did know of course dad would get her out get her home with lots of things to tell everyone at school it was the woman who made dad cry her and the stupid men in their stupid masks but the womans fault most of all they all did what she told them to do so she hated the woman for making dad cry couldnt let her know though she might hit her again her bottom still hurt from the slapping in the bathroom she hated the woman for slapping her too she ran her teeth over her brace particularly the sharp bits she wouldnt take it out again not because the woman had slapped her for doing so because shed said shed liked her without it she wouldnt do anything the woman liked anything to please her mary realized she didnt have a handkerchief she scrubbed her eyes and her nose with her fingers and tried to dry them on her skirt only just preventing herself from jumping when the woman shouted dont be dirty get a tissue from the bathroom felicite was glad shed come out to the house by the river to let the child watch the televised conference it made her feel good being able to reduce the man to tears she hadnt expected that it was a bonus power much better than the satisfaction she got from making her group do what she wanted pity the wife hadnt cried too that would have been wonderful making them both dance when she pulled their strings one was enough though enough for now she hoped jean wouldnt be too much longer she wanted to hear what happened at the justice ministry the rush hour in antwerp might delay him hed sounded frightened on the telephone but it only needed the smallest thing he didnt expect to frighten jean smet mary came back into the huge room with her face and nose dry but uncertain what to do dad and mom werent on television any more but there was a group of men talking about how kidnap victims were freed and the strange giggling man who had felt her bottom had joined the woman to watch the french being spoken on screen was very fast and mary had difficulty following it she thought she heard something about belgiums having a bad record for child crime she wasnt sure what rapports sexuels actually meant but it sounded like what theyd been told about in biology at school how babies were made and a succession of childrens photographs suddenly appeared on the screen can you understand what theyre saying demanded felicite by telephoning the school another pleasure speaking to the establishment whose pupil was hers now to do with what she chose pretending to be the parent of a potential student shed discovered the curriculum languages were german and english in addition to french im not very good something about children being taken away from their parents to mehre in english felicite said the men on the television were talking about children getting punished if theyre bad werent they mehre sniggered so hard it sounded like a cough he said yes are we going to do it mary was sure they hadnt been speaking about punishment i havent done anything bad youre not going to are you let me please said the man urgently dad said he wanted to talk to you are you going to be naughty no mary made herself say the woman wanted to hurt her again why was the man snuffling i really want to be nice to you we all do said felicite mary couldnt think what to say she lowered herself very gently on to one of the big chairs like a movie seat in front of the giant screen her bottom still hurt the men werent talking on television any more sesame street was on although it was in french she could understand that easily enough she tried to watch it but not so the woman would see and get angry i want to love you be kind to you take me home then i will when not yet when soon would you like me to be nice to you i dont know you dont want me to slap you again do you no so youve got to be a good girl do what i tell you to do all right mary wanted to go back to her room not to be with this woman and the man who was grunting more than laughing now did you like seeing your mama and papa yes they were trying to make her cry again but she wouldnt are you going to talk to him like he asked he knows youre safe mary swallowed when can i go she wished she hadnt walked away from school she wouldnt do it again ever the man gave a grunting laugh not yet said felicite when when i say so youre bad for taking me dont be rude if youre rude ill slap you again she smiled and you know i dont want to do that the womans voice was thick again and mary didnt like it she didnt believe the woman wanted to be nice to her if she wanted to be nice why had they taken her and locked her up and hit her it didnt make sense she didnt like not understanding what was going on im not rude and i dont want to stay here i want to go home that was better mary was being contrary again would you like someone to play with mary frowned a pet you mean felicite hadnt but they were going to need another identification do you have a pet a rabbit whats its name billy boy what colour is he white with black ears and a black leg wholl be looking after him mom i suppose i didnt mean a pet to play with i meant another boy or girl does one live here in this house maybe yes i would nothing bad could happen if there was another boy or girl in the house mary felt better safer perhaps they could become friends and whoever it was might help her get away like in the books is there someone well have to see wont we did she mean it or was she playing another silly game she kept talking about games this might be one of them making mary think she could be with someone and then saying she couldnt cheating her she wanted so much to be home home with mom cuddling with mom like mom wanted to do a lot but she didnt saying it was silly she didnt think it was silly now she wanted to be with someone who cuddled her please let me go home dont whimper said felicite sharply i hate you youll love me in the end properly i wont ill make you without warning the door leading upstairs opened without entering gaston mehre said the others are here they want you to come what demanded felicite surprised please come he wasnt wearing a mask and mary saw a balding man with a red face what hair he had was red too shed be able to tell people what he looked like when she got home she wanted them punished for what they were doing to her the woman most of all but after she got home they know declared jean smet he strode round the room with its panoramic view of the now placid river nervously smoking the cigarette hed lit from the stub of the previous one know what demanded felicite lounged in her thronelike chair and for christs sake stop running around she was angry at the mans panic which was making the rest nervous and at his summoning them all like this without asking her permission the lawyer did stop but it seemed difficult for him to remain still that we took her for sex in the beginning theyre going back through police records not just in brussels but throughout the country europol records too he looked fleetingly at dehane they know computers are being used cleverly theyre sure theres no shortage of money he concentrated upon felicite did you go to school in england she laughed at the totally unexpected question for three years my father was at the london embassy what the hells that got to do with anything she thought the person who wrote the message learned the language properly so what felicite said dismissively theyre clever its not confused like last time only felicite was relaxed unworried the mehre brothers were side by side with their backs to the water gaston holding charless hand comfortingly the obese michel blott was frowning at the apparent knowledge of those hunting them and august dehane had started nibbling at a thumb nail a nerve beginning to pull at the corner of his mouth smet lit another cigarette from his preceding stub and set off once more moving up and down in front of the window the heavily bespectacled henri cool sat with his arms awkwardly folded as if he were holding himself for reassurance we cant go on insisted smet weve got to get rid of her we should have done it the first day not started all this thats what i said cool reminded them so theyre cleverer than the last time mused felicite more to herself than the others thats good it makes it much more interesting they think that too that were doing it more as a challenge than for the money blurted the government lawyer they have worked a lot out havent they conceded felicite who exactly is the clever one i dont know said smet an english superintendent blake did most of the talking at the ministry but there were two psychologists a woman and an american the americans have brought in a lot of people and their man from the embassy harrison said that as many more could be brought in as are wanted poncellet can second as many officers as they want from any force in the country and the europol commissioner sanglier said there are unlimited resources once the investigation is focused the entire cabinet is determined to find her find whos got her ulieffs job is on the line all of which i anticipated and we expected said felicite mildly im not sure that we did not properly said blott the other lawyer there was the faintest sheen of perspiration on his forehead once the investigation is focused echoed felicite the six men looked blankly at her none of them understanding felicite stared contemptuously back at them one by one finishing upon smet thats what you said isnt it what sanglier said so what weve got is nothing more than intelligent police guesswork sighed the woman they dont know anything and if they do youll know wont you youre asking me to do too much complained smet im taking all the risk youve no idea what its like sitting mere listening to it you arent in any danger and you know it said felicite impatiently its all going exactly as i knew it would even better with your attachment to poncellet that was my idea too remember but you did very well making it work smet smiled gratefully stubbing out his cigarette without lighting another it was the only positive idea anyone had before we met them all ulieff almost cried with gratitude youve got full access ulieffs told poncellet he wants daily briefings which means well have daily briefings too so wheres the danger i think theyre clever insisted smet inadequately his mind locked on a single thought felicite looked at dehane and were cleverer arent we august the deputy head of belgacoms research and development smiled uncertainly i suppose so you know so all of you have i ever failed you they were like children themselves always needing to be reassured no mumbled cool for all of them did marcel ever fail you before me no said cool again so were going to stop panicking arent we stop panicking and listen to me and everything will work out just as i want it to to dehane she said what happened after the americans posted their message thereve been almost five hundred responses with an upsurge after the press conference replied dehane a greying bearded man felicite smiled but not one from us and every single one of those five hundred has to be eliminated right the american response had been another bonus she hadnt expected but she wanted them to think that she had because shed already decided how protective it was smet said thats the only positive line of enquiry according to todays meeting which we already know is absolutely pointless said felicite people running round in circles like chickens with their heads cut off she looked pointedly at smet deciding the comparison fitted a squawking longlegged human chicken shitting himself at the first sight of the farmers axe aware of her concentration smet finally abandoned his aimless wandering and sat down in an opposite chair weve opened new lines into the embassy at the americans request said dehane weve actually been officially asked to impose a monitor on the embassys email address and weve sent some of our operators there to help with the backlog thats built up so well know all about that from you just as well know all about the official investigation from jean wont we yes confirmed dehane we are safe arent we felicite let the question settle in everyones mind conscious of the discernible recovery among the men were going to know what the people looking for us are doing and thinking every minute of every day and watch them every minute of every day buried under an avalanche of stupid messages gaston mehre patted his brothers hand reassuringly charles covered the comforting fingers with his own blott and dehane looked at each other and nodded smiling as if felicite had said something they already knew looking at charles mehre blott said what about criminal records restricted to children felicite asked smet thats the remit confirmed the lawyer it was indecency in a public place twelve years ago reminded gaston patting his brothers hand again the girl was sixteen charles was eighteen it wont show up said felicite positively she held out a wavering finger as if she was holding a gun stopping at blott you can compose the next message ive got an identification shes got a pet rabbit named billy the fat man shifted uncomfortably what shall i say this one doesnt have to have any input from me said felicite impatient again i dont want to know what it says just compose it and give it to august to send should i make a demand get it over with quickly asked blott hopefully i think you should said smet i want to get it finished im the one under all the pressure theres no hurry said felicite theyre the ones under pressure i want to increase it before the negotiations start cool said we should kill her were going to anyway lets have a party now and get it over with you know the party were going to have felicite reminded him the others havent found their new friends yet before she left felicite beckoned gaston away from his brother she said charles was getting too excited this afternoon i dont want him doing anything to mary i know how to quieten him said the man dont worry before sanglier caught a late afternoon train back to the hague it was agreed to post an appeal on every internet provider for users to leave the embassys home page clear for whoever held mary to make unimpeded contact despite kurt volkers doubt that it would have any effect its a users dream warned the german every surfer is a voyeur at heart think of the opportunity the chance to become involved in a sensational investigation from the uninvolved comfort and dangerfree safety of their own armchair certainly every journalist from every media outlet will be permanently connected claudine was depressed by the enormous traffic flow into the greatly enlarged computer centre unable to believe it possible for a genuine kidnap message to be identified from the mass of material being sorted in front of her volker wanted to attempt a fasttrack selection program and refused claudines dinner suggestion so because it had been a hard day and la maison du cygne was conveniently close she and blake ate there again exhausted claudine sat back very content to let blake order a lot of battles won he suggested but not the war cautioned claudine she supposed she should have felt satisfied by the events of the day but she didnt she felt curiously flat unsettled that there wasnt a positive direction in which to go it wasnt she knew a properly dispassionate reflection but always in the forefront of her mind was the thought of an imprisoned child she had somehow to find you think the americans will still try to go it alone norris will if he gets the chance predicted claudine i cant see that happening now said blake looking casually round the room i did a terrible tiling to him today she supposed her guilt contributed to her despondency it was justified in the circumstances its never justified for a doctor which i am to make an illness worse you think you did that very possibly but you cant be sure i think i did thats enough it will be if you get mary back said blake turning claudines words back upon her its supposed to be a combined effort she reminded him the sole was excellent but she was having difficulty eating perhaps she should have stayed at the hotel you were very impressive today blake congratulated her claudines spirits lifted slightly you were pretty impressive yourself largely repeating your theories id say the input was fiftyfifty you think there could be something from the people whove got her among all the stuff thats come in claudine shrugged if there is its going to be a hell of a job finding it i dont like the helplessness of having to wait for them to make a move theyre orchestrating the entire thing thats the whole point insisted claudine theyre getting their satisfaction from control making us follow their lead similar to norris marginally lets hope its the only way theyre getting their satisfaction said blake heavily i wish to god i could be more certain about that admitted claudine if she is still alive and theyve started abusing her shell break become subservient and totally confused by adults doing things to her she wont fully understand why its happening i mean shes been gone more than three days the man reminded her they might still not have touched her physically dont forget the usual way is to try to convince the child that sex with an adult is quite normal talk about it first and show them photographs and films of it happening to other children that sounds bad enough to me said blake im hoping for arrogance said claudine and thats how im connecting the daytime abduction with their first contact both are arrogant the daylight snatch on a crowded street even reckless thats in marys favour how long will it go on like that i wish i knew admitted claudine honestly just as i wish i could guess how much longer mary can hold on whether shes being sexually molested or not weve established that shes strongwilled that will have helped at first made it easier for her to convince herself she isnt frightened which she will be of course terrified gradually theres no way of predicting how gradually the terror will replace the resistance when that happens shell start wanting to ingratiate herself think that if she does what they want theyll treat her kindly let her go even making it easier to convince her about the sex claudine nodded abandoning the rest of her meal you havent eaten much im not hungry that all its been a long day im tired it doesnt show it would have done if she hadnt concentrated upon her makeup more than once rearranged her hair after showering and taken the time to choose between three dresses before coming out she was glad she had hed changed too she realized id like to believe it after the knife attack on the last case you were authorized to carry a weapon claudine was startled by the abrupt change of direction yes you carrying it now she was still bewildered no im embarrassed about it it was an overreaction where is it back in the hague in my safe not a lot of use there is it what about you after ireland yes are you carrying he smiled sheepishly i left it at the hotel which is not just stupid but a very good reason for me to be disciplined touche what the hell was this all about you enjoy europol now which way were they going theyd had this conversation surely i didnt want to stay in england after my husband died i wish there was more to do lots of opportunity to meet people if you want to meet people she agreed which i hear you dont from whom at least hed held off for the first few days she supposed she should have been irritated now but she wasnt oddly the tiredness was easing too just talk im not interested in onenight stands any sort of stand for that matter blake pushed his own plate aside is there anyone claudine realized surprised that she hadnt thought of hugo rosetti since the brussels case began theres a friend nothing serious why had she said that dismissing the situation with hugo she loved him and knew he loved her was prepared anxious even for the affair that his rigid selfimposed rules prevented his entering into so maybe the dismissal had been justified after all although not describing it as nothing serious bizarre was more accurate how long was she prepared to go on with it until flavia really died instead of remaining suspended in a living death the question was as repugnant as the actual prospect no matter what she felt for hugo she couldnt tell him that it would sound like an ultimatum which it would be she supposed the way to end it even she didnt want to end it unsatisfactory though it was nor did she want it to drift on indefinitely impasse what was the clinical word to describe someone supremely confident of their professional ability whose private life was an insoluble mess idiot came easily to mind i think ive overstepped the boundaries said blake perhaps you have are you offended no im still sorry embarrassed too claudine didnt think he was we should be getting back kurts got this number if anything comes up id still like to get back so you are offended tired claudine thought blake was going to protest at her paying her share of the bill shifting the colleaguetocolleague understanding but he didnt and she was glad on their way back across the square he kept even further away from her than hed previously done there were two telephone calls from rosetti logged at the reception desk anything personal she didnt feel like returning them tonight goodnight then goodnight he nodded towards the corridor bar holding her eyes i thought id have one last drink claudine answered the gaze ill see you in the morning she wasnt offended she decided as the opensided elevator took her upwards there wasnt any possibility of a personal situation developing between them but the suggestion she might have responded to one was flattering he was in fact a very attractive man you looked very grand on television autocratic like de gaulle francoise was totally naked examining herself in the full length mirror she did it most nights when she slept there which wasnt a lot it went beyond narcissism to become a permanent taunt directed at him sanglier had collected the europol masterfile on the mcbride disappearance on his way from the railway station he didnt bother to look up from it until he became aware of the woman close to his bed she turned with a models grace jutting out her left hip what do you think there was still some distorting soreness around the small tattoo of a yellow and blue bird high on her thigh what is it a love bird marias got one to match whos maria she makes films sometimes very special films i love her very much gauging his sudden interest she said but not enough to leave home it suits me to be married to you just as it suits you to be married to me we adorn each other once but not any more thought sanglier how and when was he going to tell her about returning to paris not yet shed probably be glad to be going back she hated the hague i was with claudine carter in brussels one of the few to get away pouted francoise in mock regret why did you bring us together another mistake conceded sanglier youd never think of involving me in a situation to get rid of me would you demanded francoise with a member of my own staff hardly dont even think about it she warned she would embarrass him one day sanglier knew and he did want to get rid of her so very desperately chapter ten the message said mary mary quite contrary is missing billy and at the first combined gathering of the day claudine stressed that she might have missed the identification without norriss complete background on the mcbride family initially she actually held back hoping the american himself would isolate what was so glaringly obvious from the ten other possibilities thrown up by kurt volkers fasttrack wordrecognition selection but norris didnt he didnt respond to her praise either the success anyway was more kurt volkers than hers hed filleted norriss background information of trigger words for his tracer program which had instantly flagged the only reference to marys pet in any of the incoming email it also activated a printout and timed the duration of the message precisely at sixty seconds confirming volkers earlier estimate before clearing what about a trace on the source demanded norris hiding any approval he might have felt which claudine didnt think was much volker shook his head theres still too much incoming slowing down any possible response all the key words in this case contrary mary and billy spelled with an ie as well as with a y just in case had to be matched by my comparison program its like trying to swim against a tide could you get a location if the traffic eases asked poncellet responding to jean smets obvious prompting yes said volker immediately and confidently poncellet went sideways to a fresh nudge from the ministry lawyer before asking in apparent disbelief in as little as sixty seconds i think so looking invitingly at norris claudine said theyve maintained contact come on she thought hopefully analyse it as you should be able to and show me i havent done as much harm as i think i have harding rampling and harrison were all looking expectantly at the fbi supervisor not properly complained norris there should have been a negotiating link established by now theyve been frightened off by the publicity dont you think we might still be in the power stage their showing us theyre calling the shots she suggested how could she hope to help this man treat this man when saving the child took precedence over everything they already know that but psychologically they need to prove it to themselves more than to us at the moment its the predictably established formula your formula said claudine by trying too hard to be kind she was coming close to exposing the mans mental limitation the longer it goes on the more dangerous it gets for mary insisted norris i agree said claudine at once todays message was important how demanded blake he was the only one in the room aware of how much reconciliation claudine was attempting with norris and he was professionally impatient with it having operated alone for so long in ireland blake was unused to working with or considering the feelings of oversensitive committees it was diplomatic bureaucracy and that wasnt the way to solve crime he was anxious to start an investigation he wasnt yet prepared to discuss with anyone not even claudine and he was personally unsettled by the previous evening he certainly wasnt prepared to discuss that with her either hed hoped perhaps stupidly that the days of having to carry the beretta in his beltline where it was chafing him now were past too it wasnt composed by the same person who wrote the first mary mary rhyme declared claudine grateful for the opportunity blake created the first approach was considered measured a lookatme arenticlever message todays wasnt it was hurried impatient or nervous but thats important the immediate significance of their knowing the name of marys pet is that theyve begun mentally to work on her to confuse her by how they treat her so that she wont know whats going to happen next whats right or wrong real or unreal theyre talking about her pet might even have told her the sort of message they were going to send and having started to build up a trust theyll break it interrupted norris thats the pattern agreed claudine pleased it hadnt all gone so what do we do asked the american chief of mission were pretty strong on psychological theory but i dont see anything practical coming from it like getting mary back we wait for the next message declared norris thatll take us forward theyll give us the link the next time claudine sighed sadly disappointed i dont think we should wait i think we need to bring them forward the ambassador publicly cried yesterday and is as embarrassed as hell about it disclosed harrison he shouldnt be insisted claudine he did a lot to help mary breaking down like that they reduced an ambassador of the united states of america the most powerful nation on earth to helpless tears the power their ability to do that makes mary very valuable to them protects her so what should we do persisted harrison i think the ambassador should meet the media again television particularly to enable marys abductors to see the effect her disappearance is having with mrs mcbride too im not sure either will be prepared to intruded harrison again claudine decided it wouldnt be difficult to become thoroughly pissed off by the overbearing opinionated diplomat restraining the temptation verbally to push the man back into his box she said why dont we explain the purpose which is to prove just how helpless we are and how much in command they are and give them the chance to make up their own minds if mrs mcbride cries even better mrs mcbride doesnt cry said harrison simply any emotion the mcbrides publicly display will help insisted claudine weve got to establish a twoway dialogue as quickly and as effectively as possible and the way to do that is for the ambassador to announce verbally in public that there has been another message she stopped not wanting any misunderstanding but not in any circumstances saying what mat message was not even that it arrived by email that goes way beyond keeping the computer route into the embassy as free as possible were inviting them conceding that they rule our world to take that one step forward and begin a dialogue from a position of weakness challenged norris at once momentarily claudine didnt reply looking away from all of them but focusing on nothing like so many doctors able to adjust the hippocratic oath shed favoured euthanasia long before helplessly watching the mother shed adored physically eroded by cancer just a few months earlier but incredibly she now realized shed never extended that image of physical erosion and that necessary release to include a mental illness at that moment she did strictly obeying her know thyself creed claudine fully recognized that her overweening professional confidence the central core around which her life revolved was what motivated her entire existence as horrifying and as humiliating and as agonizing as her mothers physical decline had been claudine decided that for her personally to lose her analytical psychological competence to lose her mind in fact as john norris appeared to have lost his equally justified the quick release of selfdestruction in her case perhaps more so than an irreversible physical condition at once there came an unsettling unanswerable question did she really feel so strongly about euthanasia because of her mothers death or did her conviction come from what she couldnt fulfil with hugo rosetti because of the permanent irreversible coma in which his wife existed claudine forced herself on refusing even to attempt an answer frightened of what it might be john she said gently thats exactly what it is a position of weakness we know it they know it theyve got a public forum in which they want everyone else to know it too we cant change that position until we get into a negotiating stance you wrote that in the text books lectured on it at quantico norris frowned seemingly unable to remember he didnt argue harding alongside frowned too towards rampling but it was an entirely different expression for entirely different reasons there was a long unfilled silence john prompted harrison it means exposing the ambassador the man tried to recover which is better than exposing his daughter said blake shortly and claudine wished he hadnt harrison said i could suggest it i understand the reasoning smet leaned sideways whispering to the commissioner at once the portly uniformencased man said we have some positive sightings of mary minutes before she disappeared walking or getting into a vehicle demanded blake both said poncellet walking first dictated blake eager to establish the sequence how many positive identifications poncellet hesitated at the intensity of the englishmans demands claudine withdrew giving way to a different expertise interested in watching blake operate poncellet consulted a folder already set out in front of him three absolutely no doubt it was mary a positive identification every time was she by herself or with someone by herself anyone close poncellet hesitated again i dont think so the question wasnt asked decided blake briskly ill need to go back to each witness myself today can we get them in here now we could try poncellet turned at once to the threeclerk secretariat that had arrived with him and smet one immediately left the office how was she behaving came in paul harding walking normally slow fast agitated calm claudine was alert for any reaction from norris to the local fbi mans intrusion and suspected that harding was too there was a faint smile on norriss face the expression of a master watching inexpert pupils attempting to prove themselves but nothing else youll have to ask them that said poncellet he was beginning to colour and his breathing was becoming difficult how close to the school was the first sighting persisted harding quite close i think any evidence of a car near her asked blake not that ive been told was she seen talking to anyone i havent any reports of her doing so how reliable are these witnesses demanded harding believable or questionable i think you should decide that yourselves i think we should said harding pointedly dismissive he looked without needing to ask the question to blake who nodded what about the car sightings said blake two of her getting into a vehicle what sort of vehicle a mercedes no doubt about that pressed harding poncellet shook his head both are mercedes drivers themselves registration asked harding no belgian or foreign designation ive no record of that model demanded the american i dont have the complete report colour said blake black according to one said poncellet relieved at last to be able to reply positively blue according to the other what about occupants said harding you really do need to speak to them yourselves poncellet finally capitulated we most certainly do said harding he needed to discover what the fuck was wrong with the fbi superstar sitting silently beside him too the iceman seemed to be frozen into unresponsive inactivity unaware of or uninterested in what was going on around him the questioning of witnesses was very much a police function but claudine included herself without seeking the approval of peter blake or anyone else just as she visited whenever possible the actual scene of a violent crime and the postmortem examination of its victim she didnt consider it an arrogant refusal to trust the ability of others which she knew to have been a london criticism before her transfer to europol unless she had reason to doubt their competence as she now definitely had with john norris claudine never intruded into the assigned roles of those with whom she worked what she didnt expect and most certainly didnt want was for those others to think they could do her job for her one missed question vital to her from someone not examining a situation from her perspective was the difference between success and failure professionally it was better to offend than to fail she made a particular point of announcing her intention to reinterview the eyewitnesses fully expecting norris to stay as well he didnt saying it was more important he return to the embassy with burt harrison to prepare the ambassador for the second press conference poncellet and smet did stay which she had not anticipated from the fleeting expressions she intercepted between them it seemed to surprise blake and harding too when claudine pointedly remarked it would intimidate witnesses to be confronted by so many people poncellet dismissed the clerks despite what she was sure were smets whispered objections the first person positively to identify mary walking away from the school was a yearold mother who took her fouryearold daughter along the rue du canal at the same time every day to feed whatever birds might be on the nearby waterway that day there hadnt been any she definitely recognized mary from the published photographs and correctly identified the colour blue trimmed with red of the backpack a detail that had intentionally been withheld from the media release because she was such a regular user of the road at such a regular time she was accustomed to seeing children collected from the school mostly by car and was mildly curious at a child walking away unaccompanied there was no one close or in conversation with mary whod been walking quite normally and not in any obvious hurry and had ignored her and the little girl when she passed the accounts of the two other pedestrians a bookkeeper the end of whose working day coincided with the school dismissal and a hotel waiter who always walked to his evening shift for the exercise tallied in every respect even to identifying the rucksack the bookkeeper thought mary was walking fast not as if she was trying to get away from someone but as if she was anxious to reach a destination all three were quite adamant that the child was showing no signs of distress or uncertainty the waiter in fact had been struck by the confidence with which mary had been walking as if it was a regular route she knew well it was that streetwise assurance that had attracted his attention it was his regular route to work and he couldnt remember seeing her before each of the three had been walking in the opposite direction to mary and had no reason to look round once she had passed so none had seen a car or the child being accosted the breakthrough came with the first car driver his name was johan rompuy and he was a technical translator in english and italian in the agricultural division of the european commission he was a yearold greyhaired greysuited bureaucrat who had worked in the governing body of the european union for eighteen years and thought and talked with the pedantry of a man whose life was governed by detail order and regularity that was why he remembered the incident with mary so well hed been summoned late to a commission meeting of agricultural ministers and was in a hurry although obeying the speed limit which he always did hed been following on the inside lane directly behind the black mercedes when it had suddenly stopped making him halt just as sharply the volume of traffic in the outer lane prevented his pulling out to overtake hed seen everything because it had happened directly in front of him claudine had positioned herself to the side of the room giving the encounters over to blake and harding and had the impression of two tensed cats undecided which was to be the first to jump on an unsuspecting mouse even the timid greyfeatured civil servant fitted the cat and mouse analogy the local fbi man gave the slightest body movement conceding to the englishman for the briefest of moments blake hesitated preparing himself youre very important to us and to this investigation he began and claudine at once acknowledged the basic psychology of the approach rompuy smiled a man rarely praised or flattered by superiors im glad to be of help and i want you to be as helpful as possible there are a great many questions we want answering youre going to have to be very patient what might not seem important to you could be of very great importance to us the smile remained i understand youre sure the car was black yes what model asked harding a i think was the registration belgian or foreign said blake i didnt make a note of it obviously but im sure it was belgian if it hadnt been i might have looked more closely and im sure the country designation was belgium too again i would have looked more closely if it had been foreign my job is identifying different nationalities was it a brussels registration pressed harding taking up the questioning i dont know was there anything unusual about the car a badge or a sign in the rear window coaxed the american anything inside that you could see about the car i mean well get to the passengers in a minute like a sticker or a religious medallion or a permanent parking authority or even the sort of decoration people sometimes hang in their vehicles the man made a visible effort to remember i dont think so was there a radio aerial asked blake yes positioned where at the rear was it raised for the radio to be playing or retracted retracted what about a telephone aerial yes said the man at once in the middle of the rear window at the top by the roof a straight aerial or a spiral one persisted the american and claudine was aware of the quick approving look from blake poncellet and smet were sitting motionless an audience to a special performance of experts straight i think said rompuy doubtfully now lets talk about the people inside encouraged blake how many were there two a man and a woman there was a stir from the two belgians which claudine at once regretted because rompuy looked at them and said there were im sure there were we believe you said harding quickly how were they sitting the man was in the front the woman in the back so you could see the woman better yes claudine hadnt moved not wanting to risk distracting the man again but there were questions she needed to ask but the detectives had to finish first whereabouts in the back seat was she to the right or to the left or in the middle more to the left to give the child room to get in was she like that when the car stopped or did she move over i dont remember her moving over i think she was there when the car stopped how did the rear door open then for mary to get in rompuy frowned im not sure i think the man turned and opened it but i cant really remember lets go back to the woman said blake wanting to maintain a sequence what colour hair did she have blond light yellowy blond or dark blond dark you could see her shoulders part of her back yes the man frowned how much show us on your own body said the american selfconsciously rompuy stretched over his shoulder with difficulty pushing his hand down roughly to the bottom of his shoulder blade so you could see what she was wearing rompuys frown remained it was a jacket i think fawn or maybe a light brown can you describe it demanded blake it was just a jacket what was the cloth like rough smooth could it have been suede leather it was cloth of some sort smooth i think the questions were building up in claudines mind but still she held back momentarily blake turned his eyes to her and she gave an almost imperceptible nod to show that she wanted to take up when they were satisfied what about the style of her hair said harding did she wear it loose or tied it wasnt tied exactly said the man awkwardly but it was tight against her head one side sort of folded over the other blake looked hopefully at claudine who in turn looked round the room and then picked up some paper and quickly sketched like that claudine asked yes agreed rompuy at once pleased at making himself understood its a pleat said claudine thats it isnt it her hair was pinned into a pleat so that it made a line down the back of her head exactly said the man smiling again both men moved to speak at the same time and again harding deferred to the english detective blake said youre doing very well youre telling us a great deal we need to know now you saw the back of the womans head looking from your car into hers but theyd stopped for mary hadnt they as i now know yes did mary get in immediately no what happened they talked how long for the man shrugged i dont know a few moments fine said blake theyd stopped and the rear door had opened for mary to get in but she didnt not at once who was she talking to the man or the woman the woman so the woman must have looked towards mary oh yes said the man as if he was again surprised at the question that was when she kind of leaned across neither man showed any impatience at not having already been told that the tension was palpable to claudine blake said if she was looking towards mary leaning across the car you must have seen her in profile i did there was a brief hesitation from both detectives the noise of smet moving in his chair sounded loud blake said was she fullfaced or thin in the face thin i think that was the impression i got tanned or lightskinned definitely tanned a lot of makeup or not very much i dont remember there being a lot of makeup youre looking at her in profile said blake was her nose large or small straight or crooked describe it to us in your own words straight said the man trying hard and sharp thats how i remember her as a sharpfeatured woman at blakes pause harding took up the questioning you could see part of her front now what was she wearing under the jacket a blouse or a sweater i dont remember seeing anything under the jacket you say she was thinfaced what about that much of her body that you could see was she bigbusted or small the man looked embarrassedly towards claudine i dont think she was very big claudine smiled at the man and said dont feel awkward theres no reason to be all this is vital to us so try to help as much as you can quite smallbusted not noticeable at all really was she wearing earrings asked blake returning to the questioning yes hoops i think there were jewels in them what colour clear like diamonds what about her ears large small close to her head quite small and close to her head the man sat back in his chair and said could i have something to drink of course said blake looking to the police commissioner poncellet quickly gestured to smet the lawyer hesitated actually turning to where the clerks had sat before realizing they werent there any more he hurried irritably out of the room a man demeaned by a chore that was beneath his dignity rompuy said i hope everything is all right youre doing remarkably well replied blake i wish every witness could be as helpful i want to help said the translator she must be suffering a lot thats why we want to get her back as quickly as we can said harding will you get her back the media might discover the man claudine thought as smet came back into the room carrying a carafe and glasses she said im quite sure we will what youre telling us adds a lot to what we already know the man drank the water gratefully smet leaned close to the police commissioner who shook his head to whatever the lawyer said can you go on now harding asked the translator of course youve given us a very good description of the woman said harding what about the man i couldnt see him so well in the front did he turn at all for you to see him in profile asked blake theyd started to hurry overlooking questions that should have been asked decided claudine the interview had been going on for over an hour so it was understandable but she had a vague feeling of disappointment in peter blake it was fortunate shed held back to allow the two men to finish i dont remember him turning although i suppose he must have done if he opened the rear door was he wearing a jacket asked blake yes black like a chauffeur i suppose so my impression was that he stayed looking to the front as a chauffeur would have done could you see more of his back than you could of the womans yes and i remember he kept his seat belt buckled what about his hair asked harding black long short short and he was going bald at the top rompuy frowned putting his hand vaguely to the back of his head here like the way monks have their hair at the crown of his head said blake a tonsure thats it said the translator he poured himself more water what about his ears were they flat against his head like most peoples or did they stick out i dont remember anything about his ears could you see his hands sitting as he was was he holding the wheel asked harding i think so could you see if he was wearing a ring i couldnt see did he turn the engine off or keep it running asked blake he kept it running and the brake lights were on all the time so i suppose he was sitting with his foot on the brake what about indicators said harding was there any signal that the car was going to turn in to the side and stop before it did so no thats how i got stuck behind it was too quick for me to get round him didnt that inconvenience you asked blake it delayed me a few minutes and i was in a hurry did you sound your horn no did the car move off immediately mary got into it take your time take your time claudine thought yes said the man fast asked harding there was too much traffic to drive really fast was it as fast as the traffic would allow insisted blake as if he was anxious to get away i suppose it was as fast as he could go i wasnt really ready and in the gap that opened up someone else overtook and got in front of me with another car in the way were you able to see what was going on inside the car after mary got in said harding not really which way did it go i dont know said the man lamely we were moving again and i was late im sorry youve done remarkably well blake said looking first to harding who nodded to show hed finished and then invitingly to claudine monsieur rompuy she said at once i have some different sorts of questions which might seem odd but bear with me the woman was looking sideways across the car with mary still on the pavement and then she leaned across the car to encourage mary in yes that would have tilted her off balance unless she supported herself how did she do that was she resting against the seat or was her arm visible along the seat back where it joins the rear shelf along the back of the seat all the time throughout the entire time the door was open for mary to get in you could clearly see the womans arm along the back of the seat yes claudine saw blake and harding exchange glances aware of their oversight was she wearing a bracelet three gold bands that seemed joined together i got the impression they matched the earrings what about rings on her fingers i didnt see any what about her arm did she just let it lie there casually supporting herself or did she gesture for the child to get in she kept it along the back of the seat what about her free hand did you see any movement with that not until she reached forward to take the girls backpack the girl took that off before getting into the car claudine resisted the temptation to take the direction the answer offered you were stuck behind their car were there any other vehicles held up behind you one it was the car that cut in front of me when we started moving again thats our next positive witness intruded poncellet imagining he was helping claudine ignored the interruption wishing the belgian commissioner hadnt broken the flow had that car sounded its horn several times it made the child look which put her fully facing me thats why i was able to recognize her from the newspaper and television pictures knowing that they were causing a traffic jam irritating other drivers the woman still sat casually with her arm along the seat yes and the driver didnt react either not that i saw tell me about mary did you see her walking along the pavement before the car stopped i wasnt conscious of her until the car stopped was she carrying her backpack then or wearing it definitely wearing it i remember her slipping out of the straps to take it off she did it herself quite willingly yes then she handed it into the back of the car to the woman she wouldnt have been able to have sat comfortably if she hadnt i understand said claudine because she turned towards the car behind you could see marys face very clearly what was marys expression was she frightened upset frowning laughing crying rompuy shook his head uncomfortably she wasnt laughing or crying its difficult but i thought she looked annoyed at the driver behind you im not sure at whom what about being frightened that wasnt my impression she got quite willingly into the car yes as if she expected it she simply handed her backpack through the open door and followed it into the car when mary did that the woman still had her arm along the back of the seat yes i know the car behind you overtook blocking your view but that didnt happen immediately in those first few seconds mary was sitting in the seat along the back of which the woman had her arm outstretched yes could you see mary just the top of her head what about the woman did she bring her arm down to put it round mary i dont think so in those last few seconds when you could still see the woman and mary how were they sitting quite ordinarily side by side claudine stopped satisfied at the improvement to her profile she said youve given us a great deal of your time and a great deal of help for the moment were almost through having seen the woman as you did how old would you think she was the two detectives exchanged looks again at another oversight im not very good at guessing ages give it your best try fortyish early forties one final question could you work with a police artist to create a sketch of the woman you saw lure mary into the car i could try agreed the man claudine thought uncritically that by the end of johan rompuys interview which had begun so well blake and harding had no longer been able to think with total objectivity which in both their circumstances was totally understandable for a long time she didnt know how long peter blake had not been an investigator needing to pick and prise the information from others he had in fact been the infiltrated eyewitness assembling the evidence and facts for others to accept and assimilate the giver not the hopeful taker and an embassy posting like paul hardings was again different in a foreign country it was scarcely operational at best it was a liaison function with incountry law enforcement with as much unadmitted but tacitly acknowledged intelligencegathering as possible it was too much to expect an instant adjustment from a man literally thrust back into the field as harding had been it was the most basic of all psychological mistakes even from professionals to imagine that because a person had been an eyewitness had been there watching everything seeing everything they would possess the unprompted gift of total recall no one did a hundred people standing side by side would give a hundred different accounts of something happening literally in front of them depending upon their age attitudes feelings and personalities it wasnt human nature it wasnt humanly possible for two people to see the same thing the same way the commonest failing was investing a situation with a logical progression there was no such thing as a logic to human interaction there was even a recognized psychological term the phenomenon of closure nothing was logical nothing should have happened in the way it appeared to have happened in the disappearance of mary beth mcbride so it couldnt be investigated logically the questioning by the two detectives had been copybook a building block attempt to perform their function and johan rompuy had been a deceptive oneinamillion witness because he had been so good so observant hed lulled them into carelessness it was incredible after learning so much that neither had suggested rompuy work with a police artist to create a visual impression of the woman obvious by not being obvious both men looked sheepishly at her as the second motorist came into the room and harding said do you want to join in as we go along lets stay as we are said claudine hoping they did not infer disapproval rene lunckner was an air traffic controller at zaventem airport and like rompuy had been late for his afternoon shift he hadnt known at first why the cars in front had suddenly stopped and only just managed to avoid colliding with rompuys vehicle he thought hed sounded his horn three or four times before slightly reversing to swing round the car in front of him it was then hed seen mary beth mcbride seeming to look directly at him the driver of the mercedes had his window down and was gesturing for him to pass but oncoming traffic was too heavy for him to pull out as far as he needed for a few moments he had in fact caused greater traffic congestion than already existed the driver had signalled with his hand and his indicator that he was pulling away from the kerb lunckner was adamant the car into which mary got was dark blue top of the range definitely larger than a and that it had a brussels registration i couldnt believe someone who knew the city would stop like that and block the traffic stuck out in the road as you were could you see the driver demanded harding not very well he was going bald and he wore spectacles i think they had heavy black frames and he had a beaked nose thats the best i can do a thin man or fat quite heavily built did you see enough of him to help a police artist create a picture asked blake avoiding their earlier oversight the man shook his head i really dont think so i dont want to mislead wed really like you to try urged blake well keep your reservations in mind all right how old would you say the man was said harding also avoiding the earlier omission again i dont want to mislead late forties early fifties i cant get any closer than that what about the woman asked blake i hardly saw her at all i was looking at the front of their car trying to judge the distance to get by but you didnt get by reminded harding you had to pull in behind blond hair very tightly pinned at the back i didnt see her face at all i wasnt really interested it was a mother picking up her daughter as far as i was concerned all i wanted to do was get by and get to work is that the impression you had asked claudine quickly not wanting to miss the moment that it was a mother picking up her child i drive along the road all the time i know the schools there and im used to seeing the kids picked up that usually causes jams too i try to beat them by coming along earlier but that day i didnt make it was there anything other than your knowing there was a school that made you think it was mother and daughter anything unusual about the way the child was behaving lunckner shook his head she was scowling as if she was annoyed annoyed persisted claudine not frightened annoyed insisted the man i thought it was because her mother was late and had made her walk or that she was being told off when you were driving behind them did you see the woman drop her arm to put it round the child which would have been a natural thing to do if shed been late and her daughter was upset it wouldnt have been comfortable the man pointed out she was too small against the woman in the back seat if shed put her arm down it would have been round the childs neck not round her shoulders or her back and the woman definitely didnt do that reach down to hold mary not that i saw while they were in your view did you get any impression that mary didnt want to be there any indication of their arguing or mary fighting trying to get out not at all how long were they in your view only a few minutes at the rue de laeken they turned left and i turned right this is very important warned claudine you could see marys head above the top of the seat just the whole of her head down to her neck or just the top her hair not much more than her hair how far up the womans arm was the top of marys head the man put the flat of his hand virtually at his shoulder about there poncellet summoned an aide to take lunckner to a police artist waiting for the man to leave the room before saying i think that was very good he spoke as if he were personally responsible for the success i agree said claudine weve got a lot to work from i think so too said harding rompuy particularly i prefer his recall to the other guys rompuys drawing will be important but will it really take us that much further forward asked jean smet coming into the discussion for the first time very much predicted claudine im getting to know who it is im up against well asked norris impatiently he was leaning forward intently over paul hardings desk in the embassys fbi office nothing much so far apologized duncan mcculloch uncomfortably a towering rawboned man he was a texas descendant of a scottish immigrant whose given name he disdained in favour of duke quite a lot of newspaper cuttings about her involvement in some serial killings a few months back chinese gangs terrorizing illegal immigrants into prostitution and drugs there was a failed hit on her it was at a railway station a knife attack she caught it in the arm but the chinese went under a train what about personal stuff insisted norris that was where hed find the lead to her association with the kidnappers robert ritchie said shes described as a widow in some of the cuttings apparently she was britains lead profiler before she transferred here anything between her and blake it doesnt look like it said mcculloch you lying down on this demanded norris abruptly accusing for christs sake john weve only just started protested ritchie i dont like being sworn at and i dont like being told theres nothing dirty when i know there is what is it demanded mcculloch if youve got a lead give it to us to follow im talking instinct ive given you the job of finding it you fixed a wire yes said mcculloch nothing we got her personal europol file each man waited for the other to respond finally ritchie said we havent got any assets inside europol which would be our only chance getting hold of a personal europol file cold from outside would be as impossible as getting any of our stuff out of pennsylvania avenue which you know as well as i do cant be done norris patted the table at which he sat you think paul might have a contact inside mcculloch shrugged ive no idea but i thought this was a sealed operation it was said norris now maybe you guys need help mcculloch managed to restrain himself until they reached the rue guimard and the bar to which harding had introduced the fbis washington contingent jesus h christ exploded the texan where the fuck does the asshole think hes coming from ritchie a laidback survivor of californias flower power era was as angry but better controlled i dont think the sonofabitch knows where hes coming from you ever hear of james angleton the cias master spycatcher remembered mcculloch internal counterintelligence only he never caught a single fucking traitor in the agency although they were there broke every law there ever was and ended up a paranoid basket case i think weve got ourselves the son of angleton the story is that angleton destroyed as many people as stalin if it just crossed his mind that they werent on his side and norris has just started to have doubts about us declared ritchie chapter eleven it would probably have occurred to each of them at some stage but it was peter blake who suggested it first so the credit went to him and in claudines opinion more than made up for any earlier oversight it was admittedly prompted by the appearance of kurt volker in the main operational room just as johan rompuy and rene lunckner reentered with the police artist but it was still blakes idea most encouragingly of all paul harding at once acknowledged it as such theyd had to promise poncellet and the justice ministry lawyer a full profile and copies of the artists drawings by the end of the day before either of them accepted that claudine and the detectives needed to work through the information and even then the reluctant jean smet had tried to argue his right to remain videofit declared blake it was volker who responded spurred by the word of what the man and the woman who snatched mary announced blake he smiled sure of his proposal and pleased with it quickly almost too staccato he recounted the physical description given by the two motorists and offered the sketches volker said casually easiest computer graphic in the world i can draw the faces as they appeared to both witnesses and then enhance them threedimensionally itll be counterproductive if either of them has any obvious facial disfigurement but gambling that they dont i can make a right and a left profile and a full frontal he smiled we established our own web site with the serial killing we can post the images on our own home page and then advertise through the main providers include a digitalized picture of mary too he hesitated nodding back to his communications setup itll start a fresh avalanche the first ones dwindled incidentally down to a trickle do we want to start it up again wondered harding both our witnesses think its a belgian car brussels maybe heres where the concentration needs to be not worldwide claudine wished the belgian motorists werent hearing a conversation they might later repeat there wont be any facial disfigurement mary wouldnt have got so readily into the car if there had been and we need to emphasize it worldwide itll feed their power need but at the same time it will be the beginning of the pressure i want to impose to volker she said the graphics could be shown on television couldnt they of course in colour and actually moving from profile to full face thats how well guarantee the saturation here in brussels according priority to the computer graphics claudine and the two detectives concentrated upon the physical descriptions of the man and woman to accompany volkers drawing which the german began from the artists impressions and built up from the prompting of the two motorists blocked by the kidnap mercedes volker had already created the threedimensional portrait of the woman by the time claudine delivered her suggested statistics with the undertaking for more specifically the estimated height of both it was blake again who suggested a way of calculating that from the known seat height of mercedes up to and including the range and the rough approximation of where marys head came against the womans shoulder from marys known height were learning what they look like said blake you getting to know whats in their minds claudine nodded theres no doubt that it began as a classic paedophile snatch with a woman to allay the childs fear the womans the key possibly the ringleader and shes recklessly arrogant sitting casually not hurrying even when theyd caused a traffic block the man was anxious hurrying people by and even using his indicators when he pulled away trying to minimize the inconvenience hed caused by stopping as suddenly as he had at what id guess to be the womans command when she saw mary walking by herself the womans very quick mentally marys scowling was at having an adventure spoiled she was expecting a car and must have said something the woman was able to pick up on she got mary into the car and was able at first at least to control her verbally the most obvious way would have been by pretending to be the backup car taking her where she expected to go physically to have touched mary would have frightened her so shes a practised child abuser shes probably taken kids this way before so weve got to go carefully through those previous case histories poncellet is assembling there is money the jewellery description sounds like a cartier set i know because ive got the same its called constellation so she likes expensive jewellery that coupled with the reckless arrogance tells me shes vain overly sure of herself the way she dresses her hair supports that everything in place controlled when kurt and rompuy are happy with the computer compilation we should blanket hairdressing and beauty salons with it she paused searching for anything she needed to add and ive very little doubt that it was the woman who created the mary mary quite contrary message arrogance again if it was her it confirms her as the person in charge a woman paedophile targeting a girl queried blake frowning its an unusual pattern but not totally unknown said claudine the publicity will be intense when the computer pictures are released suggested harding wont the physical risk to mary increase quite apart from the sexual danger if they think were getting too close yes agreed claudine flatly but its something we cant avoid would there be an element of protection in the fact that a woman is involved wondered blake claudine shook her head positively even more flatly she said the majority of case histories of women sex perverts show them more physically cruel and deviant than men thanks for picking up on the things we missed said harding claudine saw the opening at once she hadnt expected it to be so easy its a combined effort now not a contest any more isnt it it certainly is as far as i am concerned said the american guardedly and i think todays gone pretty damned well with an aggression that surprised claudine blake said you sure about that paul i dont think i understand that question protested the american i thought wed ironed out the working relationship said blake so did i it would be unfortunate if it got fouled up again claudine had imagined she would have to lead this discussion and frowned curiously at her partner blake refused to meet the look it wont on my part assured harding it didnt make sense john walking out as he did said claudine it had to be confronted not allowed to drift into innuendo and misunderstanding i know reinterviewing the eyewitnesses was primarily an investigative procedure but id have expected someone as obsessional as john to insist on remaining i know said the american i was as surprised as you claudine didnt think she could go as far as openly suggesting norris was suffering a mental problem so what are we going to do about it hes got a lot of respect back in washington said harding what the hell was he doing talking disloyally of a colleague but norris was behaving like a horses ass harding was more discomfited by the mans behaviour today than he had been when he received the initial iceman cable alerting him to norriss arrival i thought mcbride had clout too said blake i dont have any reason or the authority to question john if i tried my feet wouldnt touch the ground until i got to washington probably in protective custody which would seem to sum up the problem said claudine any move is going to have to come from your side harding insisted it would help if we knew when and where to make it said blake harding shook his head despairingly i cant work against my own task force commander dont work against us either said blake i wont repeated the american shit he thought what a total fuckup blake was about to speak when the telephone sounded harding grabbed it eager for the respite it was a very brief conversation to claudine he said it was harrison at the embassy the ambassador has asked to see you claudine went alone to the boulevard du regent leaving the two detectives watching volker creating a startlingly lifelike portrait of a narrowfaced suntanned blond that both rompuy and to a lesser extent lunckner insisted was an amazing recreation of the woman in the back of the mercedes it would volker assured them be ready by the evening james mcbride was more composed than claudine had previously seen him so was hillary norris was facing them across the desk legs outstretched in easy relaxation the chief of mission remained standing the ambassador started harrison but mcbride broke in at once can talk for himself im not sure this second television appearance is a good idea john doesnt think so either norris smiled and nodded he looked beyond claudine clearly searching for harding the smile disappeared claudine realized at once that the ambassador respected her opinion so shed impressed the man at their earlier encounter she didnt think it would be difficult to do it again inexplicably leaving as he had meant norris was totally ignorant of what theyd achieved with the eyewitnesses it wasnt going to help the mans mental condition but claudine wasnt sure anything short of hospitalization would she repeated her conviction that the abductors had to be drawn into contact upon europols initiative the first unwitting erosion of their control and that it should be achieved in the shortest possible time its the fourth day now mary mustnt be allowed to think no one is trying to help her and start trusting those who are holding her throughout norris sat complacently shaking his head in dismissal to every point mcbride provided the opportunity for which claudine was waiting wont it simply be a repetition of the appeal ive already made that would be sufficient by itself said claudine easily but weve got digitalized pictures of the man and woman who took mary you know who they are hillary interrupted we think weve got a fairly accurate picture of what they look like qualified claudine theyll be ready by late afternoon early evening and their impact will be that much more if you appear reiterating your appeal directly to them why didnt you tell me this john mcbride demanded norris was sitting primly upright now his face fixed knowing claudine carter was lying she wouldnt allow anything like an accurate picture of her accomplices to appear publicly i was waiting to hear from paul he said inadequately theres a danger of getting a lot of bad leads if the pictures arent good the witnesses are happy with them claudine assured him to the ambassador she added i dont want to expose you or your wife to any more distress than youve already suffered but i really want these pictures to achieve the maximum impact your appearance would ensure that i made a fool of myself last time blurted mcbride not for the first time said hillary you couldnt have done better if youd been rehearsed insisted claudine pleased to contradict the other woman you sure about that asked mcbride doubtfully norris was shaking his head vigorously weve got to make the biggest possible impact to get them to come to us repeated claudine dont stage a press conference as such make it a television appeal limited to yourselves and an interview she hesitated remembering the need for diplomatic correctness include poncellet to talk about the importance of the computer graphics to the investigation well do it decided hillary mcbride nodded in agreement im to appeal plead broke in norris contemptuously yes said claudine eagerly again thats what youve got to do plead do whatever it takes to bring them to us mcbride was silent for several moments before saying will you prep us willingly said claudine relieved well rehearse it word for word turning to harrison mcbride said fix it through public affairs and involve poncellet norris stayed listening disparagingly to claudines advice but offering none himself he realized the woman was extremely clever his mistake had been in underestimating her it was possible hed have to take some very direct action detain her and interrogate her make her talk norris was waiting in paul hardings chair at paul hardings desk when the local fbi man arrived back at the embassy he didnt make any effort to move you should have called me about the computer graphics the woman wrongfooted me i was still working protested harding you got printouts of the pictures harding offered them across the desk im not impressed norris said dismissively could be anyone the two motorists who saw them are happy i think its all very clever said norris solemnly their german computer guy is a genius agreed harding misunderstanding norris frowned what do you know about her hardings misunderstanding remained he looked at the digitalized image on the table between them and said we dont have a name john dr carter harding couldnt speak for several moments at last he managed youre losing me here ive got a bad feeling about her i want her thoroughly checked out ive assigned ritchie and mcculloch but theyre drawing blanks i want you to do better on the scale of bad feelings paul hardings score was eleven where the graph stopped at ten what the fuck was he going to do remembering he said we checked the school again the principal had an odd phone call from a woman wanting to know the curriculum languages the phone number she left was wrong im interested in the carter woman said norris dismissive still concentrate on her kurt volker was waiting impatiently for claudine when she reentered their offices at the belgian police hq i think theres something significant he announced its time to declare yourself said lucien bigot hed made the first approach all those months ago i know that agreed sanglier so whats it going to be demanded the politician id like a final meeting he had to have the commitment even if only verbally wed like that too for positive undertakings said sanglier thats what we all want said the other man chapter twelve felicite recognized that she was right as she usually was there was a sexual excitement about danger it was perhaps why she so much enjoyed cruising the streets hunting the pleasure had gone on now for more than half an hour ever since jean smet had burst into the anspach house babbling about pictures of her and henri cool to be shown on television youll be recognized identified the man was unable to keep still striding about the room as he had at the beach house his mind butterflying from anxiety to anxiety his words jumbled hed tried to smoke too but felicite had forbidden it she detested the smell of stale tobacco in her home sit down she ordered sharply how can they know about me two motorists saw you pick her up smet remained standing shifting from foot to foot it was the first comprehensible sentence the man had uttered and felicite felt another spurt of excitement she rose and put both hands against smets shoulders to press him into a chair on her way to the drinks tray where she poured brandy for both of them as she handed his glass to him she said from the beginning everything that was said how it was said smet made a slurping sound with his first drink and the cognac caught his breath making him cough he tugged a tightly folded wad of paper from inside his jacket and said read it yourself thats a copy of todays report to the minister felicite took her time sipping her drink as she read acknowledging that this investigation appeared much more thorough than the previous one which was why it was that much more satisfying when she finished the account she remained looking down at it turning several sheets over before looking up so wheres the computer graphic i only heard there was going to be one in a telephone call from poncellet on his way to the television studio were not getting a copy until tomorrow in time for our cooperation meeting and thats the problem im trying to make you understand i dont know everything theyre doing not all the time and not quickly enough there was still ten minutes to go before the special newscast felicite saw she waved the report you read this of course ive read it i wrote most of it and its you isnt it its a very general description of a woman who is older than me and wears indeterminate blond hair in a chignon felicite ran her fingers exaggeratedly through the lightly waved hair that fell almost to her shoulders which i never do except when im choosing someone new precisely because it will be confusing if im seen my hair is more golden than blond the estimate of how tall i am makes me almost into a giant cool too its ridiculous they havent even got the car right its dark green not blue or black and its a she cupped her breast with her free hand and im not at all flatchested ive got nice tits you like them dont you smet shook his head although not in answer to her question this isnt anything to joke about nor is it anything to wet yourself about she had imagined far more from the mans garbled rambling and her excitement was going you told the others i wanted to speak to you first too frightened to do anything by himself felicite thought or even to be trusted there could never be any question of smet going to the authorities he was too deeply involved as legally culpable as the rest of them which he well knew but the risk not a danger by which she was sexually aroused was in his making a stupid mistake unlikely she reassured herself not that he wouldnt make a mistake as nervous as he was felicite didnt doubt hed do something wrong but that it would in any way direct attention towards them but smet was still a weak link useful only because of the position he occupied not just weak boring too boring like them all as marcel had complained just before he died maybe she should abandon them after this thered be nothing they could do about it and she had other connections through lascelles and lebron moving on finding new people was definitely something to think about its time announced smet anxiously it wasnt but felicite turned the television on anyway and was glad because the introduction had already begun with a clip from the earlier conference at which the ambassador had openly wept the main newscast anchorman talked over the old footage announcing a different format tonight was not going to be a media event it was to be a personal appeal by mcbride and his wife following important new evidence that the brussels police commissioner would disclose on that cue the previous conference faded to be replaced by a screenfilling photograph of mary beth mcbride which held for at least thirty seconds before cutting to the studio mcbride and his wife were seated at an oval table with andre poncellet to their right the three were facing the anchor an eagerly talking darkhaired man who spoke in sound bites to his prompting poncellet described the eyewitness information as dramatic sensational vital a breakthrough only just stopping short of predicting an early arrest the camera focused tight on the ambassadors face for the mans appeal there were no tears but mcbride was gravefaced hillary visibly strained beside him they held hands although listlessly mcbrides plea was for private and immediate contact with marys captors come on come on said felicite impatiently where am i smet broke away from the screen frowning curiously at the woman we want to negotiate mcbride was insisting keeping strictly to claudines instructions even using the words shed suggested but thats not possible on the internet find another way tell us and well follow it well obey every instruction please let us know that mary beth is unharmed the camera pulled back again to include the anchorman who used a renewed selection of sound bites to reintroduce poncellet and the digitalized computer images of felicite galan and henri cool felicite stretched towards the screen feeling the sensation return it was a reasonable impression she conceded but not good enough for a positive identification shed been made too thinfaced and her nose was too pronounced and elongated as if it dominated her face which in reality it didnt and the graphic showed her hair pinned right to left which was opposite to the way she wore it henri cool was made to look much too heavy and again the nose was too pronounced on the right hand side of each graphic the physical description was printed making them both much too tall pedantically poncellet recited every statistic its you whispered smet breathily its definitely you and henri no its not snapped the woman brusquely theres a resemblance nothing more certainly insufficient to bring anyone knocking on my door henris either youre recognizing us because you know its us thats altogether different and the printed description is too vague as well abruptly she felt deflated disappointed trying to bring back the feeling she said see the power weve got how were making them beg and plead what are we going to do now you mean what am i going to do now yes mumbled the lawyer you im in no hurry said felicite i like a worldwide stage well change our approach when i feel like it not because james mcbride wants us to lets get it over with the man implored felicite ignored him you can write the next message she decided make it better than michels another rhyme maybe im doing too much as it is smet argued let someone else do it i want you to do it insisted felicite ending the protest she paused it was a pity there wasnt time to get to antwerp and watch the broadcast with mary let her see how desperately dependent her big important papa is upon us the telephone jarred into the room interrupting her smet his nerves stretched noticeably jumped felicite said itll be one of the others shitting himself like you the expectant smile with which she answered the telephone faded almost at once it was a very short conversation with felicite constantly interrupting as she replaced the receiver she said vehemently damn charles mehre what is it demanded smet in fresh alarm hes killed said felicite shortly a television had been installed in the largest of their allocated rooms and they watched mcbrides appeal in silence when the programme finished claudine said i wish id had time to brief poncellet he exaggerated far too much but mcbride was better than i expected caught exactly the right note even hillary saying nothing but looking like she did fitted what i wanted a couple totally at the mercy of those whove got their child they even held hands as i asked them which they didnt want to do can you imagine what its like said volker sympathetically maybe its not enough to reassure them i might be interpreting it wrongly but i think marys still alive announced blake quietly claudine and volker looked at him waiting i thought id check the school again see if anyone had remembered anything after all the publicity said blake it probably wouldnt have meant anything to madame flahaur if it hadnt been the only call like it shes had since mary disappeared a woman telephoned two days ago asking about the curriculum particularly about the languages that are taught thats all she appeared interested in according to madame flahaur the prospectus she sent out was returned this morning the address doesnt exist neither does the phone number the woman left i checked both with belgacom on my way back what language did the woman speak demanded claudine immediately understanding french mary learning it blake nodded she started it late behind all the other pupils its her second semester comprehension below average for her age because of the late start its got the arrogance of our blond in the mercedes judged claudine slowly arrogance coupled with clever caution if youre right and i think you might well be we now know whoever have mary are frenchspeaking but dont want mary to understand what theyre saying in front of her volker nodded also understanding now it could be a crank call a lot of the email stuff so far has been particularly after the press conference identification its feasible agreed claudine i dont think its sufficient to reassure the parents that marys still alive and risk their agony if were wrong but i think its something we can add to the profile as a possibility it was two day ago reminded blake she could be dead by now if they were going to kill her that quickly they wouldnt have bothered to call the school in the first place said claudine it could also indicate they havent touched her sexually either john norris was mortified by mcbrides television appeal practically unable to believe an ambassador of his great and wonderful country could have been reduced to begging like a bum on a street corner by the manipulation of just one woman hed even used some of the words and expressions that shed suggested theyd have laughed at that all of them known just how successful they were being infiltrating the very investigation the way they had fooled everyone except him but he was getting his own profile together it was still very disjointed a lot of threads hanging loose and needing to be tied together but the unanswered discrepancies were there like hed known they would be he still couldnt find the fit for the carter woman just knew that she was part of it because that was his job to see things other investigators didnt see and point the way for them to go which he would when the other indicators slid into place it wouldnt take long hed already sent a priority demand for the full details upon which a grand jury arms embargo indictment had been issued against italian arms dealer luigi della sialvo in whose name two end user certificates had been issued for multimilliondollar purchases from mcbrides corporation before the man came on to the political scene and another whats happening chaseup on all the possible disgruntled employees whod been dismissed by mrs mcbride norris was becoming suspicious of hardings working relationship with the english detective by not alerting him about the eyewitnesses to the kidnap ahead of the ambassadors preparation for that humiliating tv appeal harding had exposed him to ridicule the man couldnt be trusted neither could mcculloch or ritchie if anything was going to be done properly hed have to do it himself and as quickly as possible god knows what that poor child was going through and there was only him to save her harding had his usual table at the rue guimard bar and got the drinks in as the incountry host there was a lot of noise from other tables where other agents were determinedly enjoying the unexpected pleasure of an overseas assignment but hardings table was quiet he said you want to know the truth the truth is im scared shitless i knew it was going to be bad before i even heard he was involved but i never imagined it could be like this hes totally fucking paranoid im not arguing with that agreed mcculloch propping his feet on the only unoccupied chair to prevent anyones joining them the question is what are we going to do about it its our asses in a sling the texan actually wore cowboy boots harding saw he said the europol guys know it too virtually spelled it out theres nothing we can do said ritchie theyre the only people who can stop him the sonofabitch is only getting a check run on the ambassador himself mcculloch disclosed chapter thirteen gaston mehre had very roughly redressed the boy in trousers although he hadnt zipped the fly or bothered with underpants otherwise the body was naked to the waist and without socks or shoes the crumpled shirt nearby was flamboyantly ruched and the shoes were patent leather with large silver buckles there was a dried trickle of blood from the corner of his lipsticked mouth and afterdeath lividity where the blood had pooled darkened his face despite the makeup which also failed to hide completely an emerging beardline the nipples were rouged the eyes were bulging and the long black hair lankly matted by gel and sweat the lingering cologne was still quite strong charles mehres canopied bed was in chaotic disorder the sheets balled up and in places torn hanging from the bed in tendrils only one pillow remained on the bed heavily indented and spotted with blood there was also a splash of blood on a mirror set into the bedhead directly in front of the mirror was a pair of handcuffs and beside them a thinthonged whip on the floor nearby there was a black leather bag on its side a dildo and a set of nipple clamps were spilling out felicite turned away from the body uninterested walking back into the main room of the rambling twofloored apartment above gastons antique shop in antwerps schoenmarkt smet and henri cool were by the window overlooking the citys still bustling shopping district freed from felicites restraint smet was smoking defiantly both he and cool held whisky glasses gaston was by the drinks tray pouring for himself when felicite entered she shook her head against the gestured invitation charles mehre was isolated in a far corner hunched on a very upright chair his head was low on his chest a child caught doing something wrong he hadnt been given a drink no one was talking felicite said where did you get him on the paardenstraat said gaston naming amsterdams homosexual centre when last night anyone see you gaston shrugged it was the busiest time were you in your car the antique dealer shook his head gesturing towards his brother he wanted to choose himself what was his name he called himself stefan stefanie felicite frowned what nationality romanian he said a lot of them have come from the east he had an accent what happened it was to calm charles down you told me i had to it meant getting him someone said gaston defensively we were all together when we got back he was very good he had to stay obviously this morning charles said he wanted stefan for another day that he liked him we fixed a price i left them up here this afternoon while i was downstairs in the shop how pushed his face down into the pillow from behind until he suffocated thats how i found him charles says he didnt know he was doing it that he was excited felicite crossed to the corner charles hunched down cowering at her approach why she shouted the man tried to make himself smaller not replying why she shouted again sorry he said mousevoiced tell me why felicites tone wasnt so strident it wasnt as good as the feeling she got taking risks or partying with a group but it was close there was a thrill making grown men cringe nervously doing whatever she told them wanted to mumbled the man felt nice it was an inconvenience decided felicite allowing the anger an intrusion for which she had to adjust when shed thought she had everything worked out in its logical sequence she leaned even closer to the man who still smelled of his victims cologne youre stupid he looked up and as close as she was felicite clearly saw the madness in his eyes and was momentarily unsure how much longer she could control him another reason for moving on from this inherited group she thought recalling her earlier uncertainty about jean smet not stupid snarled charles it would be wrong to show any fear wrong to betray it to the man in front of her to whom she couldnt surrender control and wrong too in front of the other men who had always and unquestioningly had to accept her as their leader stupid she repeated her voice loud again admit to me youre stupid no say it stupid whispered the man louder stupid louder still stupid charles shouted he began to cry thats good said felicite soft again encouraging now promise me you wont do anything like it again promise say i promise i wont hurt anyone again wont kill anyone again i promise i wont hurt anyone again wont kill anyone again thats very good charles you wont forget that will you no felicite turned to his brother your storage basement has a security door right and your own cell yes queried gaston to the headbowed man in front of her felicite said i want you to take stefan down into the basement and all his clothes do you understand yes tell me what youve got to do take him downstairs and put him in the cell with his clothes she prompted with his clothes he agreed no said gaston still close to where the drinks were as felicite turned again she saw him pouring more whisky for the agitated smet charles had been straightening but now he stopped looking for guidance beyond felicite to his protective brother gaston said ill get rid of the body tonight cleanse it with a detergent a spirit before putting it naked into the river itll be all right no said felicite i want it kept for the moment why demanded the nervous smet from the window because i say so insisted felicite who had no clear idea why shed said what she had but didnt want to be seen immediately to change her mind she moved away from charles mehre returning to the others gin she ordered just ice i want to get rid of the body insisted gaston stubbornly there might be a use for it hes a whore probably entered holland illegally in the first place no ones going to miss him whores disappear all the time she turned back to the hunched man in the corner i said take him downstairs charles mehre looked between felicite and his brother like a trapped animal gaston capitulated take him downstairs thats better said felicite she was becoming irritated by the constant challenge from too many people she waited until charles had stumped from the bedroom the body heavy over his shoulder and gaston had fetched her drink before she said i dont want him around mary any more not until i say so hes too dangerous whos going to look after her demanded cool has anyone been to the house today felicite said to gaston charles was going tonight said the man ill go decided felicite this had to be the last time the end everything was falling apart she supposed she should talk about the television appeal shed left smet telling them when she looked at the body she felt suddenly tired of them not wanting to be with them any more that night instead she was anxious to get to the beach house to be by herself with mary her mary she said the pictures dont look anything like me nothings changed mary didnt intend it to happen didnt know why it did but a tiny mewing sound escaped when she heard the key she didnt care who it was even if it was the woman when it was the woman mary was glad the heaviness of the door would have hidden the sound shed made she didnt know how she came to be there but she found herself close to the door expectantly when it swung open she moved back slightly but the woman didnt come into the cell instead she stepped back smiling gesturing mary out into the larger room did you think id forgotten you felicites voice was quiet friendly with only a trace of huskiness i dont know mary shrugged she felt better being with someone the woman didnt seem so threatening tonight you should have known i wouldnt do that i dont want to hurt you let me go then soon you must be hungry mary was the last shed had to eat were the two rolls the snuffling man had brought for breakfast the previous morning yes she admitted ive got us both a meal said felicite pointing there was a tray on one of the low tables by the central dance floor on it was laid out bread cold meat fruit and cheese there was also a bottle of red wine and a bottle of water and two glasses do you eat with your mama and papa asked felicite leading the way at the weekends mostly theyre too busy during the week theres a nanny joyce she decided against telling the woman that mom and dad squabbled all the time im going to enjoy having supper with you yes the food couldnt be poisoned if the woman was going to eat it as well she was very hungry her tummy growling she was embarrassed not wanting the woman to hear mom said it was rude when your stomach made noises she liked the woman being kind to her not shouting or hitting her seeing marys hesitation and guessing the reason felicite served meat on both plates tasted hers immediately and said its very nice try it mary did at first hungrily but then more slowly not wanting to annoy the woman the meat tasted wonderful the first proper food shed had for days shed forgotten how long forgotten to keep checking the date on her watch she didnt mind the way the woman was looking at her smiling it was good just being next to someone not being alone how about some wine suggested felicite taking out the already withdrawn but lightly replaced cork mom doesnt let me havent you ever mary smiled guiltily once or twice bits left over after meals at the weekends felicite poured into both goblets ill let you because were friends she extended her glass and mary clinked hers against it she liked the taste of the wine like fruit she felt grown up how is it nice would you like more meat please felicite helped her to more and when mary finished the second helping changed her plate for cheese and fruit drink up theres a whole bottle for us to finish maybe some water i didnt bring enough glasses wheres the man who usually comes ive come instead arent you glad i dont want you to hit me she felt funny not ill or sick as if shed been poisoned but dizzy things going in circles inside her head i promise i wont hit you felicite offered her glass again and when mary responded said cheers this is nice isnt it just the two of us together i suppose more than suppose encouraged felicite its nice is there going to be someone for me to play with im sorry the girl couldnt come after all you promised marys face felt numb im sorry felicite reached out and took marys hand it was too much trouble felt too heavy for mary to move it you broke a promise therell be boys and girls soon when very soon felicite shared the remainder of the wine between them pouring more for mary than for herself have you spoken to my father mary felt sleepy as well as dizzy were making plans honest honest please let me go it was very hard not to cry you havent showered for two days no it was very hot today not down here i should shower too shall we shower together no were both girls arent we youre grown up so are you drinking wine i suppose then its all right isnt it i dont know ive seen you with no clothes on i know you dont mind seeing me with no clothes on do you i dont know havent you ever bathed with mama not since i got big why dont we try you wont hit me make me jump for the towel no i promise said felicite her voice thicker now you broke your other promise i wont break this one all right let me help you offered felicite neither henri cool nor gaston mehre had seen the television appeal both had listened horrified cool openmouthed to smets repeated and much more detailed account after felicite left was i recognizable demanded the schoolteacher i think so said smet she said not that it was because i knew it was the two of you what am i going to do decide for yourself said smet theyll be shown tonight on the late news programmes and in the papers tomorrow oh dear god moaned the man hurrying to the drinks tray charles mehre came back into the room standing uncertainly by the door he said hes downstairs i covered him up the other men said nothing and charles went back to the chair in which he had sat earlier its a mess complained gaston everythings a total mess and getting worse and theres no way we can get out smet was still looking at charles he said felicites right about the whore there wont be a big investigation into his disappearance even into his killing when the body is found cool returned with a refilled whisky glass his hand shaking thats not our problem i know said smet coming back to the two men its the girl and shes only a problem as long as shes alive dead cleaned against any forensic examination and properly disposed of thered be nothing to link her to us neither cool nor gaston spoke immediately cool said youre right its what i wanted from the start gaston said who smet looked back to the mans hunched brother would he if you told him to shed be furious said the antique dealer whats worse our being caught or felicite bloody galan being angry over something it would be too late for her to do anything about we should talk about it with the others first said gaston why asked cool lets get the whole damned thing over and done with were a group we rely on each other protect each other said gaston they should all agree youre trying to avoid it accused cool you do it yourself then demanded gaston at once seeing his escape i agree we have to get rid of her but dont use charles or me to make him do it kill her yourselves dispose of her yourselves the way ive got to dispose of stefan there was another long silence lets talk to the others agreed smet finally they wont do it either gaston said not themselves its always been charles someones got to insisted cool what are you talking about asked charles from his corner nothing said gaston dont get upset ill look after you for the first time since theyd arrived in brussels kurt volker ate with them at the comme chez soi on the place rouppe another first and proved to be an unusual dinner companion he dominated the conversation with cyberspace throughthekeyhole anecdotes of peccadillos foibles and downright carelessnesses of the rich and unrich famous and infamous ordinary and extraordinary mostly with the people he spoke about it was extraordinary when blake said so actually using the word volker said whos to judge extraordinary and claudine impressed said hes right psychologically mentally there are no criteria for ordinary so no one can be extra ordinary can they what about the people were investigating said blake arent they extraordinary the point is that paedophiles convince themselves actually believe that they are ordinary that its normal to have sex with children and if i forget for a moment that were hunting people who think their sexual preferences are perfectly natural were going to lose mary what if you get to them demanded blake urgently what will you be feeling and thinking if you get to negotiate one to one in some way claudine was surprised by the question disconcerted by it id suspend any personal judgement revulsion contempt would come through and i cant afford that more importantly mary cant afford that youve never negotiated a kidnap before certainly not a paedophile kidnap blake said solemnly can you do it i wont know until i try claudine conceded wishing she hadnt been confronted by such a direct question peters attitude had in fact confused her from the very start of the evening hed appeared tense unaccustomedly ill at ease and for want of any other explanation shed put it down to volkers unexpected presence although that could scarcely be considered an intrusion peter she suddenly thought shed obviously called him that from the beginning but until now had distanced him in her mind by using his surname it was an unimportant reflection she decided like thinking that blakes attitude tonight was any different from what it had been on the previous nights volker worked hard to restore some lightness with further stories of a marauding cyberspace robin hood to benefit the good and defeat the bad and claudine enjoyed the change from the grande place restaurant volker turned out to have a low tolerance but great liking for alcohol and became heavyeyed thicktongued when he retold two of his best stories blake had the restaurant order them a car rather than hail a street taxi volker between them in the back seat fell almost immediately asleep blake sat supporting the man with his arm along the back seat exactly claudine realized as the blondhaired woman had sat enticing mary into the mercedes he stayed like that for most of the time half facing claudine when on two occasions she looked pointedly across the car towards him he turned away to stare through the rear window they both had to help the german to his feet on the place de brouckere it brought blake and claudine close together and blake said quietly let me in when i come to your room no do it they ascended without speaking in the opengrilled elevator the halfasleep german leaning amiably between them claudine stared fixedly at blake who looked back expressionlessly volkers floor was below hers and as blake helped the german out she again said no blake ignored her inside her room claudine put the dead bolt across the door as well as double locking it she was confused offended too she wouldnt let him in what right did he think he had what right did any of the bastards at europol have to think every woman was going to roll over on her back and open her legs grateful to be fucked disappointment joined her other feelings peter blake she corrected herself at once was attractive considerate attentive fun to be with in other circumstances a lot of other circumstances chief of which had to be the exclusion of hugo she might have been drawn to the man but not like this not with the slambamthankyoumaam cowboy approach the knock was soft she ignored it the next time was louder and when she still didnt respond he said claudine dont say anything just let me in i dont she started but he repeated dont say anything the urgency wasnt sexual she realized at once she didnt know what it was didnt know what was happening but she was abruptly sure shed misunderstood everything so far she unbolted the door and tentatively opened it blake was standing anxiously on the threshold loudly too loudly he said as he hurried in im sorry i had to put him to bed hes completely gone and made exaggerated rolling motions with his hands to indicate that she should respond he went straight past her to the bottom of the bed orientating himself to the room bewildered but obeying claudine said will he be all right hell probably feel like shit in the morning blake revolved both hands again telling her to keep talking nodding as well claudine nodded back comprehending at last an absurd charade unfolded in which claudine remained by the door discussing the evening apologizing even for not having anything to drink while blake swept the room keeping up the empty conversation with her as he did so shed never seen it done before and occasionally faltered in what she was saying distracted by his obvious expertise he came back to where she remained standing to unscrew the light switch just inside the door from there he moved on to every light fitting and socket and every electrical plug and connection using a handkerchief pad to remove hot bulbs the bedside telephone was clean but there was a listening device in the extension phone on a table in front of the curtained window it was so minute little more than a pinhead fitting snugly into one of the tiny diaphragm holes that she had difficulty seeing it when he pointed it out to her and wouldnt have suspected it even if shed unscrewed the instrument herself blake reassembled the telephone without removing the bug moving some way away before saying as you havent got any booze here i guess well have to go back to the bar ok claudine accepted at once at that moment the telephone rang i left messages said hugo rosetti accusingly it was too late to return them when i got back what about today tonight there are a lot of problems we didnt expect go away she thought hating herself for thinking it like what i dont want to talk about them on the telephone she was being listened to she didnt know by whom or why but everything they were saying hugo as well as herself was being overheard and blake was in the room as well although hed started searching again disappearing into the bathroom whats so mysterious its far more difficult than we thought it was going to be problems with the americans i thought you allowed for that not enough what are you going to do about it blake appeared at the bathroom door pointing with a jabbing finger at what she guessed to be the switch just inside the door i dont know yet the americans send a negotiator hes the problem blake sat down on a chair by the door stretching his legs in front of him can you handle it im going to have to im missing you said rosetti im missing you too she made herself say face burning there was no reason for her to be embarrassed not in front of blake this was awful terrible it hardly sounds like it ive got to go its eleven oclock at night somethings come up from his chair blake made wardingoff gestures what something ive got to talk about with someone blake oh god yes is he a problem of course not thats a silly question why had she said that sorry he stretched the word to show he was offended youre misunderstanding its difficult not to i said i didnt want to talk on the telephone i love you said rosetti ill call you back tomorrow say around seven i said i loved you ill explain later whats the matter nothing i really do have to go i thought id come down this weekend arent you going to rome would it be inconvenient for me to come down apart from anything that might come up with the case i mean of course not id like you to come down lets talk about it tomorrow goodnight claudine hurriedly replaced the receiver but remained standing by it blake grinned and said how about that drink claudines hands were shaking from anger not fear rippling the brandy in her glass which she held in both hands shed sat where he directed at a table some way from the bar and other late night drinkers she at once recalled the bizarre conversation about carrying a gun when he identified the night hed detected the surveillance at la maison du cygne and said you thought it was on you he nodded had it been we probably wouldnt have got back across the square either of us it was the fact that we did that made me doubt i was the target in the first place even before i found my room was clean hed kept himself curiously apart from her she remembered norris obviously its not the people whod like to find me and itll hardly be the people holding mary will it norris will never admit responsibility though no one will the paranoid bastard she said fresh anger surging through her how longs it been there he shrugged sometime during that day i expect that was when you positively faced him down claudine forced herself to be calm frowning i havent used the phone much certainly havent talked about anything the americans dont know about theyre open transmitters in both the telephone and the bathroom light switch you mean theyre live all the time relaying everything that happens not just the telephone calls yes i dont want to stay in that room any more he smiled again trying to relax her theres mine but im not going to risk the rebuff you know youre being listened to now use it to our benefit you think harding knows im not sure he came a long way towards us with his concern about norris i think if he had he might have said something its so fucking stupid so pointless what are you going to do he asked i dont know but i suppose it makes sense to pretend were unaware she looked directly at him there were a lot of times tonight when you could have told me what you thought there was in my room why all the drama i might have been wrong then i would have looked foolish you still made it into a drama and you must have been sure he grinned i wanted to see if youd let me in bastard but not a paranoid one claudine put her glass down relieved her hands had stopped shaking are there really people whod like to kill you not until theyd hurt me as much as they could august dehanes wife was completely unaware of his membership of felicite galans group which always made it difficult speaking to the man at home the conversation was onesided and led by jean smet the lawyer impatiently dictated the message upon which felicite insisted and said he did not of course expect it to be convenient for the telephone executive to meet the rest of them until the following evening dehanes hesitation was obvious when smet gave his address off the rue de flandres as the meeting place is felicite going to be there he asked in a whisper no were going to settle things remove the problem promised smet thats good agreed dehane chapter fourteen there are in paris a very small number of restaurants three the most notable renowned as much for their discretion as for their highest guide michelin awards that on the rue du miel the first of the notable three was a place of dark wood smallpaned windows subdued lighting and conveniently anonymous rooms the most conveniently anonymous of all were two on the very top floor the epitome of belle epoque as indeed the restaurant was such salons particuliers were originally conceived as private rooms where the rich and famous could dine their mistresses in intimate mirrored luxury before moving to the only other furnishing an opulent chaiselongue favours were expected to be returned for favours received it was the practice for the courtesans to test the genuineness of their gifted diamond by inscribing their intitials round the mirrors edges those inscriptions anonymous of course are now officially decreed to be national monuments the salon particulier that sanglier entered five minutes late was like all the others a place where favours were still expected to be exchanged although no longer cut into the ancient still reflecting glass which his hosts were studying when he arrived there were three of them guy coty the chairman of the party was the oldest although he did not look eightyfive he was a small tightly plump totally bald man who had spent his life as a pilot fish for sharks in murky french political waters the diminutive but exalted ribbon of the legion dhonneur was in the left lapel of his immaculate dovegrey suit roger castille was half the other mans age with the darkhaired ivoryteethed openfaced looks of a matinee idol disguising a ruthlessness inherited along with ff from a financier father the third man lucien bigot was one of the few survivors of castilles treadonanyone ascent to the party leadership bigot was a beetlebrowed man who used his size to intimidate his official position was party secretary like coty he preferred powerbrokering in back rooms to his public parliamentary work it was bigot already known to sanglier from their six months of political flirtation who performed the introductions there was preluncheon champagne but no pretence of toasts as yet there was nothing to celebrate as aware as hed always been of the significance of the legion dhonneur and the expectations of the recipients sanglier accorded coty the necessary respect conscious of how it was being properly shown by castille and bigot and it wasnt stopping there sanglier realized to a far lesser but still discernible degree the two politicians were acknowledging himself as the son of a man who had also gained frances highest honour i knew your father said coty in a voice clouded by too many cigarettes not during the war of course i was in london with de gaulle after i escaped the gestapo but afterwards when the sanglier s bravery became known de gaulle invited him to come into government but he declined it seemed odd hearing the name like that properly used as the code designation by which his father had worked before officially adopting it as the familys legal surname after the war like several other resistance heroes coty was almost an exception for not having done so it was the first time sanglier had heard of the political invitation another aspect of his fathers life that had been secret he said he was a very modest man and now youve got the opportunity to take up the offer he refused said castille seizing the way to move on from reminiscence without offending the elder statesman could he take the risk sanglier asked himself for the thousandth time he didnt know that his fathers exploits rerouting nazi labourcamp trains and execution orders werent totally true there were in fact provable gestapo records of the failed hunt for the mysterious sanglier but there were so many gaps verging on inconsistencies in those and other records omissions blamed on claudine carters father who as interpols chief archivist had by almost unbelievable coincidence prepared sangliers wartime history for frances archive of heroes his emergence into political life would inevitably refocus attention upon his fathers history maybe even rekindle interest in a new biography by a new more determined literary investigator than the authors of those that already existed and who had unquestioningly accepted his uncooperative fathers explanation that apparent discrepancies were unavoidable in the chaos of the wars end cautiously determined upon assurances that went far beyond his fear of the past sanglier said with false diffidence im very flattered to have received this approach and i have had several months to consider it but there are important matters for us to discuss before i can give you my reply food first growled the huskyvoiced coty pressing the waiters bell just inside the door of the private room he was smoking through a small malacca holder the others had already studied the menu before occupying themselves with the initials of longago whores sanglier refused to hurry keeping the attendant waiting while he carefully considered his meal by the time his choice was made castille was scuffing his chair impatiently as soon as the waiter left the room castille said theres no doubt the present government will fall within six months no doubt either that well succeed them and well remain in power for a very long time after the scandals and failed policies of the last ten years but with a difference this time coty broke in virtually every minor party making up the current coalition is associated with the disgrace and failures either part of them or by association were not were clean above it all thats going to be our manifesto how were going to be seen by the electorate its going to give us an overwhelming unassailable majority so that therell be no need to rely on any of the smaller groupings were going to be the clean party for a new republic announced castille almost too obviously practising an election slogan this encounter was just as well rehearsed decided sanglier i have been extremely fortunate in my profession he ventured but until your approach id never considered a political career consider it now urged bigot well guarantee you an electable constituency and i can also guarantee that i will never forget those who declare for me at this stage said castille he needed an admission without portraying himself as naive sanglier knew if i were to pursue this there would have to be complete truthfulness between us we wouldnt be sitting here if i didnt expect you to take everything thats said with total seriousness said castille and never for a moment will i be anything but completely truthful i intend to practise among colleagues the central core of my manifesto he had learned at the eu meetings in brussels and luxembourg and strasbourg colleagues sanglier demanded shortly more than simply members of the party in the assembly the arrival of the food covered what sanglier guessed would have been a hesitation among the other men his oysters were superb the bonedry muscadet the perfect complement coty reluctantly extinguished his cigarette ive already made it clear we do not see you simply as a parliamentary member said bigot with a hint of impatience sanglier applied lemon in preference to onioned vinegar it was the moment to wait saying nothing coty said you went to brussels after an extraordinarily successful period as police commissioner here in paris and continued that success there time for absolute directness judged sanglier what role would you see me fulfilling if i were to become part of your administration justice minister declared castille i would consider nothing less said sanglier i am well aware and proud of my achievements here in paris he paused determined never to be treated lightly or underestimated just as i am well aware and perhaps even prouder of the cachet that goes with my name coty smiled a flinty expression fitting another cigarette into its holder the art of politics is assembling maximum resources to achieve optimum advantage consistent with honesty castille hurried in im glad were fully understanding each other said sanglier content with cotys admission that like all politicians these men were observing the golden rule of expediency he recognized that he did not have a positive guarantee anything in writing but acknowledged that to expect that would be naive i have your promise my absolute word said castille do we have yours demanded coty sanglier paused at the very moment of commitment yes he said the venison sanglier had chosen to follow the oysters was excellent like the margaux with something to celebrate now it was coty who proposed the toast castille said i have given you my solemn undertaking which i accept said sanglier curiously now i am seeking undertakings from you announced the man i have no wish to cause offence but there are questions i have to ask you my platform remember is that of honesty integrity and selflessness towards the people who will put us into office yes if sanglier hadnt felt the first stir of uncertainty the unctuous hypocrisy would have been amusing castille turned invitingly to coty the eminence grise of the party said is there anything in your past that could emerge once were in power once you held a ministerial portfolio that could cause the sort of scandal that has besmirched the present government no declared sanglier no going back he realized i repeat that i do not intend any offence said castille but neither do i intend to allow any risk to my election are you prepared for the party secretariat to investigate your past fully to confirm that assurance independently he had to take the risk about his father what about francoise she was by far the greater danger prowling too many public places like a bitch permanently on heat could he control her persuade her to control herself with the lure of being the wife of a government minister close to being an unrealistic question he forced himself to admit thered been enough to lose quite apart from the sanglier reputation when he was commissioner in paris before the europol appointment and neither consideration had curbed her it wasnt francoise or his father that gave him pause rather it was his determination to speak and act in every circumstance as they would expect to prevent any doubt despite castilles caveat they would expect him to be affronted your apparent need to do so hardly fits with undertakings of personal honesty that weve pledged between ourselves it fits with my intention to establish an administration above reproach said castille a prepared retort do you object said bigot of course not said sanglier im prepared to cooperate in any way thats reassuring said coty its going to give me great pleasure getting to know the son of a man i greatly admired it was midafternoon before the meal ended they parted with effusive handshakes and assurances of how much each was looking forward to working with the other bigot was the first to speak after sanglier left its a coup and not just for the sanglier name his wife was a dior model spectacular woman therell be a lot of good publicity around the two of them we could maybe build them up as the perfect couple kurt volker tracked the third message he wasnt suffering any hangover from the previous night and was actually early at his embassylinked terminals when the email was delivered because hed established a program of as many connections to mary beth mcbride as possible the sender address instantly registered which gave him at least forty seconds to follow backwards the stepping stones between sender and embassy before the disconnection claudine and blake arrived at their police headquarter offices as it was happening unaware of the potential breakthrough until being beckoned urgently into the computer room by one of the early shift belgian operators ploughing through the renewed incoming deluge prompted by the previous nights tv appearance several other operators had abandoned their stations crowding round the german but even their excitement was subdued volker himself appeared quite relaxed although his hands were darting with astonishing coordination between the keyboards of three terminals in a semicircle in front of him claudine was once more reminded as she had been on their first assignment together of a theatre act to which she had been taken as a child to watch a man perform simultaneously upon three pianos completing the impression volker was humming at first tunelessly but then something vaguely wagnerian no one else was making any sound claudine had no idea what she was watching didnt try even to read the words and the instructions that kept appearing becoming fainter each time upon the main screen in front of the german at one stage like the theatre pianist volker operated his central keyboard with his left hand and with his other punched keys on the board to his right conjuring email addresses on to the connected screen bah he exclaimed in final frustration when the screen directly in front of him remained blank after the message faded lost him he spun the swivel chair scattering the other operators to face claudine and blake theyd buried themselves in at least four different systems moving just as i thought in sourcecovering sequence from one to the other he stabbed a finger at the last address on the side screen thats where i lost them at least i think i did theres an outside chance a very outside chance it could be where theyre operating from where is it for christs sake demanded blake urgently volker turned another revolution accessed inex and typed in the address at once the screen filled with a blank home page of a computer cafe in menen on the belgianfrench border it would certainly be easy said volker still looking at his screen you can be quite anonymous in places like this you just go in get allocated a terminal to surf wherever you want and simply walk away after youve paid get me the rest demanded blake hurrying from the room claudine followed accepting that apart from analysing the latest message she was largely superfluous and she didnt hurry with the message needing the operationinitiating authority of the belgian justice ministry blake first telephoned jean smet and asked for total surveillance to be placed upon the menen cafe before disconnecting he cancelled that mornings scheduled conference with the promise to reconvene at the already arranged afternoon time unless a new development intervened he gave the same undertaking and account to andre poncellet and paul harding in that order finally blake tried to reach sanglier told the commissioner was unavailable he sent a full account to the mans secretariat with a request for sanglier to contact him as soon as possible by the time blake finished volker had located the internetlinked computers through which mary beths abductors had ridden sinbadlike to reach the us embassy home page from the specialized menen cafe the message had travelled unseen and unsuspected to the foreign ministry system in bonn from there it had been sent to a trojan horse unknowingly installed in the mainframe computer of the american express office at the foot of the spanish steps in rome from there it had been automatically routed to the flagship of the kempinski hotel chain on berlins kurfurstendamm the last stage from there had been to the school on the rue du canal from which mary beth mcbride had disappeared six days earlier whose email address volker had put on to his search program claudine realized her own need to talk to sanglier had become secondary in the light of the mornings developments but remained determined to insist he use his authority to stop the nonsense degenerating any further she wasnt interested in playing silly games and using her knowledge of the tap to their own advantage they had to recover a child and to achieve that a paranoid man had to be removed before he caused god knew how much damage by midday blakes flurry of activity had eased smet telephoned that the computer outlet was under intense observation and volker had independently accessed the cafes system and attached tracers programmed to react to the embassys email address blake was at claudines shoulder when she at last spread the printout of the latest communication between them it was written in two lines and read we determine how and when you wait and obey were not going to get much from that are we he said enough said claudine gravely maybe more than enough what i need to think more about it claudine said make sure ive got all there is to get nothing occurred to alter the scheduled afternoon session and by the time they assembled disappointment had begun to erode the initial excitement of the cyberspace chase volker explained stage by stage stopping short only of his newly installed monitor of the cafes inward and outward traffic as if on cue smet said the justice ministry had asked belgacom to suggest any electronic check that might be possible on the menen outlet completing the irony by pointing out that to attach an eavesdropping facility would be illegal although they were seeking a ruling from a high court judge the physical surveillance was absolute insisted the lawyer computer literate plainclothes officers had been drafted in to use the facility during the day taking the observation actually inside the cafe to identify regular users and there were rotating squads watching from outside a separate team had been assigned to investigate the registered owners and all their known associates if it was established the cafes use was innocent the owners and all its regular users would be specifically questioned about the computerized pictures the cafe was on the outskirts of a pedestrian and shopping precinct and all security camera film was being collected again for comparison with volkers digital images andre poncellet picked up as soon as smet finished describing as overwhelming the response within brussels to the previous nights television and that days newspaper publication of the kidnap computer graphics it was going to take several days maybe even longer to investigate every one claudine always regarded what she did as a contribution to an investigation not its most important element and was content for the practical discussions to dominate the meeting it was she acknowledged the first time this supposed overall planning group had been given the opportunity to operate in anything like a proper practical way consciously claudine let the discussion swirl about her always aware of it listening to it but at the same time instinctively lapsing as well into peoplewatching from their earlier encounters she hadnt expected quite such a forceful emergence from jean smet although she accepted blakes direct approach that morning had lifted the justice ministry lawyers participation beyond its original liaison remit andre poncellet was showing no surprise at the other belgians occupying centre stage seemed prepared even to surrender a leading role to the man claudines greatest concentration was upon john norris when shed first entered the room in which norris was already waiting shed been briefly gripped by the fury shed felt finding herself tiptoeing around her hotel room actually taking care to avoid cupboardclosing or clothesrustling noises she was completely controlled now still angry but able to find an excuse for what had happened in the mans illness she hoped it wouldnt be too much longer before she was able to reach sanglier certainly before the day was out his not being available was a nuisance norris appeared as attentive as everyone else but there was an artificial studiousness about the way he was avoiding her gaze several times it seemed difficult for the man to stop himself smiling in a situation in which there was no reason to smile and he was making no contribution to the discussion she was frightened norris decided guessing how close he was although there was no way she could know how hed got there shed have to wait to learn that wait for the confrontation hed look directly enough at her then face her down force an admission he had enough on tape from the hotel recording words that could only have one meaning words that told him she was involved in the kidnapping and how scared she was at being caught out the americans send a negotiator hes the problem she didnt know the half of it shed even conceded that too there are a lot of problems we didnt expect other parts of the conversation presented themselves in his mind each as damning as the other can you handle it im going to have to she wasnt going to be able to though not after that mornings computer chase that they were all so excited about that he was excited about because it had given him the positive tiein from bonn to rome to rome and the convenient moneymanaging expertise of an american express office which fitted perfectly with another part of last nights taped exchange arent you going to rome what about the message itself norris was suddenly conscious that poncellet was directing the question not to him but to the woman claudine did not bother with the pretence of including norris consciously subjugating her still lingering medical distaste it worries me she admitted bluntly why demanded smet it hasnt taken us any further forward said claudine the ambassador and his wife performed brilliantly last night psychologically it should have got a different response perhaps your advice was wrong said norris at once mcbride was a separate issue but norris was sure he had something there too the indictments against luigi della sialvo were all for illegal arms dealing with baghdad during the gulf war obtaining weaponry from a corporation that at the time had been mcbrides chief rival and was now the subject of four separate and enjoined indictments norris found it difficult to believe that whoever in the bureau had checked out mcbride before the ambassadorial appointment hadnt taken the inquiry further comparing the computerrecorded volume of material leaving mcbrides company against end user certificates for the far east della sialvos favoured route during operation desert storm hed put an utmost priority tag on his request after studying the indictments so he expected to hear within twentyfour hours it didnt matter whether mcbride was a close personal friend of the president or a major campaign contributor if hed broken the law he had to answer to it my advice wasnt wrong insisted claudine confronting the american verbally as well as physically this isnt a response to the broadcast this is an angry message whats there to be angry about queried harding mcbride pleaded virtually said hed pay anything i dont think the anger is directed at us said claudine i think theres some disagreement among the people whove got mary irritation that subconsciously came through in the message oh this was clever thought norris trying to confuse them all with psychological doubletalk no one could recognize except him couldnt it be reasserting the control you say is so important to them suggested smet the lawyer now very clearly considered himself an active player in the group decided claudine why not he was a lawyer and all his questions and comments so far had been valid she said theres an aggression that wasnt in the earlier contacts and this one incidentally was written by yet another person so we know there are at least three what could the disagreement be about wondered blake the most obvious reason is that theyre not unanimous over how to continue the situation said claudine what situation protested harding theyve hardly started yet thats another thing that worries me conceded claudine quietly you think the dangers sexual or worse even than that asked poncellet i dont know said claudine unhappy at a further admission but i think theres more now to the arrogance that i talked about in the beginning like what demanded smet claudine paused briefly unsure whether to express the fear theyve snatched a child not just a child the daughter of an american ambassador they should be frightened apprehensive at least but theyre not not enough so theyve done it before snatched a child and not been caught were still working through investigations over the past three years reinterviewing child sex suspects against whom no charges were brought as well as convicted paedophiles said poncellet everyone will be compared to the computer graphic obviously any women involved demanded blake poncellet looked uncomfortable not that im aware of ill make a specific check could the sort of disagreement you think this message shows be making them careless asked harding smiling apologetically to the german in advance kurt wasnt able to follow a trail before they had to risk it this time said claudine quickly seeing volkers offended frown they had to let us pick up the school address thats the proof the message is genuine not a crank response from last nights broadcast they had to leave it on the screen long enough for it to be recognized kurts genius was in having created a program that identified it in seconds far more quickly than they probably expected and then being able to follow it back as far as he did thank you said volker the frown replaced by an eventoothed smile she was extremely convincing thought norris in reluctant admiration but that was hardly difficult for her knowing it all from the inside as she did this was going to be one of his most successful investigations spectacular even exposing her for what she was but the fact that they used the school for proof could be another cause for concern claudine continued the first two messages had identification that could have only come from mary herself why didnt the third to maintain the pattern you think shes dead demanded harding was she trying to soften them up prepare them for something that had happened wondered norris that couldnt be right he couldnt save mary prove to everyone that hed been right if she was already dead so it couldnt be true it didnt fit no she cant be blake and harding regarded the american psychologist in surprise as if theyd forgotten he was in the room seemingly abruptly aware of their attention norris said i dont read the message as dr carter does in my opinion mary beths still alive there were discomfited looks between blake and harding poncellet openly shook his head only smet gave no reaction forcefully claudine said the lack of anything that must have come from the child herself is the strongest indicator so far that marys dead it could even be the reason for the anger that i believe is there how much more difficult will it be to find them if she is dead if the body is buried or disposed of queried smet harding looked sideways inviting norris to respond when he didnt the local fbi man said i think it would make washington doubly determined to catch them the investigation would increase rather than decrease if this mornings message hasnt carried any negotiation forward what do we do asked poncellet claudine was positive nows the time to wait what if they dont come back to us said blake shell definitely be dead declared claudine and well have failed youll have failed said norris jean smet kept his house as the venue but individually warned the others that felicite would be attending too she had to know they all had to know everything that had happened it didnt change the need to get rid of the child it made it all the more necessary despite hardings bravado and when she heard how close the investigation was getting felicite would have to agree that way theyd all be in it together without any falling out which he wanted as much as the rest of them he expected felicite to arrive last which she did but wasnt prepared for the triumphal entrance a diva commanding the stage well she demanded it was henri cool the one most worried about identification who first realized felicite actually had her hair in a chignon although crossed in the way she always wore it not as it had been shown in the computer picture youre mad totally mad she laughed at the schoolteacher i walked here by the longest route i could find i started in the grande place and actually obliged two tourists by taking their pictures in front of the manneken pis imagining what fun we could have had with a chubby little chap with a prick like that she smiled towards smet just for you i wandered by the palais de justice it really is the ugliest building in europe isnt it and went through the park to the royal palace before making my way here she paused again surveying them all and even with my hair like this no one looked at me a second time she snapped her fingers so that for the pictures you were all shitting yourselves about she slumped into a chair shaking her clamped hair free of its pins im totally exhausted she looked at henri cool anything happen to you i called in sick stayed home that was very clever sneered felicite that wouldnt cause any curiosity in anyone who might have seen a resemblance would it you bloody fool she made a languid gesture towards smet and said ill have champagne smet had two bottles already cooling in their buckets he gestured for michel blott to serve wanting to concentrate entirely upon the woman today was incredible its gone a long way beyond computer pictures what is it now she sighed wearily it was not something he would have admitted to the rest he was reluctant to admit it to himself but smet had actually come close to enjoying that afternoon of course he had been frightened weighing everything he said and heard but the fear had even added to the sensation he found it difficult to define precisely a combination of power at perhaps being able to influence the very people hunting him and mockery at being able to laugh at their stupid ignorance and the tingling fear itself at actually being there so close to them talking to them being accepted by them but supposed it was akin to what felicite felt the difference between himself and her was that he didnt constantly need the experience like an addict permanently in search of a better and bigger high there was even something like a physical satisfaction another manifestation of power he supposed at the varying horrified reactions from everyone except felicite hed anticipated that too there was only one more cutout after menen disclosed dehane hollowvoiced if hed got through that he would have been back to me oh my god it was stupid using the school said felicite what else did i have you didnt give me anything to identify her with retorted smet that was stupid felicite didnt like being so openly opposed certainly not in front of the rest nor did she like having to admit if only to herself that the man was right she had been stupid to dehane she said youve got a relay bug in the cafe system yes could you get it out dehane shook his head doubtfully they would expect me to do it be waiting for an unauthorized entry would it lead to you if they found it no its a oneway system ive got to access it so theres no danger even if they find it not really and it would take a very long time no matter how good this man volker is so we can use what they think is a breakthrough to our advantage again said felicite we simply leave dozens of policemen wasting their time in a part of the country were never going to go near again the insane bitch still didnt intend changing her plans smet realized the others had to hear her say it to convince them later what was necessary we mustnt go on with it it doesnt alter anything chanted felicite like a mantra weve got to get rid of her theres nothing to discuss ive told all of you whats going to happen and it will exactly as i say you cant be serious protested the other lawyer this doesnt make any sense at all felicite was extremely serious although still outwardly showing the sangfroid with which shed arrived an hour earlier the investigation everything was very different from the last time nothing was like what had happened then not so technical nor as determined nor with such an inexhaustible supply of police and specialists to be called upon at a moments notice so it would be madness to prolong it much further madness to try to recapture the exquisite firsttime pleasure of last night being with mary but ultimately holding back from touching her ecstasy from abstinence priestly fulfilment she couldnt wouldnt give the slightest indication that theyd been right of course they hadnt been right it was the investigators who had been better investigators she still had to confront to prove who ultimately was best well further confuse them beyond menen she announced now theyve got so much manpower invested in email well change our approach she turned to dehane how many belgacom mobile telephones get stolen every day not just here in belgium but throughout europe dehane snorted in disbelief thousands tens of thousands and all the losses and the numbers get recorded to prevent their unauthorized use dont they the telephone executive shifted uneasily eventually exactly smiled felicite i want you to programme newly reported stolen numbers into unprogrammed telephones for me well only use a number once before switching to another even if a number is scanned and the holder identified it wont lead to us all it will do is compound the confusion we started at menen her smiled widened now isnt that the cleverest thing no one replied immediately smet said whos going to make the telephone contact me of course unless any of you want to volunteer the silence this time was longer thats settled then said felicite hurrying now as she came to another decision it would be easy enough to bring forward that nights dinner with pieter lascelles everyone ate unnaturally early in holland anyway and ill go to the house again tonight to look after mary what about tomorrow asked cool felicite extended a wavering finger moving it back and forth between the assembled men before coming back to the schoolteacher you she decided unless that is i change my mind we were all agreed even before what happened today reminded smet so theres nothing more to discuss is there except whos going to do it said gaston mehre he likes it said smet looking at the mans brother gaston was holding charless hand comfortingly charles appeared to have retreated into his private world unaware of the discussion around him were all part of it whoever actually kills her said the other lawyer when asked gaston mehre tomorrow said smet we dont know how long felicite will stay at the house tonight youve got to get rid of the body insisted gaston charles can kill her but the rest of you must get rid of the body of course said blott too eagerly i could have come to antwerp offered lascelles he was extremely thin as well as being tall and he held himself forward so his body appeared concave he had a soft cajoling voice it wont take me long to drive back their table was in a cubicle shielding them from the rest of the diners she passed the brochure of the namur chateau across to him this is it lascelles studied the illustrations and said it looks magnificent have you shown lebron two days ago he was impressed hes probably bringing as many as ten of his people ill probably have around the same maybe more theyre looking forward to it when will you make your snatch not until you give me a definite date certainly the weekend after next maybe sooner youve caused a sensation felicite smiled its exciting you will be careful wont you dont you lose your nerve like the others it was still only nine oclock when felicite reached the antwerp house overlooking the schelde river she smiled at the child waiting anxiously just inside the heavy door hello darling said the woman are you pleased to see me very glad said mary she liked the woman being kind to her kinder than her mother and father who didnt seem to care what was happening to her in brussels blake finally got a call from henri sanglier who said that after picking up the message from his secretariat hed decided to go to menen personally to ensure the surveillance was properly in place he rang off before blake could transfer the call to claudine at the citys zaventem airport the american embassys diplomatic bag arrived from washington carrying the information john norris had requested about mcbrides armaments corporation at the cafe on the rue guimard that the fbi had made their own duncan mcculloch said if you wont talk to blake tomorrow i will its fucking ridiculous ill do it undertook harding finally overcoming his reluctance he was damned if he did and damned if he didnt he decided and just three years before he would have been out of it all chapter fifteen the depression was tangible at the first gathering of the day people talking because they had to but knowing they werent offering anything to keep alive the brief hope of the previous day the clandestine surveillance had produced nothing henri sanglier had agreed with the belgian squad at menen that the cafe proprietor was uninvolved and approved direct questioning with the computerdrawn images of the wanted man and woman the proprietor a retired customs officer recognized neither nor did any of his regular users whose names hed offered before being asked none of them resembled the couple or recognized them poncellet said the belgian police record search had been extended to cover the entire country not just brussels there was no computer graphic match with any arrest photograph in police archives nor was there on any europol or interpol register making up for his previous days ignorance the police commissioner said there were only two women with child sex convictions both with boys not girls and neither bore any resemblance to the computer pictures both had witnesssupported alibis for the day and time mary beth mcbride had been snatched one had been in ghent visiting a sick mother the other at a hairdressing salon where she was well known both had nevertheless been detained for an identification parade that afternoon that both johan rompuy and rene lunckner had agreed to attend there was nothing for claudine to contribute although john norris was saying nothing either there was more animation about the man having so studiously ignored her the previous day he now appeared almost anxious to catch her eye twice openly smiling it was claudine decided typical of the mood swings recorded against the severe obsessional condition from which she suspected norris to be suffering claudine was anxious for sangliers promised arrival that afternoon shed been circumspect on the police headquarters telephone but shed ensured sanglier understood the importance of coming direct from menen to brussels instead of returning to the hague by tonight after the scheduled five oclock embassy meeting with mcbride the problem with john norris should be all over it had been an unnecessary distraction but it had not interfered with what they were there to achieve claudine was dissatisfied shed drawn every conclusion she could from what evidence there was which could practically be fitted on to a pinhead with room to spare for a football match with spectators until there was further contact there was absolutely nothing more she could think of doing and if that contact was still by email she was not certain there would be anything to add to the profile shed already created their continued hope would have to be that volkers pursuit would be more successful the next time in rare and unsettling selfdoubt claudine wondered if she had been right to guide the ambassadors public responses as she had she was sure the messages conveyed disagreement among those holding the child from which it logically followed one faction dominated the other and if domination of any sort was a factor which was a psychologically accepted characteristic of any kidnap whether sexually initiated or not then it was right initially to accede to it but shed always resisted obedience to supposedly rigid rules in something as inexact as psychology which as a medical science remained as unexplored as life in outer space one eroding doubt created another could she be so sure that no contact within twentyfour hours not twentyfour any longer little more than twelve almost certainly meant that mary beth was dead claudine still thought so she didnt want to it was she accepted the subconscious reason for her selfquestioning but after so long without a positive ransom demand it had to be the strongest possibility and if mary beth was dead claudine acknowledged that shed failed others might not think it hillary certainly wouldnt but claudine knew it would be so which brought her know thyself know thyself to the very nub of her problem her reason for reflecting as she now did as shed stood in numbed horror in the doorway of their london home looking at warwicks lifeless body slowly turning from his suicide rope claudine had determined never again to fail in a mental analysis as shed failed to realize until it was too late her workstressed husbands condition now she faced failure again but fought against accepting it as she had before things hadnt fallen out as shed expected to allow herself to think as she was thinking at that moment was to panic without cause a fault she would be the first to criticize in anyone else a fault that would endanger the child she had to save if saving her was any longer possible throughout the selfexamination claudine had as always remained aware of the justifying discussion continuing all around and was not caught out when it settled upon her her surprise in fact was that of all people the question came from jean smet further establishing himself as the unelected but so far unquestioned coordinator of their daily largely unproductive informationsharing she saw no reason to question it either someone had to coordinate anything youd like to add asked the belgian he was getting the same satisfaction as on the previous day enjoying himself i think we should now start to consider bringing them to us announced claudine her mind filled with her most recent thoughts the concentration upon her was immediate smet said yesterday you said we should wait not indefinitely qualified claudine wishing shed earlier expressed herself more fully wishing shed thought about it more fully earlier if theres nothing by the end of the day we should change our attitude to what demanded smet to challenging said claudine i thought it was wrong to be confrontational frowned blake initially explained claudine weve gone past that time now weve got to face down the arrogance tilt the balance away from them towards us after today pressed harding yes agreed claudine guessing from the emphasis it was only half the question she was conscious of norris openly smiling his head going back and forth between her and those questioning her by which time its more than likely shell be dead the american finished claudine said weve got to accept that as the strongest possibility but obviously weve got to go on acting in the belief that shes still alive she is asserted john norris suddenly and by the end of the day he knew he was going to prove it he was going to get her back as well as discovering from james mcbride what his corporations documented business dealings had been with the indicted luigi della sialvo three months before saddam husseins incursion into kuwait i hope youre right said smet there had to be a secret agenda to which this man was working that was the only possible reason for the americans inexplicable but obvious uninterest practically nonparticipation in these sessions empty though most of them were another uncertainty he wouldnt have to worry about after tonight he wanted mary beth dumped as far away as possible and believed he knew how that could be done too gaston mehre had demanded that others in the group dispose of her but there was still the body of the romanian rent boy in the cellar of his antique shop which was very much the brothers problem no one elses definitely not his in their eagerness to avoid becoming physically involved the others would back his insistence that charles and gaston get rid of the girl as well as the boy at the same time and in the same place something else i may be able to judge from whatever response i can generate said claudine now she was speaking in the first person ignoring norris she realized youre surely not thinking of the ambassador again said burt harrison coming into the discussion not directly said claudine he they are just the route from now on i want them to focus on me she had arranged to meet henri sanglier at the metropole hotel to show him the two listening devices before he went to james mcbride and claudine had expected blake to return there with her but as they broke up blake said that although it would almost certainly be unproductive he thought he should attend the identification parade including the two convicted women sex offenders and harding says theres something he wants to talk to me about john norris was tight with excitement his overriding feeling oddly one of relief that he was at last going to achieve so much in such a short time he didnt have the slightest doubt that it would all fall into place precisely as hed planned it would that was all it needed precise and detailed planning and norris had all that in order all the sessions spaced out according to their priority all the evidence assembled memorized and ready to be presented the ambassador first then the carter woman the iceman myth was going to be well and truly established after today during the drive back to the embassy norris waited testingly for the chief of mission to refer to his impending appointment with the ambassador but burt harrison said nothing which norris regarded as important mcbride obviously hadnt mentioned it anxious to contain things between the two of them a further indicator norris decided to go with the familiar uncertainty hed detected in mcbrides voice when the ambassador had agreed to see him that hesitant intonation of nervous guilt hed heard a thousand times and never once been wrong about there was still time to spare when they got back to the embassy and norris went first to the fbi office determined everything should be ready there he carelessly cleared hardings desk with only one exception opening and filling drawers at random until all that remained on its top was an unmarked blotter a multilined telephone and the overnight washington dossier he intended carrying intimidatingly into his confrontation with the ambassador the exception was the top righthand drawer of hardings desk which norris withdrew and closed several times to ensure its smoothness before installing its unaccustomed contents the tape recorder uppermost his final act before leaving the room was to position a single chair directly opposite the one he would occupy on the far side of the desk james mcbride was alone stiffly upright and blankfaced behind his overpowering desk which by comparison with the one norris had just left was cluttered with papers and files and documents norris at once identified the ploy the workplace of a busy man with little time to spare it was all so predictable like a soap opera script what is it you want me to do demanded mcbride briskly clever conceded norris predictable again but still clever id like you to help me about certain things abruptly there was the briefest sweep of dizziness gone as quickly as it had come harrisons just told me there were no real developments this morning its not about your daughter this was what hed always liked best the thrust and parry of interrogation he had it all marshalled in his mind dates and times ready for any challenge or evasion he felt very hot probably the reason for the dizziness mr norris said mcbride with threatening condescension as well as being a very busy man im also a very worried one there is in fact only one concern on my mind at the moment and only one thing i want to talk to you about and thats mary beth our only necessary point of contact ill give you all the time you want if its to do with her but if it isnt im going to have to ask you to let me get on with being an ambassador time to kick the struts away to bring everything crashing down can you tell me about luigi della sialvo the question was like a physical blow low in the stomach mcbride actually came close to feeling breathless who dont you know a luigi della sialvo hed already said he was too busy to discuss anything but mary beth so he could demand the man leave but if he did that he wouldnt learn just how much norris or the fbi back home knew i dont recognize the name who is he whats this about that wasnt right not the reaction it should have been mcbride should have been more unsteady when the name was thrown at him it was important to keep up the pressure he went to speak but then didnt his mind suddenly thick as if it was filled with mush forcing himself he said illegal arms dealing mcbride told himself not to panic not to betray any awareness not yet he had to wait for the accusation demand the proof even then he could deny knowing the man pleading the passage of time what the hell are you talking about luigi della sialvo is currently under grand jury indictment on five counts of illegal arms dealing with the regime of saddam hussein during the gulf war a fugitive in fact that was better clearheaded again everything assembled in his mind fugitive mcbride seized on the word not under arrest likely to horsetrade or pleabargain spilling his guts for a lenient sentence the sensation of breathlessness began to recede all my stock is in a blind trust escrow account but i would have been informed of any investigation into my former corporation norris had wanted a definite sign by now the twitching shiftiness that always came just before a collapse your own records show your corporation actively traded with luigi della sialvo five months prior to the iraqi invasion of kuwait was it five or seven the dates hed wanted to be so pedantic about showing he knew everything wouldnt come two deals worth about norriss mind blanked again stranding him worth many millions of dollars it was right that he should show total shock decided mcbride appear to be momentarily unable to respond when he did speak it was loudly in furious indignation are you accusing me executives in my corporation of illegal arms dealings telling me my companies are under investigation the response came half formed in norriss mind then slipped away again no accusation just asking about a man currently under indictment there isnt an investigation yet yet thought mcbride it was a fishing expedition the bastard was looking for a confession on whose authority or instructions did you request this meeting i am ranked as a senior field executive of the federal bureau of investigation a deputy division director i have sufficient personal authority that was better thinking properly again he wished the muzziness would stop coming and going that it wasnt so hot in the room the man had left himself wide open thought mcbride so which course should he take outraged ambassadoriallevel dismissal or the astonished disbelief of an innocent man at a horrifying possibility of embarrassment hed learn more playing the innocent which company is named in the indictments against this man norris couldnt remember one moment he had the name the next it had gone his head thick not mush as if it was filled with cotton waste lextop he finally managed lestrop corrected mcbride curious at the mistake it was a passing thought replaced in a moment so this was the unspecified rumour that was causing the lestrop stock to slide where della sialvo had gone after hed told the italian to go fuck himself it still didnt help mcbride gauge the danger he faced thats it lestrop accepted norris gratefully this wasnt going at all as it should have done how hed planned it by now mcbride should have broken made a mistake he could have picked up and used to trap the man into making more it was so difficult keeping things straight and in the order he intended he didnt want at this late stage actually to consult the washington dossier but he couldnt afford another mistake at once came the contradiction the file was intimidatingly thick consulting it now might convince mcbride it contained more about him than it really did he dropped one of the indictments taking them out of the folder and had to grope awkwardly under his chair to retrieve it theres an international arrest warrant out against della sialvo hes thought to be somewhere here in europe where hed be relatively safe and able to operate mcbride knew international arrest warrants were notoriously difficult to enforce particularly in countries with different legal systems he would have known of an active investigation it would have been inevitable how did washington discover the trading with my company norris realized the ambassador was questioning him not the other way round as it should have been had to get the order reversed get everything back on track it was difficult to keep the loose papers from sliding off his lap the facts from slipping out of his mind i asked for an indepth examination checking for enemies you might have made i mentioned the possibility remember so it wasnt yet properly official a washington operation there never had been any secret about the two deals hed done with della sialvo they were totally legal a matter of public record apart from the zurich bank commission payments and that was a problem for sialvos native italy not the united states and the italian was free and likely to remain so mcbride was glad hed played the innocent it made the rest of the meeting easy he said this is potentially very worrying here it comes thought norris triumphantly it had taken longer than hed expected hed begun to feel uneasy which was ridiculous but the first trickle had just seeped through the breach in the dam it would come in a tidal wave now it always did the more you can tell me the better it will be quite so mrbrides mind veered sideways off on a sharp tangent thank god thered been the confrontation at the beginning taking the negotiations for mary beths freedom away from this bumbling almost incoherent idiot when it was all over when mary was safely back hed have the fbi directors ass for sending someone like norris i always think its best what i prefer what id like us to do would be to set it out chronologically from the very beginning said norris the gulf war was a long time ago seven eight years theres no hurry your own time hed won beaten an ambassador friend of the president there wasnt any purpose in prolonging this charade it was almost cruel like a cat taunting a captured mouse i dont have any official position in the corporation any more but obviously in the circumstances the board will do as i ask ill send them a very full explanation immediately ask them to cooperate in every way with the bureau and advise your director of course send both sides copies of what ive told the other and tell state and the president norris sat staring at the other man his mind wiped clean once more no he said dully no what mcbride frowned i want you now to tell me now its my case theres nothing to tell you after so long i cant remember anyone named luigi della sialvo but if hes an indicted criminal a fugitive from american justice then quite obviously my former colleagues have to cooperate in every way they can as i will if it turns out that i dealt with him personally mcbride rose ending the encounter youre to be congratulated for digging deep enough to find this mr norris norris rose without any positive intention of doing so and papers cascaded on to the floor he had to kneel to pick them up still kneeling he said to the other man please tell me ive told you theres nothing i can help you with at the moment mcbride said its too long ago but your people in washington will get every help i guarantee it he came round the monstrous desk to put his hand on norriss shoulder physically urging the man from the study in her room at the metropole claudine was disconcerted when the telephone rang she stared at it for several moments unwilling to pick it up it wouldnt be hugo shed spoken to him much earlier from the security of the belgian police headquarters explaining how and why it had been difficult for her the previous night it was far more likely to be peter blake something important has come up said norris when she finally lifted the receiver can you come down here to the embassy what is it i dont want to talk about it on the phone claudine hesitated henri sanglier still hadnt arrived and the american embassy was where they were going anyway she could leave a message for peter to show sanglier the devices ill be there in half an hour the embassys rezidentura the quarters of the cia and the fbi was far away both in distance and appearance from the lavish ambassadorial officialdom claudine had seen on her first visit a series of identical boxlike rectangles four of which now formed part of the emergency communications centre those of rampling and harding were at the very rear of the complex slightly larger than the rest to designate their local status of controller but each restricted by only one door and no windows to outside light rampling saw claudine as she was escorted past and waved but she didnt see him to robert ritchie who was with him rampling said you know something i dont i dont know nothing said ritchie its called staying alive norris checked his watch as she entered hardings cleardesked room and claudine at once registered both signs excessive cleanliness and rigid conformity particularly to time were both features of severe obsession she had in fact made the journey within the promised thirty minutes but she should have avoided the selfimposed stipulation she was aware of the brief frown when the indicated chair scraped slightly sideways as she sat there was a sheen of sweat on the mans sallow face and unusually his jacket was open the chair movement wasnt sufficient to cause a problem norris decided the microphone hed fed round the desk taping out of sight beneath its rim the lead to the recorder in the righthand drawer was sensitive enough to pick up everything she said so began claudine enthusiastically whats the big mystery you couldnt tell me on the phone shed had misgivings on the way there not so much misgivings as belated curiosity the arrangement was for jean smet to bring them together if there was a development norris in fact was the last person who should have done it but in the mans mental state there could be a dozen explanations she hoped at least one of them was useful norris declared technically this embassy is american property he was quite sure of the technique to use with her hit her hard without giving her any room for manoeuvre shed made a mistake claudine knew at once she said i know john we went through the question of jurisdiction at the beginning didnt we so youre in america she had to realize how trapped she was listen to me urged claudine gently you telephoned me at the hotel asked me to come here because you had something to tell me what was it you wanted to tell me that insisted the man irritably that youre subject to american law because youre in america why was she being so stupid she could walk out claudine supposed leave the embassy and get back to the hotel before sanglier and blake she felt a sweep of embarrassment no one would be able to understand her coming here like this she couldnt understand it now he was a sick man she reminded herself a sick man who was going to be confronted very soon with the demand that he be removed from the investigation she wouldnt walk away from a sick man she said there isnt anything is there nothing you needed to tell me about the case i know norris announced he had to maintain the pressure constantly keep her on edge what do you know john tell me lets talk about it this wasnt any sort of treatment it couldnt be but there would be an element of paranoia his confused mind overcrowded with disjointed delusions and if she could coax some of them out she might temporarily ease his burden why dont you tell me he wasnt going to lose control as hed lost control with the ambassador find himself answering questions instead of asking them couldnt understand how that had happened a trick wouldnt do mcbride any good what do you want me to tell you she was giving up far easier far quicker than hed expected but it happened sometimes you could never tell all of it how you managed to get in on the inside where she is so i can get her out everything claudine felt the first pop of unease deep in the pit of her stomach the moment of collapse at the highest point of tension she thought weve got to work together john help each other i want to help you and i know youll help me just do as i ask tell me where mary beth is shes been missing for too long ive got to get her back why couldnt she understand claudine knew she had to establish a central thread something he could recognize and hold on to were trying to find mary beth together she was trying to trick him the muzziness the cotton waste feeling was coming back and it was hot again it was the artificial light that had to be on all the time there should be air conditioning somewhere too late to look for it now you know where she is who they are i dont you do norris grabbed sideways for the other item hed carefully installed in the top righthand drawer alongside the tape recorder not the newissue mm that a lot in the bureau carried because of its stopping power but the smith and wesson hed always preferred he saw the fear in her eyes when he brought it out and laid it on the table between them keeping his hand on the butt if you dont tell me youll be obstructing a federal officer in pursuit of his duties and i am legally authorized in the united states of america in which at this moment we both technically are to use whatever force is necessary to make you comply with my requests he brought the weapon up pointing it directly at her so answer my question he had thought he wasnt going to get through the formal warning twice hed almost lost it but he had the warmth was satisfaction now a feeling of complete power he was legally authoritzed to shoot to kill if she tried to escape hed only wound her put a round in her arm to break it prove he wasnt making empty threats he wanted very much to fire the gun feel the kick and hear the explosion im waiting five streets away robert ritchie shouldered his way into the familiarly crowded bar on the rue guimard checking himself at the unexpected sight of the englishman at the same table as harding and mcculloch he realized at once that theyd seen him so he had to continue saying hi and gladhanding as he made his way through the crush ritchie didnt say anything when he reached their table mcculloch said hed already found the wire both of them and made you the first night i always said you were shit at surveillance their commissioners coming in this afternoon to stop the whole fucking nonsense shes with norris at the embassy now disclosed ritchie i checked the transcript he called her room just over an hour ago said something had come up that was too important to tell her over the phone nothing has come up said blake she had to bring him back from the edge give him the thread her life hung upon her being able to open whatever door there might be to what remained of his rational reasoning mind if nothing did remain then it was almost inevitable he would shoot her from a metre away he couldnt miss we were supposed to work as a team you and i inveigled yourself in so theyd know everything we were doing right it would be a mistake to pander to the delusion letting it grow im not involved with those whove got mary beth i couldnt be no one saw it but me he was closed off against her what did you see you getting inside knowing everything we were doing it made you angry didnt it my replacing you trying to change the order making him answer questions again didnt replace me thought you did but you didnt im still in charge why wasnt she frightened when a gun was being held unwaveringly on her from point blank range there were feelings anger at being tricked frustration at not being able to reach him mentally but no actual gutdropping fear she isolated the pride the boastfulness in the mans remark wondering if it might be the chink she was seeking there was the sudden flurry of movement behind her obviously from the only door she didnt turn john said a voice she recognized as hardings whats the problem here john no problem sorting everything out said norris his eyes flicking over claudines shoulder no need for you here no need for any of you get out the gun came up towards her we dont need the gun john lets put the gun down ok get out do as he says insisted claudine still not turning john i tell you what im going to do said harding im going to come on in here help things along a little there was a nervous laugh its my office for christs sake guys gotta be able to get into his own office dont need help shouted norris his voice cracking my case ill bring it in the gun abruptly shook in his fury ok ok said harding urgently everythings down to you there was renewed sound from behind and claudine guessed more people had arrived she heard mcbride say norris john this is the ambassador you hearing me of course im hearing you he wasnt looking away from claudine now whats going on here getting your daughter back sir thats what i was sent here to do the gun wavered up and down gesturing to claudine she knows where mary is shes going to tell me good man said mcbride well done i want you to put the gun down and well take dr carter back to my office and she can tell me herself then im going to cable your director just how damned well you did on this shes got to tell me no one else norriss thumb moved visibly flicking off the safety catch at the doorway mcbride whispered to harding could you hit him from here disable him hes half hidden by her hed know what i was trying to do see my gun if i moved along the inside wall for a full shot replied harding softvoiced oh shit i could hit him offered blake but his reflex would be to pull his own trigger he couldnt miss her claudine unaware of the import of the hushed conversation said loudly please be quiet everyone let us alone yes said norris distantly thats what i want everyone to be quiet everyone except her he was confused by so many people he was pleased that mcbride all of them were going to witness how good he was be taught how to interrogate a felon properly but hed lost his concentration couldnt think how to pick up the questioning the gun felt suddenly heavy he couldnt remember why hed pulled the weapon had she pulled hers to challenge him couldnt see it to frighten her he remembered that was it to frightened her claudine could detect the rustle of movement behind her but no one was speaking it was important that they didnt she didnt want any more anger didnt want him to lose what little selfcontrol if any was left he was fixated on her involvement so she couldnt positively confront him that would make him angry too and hed defied the ambassador the ultimate authority the sort of authority to which hed always deferred in the past so there was an absolute refusal any longer to acknowledge anyone as his superior either officially or professionally it made his paranoia his delusion absolute and him a totally dangerous man clinically a psychopath a psychopath sitting a metre away pointing at her a gun with the safety catch off what was her entry to someone who believed himself above all others shes got to tell me no one else she remembered not the ambassador or his director in washington only john norris godlike among the little people so he was the entry the only way to get through to john norris was through john norris the one person hed listen to the only person whose opinion made any sense to him extremely careful to infuse admiration and to make it a statement not a question she said you must feel very satisfied holding me here like this i havent got her back yet no thought claudine anxiously mary beth mustnt come into the conversation i feel very inadequate you were are norris shook his head against the thickness the gun rattled against the desk top everyone stiffened there was no way of guessing how long it would be before norris completely collapsed it wouldnt be long stressing the admiration even more she said and youre the master she was helpless admitting it and those at the door were quiet now attentive like his audiences at quantico attentive and respectful you were careless taking calls at the hotel about rome and saying how worried you were about me there was an opening she risked a question at last is that the way trusting no one he smiled first to claudine and then to the men behind her lecturing was always satisfying i always know a lie can find guilt claudine hadnt wanted to put another question until she was surer but she didnt have a choice how can you decide who to trust norris had been responding with reasonable coherence not taking too long to reply but now he hesitated frowning and claudine thought dear god dont let him slip away dont let me lose him she didnt think shed get him back even to this uncertain rationality if he drifted away we check everything dont we he said his face clearing his voice even she was there shed got past the mental barriers to what was left of his reasoning mind she couldnt guess how long it would last but for the moment she was through so you had me checked out he looked at the gun he still loosely held then at the unseen people behind her and claudine decided the frowning was not his mental confusion but his inability to understand what everyone was doing there most of all what he was doing there so you had me checked out she repeated im sorry i it was a first i got at the sorbonne wasnt it yes he said doubtfully it had to start coming from him it had to be his realization what about london first choice criminal psychologist at the home office he was knuckling his eyes with his free hand looking again at the people behind her and claudine wondered if mcbride was still there how much more time did she have your bureau helped set up our behavioural division at europol i know guy called scott burrows was seconded whats this all about i dont understand claudine snatched at the long sleeve of her dress baring her left arm and holding it towards the man the scar from the attempted assassination was still livid and wide not because of bad surgery but because it had been a professional attempt and the knife had been smeared with excreta to infect the wound which it had you know how i got this the man actually started back as if he were frightened of the ugliness a hit a previous case she couldnt risk going any further norris had held out far longer and far better than she could have hoped you know all that to be true dont you john of course i do who do i work for a wariness flicked across his face who do i work for persisted claudine for gods sake dont let there be any intervention from behind norris said europol i think john concentrate demanded claudine i work for europol dont i yes i couldnt have inveigled my way into this investigation could i the eyes began to glaze the grip on the gun tightening dont trick its not a trick john hold on concentrate youve made a mistake because youre not well youve become ill but were all going to help you get better gotta get the kid back were going to do that youve got to get better go back to america and get some treatment there was a sudden burst of redness to norriss face and his body tensed and claudine guessed he was making a superhuman attempt to stop his mind clouding once more through clampedtogether lips he managed what obsession said claudine thats what i think it is severe obsession developed into a psychosis but its treatable you know its treatable what have i done the words groaned out of him he was staring down at the gun nothing there were some misunderstandings thats all no harm i was sent personally by the director the president knows the investigation you didnt affect the investigation norris looked up at her with quick brighteyed clarity the stiffness easing from his body i dont want to be psychopathic you know it can be treated ill have to leave the bureau you wont lied claudine im sorry for whatever it was becoming difficult for him to understand one minute clear one minute fog you were part no sorry disgraced the bureau claudine detected the movement before the man actually began it guessing it was safe to move herself she said let me have the gun john and started forward across the desk and then became properly aware of what he was doing and yelled no dont but the barrel was already in his mouth she wasnt actually aware of the sound although there must have been one in front of her norriss face and head disintegrated in an enormous gushing burst of red and because she was so close her hand actually but too late upon his wrist claudine was engulfed in the gore by myself yes said gaston mehre felicite said i wasnt to go there said charles its changed does felicite know yes i wont hurt her you can but i wont this time felicite was angry with me shouted shes changed her mind she wants you to do what i tell you why thats what felicite wants what do you want the same its what we all want youre very good to me said charles you all are youve got to go on doing what we tell you though warned gaston you know that dont you yes and you know what we want you to do now yes you sure yes and thank you go and do it then chapter sixteen claudine vomited uncontrollably over the desk and the headless tendrilnecked body that remained grotesquely upright in its chair and over blake who grabbed her and turned her away from the horror she continued retching huddled in his arms long after she couldnt be sick any more the empty stomachwrenching convulsions turning into constant violent shaking uncontrollable again as the trauma gripped her she was vaguely aware of blake and harding hurrying her from the room both talking but she was still deafened by the shot and shook her head uncomprehendingly unaware that she was crying until blake started wiping her face when she saw the contents of the handkerchief she realized distantly that it wasnt tears or even blood he was wiping away but bone and brain debris she whimpered and the shuddering worsened others crowded around her in the corridor a man and two women taking over and she went unprotestingly into an elevator which took her downwards she was striving for control by the time it stopped tensing her arms tightly by her side to stop the twitching concentrating upon her surroundings looking for an outside focus to bring herself back to reality she still couldnt hear what the unknown man was saying and brought her hands up to her ears to tell him it was deafness not shock it was the embassys basement gymnasium she was bustled straight through past two bewildered men lifting weights into the womens changing rooms at the showers one of the women started to undress her stripping off the blood and fragmentcovered clothes but claudine gestured her away she began to recover in the shower forcing herself to look at the bloodstreaked water streaming off her turning the spray to its hardest adjustment and holding her breath to stand directly under it it was several minutes before she could make herself actually wash her hair not wanting to touch what might still be in it there was nothing when she squeezed her eyes shut she saw an immediate mental picture of a crimson explosion and a head disappearing and quickly opened them again twice there was loud rapping against the glass door only when she shouted for the second time that she was all right did claudine become aware mat her ears were clearing she stepped away from the water at last but didnt immediately try to leave the stall partially extending her arms and looking down at herself the tremor was still mere but not as bad her ribs and stomach ached from the vomiting consciously she closed her eyes again tightly there was no headbursting image one of the women was waiting directly outside offering an enveloping white towelling robe it had a hood attached but the second nurse handed her a separate towel for her hair the attentive man said kenyon bill kenyon im the embassy physician can you hear me claudine nodded there was still a vague echoing sensation but his words were quite audible she said im fine youre a doctor you know youre not the man said weve got a small emergency infirmary here but i think you should go to hospital kenyon had blond almost white hair and rimless glasses claudine saw mat the nurse whod put her arm round her had blood on the side of her uniform she said i am a doctor a psychologist and i know about posttraumatic stress im not going to your infirmary or to an outside hospital you cant shrug off whats just happened to you the physician protested im not trying to shrug it off the very opposite im fully acknowledging it think i know even why it happened and i believe i can go on youre making a mistake he insisted if i am then ill recognize that too ill be all right kenyon shook his head unconvinced i could let you have some chlordiazepoxide it could be a useful precaution to have a tranquillizer available claudine conceded that would be very kind by the time kenyon returned from his dispensary the nurses the blonde was named anne the brunette betty had located an embassyissue track suit in claudines size still in its wrapping and training pants for underwear claudine said she wanted everything shed been wearing incinerated both nurses tried to persuade her to rest at least for a few hours in the embassy sick bay she ignored them as well as the tranquillizer kenyon gave her his card with his home as well as his direct embassy number call me i mean it im here promise i promise i dont believe you i want to go back upstairs claudine was pleased she could remember in which direction the lift had brought her she still felt suspended between reality and disbelief the disorienting echo was intermittent in her ears youre wrong you know said kenyon no i do know insisted claudine but did she really know how strong she was ill arrange a car to take you back to your hotel offered betty i want to find everyone else claudine said positively i didnt take much notice of the route on my way down here thats all the help i need lets hope youre right said kenyon cynically i might not be and if im not ive got your numbers she conjured the contact card between her fingers claudines arrival in the ambassadors suite was met with astonishment i didnt i thought groped mcbride standing awkwardly but bringing everyone else to their feet with him i just want to be here said claudine awkwardly im all right she saw peter blake was the only person in the room without a jacket and remembered his pulling her into him swamped in norriss gore and her own vomit then she saw him crossing towards her you sure this is a good idea he said too quietly for anyone else to hear no claudine admitted the shaking had gone but despite the comforting thickness of the track suit she felt suddenly cold why then because i want to claudine was pressing her eyes tightly together again no bloodred explosion when sanglier arrived close behind blake until that moment she hadnt been aware of his being in the room you dont need to be here insisted the frenchman i want to be she repeated now she was there she wasnt sure that was true from behind his protective desk mcbride still standing said dr carter i want to say but claudine faintvoiced stopped him theres no need to say anything its over claudine had never known the sensation before never wanted to know it again it was as if she were suspended above them all in an outofbody experience in which she could hear and see them but they were unaware of her presence her uncertain ears even made their words echo ghostlike and she had to hold very tightly on to her ebbing and flowing concentration several times when it ebbed her vision actually blurred merging people together with distant voices claudine clung like a drowning person to a fragile handhold to her decision to be there it was right that she should be not to contribute she wasnt able to contribute to anything at that precise moment but she could listen difficult though that might physically be claudine sat apart from the closely arranged group round the ambassador welcoming the distance although becoming aware that mostly unconsciously the discussion was directed towards her not for approval but from courtesy mcbride did most of the talking for claudine irony piled upon irony when the ambassador insisted that american sovereignty in us embassies overseas made john norriss suicide a matter entirely removed from belgian jurisdiction or public awareness without mentioning claudine or even looking in her direction mcbride said there had been sufficient witnesses to the incident for an internal inquest to be held that evening prior to the bodys being returned to america it had been the climax of a series of extremely unfortunate incidents here at last he looked at claudine for which he apologized but in no way did he expect it to affect the principal reason the only reason for their all being there no replacement negotiator either fbi or cia was being sent from washington paul harding was to assume overall command of the combined agencies commitment with the assurance at presidential level that it was seconded to europol mcbride was about to launch into a formal speech of congratulation to claudine when he was interrupted by the sound of the telephone he stared at harrison who said i held all calls except mcbride snatched up the phone not immediately speaking holding the receiver away from him as if it were hot against his ear he said to claudine its a woman she says mary got a b for the geography paper that was in her backpack check that claudine told blake as she moved towards the telephone i want mcbride english but accented french possibly claudine said im speaking on his behalf the wife no the only lies she could risk were those she couldnt be caught out on damn her hearing the voice kept rising and falling ah the clever little mindreader we want to negotiate this was probably the most difficult part establishing the rapport from which to manipulate the woman without her being aware it was happening of course you do tell me about mary demanding blake and harding hurried back into the room together the note blake slipped in front of her said school confirm b grade harding made a rollingover motion with his hands encouraging her to extend the conversation as much as possible the womans reaction was exactly what claudine wanted we have to know shes all right the sound abruptly dipped and claudine said urgently hello hello she saw rampling reenter the room shaking his head to blake and harding there was a jeering laugh you havent lost me you wont find me either my name is claudine claudine carter so i wanted you to know was she moving too quickly the laugh came again what name would you like me to have your choice how about mercedes thats appropriate isnt it claudine felt a stir of satisfaction the woman was responding nibbling the unsuspected bait is it appropriate there was a silence shed never get it claudine guessed would the woman actually admit it you tell me good enough in its original spanish its a name that means compassionate or merciful are you compassionate and merciful you have to tell me that too and isnt name comparison invidious claudine didnt want her too angry she had the child to take the irritation out on i dont follow she admitted in latin the name claudine means the lame one anxious to show her cleverness that was good lets hope youre mercedes the merciful the pause this time had nothing to do with the uneven sound in apparent awareness the woman said you are the mindreader arent you she had to avoid responding to questions as much as possible always making the woman come to her we need to know that mary is all right claudine repeated she is how is she learning claudine was chilled by the word a challenge or a taunt she couldnt avoid it learning what what do you think i dont know not a clever negotiating lady like you whats mary learning the line abruptly became clear enough for a brief sound of background noise how to be a good girl lets talk about getting mary back im not sure i want to give her back yet ive become attached to her this was wrong dangerous i said we wanted to negotiate there is nothing to negotiate really is mere tell me what you want i want to speak to the ambassador he wants me to talk to you on his behalf youre not understanding silly woman you all do what i tell you otherwise mary isnt going to be a happy little girl when i call tomorrow i want to speak to mcbride not you and by tomorrow youll know what will happen if you dont do precisely what i tell you theres something i want to say blurted claudine trying to hold the woman i dont want to hear anything youve got to say i want the ambassador waiting this time tomorrow and i know he will be i want started claudine but stopped as the line went dead the receiver was suddenly heavy in her hand she became aware she was shaking again and dropped rather man replaced the telephone on its rest she looked up to see everyone staring at her something was wrong didnt fit or jarred maybe there was something in the recording mat theyd just sat through that was out of context but she couldnt isolate it thered been too much in too short a time she told herself objectively she shouldnt have even taken the call although she was glad she had claudine believed despite the discrepancy whatever it was that it had been useful and that there was a lot to learn from it but later not now now she was stretched to breaking point about to snap overwhelmed the shaking came in spasms starting stopping starting again are we going to get mary back claudine only just avoided wincing at the desperation in mcbrides voice and at the wideeyed strain on the face of hillary who claudine had not realized was present until shed replaced the telephone claudine felt crushed as if the room no not the room a force she couldnt see was closing in to compress her into something very small too small for them to hear or take notice of fumbling the librium from her track suit pocket she said can i have some water please blake poured it for her once more using the closeness to say you want the doctor again claudine shook her head i need some time to listen to the recording again compare it to the written transcript you must have some impressions insisted smet it was the woman in the car wasnt it of course it was said claudine irritably on a mobile telephone said rampling thats why the sound level kept rising and falling interference from bridges and highly builtup areas thats why we couldnt get any sort of fix tomorrow well use scanners are we going to get mary back hillary mcbride repeated her husbands question evenvoiced rigidly in command of herself she added back alive and claudine wished she hadnt i think so said claudine reluctantly thats not good enough protested mcbride its the best i can offer said claudine youre supposed to know i dont know admitted claudine not yet i will but not yet i dont think we should press dr carter any more said sanglier the inquiry inquest groped claudine its a formality we wont need you said harrison id like to go back to the hotel claudine admitted what if she calls again demanded hillary mcbride people seemed to be advancing towards her retreating and advancing again and claudine regretted taking the tranquillizer with a monumental effort she said she wont call again not until the same time tomorrow maybe not even then so you have worked something out demanded smet i want to go home said claudine she was unaware of the drive back to the metropole or of blakes being with her until focusing jerkily upon him helping her through the foyer she began to wonder how hed got the key to her room but couldnt hold the thought and then found hreself in it he was there too but moving around momentarily she didnt know where he was he emerged from the bathroom tossing something up and down in his hand and as he crossed to the bureau telephone claudine remember the bugs all clear he announced holding out the tiny pinheads in the palm of his hand i dont want to be by myself said claudine no agreed blake it hadnt gone at all as shed intended and felicite was angry frustrated claudine fucking carter wasnt frightened enough none of them were if they were prepared to let the woman take the call which they should all have been pleading to receive they had to be taught a lesson she coasted the mercedes into the limited parking zone outside the railway station and on her way to the public telephones thrust deeply into a refuse bin the mobile august dehane had programmed with the number of one that had been stolen a week earlier in bruges lascelles came on the line as soon as felicite had identified herself to his receptionist a scalpel ill explain when we meet im looking forward to seeing her said the doctor shes beautiful promised felicite chapter seventeen hello wheres the lady mary had been waiting eagerly on her feet just inside the door when she heard the key grate now there was a plunge of disappointment she couldnt come said charles mehre she promised shed become her friend been kind to her it wasnt fair i dont know is she coming later no just me she promised mary repeated charles mehre shrugged i want to come outside insisted mary the man hesitated blocking the entrance to the cell all right he hardly moved to pass she would have to brush against him mary stayed where she was i cant get by he giggled still not moving you can if you squeeze i dont want to squeeze he was very much like victor the garden boy back home she became aware of something surprised but decided against referring to it yet she was very uncertain about what was happening he finally shifted although still not very much but she was able to pass without touching him he smelled stale mary went to the bench seat in front of the table at which shed eaten on previous evenings with the woman were going to play games he announced i dont want to play games the woman hadnt told her about this about anyone coming but her it was the two of them shed said special friends better friends than she was with dad and mom shed started to believe her you must his voice was suddenly loud harsh and mary didnt like it why hadnt the woman come like shed promised wheres my food no food why not i always have food now not tonight why not mary said again that wasnt fair either she did always have food now why was this man being mean because im hungry no food youre bad said mary talking to him as she talked to victor at home not bad the voice was loud again but this time in protest shell be mad at you no the tone changed again sulkily you dont like her being angry at you do you wont be gaston said gaston thought mary she will be if you dont give me something to eat dance for me no she didnt like this i want you to dance for me the harshness was back im too hungry will you dance for me if i get you something to eat maybe properly like i want you to dance i want to eat something he remained uncertainly between her cell and where she sat shifting from foot to foot all right he started across the room towards the stairwell door but stopped halfway frowning back suspiciously as if there was something he didnt understand his lips moved but mary didnt hear what he said she made herself sit back against the cushions as if she were settled he continued on and mary tensed with his every step moving the moment the door closed behind him the carpet deadened the faintest noise of her running across the room she listened against the door all she could hear was her own heartbeat bumpbumping in her ears she pushed the door towards its frame before pressing the handle down actually holding her breath the door moved swinging soundlessly inwards she stood at the opening staring upwards able to see an oval of light at the top a black and white checkered floor she remembered a heavy door heavier than the one shed just opened so easily leading outside she wouldnt be able to run if it was blowing as hard as it had been when theyd brought her here didnt matter she could hide once she got outside thats all she had to do get outside she went up the first two steps then stopped she was frightened she knew downstairs her room with the sliding peephole in the door and the bathroom and the strange room with a big screen and the round dance floor in the middle felt safe there safe with the woman although not with this man the man who wanted her to dance that was silly a man wanting her to dance it wasnt like dad wanting her to dance that would have been different all right shed never danced for dad though it looked a long way up to the oval of light she had to get there get away get outside she went up two more steps stopped again she wished the woman was there someone she felt all right with mom or dad why hadnt they paid the woman said they didnt care didnt want her she hadnt believed it at first but they hadnt done anything to get her back and she seemed to be the reason they had a lot of their fights but shed seen dad cry on television heard him say he loved her and did want her it was the woman who was kind to her now showered and dried her last night theyd gone through her backpack and looked at her schoolwork and the woman had even given her a lesson but as a game not the proper geography for which shed got the b the questions had been easy but shed really tried and the woman had been pleased with her called her a clever girl shed been proud to be called clever now she was confused confused and frightened although she didnt know what she was frightened about just not knowing being alone she didnt want to go outside didnt know what was out there perhaps they were all up there all the men in stupid masks whod looked at her through the hatch she wished there were more of them not just this man who smelled bad and laughed in a silly way as if he knew a joke that nobody else did there was the noise of a door opening closing footsteps across the hall mary scurried back closing the downstairs door behind her and running to where she had been sitting she was there against the cushions when he entered a tray balanced across one arm there was bread and cheese from the previous day the milk only half filled the glass and had lumps in it and was sour when she tasted it the bread was stale but she made herself eat it as slowly as she could she pared off the cheese in small slivers youve got to shower take your clothes off i dont want to you must why he frowned she says she changed her mind she told me yesterday she doesnt want me to do that not any more not true why arent you wearing your mask she asked finally when he smiled mary saw his teeth were very uneven as if there were too many crowded into his mouth she hadnt worn her brace for days now he said dont have to not any more why not doesnt matter any more why not she repeated secret he snickered he reached out to touch her hair but mary pulled back he sniggered again shed eaten too much cheese practically all of it to prolong the meal and now she felt sick she wished shed gone up the stairs she didnt feel safe down here any more youre pretty mary couldnt think of anything to say i like you like your hair i dont like you touching it said mary pulling away again nice hair leave me alone havent got to mary didnt think the sickness she felt had anything to do with what shed eaten it wasnt like a tummy upset pain did she say that yes she told me you did told me herself that you didnt have to touch me she didnt hed been sitting next to her on the bench close enough to reach out towards her now he got up and crossed to the tape deck and cd equipment against the wall beside the large screen he stood there staring at it in total bewilderment awkwardly touching switches and knobs no music he complained we dont want any music mary said nervously to dance said the man we need music to dance i dont want to dance yes the harsh loudness was back he wasnt sniggering or laughing any more have a shower and then dance play like you did with her for the towel play with me i didnt like that said the child i dont want to do it again ill slap you i want to slap you victor she had to treat him like victor that would be bad he shook his head no one knows its not right to hit people nice good no no its not good its wrong he said i could who she didnt know what to do dad please dad there was no one to tell her what to do i wont be naughty again god i promise help me and ill be very good please god gaston gaston doesnt want you to hurt me he does said i could mary started to tremble there was a lock on the inside of the bathroom door could she pretend to do what he wanted get inside before he could follow her and lock him out she might be able to if she was quick quicker than shed been when she tried to run away from the woman the other time she could pretend to dance a little first make him sit down to watch to give herself the chance what if he got to her before she locked it like the woman had done shed be even more trapped then have to do what he wanted or hed hit her hed said he would hit her wanted to i want to go back into my room now he shook his head not any more you mustnt hurt me do anything bad to me i can if you do youll go where bad people go he frowned at her head to one side what it had been the ultimate threat against victor when shed wanted to make him cry how much longer could she go on talking keeping him away she still felt sick and now her throat was beginning to get sore i wont make victor cry ever again god i promise you know where bad people go jail thats it youll go to jail mary seized on the word go to jail for a very long time for ever no one knows theyll find out cant my father can hes a very important man lots of special people work for him doesnt matter if you go away leave me alone ill tell my father you were kind to me promised mary then they wont send you where the bad people go she wanted to make pee pee already felt wet do the other thing very much wanted to do the other thing her stomach was rumbling making rude noises she tried to keep her bottom tight together me now the words roared from him furiously hed shown no sign of losing his temper and mary screamed out in shocked surprise at the unexpected noise he was coming towards her arms outstretched hands cupped and she cringed back against the seat trying to slide sideways round the tiny table so that she could run run where she didnt know just run around the room anywhere run to the bathroom he snatched out grabbing her arm as she darted to her right pulling her towards him and mary brought her other hand up trying to push him off his smell was much worse not just his body but the breath from his ugly mouth he was grunting squeezing her stop it stop it stop it mary was scarcely aware of the words at first not until the woman reached them beating at the man with openhanded slaps the woman got between them slapping the man again and again he roared not a word just a sound and slapped the woman back and she screeched clawing at him so that mary saw blood burst out on his face mary fell back against the table hearing it split as it tilted spilling her back on to the bench the man wasnt fighting back any more he was standing with his arms cupped about his head trying to protect himself but mostly just standing there letting himself be beaten and the woman was beating him aiming her blows kicking him and shouting in french the man began to retreat towards the door under the onslaught and she kept up the attack driving him from the room and disappearing through the door still clamouring at him in french it was only then that mary saw there was someone else a man she hadnt seen before standing just inside the entrance he was very tall and oddly thin his stomach curved in instead of out the strangeness made more obvious by the way his shoulders humped bringing him forward his mask was frightening black leather cut with spaces for just his eyes and his mouth but very tight like a skin over his head and face he carried the sort of bag that doctors used in bad english he said poor little one poor poor little one dont hurt me pleaded mary her voice catching in a sob please dont hurt me i wont said pieter lascelles i promise i wont hurt you mary was sick and shed wet herself and there were tiny blood spots inside her knickers that frightened her but the woman said she wasnt ill but that it was growing up becoming a woman and she wasnt to worry until they dried after shed washed them she didnt have to worry about ups the woman had showered her and afterwards cuddled her on the cushioned bench mary lay with her legs curled up wanting to be held wishing the man with the skin mask wasnt in the room with them spoiling it mary didnt want anybody else with them she liked it with just her and the woman it took some time for the catch to go out of marys voice as she told the woman what had happened and all the time the woman held her and smoothed her hair and several times mary felt the woman press her lips to her head kissing her over and over she kept repeating poor baby and my poor darling and poor love he wanted to hurt me sobbed mary said gaston said it would be all right wanted me to dance shower and dance its all right all over now he wont come here ever again i want you i know you do my darling ill take care of you now ill always take care of you please dont leave me alone ive got to there are things i have to do but youll be safe she pulled away from the child i want your backpack the one we looked through last night why i want to use it for something all right mary felt important being able to lend the woman something she wanted on their way into antwerp lascelles said shes very pretty and shes mine declared felicite the gaunt man looked across the car towards her would he have killed her there was no emotion in his voice i think so hes a liability all your people are can you stop him coming back again yes said felicite shortly i think we should get it over with soon when im ready not before shes not just pretty mused the doctor remarkably brave considering what she went through back there felicite was at the mehre gallery confronting the brothers charles sat even more huddled than before in the upright chair crying gaston stood defensively by the window as if he saw it as a way of escape there was no pretence of drinkoffering hospitality i didnt know hed gone i sent him to collect a bureau in ghent liar accused felicite you sent him to kill her no yes gaston stopped protesting who of the others knows felicite demanded all of them bastards what are you going to do felicite didnt know that realization made her even angrier they werent obeying her any more wait she said inadequately you can wait all of you to find out gaston said i could mumbled charles from his isolated seat claudine lay with her head into blakes naked shoulder liking the way his arm felt holding him to her liking the whole feel of his body along the length of hers it had been wonderful she couldnt remember how long it had been couldnt remember sex but she didnt think it had ever been like this hed been incredible always thinking of her before himself her pleasure before his but at the same time thered been a frenzy an urgency more than passion the first time and then hed taken her again twice and each time shed come shed forgotten that too now she felt wonderful relaxed from the sex and the librium but with no tiredness instead her mind was pinsharp and her skin burned tingling against his you ok wonderful there had to be another word you you wouldnt know it seemed an odd thing to say it didnt matter now weve joined the europol club i guess its like the mile high club no he said despite the darkness she was conscious of his seriousness i dont think we need to analyse it she said which for her would be a change perhaps we do it happened peter because of a lot of outside things but it happened and it was she stopped refusing to use the word yet again and it was sensational but i dont expect you to propose marriage if you did id refuse i used you he said i dont remember complaining or fighting she said trying to lighten his mood he was spoiling things i want to tell you something need to tell you something but im frightened what of what youd think of me does it matter what i think of you i think so your choice she said blake didnt speak for a long time when he did it was with difficulty the words uneven disjointed there were two of us i didnt know that i wasnt told neither was she thats the system you see if one gets blown theres still another one in place but you cant bring him down because you dont know he lapsed into another long silence lying as she was claudine was conscious of his breathing becoming shorter what was her name she prompted knowing his need anne her family were from kildare he grunted bitterly i suppose thats how it started with her and me like you tonight frightened not wanting to be alone after seeing someone killed we had to take part in operations of course prove ourselves our initiation was a bombing in enniskillen a british soldier died we both saw it happen saw him blown to pieces but it became more than fear and sex claudine prompted again when he didnt continue after several minutes it all had to come out brutally if necessary blown to pieces echoed in her head briefly she had a mental image of a crimson explosion and a body without a head we still didnt know about each other not properly i mean we used to have long conversations about how wed get married when it was all over when the cause had been won and there was just one ireland i mean and all the time i knew it would never be possible because of who i really was and she would have been thinking the same because of who she really was neither of us knowing that we could have got together when we were withdrawn what went wrong said claudine there was to be another operation on the mainland the strategy of bombing the city of london hitting the countrys financial centre was judged a success so it was decided to keep it up force a lot of foreign banks to relocate in frankfurt my contact was a barman at the europa hotel in belfast we used to drink there anne and i she knew him by sight the semtex movement into britain was decided at the last minute more than a ton the devastation would have been greater than either canary wharf or the baltic exchange i hadnt used the emergency system before actually met him away from the hotel but i had to for the van carrying the explosive to be identified and followed from its arrival at holyhead i made the call from her flat i went there ahead of her from the planning meeting and decided i couldnt wait or risk a public kiosk that annes phone was safer she must have come in sooner than i thought and heard me although i didnt think she had i didnt think she was in the house she must have followed me can you imagine it doing her proper job and i saw her just after i passed the details his breathing became even more difficult and claudine guessed he was crying and was glad for his sake they were in darkness dont stop not now he must have had an english watcher too someone compartmented like we all were who saw her and thought he was blown i never knew but he was withdrawn took the information with him we made a big thing about it in england followed the van to london swept up the entire cell that was going to plant the bombs the head of the antiterrorist unit gave a press conference and the stupid bastard talked about inside information actually used the word infiltration there were only ten people who could have known anne and i two of them they had a source inside the belfast telephone exchange i didnt know about they traced the call from annes flat to the europa bar the bar from which my man had been withdrawn claudine waited i dont want to go on yes she insisted they got her thats not it is it thats enough not for you it isnt blakes voice was flat as if he was reading words that had been written down there was what they called a trial anne in front of every one of us whod known about the semtex shipment she denied it of course said she didnt know about a hotel barman which was true never once looked at me they took her away after finding her guilty they decided to torture her to find out if there were any others we were all to gang rape her then she was to be tortured you didnt let them get to her did you she was already naked when i went into the room spreadeagled on the bed i went mad intentionally screamed and shouted that she was a whore and a slut made myself uncontrollable which wasnt difficult although not for the reasons they all thought she never said a word to betray me only looked directly at me at the very last minute i shot her dead before they realized what i was doing blake moved slightly away from claudine who for the first time became aware how wet her cheek was from his tears i killed her twice once by being careless and then by pulling the trigger she let it happen to save me and they all said what a good and loyal soldier i was forgave me for spoiling their fun before they could find out if there was any other infiltrator for once in her overconfident life claudine didnt know what to say the proper english trial at which you appeared she groped they were the men six of them they all got life but theyll be released of course if you and anne made up two who knew and there were six properly tried that leaves two missing we were to put a bomb in belfast city centre our reprisal for the interception of the semtex and the arrest of the cell in london we were going to use the sewers crawl in and crawl out devastate the place and kill god knows how many above it was to be an hour fuse i shortened it to two minutes they went into the sewer ahead of me and i shouted down that there was a patrol and i had to close the manhole it made a crater twenty metres deep and forty metres across you were believed by other people queried claudine i didnt run knew i couldnt if it was to be accepted as the sort of mistake they often made the explosion broke my left leg and right ankle were you trying to die the other six hadnt been sentenced then what if they had been he didnt reply peter id have gone into the tunnel with them im glad you didnt and im glad you told me its better i havent finished since then i havent been able to do this not until tonight oh god thought claudine they werent talking love love didnt come into it but there could be a dependency here thats what i meant by using you are you angry no she said cautiously but lets not think about what happened as anything more than it was i wont he said he would she knew the first of the early morning cleaners found mary beths rucksack just inside the school entrance and imagined it had been left there by a pupil the previous day although it was rare for things to be left lying about madame flahaur recognized it immediately for what it was and fortunately told her secretary to call the police before opening it the school principal collapsed immediately with severe heart palpitations at the sight of its sole content a childs severed toe chapter eighteen she had been desperately trying to prevent herself from getting shot and she wasnt in any case capable of treating the man but claudine denied herself any excuse hollowed by the guilt of failing sufficiently to identify john norriss mental deterioration the remorse was inevitable tangible almost and close to that shed known after not recognizing warwicks problems less easy to quantify was the psychological effect of seeing a man blow his head off right in front of her she was sure however that neither remorse nor effect prevented her from functioning to the fullest of an ability it unsettled her to question there were a lot of other contributing uncertainties last night for instance nothing that had happened affected how she felt about hugo to imagine it had to think of it as anything more than a one night stand would be ridiculous things like that happened a million times every day it would be important though not to let it happen again she didnt want it to happen again know thyself she did want it to happen again but she wouldnt let it it wouldnt be fair not to peter which was the chief consideration nor to hugo peculiar though their situation was she had to put it behind her not forget that it had happened she certainly didnt want to forget but not invest it with meaning and significance it didnt have and anyway hugo would be in brussels by midday to examine the grisly discovery in mary beths backpack which brought claudines thoughts back to yesterdays telephone conversation she remained convinced that somewhere in the events of the preceding twentyfour hours shed missed something of importance shed left henri sangliers breakfast review ahead of everyone else to arrive early at their police headquarters incident room to examine chronologically all the previous days material forcing herself through the tape of her conversation with john norris and men her recorded exchanges with the woman there was something she couldnt decide what it was but neither could she lose the impression that it was there waiting to be found she was still surrounded by dossiers painstakingly going through them word by word to ensure she hadnt made the psychological mistake of closure wrongly completing a picture by automatically inserting an expected fact or conclusion that wasnt there when the rest of the control group arrived virtually together she abandoned the search joining the others in the larger conference room anything asked sanglier quietly as he took a chair beside her hed listened to the norris tape and heard the shot and was close to incredulous not just at her bravery but at her apparent recovery it had been his decision that the europol pathologist assigned to the investigation should be hugo rosetti knowing as he did from his absurd mistake of exposing claudine to francoise at a dinner party at his delft house that there was a relationship of sorts between her and the italian claudine shook her head without replying shed talked at breakfast of her lingering belief that something had been overlooked and suspected they thought it imagination a traumatized reaction to the suicide jean smet felt himself at a disadvantage in the presence of henri sanglier nervous of trying to exercise the virtual chairmanship none of the others in the group had opposed he didnt know exactly what had happened the previous night at the american embassy only that john norris was dead but there was going to be no public announcement or any belgian involvement whatsoever it had all been arranged without his knowledge in late night meetings between the europol commissioner mcbride belgian foreign minister hans van dijk and miet ulieff the justice minister who was supposed to be so reliant upon him smet was still furious incredulous at ulieffs dismissal that it had been a matter to be decided at an upper government level with no connection to the investigation and therefore nothing that he needed to know an unexplained officially concealed death of someone introduced into the investigation as its star negotiator quite irrespective of all the doubts that hed personally had about the strange man had to have some bearing on the case a bearing he had to discover if he and the others were to remain safe his problem was finding out without drawing undue attention to himself equally worrying was not knowing what was going to happen when he obeyed felicites telephonescreamed insistence to meet after this conference sanglier began the meeting by announcing that a europol pathologist was arriving to examine the school find the americans at once followed the lead burt harrison described the ambassador as devastated and disclosed that at that stage mrs mcbride hadnt been told for that reason he was asking for the complete media blackout imposed upon the personal contact to be maintained and extended harding added that foot and hand prints were automatically taken at every birth in america and that mary berns footprints were being wired for comparison hopefully within hours you had the conversation with the woman said harrison to claudine do you really think they would have mutilated the child like that claudine hesitated aware that all of them round the table were trying to push reality away with selfdeception clinging to the hope the toe did not belong to mary as they had tried to avoid admitting any sexual element in her original disappearance yes she said shortly wanting positively to shatter any false hope in addition to all the other opinions ive formed about her and theres no doubt of course that the person on the telephone is the woman seen by the eyewitnesses to pick mary up i think theres a dangerous clinical psychosis that makes her capable of extreme violence she allowed another pause and this mornings find answers your question anyway it isnt an adults toe if it isnt marys it belongs to another youngster one we dont yet know about whos been maimed by the same people whove got mary if theyre prepared to maim theyre prepared to kill she focused on burt harrison which puts our chances of getting mary beth back alive even if we comply with every demand at less than fifty per cent horrified silence enveloped the room even the three clerks behind smet came up from their notebooks and recording machines to look at her shocked why wondered claudine was it so difficult for everyone most of them supposedly trained criminologists to accept the likeliest outcome of this investigation i dont think the ambassador should be told this said the american diplomat his voice wavering neither do i agreed claudine severing the toe was to force the ambassador to talk to her sanglier reminded them can he is he up to it he says he is replied the us head of mission doubtfully again looking directly at claudine he added should he in view of what youve just said without any question answered claudine at once his not doing so would put mary in enormous danger thered certainly be another body part what can your involvement be now a conference call with me on an extension alongside mcbride replied claudine hopefully i can guide everything he says avoid the wrong response marys safety could depend upon something as small as that one wrong word one wrong reaction jesus said harding smet was as staggered as everyone else by the assessment although for totally different reasons the psychologist was so close actually appeared to know their thoughts are you up to it dr carter demanded harrison pointedly if i didnt believe that i was i would have withdrawn responded claudine at once conscious of both poncellet and jean smet frowning between her and the american to have done anything else would have risked marys safe recovery harrison blinked at the rebuke trying to recover he said in sudden exasperation all we want to do is pay the money and get her back they havent specifically asked for money she reminded him and dont forget that in my opinion money wasnt what they took mary for in the first place can we talk about yesterdays conversation intruded smet anxious to fill the gaps in what he knew he patted the dossier in front of him weve got a transcript but no interpretation there was a hesitation between claudine and harding who had had a brief telephone conversation that morning to discuss connected aspects of the tape at claudines gestured invitation harding said in the original recording before our people enhanced it there was a lot of distortion we didnt understand now we do she used a mobile phone and drove around all the time the sound dips and interferences are caused by her going under bridges or through highly built up bad reception areas enhanced its easy to detect the noise of traffic in the background it lasted a long time you couldnt trace it demanded poncellet not yesterday admitted harding uncomfortably the equipment we had was to locate a landline approach overnight weve installed scanners for both analog and digitalized systems our people are hoping itll be analog theyre easier unfortunately most new systems are digital can your technicians guarantee a location asked smet at once im told itll be practically impossible if she keeps moving further conceded harding the hope is to get a number which will be difficult if shes routing through any of the iridium or globalstar satellites to poncellet he said before shes due to call tonight we have to set up numbertrace arrangements through belgacom and the major mobile phone companies and satellite servers and have a lot of people on instantresponse readiness if we get a fix now that the contact method has changed were scaling down our email monitor at the embassy to have most of our washington people on standby it had been hardings first command decision hed talked with claudine before issuing it and was still uneasy despite her assurance that it was probably safe peter blake said a copy of the tape went to europols forensic laboratories last night for positive voice analyses at the moment dr carter is guessing that the woman is a french speaker not flemish the backpack has gone for all the forensic tests too im not hopeful of anything being found from people as organized as these what about the actual contents of the tape dr carter asked the belgian lawyer hopefully more than enough confirmation of the arrogance id already suggested said claudine the entire tone virtually every word is taunting take identifying herself as mercedes for instance and theres very clear reference to sex in all the remarks about what mary is learning the most worrying phrase particularly after this mornings backpack find is when she gloats that shes not sure she wants to give the child back whats the overall picture queried a subdued andre poncellet claudine considered the question for some moments the woman were looking for is suffering an extreme psychosis she is accustomed to achieving absolute and total control over everyone around her but is in fact on the very edge of losing it over herself and she is as ive already said capable of extreme violence it was thought smet a superb characterization of felicite galan he said would you say she was insane without any doubt very seriously mentally ill agreed claudine what a layman would definitely call mad hugo rosetti collected claudine at police headquarters and on the brief journey to the mortuary he said its been difficult to get in touch ive been very busy so you said when you finally called you sure youre all right a lots happened ill tell you about it later happened personally or happened professionally he pressed professionally of course what else almost too stridently defensive she thought ive missed you ive missed you too hows flavia why the hell had she said that it was pointless he took some time to answer the same as always hows it worked out with blake hes very professional no personal problems none the main autopsy room was obviously unnecessary for such a small article instead they used one of the small side laboratories in which immediate tests were carried out during full crimevictim postmortems and didnt completely robe up just putting on protective aprons and gloves claudine had watched the italian work before thered been eight dismembered corpses in the serial killing investigation and was impressed again by the finesse even with a body part like this rosetti had a series of pictures taken a selection against measuring graphs and others under magnification by a waiting photographer before studying the toe under even greater magnification he scraped on to separate slides from beneath and on top of the nail before slicing a selection of surface skin on other slides on to yet more he smeared the invisible result of several swabs only after completing all his surface examinations did rosetti take prints for later comparison with those due to arrive from america later that day he carefully cleaned away every vestige of dye before finally making a deeper incision for tissue samples within the toe itself claudine was conscious of although not offended by the smell anything you want me to do he asked without looking at her on their earlier case shed sometimes asked for tests beyond his to help her profile no said claudine do you have a precise time of what was obviously the threat to do something like this in the telephone call five sixteen in the evening replied claudine at once and the time this was found seven this morning how old exactly is mary beth ten years and four months build small for her age the tests will take me a while ill wait claudine stripped off the protective clothing and perched on a stool just inside the door watching him work he was completely absorbed seemingly unaware of her presence muttering the verbatim record of what he was doing into the recorder strung around his neck and pinned out of the way against his chest had last night the entire time shed spent with peter on the inquiry affected her feelings for hugo there was a newness an excitement about peter and what hed done in ireland and its appalling cost was incredible but there surely had to be more than exciting novelty fuelled by awed admiration remaining strictly objective claudine didnt think her feelings went beyond that which wasnt of course saying they wouldnt she didnt want to search now for the answer to a question she didnt know claudine decided it was too soon but it wasnt sex if shed wanted sex she could have got it from any one of the dozens who regarded europol as a harem she was lonely claudine acknowledged with knowthyself honesty lonely and too often sad fed up not living a proper life using work as a substitute to subjugate everything else that was what john norris had done she didnt want a man to think for her or decide for her or protect her she could do all of those things by herself she wanted she didnt actually know what she wanted not fully all she knew was that she needed a personal life very different from what it was at the moment because at the moment it was nonexistent outside work she was nonexistent last night she hadnt been she became aware of rosetti crossing the small room towards her unpinning his microphone as he walked theres one thing that im sure about announced the man it was a professional amputation not hacked off by an amateur so one of those youre looking for is a doctor or surgeon which could narrow down the records search rosetti nodded well need the confirmation of the footprint obviously but i dont think the toe belongs to mary in dimension and length i think it belongs to someone older certainly not a child just gone ten who is small for her age according to your time frame if it came from mary the amputation occurred within the last fifteen hours theres far more than fifteen hours decomposition in the toe ive just examined there was a noticeable smell of putrefaction even before i put a tissue sample under the slide id estimate death four or five days ago mary could have been dead that long claudine pointed out i know said rosetti thats why we need the print confirmation but theres another guide we can get from the parents the nail was carefully manicured and kept there was no scrape residue at all from beneath it but i got a lot from on top traces of ethyl acetate and glycols copolymer both are constituents of nail varnish in this case extremely pale pink the parents can obviously tell us if they had marys feet manicured she was a pampered kid but i dont think she would have been that pampered said claudine it wont be necessary if the prints dont compare but ive naturally got sufficient skin samples for a dna match with anything we can recover from marys bed or clothing hair for instance and we could also make a comparison with the parents dna did the toe come from a dead body or from someone who was still alive asked claudine dead unquestionably so weve got a separate murder quite apart from whats happened to mary i could be wrong although i dont think i am said rosetti he wasnt there was no match at all with the print that arrived two hours later from washington felicite galan had insisted that jean smet and august dehane meet her that lunchtime at the comme chez soi on the place rouppe which theyd both initially welcomed because it was a public restaurant in which she could not openly berate them but they were immediately terrified when she arrived felicite again had her hair in the tight chignon of the day of the abduction and was wearing the same jacket that had been described in the wanted posters and appeals she strode from the entrance exaggerating her walk like a models catwalk parade and didnt immediately take the waiters offered chair smirking down at the lawyer and the telephone company executive why not hide beneath the table she said sit down for gods sake smet spoke in a fierce whisper please added dehane smet waited for the waiter to leave youre mad she said youre mad and you are totally insane and you disobeyed me both of you all of you you sent charles to kill her didnt you no smet said keeping to the rehearsed story theyd agreed with gaston to follow you know what charles is like and hes getting worse has been for months how could we have known what he was going to do protested dehane unconvincingly youre a liar youre all liars none of you are to go near her any more i dont want to go near her at all said smet dehane said nothing im not sure that ill let any of you even when we have the party she wished there was a greater penalty she could impose hurt them disgrace them in some way that wouldnt involve her claudine knows all about you declared the justice ministry lawyer knows what sort of person you are its frightening how accurately shes described you did she really say i was mad yes said smet petulantly and shes right you are tell me everything ordered felicite theyve excluded me announced smet dramatically the bastard poncellet how theyre staging a big operation at the embassy for your call to trap you the others would have accepted my being there as a matter of course but poncellet made a fuss about its having nothing to do with liaison said id get a transcript later for the ministry id have drawn too much attention to myself if id argued against it to trap me echoed felicite looking to dehane i hope youve got the phone ready dont do it pleaded the man ive no idea what sort of tracking equipment theyll have but its bound to be state of the art felicites hand was already outstretched she snapped her fingers and said give it to me reluctantly dehane passed over the instrument whose number is it she asked a director of a restaurant group his phone was stolen from his car two nights ago it hasnt been recovered yet excellent said felicite dropping the mobile into her satchel handbag now i need to know everything mats happened she paused but most of all i want to hear her opinion of me chapter nineteen only claudine saw a twisted contradiction in her guiding james mcbride in the rudiments of negotiation so soon after what she considered her disastrous attempt to talk john norris into compliant surrender she tried to drive the thought from her mind to drive everything from her mind except preventing the man from making any mistake in the telephone confrontation that was to come her first concern was that it should not be a public spectacle as it had been with her the previous day her attempted insistence that only she and mcbride be in the room was met with shouted objections from hillary to whom claudine had to concede everyone else was relegated to the communication centre and its audible twoway reception claudine briefed the ambassador in the sealed office too wanting him to become accustomed to the circumstances in which he had to conduct the conversation it was ludicrous to expect the man to be relaxed but claudine strived to achieve something as close to it as possible it didnt help having hillary there nor did the womans sneer that if mcbride became incapable she would take over there was no way claudine could know that mcbrides initially intrusive euphoria had almost as much to do with the death of his personal embarrassment along with john norris as it did with his learning the severed toe was not his daughters although the disclosure led to another brief dispute with hillary who complained that she hadnt been told that a toe had been found and demanded that in future she be informed of everything everything you understand the overexcitement made mcbride dangerously confident it was essential to bring him down to a manageable level of selfassurance without swinging the pendulum too far in the other direction and making him realize the real danger the amputation still represented to his daughter if the woman keeps to her timing which i think she will because its all part of her control syndrome in two hours time youll be speaking to the monster who snatched your child said claudine she used the word intentionally yes said mcbride claudine was pleased at the body language the way mcbrides lips tightened and he straightened in his chair a possible sex monster she said using the word again yes the voice was quieter someone whos maimed your child but weve avoided your first mistake declared claudine i dont want her to know weve discovered the toe isnt marys its part of her control it mustnt be taken away from her yet ok said mcbride doubtfully you hate her said claudine youd like to kill her wouldnt you mcbride blinked yes and if she were in the room with you instead of on the other end of a telephone youd probably try i would said the man and id do it i want her dead hed loosened his tie and taken his jacket off good said claudine pleased with the admission make yourself think hate i dont have to make myself you cant kill her though i will if i ever get to her but you cant not today no he conceded so what can you do to her today mcbride looked at claudine uncertainly what you tell me i suppose hed come down as far as she wanted use your hate to beat her she said how you negotiated a lot in business yes mcbride thought uneasily of his recent fear of norris how often did you lose a negotiation a few times did you ever hate the people you negotiated with of course not it was business what about those who beat you no ever lose your temper thats the way to lose negotiations claudine smiled exactly youre going to be talking to the woman whos got your child a woman you think of as a monster whos prepared to disfigure her and whom you hate but if for one single moment you allow that hate to come through lose your temper then youre going to lose mary beth show emotion plead cry beg but dont genuinely lose your temper and threaten to kill her like you did just now shes got mary beth to hurt you with youve got nothing except the words you use and the money youre prepared to pay and at the moment it comes down to words mcbride nodded in what claudine read as determination not despair for once hillary was listening too not trying instinctively to compete what do i do follow her lead let her be in control all the time only argue or oppose her when i tell you im going to be right here directly beside you if youre unsure let it show that youre unsure stumble to give me time to guide you will she settle it today demand a ransom and say how its to be delivered demanded hillary theres no way i can answer that replied claudine who didnt expect things to move that fast if i can talk long enough we might get a positional fix be able to get her back suggested mcbride claudine was worried the confidence was sinking below the optimum level youre the key you and what you say and how you say it mcbride stared at her swallowing all thoughts of his escape by john norriss death wiped from his mind ignoring hillarys presence he said ive never been so frightened in my life it doesnt matter at all if she realizes that claudine assured him now were going to do something youll probably think is ridiculous but isnt believe me what im going to be the woman whos got mary negotiate with me to get her back the embassy communications room was the focal point of the operation and claudine went to it an hour before the expected kidnap call needing to know what the backup was going to be one wall was dominated by a hugely magnified map of central brussels with linked adjoining charts spreading out into the citys major suburbs on each were marked the outwardly radiating waiting positions of thirty unmarked radiocontrolled cars and fifteen anonymous motorcycles ready to be dispatched in a pincer movement at the first indication of a route being established by the womans call when claudine got to the crowded room the cars and motorcycles were testing in turn for sound levels and interference each separately identified by a flashing light against its numbered designation on the central control panel in front of which sat three technicians all american one was slightly apart from the other two connected at a divided section of the control board not to the road vehicles but to two helicopters at that moment preparing to lift off from the nato military complex close to zaventem airport to be in a spotting formation directly over the city at the time of the anticipated call two replacements were being held at the base in case a contact delay encroached into the fuel reserves of the airborne machines there were two separate mobile telephone scanners both linked to roofmounted satellite dishes installed that day and each again operated by a threeman crew there was so much apparatus to record every spoken word and command if an operation were initiated that it had needed to be assembled in two banks one behind the other one man responsible for every two machines after a guided tour of the communication and tracking systems sanglier led a retreat out into the less congested corridor hows mcbride he said all right i think ive rehearsed him as much as i believe i safely can once he lost his selfconsciousness he did quite well his wife being there is a nuisance ill go to see if theres anything he wants announced harrison no said claudine he needs to be left alone and we dont have to be told what he wants said harding heavily what either of them wants claudine went back to mcbrides office fifteen minutes before the expected call mcbride was at the open cocktail cabinet the jack daniels bottle already in his hand he turned and said you want anything no said claudine and i dont think you should damn something else shed overlooked listen to her if you wont listen to me said hillary i can handle one i dont think you need it when he stayed with the bottle she said shed be winning before you even started to talk mcbride shrugged replacing the whiskey and closing the doors im ok i know you are i wish i knew it as well said the other woman youre not helping mrs mcbride said claudine in fact youre making things more difficult who the hell do you think youre talking to lets think about helping mary shall we said claudine refusing the argument what if she doesnt call she will the woman was too unpredictable for such a guarantee and claudine accepted shed lose credibility if there was no contact but mcbride couldnt be allowed any doubt she didnt like the nervousness obvious from his pacing round the study but said nothing hillary lounged contemptuously in a chair as he walked mcbride constantly checked his watch to calm him claudine sat easily in her already arranged chair positioned the special largefaced clock with the sweep second hand where they would both be able to time the call and then toyed reflectively with the prepared jotting pad before beginning to write a series of quick tomoff notes what are you doing demanded the ambassador to her relief he stopped moving there are things i can anticipate prepare for what things she would expect you to say i thought wed been through all that reminders said claudine its time shell make us wait how long as long as she likes but shell call he started walking aimlessly again claudine said itll be better if you sit down youve got to be ready mcbride completed a circle and came back to lower himself into his chair it was so large his feet only just touched the ground his hands were shaking and his forehead was sheened with perspiration there were three concealed call buttons on the left of the knee recess she wondered what they were for the clock was registering four minutes after the time of yesterdays call mcbride had got as far as shes not when the phone rang all three jumped mcbride more than the women claudine knew the transfer from the main switchboard would have already been delayed for a few seconds for the scan to begin mcbride stared at the instrument transfixed pick it up said claudine calmly mcbride did so hesitantly but remembered to look sideways to her so that both receivers came off their cradles together hello mcbride the voice was faint yes how do i know claudine mouthed you must tell me and the american repeated the words aloud whats granny mcbrides birthday asked the caller august second replied the ambassador at once and grandpas grandpas dead when did he die two years ago november there was a laugh overlaid at the end by outside traffic noise hello mr ambassador quickly claudine slipped across the first of her notes it read horror shes maimed your child mcbride said youve hurt mary badly please give her back so i can get her treated get her to hospital there was a pause at the other end claudine nodded approvingly to the man beside her the line had been open for almost two minutes shes been properly treated who by mouthed claudine by a doctor how shes not in any pain claudines second note read anger but not hatred frustration bastard said mcbride why i want to pay to get her back pay anything he was performing far better than claudine could have hoped i wanted you to know youve got to do everything i demand the line faded into silence and mcbride said urgently i didnt hear the lines gone demand or something worse will happen to her echoed down the line as the volume returned no protested mcbride unprompted theres no need to hurt her any more just tell me what you want and ill do it lets just end this we want two hundred and fifty thousand dollars announced the woman claudine had been making profile notes throughout she pressed down at the ransom figure so heavily the pencil point broke she switched to another angry at her overreaction important though the demand was hurriedly she passed another note responding to it mcbride said you can have it now tonight tell me how to deliver it and you can have it tonight so i can get mary back tonight four minutes claudine saw surely with the sort of technical equipment at the other side of the embassy they would have got a fix by now all in good time i cant have us walking into a trap i promise before claudines headshake registered with mcbride the woman cut him off i know that wont be true so dont lie you dont want mary coming to any more harm do you the man opened his mourn to speak but claudine held up a stopping hand mouthing her instruction im sorry i didnt mean im so desperate to get mary back stumbled mcbride obediently the volume collapsed into static almost six minutes noted claudine the words were indistinct when the sound came back then the voice said guess you didnt hear that i lost you too and hows the clever lady today i know youre there claudine the remark reverberated through claudines head like a pistol shot shed been right in thinking shed missed something but she wasnt missing it any more and the recognition was so astonishing that momentarily claudines mind blocked she was conscious of mcbrides startled expression and of his intention to speak and urgently shook her head she said im very well mercedes trying to be a clever lady yourself the laugh was uneven it was obvious youd listen in just as its obvious theyll be trying to trace this call thats why i wont be talking to you much longer could she do it she had to claudine told herself there was a risk but shed already made up her mind about the chances of getting mary beth back alive abandoning everything shed rehearsed with the ambassador she embarked on an approach shed considered at the very beginning were having the toe scientifically examined to establish if its from mary she held her free hand up against any interruption from mcbride your idea yes said claudine and ive got a lot more bite she thought desperately the clever psychologist imagining you know my mind claudine felt another sweep of disbelief oh i know your mind very well mercedes probably better than you know it yourself there was so much to think about considerations to weigh but later not now now her entire concentration had to be upon every nuance and word of this conversation youre a conceited fool claudine was pleased at the irritated edge in the womans voice one of us is mercedes she hoped the woman discerned the contempt she was trying to infuse into her voice every time she uttered the ridiculous assumed name didnt you hear the warning i gave mcbride about what would happen to mary if he annoyed me once more claudine shook her head against any interruption from the ambassador the door on the opposite side of the office opened softly but urgently without coming any further into the room blake gave exaggerated nods to indicate a location followed by one of the familiar rolling gestures with his hands for the woman to be kept on the line trying to make the sneer in her voice as obvious as she could claudine said you didnt actually say annoyed mercedes but then i guess youre confused im not at all confused broke in the woman dare she go on if she were right and claudine didnt doubt that she was there was another way a much more effective way for her to achieve what she wanted mcbride beside her was damp with sweat smelling of it its a common belief claudine said letting her voice trail at the same time she slid another prompt sheet to the man mcbride said let me speak to mary talk to her to know shes all right wheres claudine i want claudine claudine allowed the briefest of pauses aware of the satisfaction surging through her so much so quickly dismissively she demanded what whats a common belief what are you talking about quite irrespective of anything else theyd kept the woman talking for a further three minutes she had to be surrounded now on the point of arrest the ambassador wants to talk to mary you havent answered my question the only thing we need to talk about is the arrangement for getting mary back ill began the woman loudly but then stopped there was a sound as if the instrument had been hurriedly dropped and distant talking in french too indistinct to decipher but no police sirens or the shouts and yells claudine would have expected at a moment of arrest what started mcbride but claudine gestured him down for precisely four more minutes timed by the clock in front of them the indistinct talking continued claudine thought she detected a childs voice and from the disbelieving look on his face she knew mcbride had heard it too then there were sirens a screaming cacophony and the expected shouting began there was definitely at least one childs voice among the screaming before all the noise was drowned by the whuckwhuck of descending helicopters theyve got her said mcbride his voice trembling theyve got the woman and theyve got mary back come on shouted claudine already running towards the door way was made for mcbride and his wife to squeeze into the communications room alongside sanglier against the wall at the very rear the only sound the volume adjusted to be properly audible not deafening was relayed over an open channel that all could hear it was in french there was definitely a childs cry demands clearly from the arresting officers for the adults not to move and to keep their hands and arms visible one voice kept repeating a threat to shoot claudines first dip of uncertainty came with the sound of a mans voice close to hysteria demanding to know what was happening and pleading that no one shoot and of a child screaming hysterical too blake was beside her she leaned towards him and whispered its gone wrong he frowned back at her not replying she looked intently at poncellet on the other side of the blondhaired man it surely couldnt be the police chief she hadnt thought whom she could continue to trust until that moment hadnt thought about anything except her conviction now she did she thought about how they could use what shed learned and how she could keep mary alive and wondered how much easier or more difficult it made everything and she wondered who it was there was only a small possible number through all the confusion and conflicting impressions claudine abruptly felt very confident she couldnt risk telling anyone her biggest and most immediate problem was deciding whom she could tell about anything but for the first time almost since the investigation started she believed there was a chance of getting mary back alive just as she decided suddenly that mary was still alive if shed been dead it would have been marys toe in the backpack not someone elses claudine was briefly thrown off balance for just seconds by the implications of that awareness sickening but at the same time hopeful though it was im not sure i want to give her back yet ive become attached to her there could be another interpretation of that remark as obscene but not as lifethreatening as her first bizarre though it might be to a rational mind which she already knew the woman didnt possess but totally in keeping with the sexual deviancy of paedophilia claudine thought it more than likely that the unknown woman had fallen in love with mary beth mcbride which while posing a terrible sexual danger meant that she wouldnt for the moment at least be subjected to any other physical danger rather bizarre upon the bizarre that she would be protected from it poncellet leaned from claudines other side and said this doesnt sound right it isnt said claudine shes beaten us the family was brought to the us embassy because that was where the investigation was concentrated but long before their arrival there was an explanation of crushing disappointment there was no reason whatsoever for embarrassment or recrimination because the location operation had worked perfectly but there was a squabble of accusations between the belgian american and europol squads particularly among those whod first arrived at the supermarket car park in the ganshoren suburb of the city paradoxically hortense the daughter of horst and sonia eindicks was the same age as mary beth mcbride to within a day the family always did their major supermarket shopping on the last friday of every month when horst got paid neither parent could remember the mercedes parked next to them when theyd emerged to unpack their trolleys but hortense said she was sure the nice lady whod taken one of their trolleys instead of getting one for herself and given her the deposit money had yellow hair certainly none of them had seen her drop the telephone still connected to the embassy among the plastic bags in the back of the family ford and while we all went one way she went the other said poncellet bitterly harding paid double for the trolley coin to be sent for forensic analysis along with the abandoned telephone the eindicks family awed by the sensation in which they had become so innocently involved accepted apologies for earlier being terrorized it was not until the family was being escorted from the embassy that claudine had the opportunity to draw sanglier aside weve got to have a meeting but without poncellet she said urgently what about the person who knows whos got mary said claudine simply chapter twenty it didnt take long to organize after the departure of andre poncellet but there was a lot of questioning impatience from everyone particularly sanglier after claudines dramatic announcement sanglier demanded a preliminary explanation which claudine avoided by insisting that they needed complete transcripts as well as the tapes of both her conversations with the woman to understand her discovery unable to gauge how serious the leak was and with the bugging of her hotel room very much in mind she asked to remain at the embassy instead of returning to their police headquarters accommodation claiming it might no longer be safe that assertion heightened the drama and increased the demands the delay of transcribing and then copying the second tape gave time for rosetti and volker to arrive from the hotel both men made contributions to an investigation far beyond their individual disciplines but observing her know thyself dictum claudine acknowledged a determination to present something that would turn the entire investigation on its head to both hugo rosetti and peter blake she at once confronted the selfexamination it wasnt immaturity although maybe there was a small disturbing element it was instead the far deeper need after john norriss suicide to prove herself not just to two men to whom she felt emotionally attracted but to everyone else as well including herself she wanted to stage a performance almost literally in front of them all gain their plaudits she didnt like the awareness it was good cathartic that shed diagnosed it but she had to rid herself of it they used the cia quarters which meant lance rampling had to be included because of the possible political consequences claudine had considered including the ambassador as well and there was no doubt his larger office would have been far more comfortable however she decided it was unnecessary as well as wrong to cause mcbride and his wife any more distress hopefully burt harrison could assess the political repercussions far more dispassionately belatedly trying to minimize the stagelike appearance claudine did not actually sit behind ramplings desk but perched casually on its side edge even so as rosetti and volker finally entered sanglier said testily i hope you can justify all this mystery were supposed to be working with the belgians not against them claudine decided she could not have sought a better cue as theyre supposed to be working with us but someone isnt what that was harrison the people whove got mary are aware of every word weve spoken and every move weve considered making against them virtually from the start of this investigation the stunned disbelieving reaction came from harding how in the name of christ can you know that instead of replying claudine depressed the play button on the machine beside her into the room echoed her previous days exchange i want mcbride the woman im speaking on his behalf claudine the wife no ah the clever little mindreader claudine stopped the tape looked expectantly hopefully towards the men ranged in front of her rosetti had his head to one side frowning in what she thought was halfawareness blakes face was blank so were those of sanglier and harding harrison was looking to them for guidance rampling was still hunched over the transcript from which hed followed the replay there was a halfsmile on the face of the always laterally thinking volker claudine minimally rewound the tape for just one sentence ah the clever little mindreader its wrong declared claudine urgently she doesnt get mcbride whom she expects mrs mcbride is an outside possibility whom she doesnt get either and when i deny its mrs mcbride theres an immediate recognition ah the clever little mindreader not who are you not put me on to mcbride hes the only one i want to talk to no threats no arguments until much too late she was waiting for me claudine started the tape again we want to negotiate of course you do tell me about mary demanding but she doesnt demand in return insisted claudine she should have done had every reason to do so but she doesnt because she knows who i am thered been no public announcement of my being here whether i was male or female theres no way she could have known unless someone at the very highest level at our level told her she started the tape again continuing the conversation she accepts me without question plays word games about names needing to show me how clever she is wanting to be cleverer than me having to regain control there is an acceptance from the beginning said volker im not so sure disputed blake claudine rejected the first tape fumbling in her eagerness to replace it with the second she began it at the wrong section fast forwarded to where she wanted to be the clever psychologist imagining you know my mind echoed into the room claudine said theres been no public reference anywhere to a psychologist being part of the investigation and i said exactly that at one of our meetings that i was getting to know her mind and hows the clever lady today i know youre there claudine challenged rampling reading from the transcript he looked up it was obvious youd listen in just as its obvious thered have been a trained negotiator from the beginning hostage or kidnap negotiators are invariably psychologists its all intelligent reasoning its not intelligent reasoning that the negotiator would be female persisted claudine the more likely reasoning from a woman would be that a negotiator would be male i dont think thats logical said rosetti how many other women are there in this room demanded claudine going to sanglier then harding and finally rampling she said how many female psychologists are there in europol or the fbi or the cia why wasnt it as obvious to them as it was to her youre being sexist we arent said sanglier inadequately he didnt want her to be right didnt want to become embroiled in the alternative that she was suggesting it was too fraught with personal difficulties listen to todays conversation in full pleaded claudine really listen total silence enclosed the room and claudine didnt speak for several moments after the tape had finished finally she said whats wrong youre antagonizing her harrison suggested fatuously claudine refused the bait she challenged me at the very beginning announced that she knew id be listening in but hear how she loses control the last thing she wanted to do total anathema to her when i tell her i know her mind better than she does whats the significance of that queried sanglier she couldnt be right it wasnt possible yet at this mornings conference i said she was mad in laymans terms claudine reminded him someone suffering from her psychopathy will never accept that they are mentally deranged everyone else is mad not them todays call wasnt to taunt the ambassador or announce a ransom it was to argue with me prove to me that she wasnt mad yes i can see that said volker me too agreed rampling but for someone in the group to be involved would be blake began inconceivable finished claudine but why paedophiles perhaps more than any other criminal category come from across the widest spectrum of society more often than not theyre from the professional class look how clever theyve been with email and now mobile phones that points to an executive expertise they abandoned their email approach switched to telephones the moment i traced their route to menen which only our group knew id done volker pointed out heavily he added and they havent used it since how many in the control group could be involved demanded rampling eight replied harding at once poncellet and smet or any one of the six clerks whove been keeping records on a rotational basis three are women two of them blond remembered blake neither answers the description or looks anything like the videofit picture cautioned volker the source could also be anyone at police headquarters with a duplicate key to the incident room and all its records and transcripts suggested blake the transcript of this mornings meeting when i called her mad wont be in the incident room records yet claudine pointed out it can only be one of the eight if dr carters interpretation is wrong the fallout will be incalculable said sanglier how could a future justice minister answer for wrongly suspecting another justice ministry it was precisely the sort of embarrassment hed been warned about in paris on the other hand if her suspicions were right why did things become so difficult just when he imagined they were becoming simpler my function is to interpret words and behaviour claudine said slowly there are some interpretations of todays conversation that ive still got to suggest to you but the most important is my total conviction that there is an informer among us she was reluctant to challenge sanglier openly after the apparent relaxation of their earlier uneven relationship but she couldnt avoid it we surely cant risk the other incalculable whats going to happen to mary beth if my interpretation is correct he couldnt argue against her and he didnt want to go along with her sanglier thought desperately why had he stayed why hadnt he gone back to the hague immediately after resolving the problem of the suicide he would have been safe there able to claim that operational details had been kept from him if there was a disaster what are the other interpretations you mentioned asked harrison principally a further confirmation of what ive feared and warned against probably the biggest said claudine shes seen mcbride openly cry on television knows his desperation she knows too how rich he is that hell pay anything yet all she asks for is two hundred and fifty thousand dollars which is derisory no intention of giving mary back blake realized there never has been insisted claudine now for the first time weve got a real chance to prevent that happening our first real chance in fact to get her back but from now on our proper decisionmaking has got to be carried out like this just by us in this room our sessions at police headquarters have to be conducted solely to manipulate the woman and the people with her through whoever their source is we need to do more than that insisted harding presented at last with an operational opportunity therere only eight people to check out for christs sake and weve got an army looking for work endorsed rampling equally enthusiastic an american operation you mean sanglier said trying to keep any eagerness from being obvious weve been through the problem of legality harding pointed out i dont think the circumstances are the same any more were straying into dangerous water protested harrison as diplomatically uneasy as sanglier in effect in fact wed be spying upon and investigating justice officials of a sovereign state actually in their own country thats exactly what well be doing said the aggressive rampling intentionally changing tense and need to do can you do it demanded harrison of claudine manipulate a response wed recognize i mean very easily she assured him and with poncellet smet and at least three of the clerks at your meeting in the morning we know where more man half our suspects will be dont we smiled rampling i dont think any positive action should be taken until weve fully assessed dr carters success at the morning conference said harrison neither do i said sanglier anxious to support the reluctant diplomat i totally agree said harding not caring if the lie was obvious what was even more obvious was what he had to do as the operational commander by this time tomorrow sooner if possible he wasnt just going to know the favourite breakfast cereal of eight near strangers hed be able to say in which hand they held the spoon by the end of the meal claudine accepted she had been the only person with any real problem but believed she had lost it early enough for neither of them to have been aware of it blake appeared very much at ease and rosetti usually a reserved man matched his friendliness shed wished hugo hadnt been so territorially obvious cupping her arm and holding out chairs and unfolding dinner napkins twice shed caught the curiosity on blakes face they ate at the hotel at the request of claudine who pleaded exhaustion at the end of such a crowded day which was only part of the reason it would she decided make it easier to leave both men at the end of the evening there was only the vaguest of tensions each man competing to admire the profiling and analysis that had led to the breakthrough which neither doubted the more cynical blake was genuinely funny parodying the desperation of harrison and sanglier whod gone off alone to eat together to avoid any personal responsibility for whatever harding and rampling did lets just hope they do it well said claudine quickly cutting off the laughter blake didnt look at her when he pleaded tiredness to excuse himself as soon as the meal ended leaving her with rosetti claudine felt a sudden warmth and hoped she hadnt coloured that would have been ridiculous kurt told me about the american said rosetti im all right you sure i should have prevented it so youre not all right said the man ill be ok it would be wrong to blame yourself easy to say but true he wasnt your responsibility or your patient i said ill be ok i can function i dont want to analyse it any more she regretted the sharpness peters a nice guy yes you obviously get on well i told you we did she felt a sudden sweep of anger i remember im very tired im going to bed of course she expected it to be blake when her phone rang you didnt tell me about you and hugo theres nothing to tell it didnt look like that tonight we see each other but were not sleeping together why was she defending herself telling him that oh i really am tired how about lonely yes she said but no you sure quite sure she hoped she hadnt created an unnecessary problem for herself rosetti and volker were at the bar and both drunk when henri sanglier got back to the metropole the german emboldened by whisky invited him to join them but sanglier said he had calls to make things could really start to move tomorrow forecast volker carefully enunciating each word i hope youre right said the frenchman weve done our best volker assured him enigmatically i dont want to know in his suite sanglier remained undecided for several moments before picking up the telephone to dial francoise to whom he hadnt spoken since paris and hardly expected to reach now he was actually surprised when she answered almost immediately she appeared as surprised to hear from him there was noise music and people in the background instead of talking about paris which hed intended he said whats going on friends a party sanglier felt his throat block she was very bright excited chattering grownup birdsong it wasnt alcohol he didnt want to think what it was i said never the house you say lots of things get them out francoise theyre my friends how long has it been going on days who knows great fun im coming home lied sanglier i want everyone out before i get there dont be such a pompous shit why doesnt everybody stay so you can join us when you get back sanglier put the phone down but remained sitting on the side of his bed eyes tightly shut in despair what was he going to do dear god what was he going to do chapter twentyone the effectiveness of kurt volkers computer marauding enabled the enlarged fbi and cia surveillance operation to be in place by am through europols temporary incident room volker was officially part of the police headquarters system knowing its password so it wasnt even necessary to hack in from the us embassy to access its personnel files which had no protecting firewall against unauthorized intrusion the full printout of police commissioner andre poncellet included two photographs clearly taken some years previously but still sufficient for identification a prime requirement so volker digitalized both there were two listed addresses one within the city on the rue des commercants and what was clearly a summer house by the lake at auderghem from their dates of birth one daughter was twentyone the other twentyfour making it unlikely either still lived at home information about how many people were likely to occupy a property was another essential requirement volker switched from police headquarter records to its computer directory guessing the access code to the justice ministry would be registered which it was so he didnt have to hack an entry there either as with police personnel every ministry file held two subject photographs full face and profile again he digitalized those of the six clerks as well as those of jean smet the rue de flandres was the only listed house for smet who was described as a bachelor with no dependants two of the europolassigned female clerks were married so were two of the men each of the four had schoolage children only the unmarried man lived outside the city close to the astrid park in anderlecht to each of the eight targets paul harding assigned a sixman squad with two floating operatives for any unforeseen development or emergency the necessary forty additional agents twenty from the fbi twenty from the cia had been embarked at washingtons andrews air force base before volker completed his computer searches with them they brought the bibles and literature to support the textbook cia cover of overseas jehovahs witnesses or mormon missionaries if they mistakenly approached a still occupied foreign household the am deployment of each team was designed to avoid that risk which it did in every case by recording each departure against the likely remaining occupancy of premises to be burgled and searched after the target left for work at that exit the watching team split three detaching to maintain the physical surveillance three remaining to enter the house or apartment after determining it was empty each of the fortyeight officers fifteen of them women were equipped with volkers computerhijacked personnel printouts with their essential recognitive photographs all the clerks left their homes roughly within fifteen minutes of each other for their am ministry start three dropped their children off at school the wife of the fourth male clerk left separately in her own car with their two children the apparently unoccupied houses of the bachelor male clerk who lived at anderlecht and the unmarried female whose rented home was on the rue pieremans were the first to be entered both were telephoned first to ensure they were empty the others were burgled as their occupants left during the course of the day the last not until pm all the burglaries were to an established pattern two agents entering while the third the spot man remained outside to warn of any unexpected return jean smets house was broken into at am fifteen minutes after he left for the ministry and that mornings meeting of the control group the team assigned to andre poncellet had to wait until pm an hour after his wife left for her luncheon club meeting they had to wait an extra half an hour for the departure of the nonresident housekeeper whose earlier arrival theyd noted the police commissioners home was the only one equipped with a burglar alarm although it was not set no house had any dogs although there were cats in three one with a litter there was only one hurried exit at an unexpected return that of the wife of a clerk living on rue brogniez it was achieved without panic or discovery through an already opened rear door and along an already reconnoitred side path the establishment of an escape route was always the first step in the strictly regimented and wellrehearsed entry routine the sweep was conducted from the very top the loft if there was one and descended to the basement before the search of any room began it was photographed from four different angles by polaroid with one operator checking the other at the completion of the examination to ensure every article piece of furniture picture drawer ornament vase book magazine or newspaper was replaced precisely in the position in which it had been before they started any letter or document they thought might have the slightest relevance was photographed with a more sophisticated camera fitted with a proxile copying lens so were all bank and financial records and every address book all pictures photographs bureaux and furniture that might have concealed hiding places were moved particularly in lofts and basements listening devices were installed in every telephone and in the light fittings and skirting boards of every room the primary objective was obviously anything sexual of any nature whatsoever all videos were run for their first five minutes on the available television screens there were two soft porn videos at the home of one of the married male clerks and three more hard core at the anderlecht house of the unmarried man there were also twelve sex magazines all the videos and the magazines portrayed heterosexual sex in every case the floating agent on standby outside each house ferried the videos back to the us embassy and waited while kurt volker made instant copies the unmarried female clerk had two vibrators one black in her bedside cabinet and a selection of soft porn male magazines duncan mcculloch and robert ritchie carried out the search of jean smets house it was immaculately kept every shirt folded in its drawer every shoe on its tree no dust or fallen flower petal anywhere they took particular care with their polaroid record and with the loaded hochner pistol they briefly removed from the bedside table so cleverly was it concealed that mcculloch almost missed the safe only at the last minute lifting the corner of the bedroom carpet that had been extended to cover the bottom of the wardrobe to see its edge sunk into the floor he shouted the find to ritchie who continued his search while mcculloch hunched over the safe stethoscope microphone against the combination box it was hardly necessary like nine out of ten people smet had used the date month and year of his birth all of which mcculloch had from volkers printout for his security the safe was empty apart from a selection of pornographic photographs all featuring children predominantly boys and two videos one of the videos was the acquisition from amsterdam that smet had shown felicite three days earlier it was only after hed hurried it off to the rue du regent that mcculloch located his partner in the basement i got two paedophile films and a lot of stills announced mcculloch ritchie didnt turn too intent on the photographs he was taking and this original coal cellar has been converted into a cell with a metalgrilled door he turned but mary beth isnt in it that mornings gathering was the last at which the identity of the informer remained unknown there had been a brief preliminary meeting at the american embassy at which claudine had argued that neither poncellet nor smet and certainly none of that days clerks would know she was twisting her assessment of the previous evenings telephone conversation the others also agreed not to question the unexpected result of the overnight forensic and number check on the mobile telephone unless poncellet drew attention to it at police headquarters smet again asked for the actual conversation to be played following it from the prepared transcript coming up to claudine enquiringly the moment it finished shes panicking responded claudine easily dumping the telephone as she did clearly indicates that and shes frightened of me personally the whole conversation is directed against me not the ambassador and she hasnt got a clue how to arrange a ransom i didnt think you believed there was ever any serious intention of getting a ransom pressed smet what i doubted was her intention of giving mary back corrected claudine to have got away undetected with a ransom would have been her ultimate victory she wont get that now shell abandon the ransom idea if she doesnt go ahead with the ransom theres no reason to maintain contact is there said poncellet claudine wished the policeman hadnt asked the question although there was an opening to continue the goading it was always the most worrying possibility i never imagined she would collapse so quickly or so easily you dont know that she has persisted poncellet i do said claudine she was uncomfortable offering wrong assessments more immaturity she recognized it wasnt a wrong assessment it was an absolutely correct procedure to achieve a very necessary objective the doubt was whether she would succeed in doing so was there anything in the scientific examination of the telephone asked smet blake said nothing it was stolen in ghent seven days ago a blank there then said poncellet for a further five hours that single remark focused the suspicion upon the police chief in front of whom were set out the findings including the one obvious but seemingly unnoticed inconsistency of the mobile telephone company who had cooperated fully from the first moment of their being contacted once the number had been identified nothing that i can see to help us along said harding setting a fresh snare for the policeman who immediately appeared to fall into it by saying nothing so everything revolves around another telephone call said smet which shell be too frightened to make declared claudine there was nothing from the surveillance when they got back to the embassy although the hope of a possible discovery within six hours had been unrealistic the disappointment was nevertheless intense ive changed the entire strategy claudine explained to the doubtful burt harrison directly challenged her with being scared behaving like someone mentally unstable she wont be able to stop herself from responding i couldnt do your job said the diplomat i know you couldnt thought claudine aloud she said most times i dont enjoy doing it myself had that morning been another confidencebuilding public performance she certainly hadnt thought so until now and with no professional reason for him to attend hugo rosetti hadnt been there to witness it he hadnt come down for breakfast before shed left the hotel either it was four thirty before the courier hurried in with jean smets two tapes and a selection of the stills to be copied both were hard core paedophilia pornography harrison became visibly distressed halfway through the first film and openly protested at the need to watch the second in its entirety why he demanded to see if mary beth is featured said blake bluntly the man objected again when volker rewound both to replay them simultaneously the german ignored him exclaiming in satisfied triumph when he freezeframed both at the meaningless strip of letters and figures that preceded both performances what demanded claudine expectantly theyre identical volker traced his finger along each matching set of symbols its cryptography encoding data against unauthorized entry in this case itll be the details of the distributors its the newest and safest way for paedophiles to hide the current antihacking firewall wheres this going to take us asked harding to who they are and where they operate from to all the pornography theyve got on offer to see if mary is among those already featured volker hesitated nodding in renewed satisfaction and hopefully to their subscriber list to see who else in belgium particularly in brussels is on it as well as jean smet the illegal burglaries had been totally justified decided henri sanglier and all except that of smets house could remain undisclosed so he was in no careerobstructing personal danger in fact as the acknowledged head of the investigating force there would at the end of the case be a great deal of public recognition he said weve done extremely well im very pleased briskly actually moving towards the door harrison said we could have mary back by tonight ill tell the ambassador you wont snapped blake this is the beginning not the end and that could still be a long way off chapter twentytwo at first when they left the house felicite held tightly to marys hand but it was difficult for the girl to throw the bread to the screeching gulls hovering against the warm wind so felicite let her go the gulls swarmed very close and mary screamed and laughed although nervously finally hurling the remainder of the brokenup loaf in one shower to send the birds from her the sun was silvering the water and after so long in the basement mary still had her eyes screwed up against the brightness already there was some faint colour coming back to her cheeks isnt this nice said felicite she was completely recovered quite calm content even certainly much better than she had been after talking to smet then shed been so furious she hadnt even been able to think properly her mind jumping from one halfthought to another nothing in its proper order it was now as it always was everything worked out all the uncertainties resolved there was a lot to do despite all that shed already done since the previous day but there was no longer any hurry can i collect shells and things asked mary as the disappointed gulls at last left them alone dont go too far ahead there was nowhere mary could go but felicite was watchful two barges were passing each other in the centre channel of the schelde but felicite wasnt worried both were too far away to see any crew so she and mary would be just as distant tiny unrecognizable figures i like my new things and the ups said mary she was glad she could throw the old stained pair away and that the pain in her tummy had gone and there werent any more blood spots she wasnt sure the woman was telling the truth about her becoming a big girl the woman told lies you look beautiful the clothes had been the last things felicite had bought before leaving brussels the red sweater rollnecked with reindeer in a blue line across the front fitted perfectly but shed had to take the jeans up by one turn why didnt you let me come out here before mary was scurrying by the waterline turning over debris with a stick she wondered if mere was a road beyond the rising bank to her right she couldnt hear any traffic there was never time felicite could only just pick out the closest house nothing more than a dark shape on the horizon far ahead there was even less danger from that than from the barges but theyd still turn back soon she didnt want to tire mary and she was tired herself it had been late by the time shed got to luxembourg the previous night and shed had to drive hard to get back to brussels and do everything necessary there before coming to antwerp but it was all going to be worth it why is there time now im going to stay with you not leave you alone any more would you like that how wonderful magical to be with her for ever to travel just the two of them a fantasy felicite knew but one she could indulge in during the next few days a fantasy that would become her personal greek tragedy mary frowned up from her beachcoming how longs that going to be im not sure not yet a while she couldnt conceive what it would be like when it had to end refused to think about it all she wanted was for them to be together something beautiful she wouldnt let there be any pain shed have lascelles do it just a pin prick mary suddenly swooped crying out coming up triumphantly with her hand above her head a stone with a hole in it thats lucky is it back home solemnly the child held out her hand the stone was white waterbleached a present for you your own lucky stone felicite swallowed heavily thank you my darling ill treasure it she would for ever mary was so beautiful so utterly adorably beautiful can i go to see whats on the other side of the bank theres nothing just marsh can i go and look anyway there are mosquitoes i dont care stay down here mary detected the change in the womans voice knowing she had to stop it is nice being able to come outside i knew youd like it can we go somewhere else mary could see a house a long way off it looked dark shuttered the sun should have been shining off the windows but it wasnt what as well as here by the river go somewhere else for a walk well see id like to well see repeated felicite i think we should go back now weve walked a long way im not tired well still go back just a little further no there was that sound in her voice again i dont want to look for shells or stones any more were going back insisted felicite mary reached out for the womans hand when will i go home dont you like me marys hand was velvet soft pudgy fingers searching for hers yes now that you dont hit me i wont ever hit you again i promise she broke her promises when she felt like it remembered mary why did you before i made a mistake im sorry mary liked making her feel sorry there definitely wasnt any car noise from the other side of the bank so perhaps it was just marsh so when will i go home felicite walked for several moments without talking would you like to talk to your papa it was a new idea the bitch who thought she knew so much wouldnt expect that wouldnt expect a lot of what was going to happen she was a pisspoor psychologist believing she was frightened of her soon prove that was ridiculous can i can i said mary urgently what would you say about me now mary remained silent although not for as long as felicite i dont know nothing can i speak to him please why dont you want to stay with me mary flinched at the sudden harshness i cant stay with you for ever you know i cant would you if you could said felicite allowing the fantasy mary knew the answer was important yes if i didnt already have a mom and dad the simplistic logic blunted felicites irritation she wouldnt be giving in letting mary speak to her father shed be increasing the pressure an additional idea began to form they might try to stop you who people who are with your papa a woman her names claudine thats why its taken so long sometimes when i call she wont let me talk to him why not she wont believe its about you a lot of people are playing jokes on your papa calling and pretending to be you were not pretending i know tell her she must let me ill try if i do will you promise to tell her something for me what asked mary doubtfully something that might sound silly but shell understand all right they were close to the house now hopeful gulls swooped and called overhead a ship so laden with containers it seemed to have a city skyline was making its way slowly from the port towards the open sea it was still too far away for anyone to be visible but mary waved did you see anyone demanded felicite sharply no why did you wave mary shrugged because she stood in the middle of the patternfloored entrance hall watching felicite carefully lock bolt and test the huge front door are any of the others coming no when will they never felicite smiled of all the decisions shed made in the last twentyfour hours the one to abandon smet and all the others satisfied her the most i dont want to go back downstairs announced mary risking the defiance the telephone conversations would be in french there was no way the child would be able to understand felicite said if you stay upstairs youve got to be a good girl i will be you know what i mean by being a good girl dont you yes what not try to get away she was glad she hadnt run to the top of the bank shed intended to at first if you do try ill bring back the man i stopped hurting you to look after you again and ill leave felicite felt almost physical pain at the fear that registered at once on marys face so you will be good wont you she added hurriedly yes said the child quietly she tensed when felicite put her arm round her to take her into the huge room with the panoramic windows inside mary curled up in a large chair staring out over the river with her back to the room and felicite hans doorn said he was glad shed called to rearrange the postponed booking it was fortunate the house was still available hed arrange for it to be prepared before the arrival of her and her party and understood theyd be bringing their own staff if there was a change of plan he could fix local cooking and cleaning people felicite said there wouldnt be any change the luxembourg lawyer whom shed continued to use after marcels death and had briefed that morning said hed already started the chain in andorra and liechtenstein and hoped to complete with the confirmation in switzerland within three days he remained unsure whether the expense was justified but accepted it was her money and she could do what she wanted with it in the meantime now that shed confirmed the rental hed release the money transfer shed authorized and hoped shed have a good vacation felicite said she was sure she would pieter lascelles admitted being surprised by her moving into the antwerp house but didnt question it more immediately interested in the arrangements for what was going to happen what do you think about the identification he smiled quizzically what is it an english nursery rhyme i learned at school very appropriate you still bringing the same number of people yes you just me the surgeon didnt speak for several moments whats wrong im simply not including anyone your decision lascelles conceded ill probably be seeing a lot more of you in the future said felicite ill look forward to that in lille georges lebron responded as excitedly as lascelles i was becoming impatient he complained how many of you will there be ten as arranged said the man and a special guest of course throughout the conversations mary hadnt turned from the window felicite said ive got hamburgers im not hungry said the child sullenly her back to the woman hamburgers and then well telephone papa said felicite mary turned finally all right the outraged head of mission insisted upon summoning the young embassy lawyer elliot smith and that mcbride be told so theyd all transferred yet again to the ambassadors study taking mcculloch and ritchie with them mcbrides reaction was mixed like harrison he showed incredulous disbelief but he was quicker to recognize the restrictions of the discovery the bastard hes got to be arrested made to talk exclaimed hillary the reluctant elliot smith was once more thrust into the forefront as he had been during the original jurisdictional problem and again when norris had committed suicide it seemed he thought as if events had come full circle nervously apologetically he said in my opinion there is no official action that can be brought against smet theres probably a belgian law against possessing pornography featuring children there is in most eu countries but that information was gained illegally it cant form the basis for any formal investigation hes a lawyer hed know that what about the basement cell for christs sake demanded mcbride its a coal bunker with a strengthened door said blake it could be for burglar prevention from the street outside you absolutely sure hes in contact with whos got mary demanded hillary yes but i cant prove it said claudine ignoring her qualification mcbride said you telling me we couldnt sweat it out of the bastard thats exactly what were telling you said claudine pityingly hed have to be arrested to be interrogated weve got no legally obtained evidence for his arrest and hed know more than that hed know the only way he could face prosecution would be by admitting knowledge of marys captors so theres no way hed do that at this moment weve got a way through to them whoever and wherever they are wed lose all that even if we could persuade the belgians to pick him up mcbride thrust up from his desk stomping to the window overlooking the formal grounds and the avenue beyond no one spoke after several minutes without turning back into the room he said my kids out there somewhere with a bunch of perverts who could be doing god knows what to her we know who one of them is and we cant do a goddamned thing about it i just dont believe it said hillary in rare agreement with her husband no one wanted to reply claudine looked to sanglier uncomfortably the europol commissioner said i know it sounds absurd but we cant do anything not if we want to save her it is absurd but thats precisely what the situation is mcbride turned back into the room but he did not go immediately behind his desk instead he came to claudine which brings it all back to you dr carter to how well you can mislead him into showing her a direction and how well you can manoeuvre the woman without her realizing its being done not totally said harding every telephone and every room in smets house is wired he cant make or receive a call talk to anyone who comes there without our hearing every word and we know theres more than just smet and me woman hes bound to speak to the others when he does hell take us with him whats come from the house since the devices were installed challenged mcbride rampling shook his head not even an incoming call bitterly he added obviously a guy with a very limited circle of particular friends theres a point about that said mcculloch nodding sideways to his partner we combed that house gave it a second shake after wed found the pictures and the cell im sure we didnt miss anything there wasnt an address book not one he left lying around in the house anyway nor any personal letter just business stuff hell carry it with him guessed harding theres a damned great briefcase in all this mornings surveillance pictures the entire ring the woman herself are most likely in it said ritchie so how do we get it not easily said rampling but weve got to said blake the american looked sourly at him that so mcbride had gone back behind his desk and was listening intently gauntfaced to the operational discussion for once hillary was silent and theres his office added blake unembarrassed we dont have any wires there the justice ministry is an official government building protested harrison youre not suggesting you know damned well what hes suggesting and it sounds good to me snapped mcbride impatiently if anyone wants superior authority ive just given it and if thats not enough ill get it from the fucking president you got any problem with that no sir said harrison for the record sanglier supposed he should voice an official caution but this was a meeting where records were not being taken hed have to be very careful of the americans when he took up office in paris but then he reflected hed been careful about everything and everyone ever since he could remember it would be a relief just once to be able to relax a relief but impossible he said what are we going to tell poncellet nothing said harding shortly totally confident now as the overall american supervisor i dont imagine hed have a problem but he is the police commissioner and we are acting illegally we cant take the risk he wouldnt try to intervene in some way screw everything his house is bugged reminded sanglier we wont listen said harding still with two hours to go before the earliest the woman might call even if she kept to her roughly established schedule sanglier remained with mcbride and the chastened harrison when everyone else left with time to kill the rest moved without any positive decision back to the room made available to the europol group now that the embassy had become the focal point for the investigation the accommodation was actually a rarely used briefing room for both the cia and the fbi and slightly bigger although less comfortable than ramplings suite which theyd used previously it was also considerately at the furthest end of the corridor from where norris had killed himself the area remained behind canvas screens but cleaners workmen and decorators had moved in i guess weve just been given the carte blanche to stage a second watergate said mcculloch lets hope we do it better this time said harding anyone got any ideas we havent talked about the mobile telephone suggested claudine who didnt like moving on to new problems with others unsolved what about it asked mcculloch a newcomer to the inner circle the number belonged to the mobile of an accountant in ghent it was stolen six days ago the stop had only just gone through so queried ritchie it wasnt the same telephone dumped in the back of the ford said harding its a massproduced mediumpriced instrument used by belgacom as well as a couple of independent mobile companies why bother to transfer the number to another phone questioned mcculloch it doesnt make sense it must do to someone said rampling but who and why there was a flurry of movement at the doorway as a beaming volker hurried in from the adjoining computer room ive accessed the cryptograph entry code on the two paedophile videos he announced the company is trading out of amsterdam offering a whole range of pornographic specialities even animals can we get the paedophilia asked rampling already ordered volker assured him we thought there was a sex element in the serial killings there was but not what we thought but we established a home page supposedly of a subscriber in copenhagen through several illegal bulletin boards specializing in sex used it to close down quite a few outlets since ive ordered through there asked for anything new in the past fortnight they wouldnt have made anything featuring mary as quickly as this said blake one of the videos found in smets safe was issued seven days ago said volker its dated normally i dont have a problem with dirty movies but i guess this time i will said ritchie he became abruptly aware of claudine and blushed we all will if marys featured said rampling all the car motorcycle and helicopter intercepts were reestablished according to the previous days pattern claudine left the systems check just after it started less than an hour before the time of the previous days call and made her way to mcbrides study the ambassador was in shirt sleeves his tie loosened away from his desk hillary had changed from what shed been wearing earlier into a tailored safari suit action woman thought claudine mcbrides impatient shifting around the room was now stoked as much if not more so by the frustration of not being able to move against jean smet as by the obvious nervousness at least he was ignoring the cocktail cabinet and the jack daniels bottle claudine sat at once as she had before trying to quieten the man by her own calmness which she didnt have to force it had to be frustrating for mcbride double torture but it couldnt be much longer now disaster was still only one misplaced word away but claudine didnt think there was a risk of her uttering it the pendulum swung abruptly worryingly she wouldnt say the wrong thing but mcbride had sat in on a lot too much of their operational discussion and he knew about jean smet it was possible likely even that unconsciously hed blurt something hurriedly she said please remember what i said yesterday no hate no aggression and dont respond to any challenge as soon as you can switch the conversation to me im the person she wants to confront are we talking about mary or some private fight between you and the fucking woman demanded hillary a private fight between me and the fucking woman responded claudine ive got to be the person her angers directed against all the time who shes trying to humiliate not mary mcbride stood forlornly before her gripping and ungripping his hands i feel so he began helpless she finished i know but were not not any longer tell me youre going to get her back she shouldnt lie couldnt lie if she was going to retain her integrity im going to get her back ill destroy you if you dont you wont have to i will have destroyed myself and threats dont achieve anything ambassador he didnt apologize its time shell definitely make us wait today why to prove all the things she needs to prove to herself maintain her imagined control why late why not early that would have the same effect of disorientating us said hillary claudine shook her head that would make her seem too anxious she cant ever let herself appear to be that nothing touches you protested mcbride abruptly if only you knew thought claudine she wasnt surprised at his wanting to hit out at someone find a focus for the impotent anger she said i couldnt do my job if i allowed myself to become personally involved none of us could the investigators i mean you ever doubt yourself said hillary stop it claudine thought i cant allow that either mcbride looked at the large secondsweep clock reestablished on his desk shes almost thirty minutes past schedule she has her own design not a schedule im not sure how much longer i can go on you can go on as long as it takes to save your daughter insisted claudine forcefully if you cant i will challenged hillary nothings happening this is reality not a movie with people and cars going round in circles that hardly made sense claudine conceded that was precisely what theyd done yesterday but others not mcbride he just had to sit and wait im sorry said mcbride what for saying id destroy you i didnt mean it i know she welcomed his uncertain smile hed stopped moving around the room been able for the briefest moment to put out of his mind what was happening what they were waiting for shes an hour late shes making us suffer she has to how much is she making mary suffer said hillary fuck thought claudine angry at her carelessness were going to get her back in what sort of physical condition she couldnt allow the selfpity to go any further alive it halted him he began stopstarting around the room again stretching his fingers as if they were cramped you havent written out any prompts i can do it quickly enough when she calls i forgot to ask you if you were all right now said mcbride belatedly solicitous im fine it was terrible he wanted to transfer his anguish on to her yes did you think you were going to die i knew it was possible she said cautiously what do you think about feel like imagining youre going to die the wrong direction claudine quickly recognized children as young as mary dont think theyre going to die death is beyond their imagination i cant begin to think what shes suffering dont try urged claudine shes strong you dont know what she is by now none of us do we cant mcbrides wanderings had fortunately brought him close to the desk when the telephone sounded again the three of them jumped claudine held up a slowing hand as the man darted round the desk he snatched his receiver up slightly ahead of her there was momentary blankness then dad mcbride retched honey he managed coughing claudine kept moving her hand trying to slow him down its me let me speak to her demanded hillary i know oh honey said mcbride i want to come home dad the effort to get hold of himself shivered through the man i want that too honey the volume was uneven and a blankness came after every exchange claudine noted two minutes had passed according to the clock why havent you fixed it then the petulance was immediate angry are you and mom fighting hillary was in front of her husband beckoning demands no honey were not fighting claudine gestured the woman back to mcbride she mouthed let her tell me how and when the man repeated it word for word mary said you must do everything she says perspiration was streaming down mcbrides face now soaking his shirt i will i promise i will how are you honey tell me how you are all right a brief blankness then is claudine there hillary actually tried to snatch mcbrides phone he physically slapped her away hello mary said claudine i dont like you why not not letting me speak to dad hes here you can speak to him now four minutes she saw what mary had said was important not today before satisfaction surged through claudine do you want to speak to mummy shes here too ive got to tell you something its to the still demanding hillary claudine shook her head and mouthed no aloud she said i think youre being a very brave girl i silence tiny fingers come after tiny toes the child blurted mcbride squeezed his eyes shut in despair claudine felt perspiration prick out on her face youre very pretty ive seen lots of pictures of you thank you said mary and for the first time claudine guessed the reply had been unprompted there was a gap before mary said ive got to go claudine gestured against the frantic protest she saw mcbride about to make anxious for a response she could identify from her hopeful manipulation of smet claudine made the sigh like the contempt as obvious as she could in her voice so she isnt going to talk herself just through you im not surprised oh yes i am going to talk came the womans voice harshly why shouldnt i want to talk mcbride surrendered the phone but hillary didnt speak i can think of a lot of reasons you think im afraid of you confirmation of the smet conduit thought claudine triumphantly arent you you know what youve just done youve just cost mcbride another two hundred and fifty thousand thats my new price half a million and youll never guess the good use its going to be put to not much of a negotiator are you how do you want it paid said claudine evenly refusing any reaction arrangements are being made im sure said claudine disbelievingly seven hundred and fifty thousand declared the woman youd better watch your mouth every time you say something i dont like im going to fine you how much longer said claudine with another sigh psychologically she had to press the woman as far as she could and she was as confident as she could be that the woman had developed a bizarre love for mary ill tell you when im ready its taking a long time like this conversation claudine thought ten minutes without any indication from outside that the scanners had traced the signal the newspapers say mcbrides a friend of the president but i dont believe it claudine frowned unsure of a response go with it she decided why not theyd have sent someone better than you if he was really important the almost juvenile desperation was unsettling maybe its you who arent sufficiently important she said you really do have to watch your mouth were up to a million now why not collect it you havent suffered enough yet maybe mary hasnt either mary beth broke in hillary at last but there was no response from the other end just before it went dead she and claudine heard marys distant muffled shout please dad please mcbride looked at claudine his face purple with rage you stupid bitch you made her hang up i hope it was because of me and not the sudden interruption from someone she didnt expect said claudine furiously confronting the woman she said mrs mcbride you could have just killed your daughter chapter twentythree jean smet was the way to bring the woman back only if she failed to respond would hillary mcbride have caused a catastrophe by confronting her with something for which she hadnt been prepared and claudine regretted her outburst against the ambassadors wife hillary and mcbride were literally eyeball to eyeball after claudines accusation screaming abuse at each other claudine shouted shut up shut up and start thinking properly about mary beth the fresh outburst silenced both of them claudine said its recoverable the important thing is that ive become the person she hates the person towards whom all her hostility is directed now and today i was coming very close to gaining control without her knowing it making her do what i want which is seriously to attempt a ransom ive challenged her doubted that shes capable if todays call didnt start out to fix a ransom what was it for demanded hillary wanting to recover from her mistake she wants mary to hate me as much as she does you heard what mary said about not liking me and her reply when i asked her why with perfect recall claudine quoted not letting me speak to dad not today before shes transferring the blame in her own mind and trying to do the same in marys for whats happened to mary shes trying to bond the child to her make mary like her you mean asked mcbride incredulously how the hell can she do that i didnt say she could do it i said thats what shes trying to do paradoxical though it seemed it was psychologically possible particularly with someone impressionable for a victim to become emotionally dependent upon a captor what about the fingers and toes remark persisted the father thats to alienate you from me continue the attack upon me claudine assured him she wont maim someone she wants to like her why is she doing that i dont understand protested hillary shed spare them by not talking about love its the way her mind works claudine was momentarily surprised to see hugo rosetti with everyone else in the briefing room when she reentered he smiled fleetingly and just as quickly she smiled back blake expressionless watched the interchange what happened to the scanners demanded claudine at once the transmission was too far away thats why the volume fluctuated so much said volker they couldnt get any sort of fix although they dont think she was moving around the way she did yesterday for poncellets benefit claudine summarized to its minimum but still accurately the complete profile shed given to mcbride to get rid of the police chief she said she needed to assess the womans mental state before they held another planning meeting and the moment poncellet left the embassy peter blake gave them his explanation for the mobile telephone number they didnt have the telephone he said only the number knowing it was stolen so they had to get an instrument to programme it into jesus said harding the simplest answer is always the best said rampling in immediate agreement it was too obvious for us to see so whod have access to stolen numbers asked harrison anxious to contribute too many people said blake belgacom the brussels manual exchange the mobile phone company thats not the way to find them said claudine we can make whoever it is come to us through smet all hes got to believe is that weve got a lead to him his own fear will do the rest how demanded harrison we give smet the same reason we gave poncellet for not meeting again today but add that theres an even more important development with the phone as well hell immediately warn whoever it is hes waiting in his office said rampling hell do it from there and we dont have it tapped we force him home said blake at once when we speak to him in his office we say that theres something important about the phone but that were not sure what it is forensic havent yet spelled it out and promise to call him at home tonight if its really important which well do smets telephones interrupted volker do they have dials or are they push button push button said mcculloch volker gave a satisfied nod its not possible to trace the number of an incoming call on a bugged telephone but it is when a number is rung out each number on a push button phone has a different electronic signal thats how the system works tonally and smet will dial out to speak to whoever it is wont he as soon as he does well have him rampling said and itll be someone in belgacom not the mobile company added the german a technical expert with access and ability far beyond phones thats who set up the email exchange in the beginning this is coming together enthused rampling whos going to make the bastard dance asked harding rampling looked at sanglier youre the task force head the senior investigatory officer he couldnt argue against my decision to cancel agreed sanglier alert to a safe advantage he was already committed as far as the illegality was concerned so hed hardly be enmeshing himself further and later when that illegality became acceptable he would have done something positive definitely involved himself in the investigation a lot of worthwhile publicity could be worked up for his political emergence hed be the only justice minister in the world personally to have headed the investigation into a famous crime and the fame would be his not inherited from his father jean smet responded at the first ring the respectful tone discernible as soon as sanglier identified himself sanglier spoke autocratically a police commander complying with a liaison agreement but not inviting a protracted discussion it had been his decision not to have another meeting dr carter thought there was a lot to be gained from that afternoons exchange and theyd just been warned by forensic officers of something potentially vital he actually used the word breakthrough about the telephone that had been abandoned the previous day something that could lead to an arrest asked smet they havent been specific we wont know until later tonight maybe not even then we hope to have something definite by tomorrow sanglier was enjoying himself knowing from the expression on the faces around him that he was doing well if its really important the minister would want to know immediately tonight sangliers pause for apparent consideration was perfect if its as vital as they think it is i could have someone call you at home he allowed another hesitation do we have your home number harding and rampling smiled nodding in open approval as the lawyer hurriedly dictated it repeated it and then asked sanglier if he was sure hed noted it correctly the minister really will be most anxious to hear at once emphasized smet ill see youre called if theres anything said sanglier dismissively replacing the telephone ahead of the other mans gabbled thanks now what said harrison we wait said blake they didnt have to for very long anything a mans voice strained without any identifying greeting nothing harding made a thumbsup gesture to the other smiling american it was only fifteen minutes after the first sounds of the homecoming jean smet the front door had slammed two more opened without being closed thered been the scuff of his moving from room to room the tinkle of a decanter against a glass a lot of coughing and throat clearing maybe they called while you were on your way from the office call them back i dont even know where theyll be the hotel try the hotel i cant ive got to wait for them what in the name of god can it be it was practically a whimper there was no movement in the communications room almost everyone physically leaning towards the speaker claudine sat directly in front cramped against the operator making notes i dont know what can i do theres nothing nothing either of us can do its her fault everythings her fault we should have disposed of the kid the day she picked her up youre blocking the line if theyre trying to get through smet said dont call me why not antoinettes here its difficult then how can i ill keep calling you when its convenient here damn said blake quietly rampling shook his head in frustration you heard from the others asked smet no you she called as usual after this mornings conference said they hadnt got a clue what they were doing she wasnt at home when i telephoned her later about this there was a snort of derision then ive got to go antoinettes coming no one spoke for several moments after the line went dead through the speaker came the noise of decanter against glass again claudine revolved her swivel chair to face the halfcircle of men rampling said its so close i feel i could reach out and touch it more practically blake said it could be the driver whoever the man is hes not the one whos holding mary said claudine hes got a wife or a partner antoinette who doesnt know whats going on and they have fallen out its something to concentrate on weve got to get a wire in that bloody office said harding how long would it take asked claudine minimum maximum mcculloch shrugged seconds to stick a microphone with an adhesive base where he hopefully wouldnt find it five minutes tops to put something inside the phone like weve done at his house wed put pressure on her if we broke the routine of his always being available in his office when she calls said claudine reflectively from behind her there were short bursts of noise as smet clicked his way through television channels and then the crackle of static as he roamed radio frequencies in an equally unsuccessful search for a news programme thats tomorrow what about tonight demanded sanglier you did warn there might not be anything until tomorrow harrison reminded him theyd be frantic by then said rampling smet tried to call her from the office claudine pointed out hes almost bound to try again as soon as he hears from us we shouldnt wait decided sanglier blake made the call smet actually dropped the receiver in his anxiety to pick it up repeating yes every few seconds to urge the explanation on you think you can trace who it is he demanded itll be timeconsuming but weve got the manpower blake said its our first direct and positive line were going to get him and through him everyone else the minister will want to know how soon smet pressed blake said we could have it all wrapped up in days by this time tomorrow we could be well on our way claudine made cuttingoff gestures and blake said were setting things up now speak to you tomorrow they waited tensely silently at once smets telephone was lifted a digit within minutes isolated as the first number of the brussels code was punched before the handset was replaced it was lifted within seconds and pressed again before once more being put down come on come on hissed rampling make the fucking call everyone jumped when smets telephone rang the overamplified sound echoing into the room shit exclaimed blake anything the same voice as before theyve worked it out what shouted the man his voice breaking smet even used some of blakes exaggerated words and phrases the other man never once interrupted not until the end did he say thats it all of it blake said it was a simple process of elimination ive got access to the numbers sure but im much too senior ever to bother to look at them there are dozens hundreds more likely man me and the phones arent traceable to me either you think youre safe the laugh was genuine unforced i am now that i know what to expect smet gave a loud sigh thank god for that you told felicite i was going to i decided to talk to you first dont you think i should bother id like to frighten the bitch but this wouldnt she had me explain everything when i gave her the phones she knows the only danger is being picked up by a scanner and shes only going to use a number once how many has she got six the man cleared his throat gaston called you tell him i said id call him back if it was serious what did he want he said he doesnt give a shit what felicite says hes going to get rid of the other thing its beginning to stink lets talk tomorrow ill call you that didnt work out at all as it should have done said harrison as the call disconnected i would have liked more agreed claudine but we have her name now felicite and the number smet began to ring puts her within the city not outside weve got two more given names antoinette and gaston we know were looking for someone at the top a senior executive at belgacom that hugely narrows down our search there and if felicite is only using a stolen number once shes got three left that gives me a time frame for the dialogue and hell call out volker said its just bad luck that he hasnt already he still might they made arrangements to be immediately alerted if he did and returned to the metropole at dinner sanglier anxious at the lack of convenience and freedom to keep in touch with paris announced that he intended returning to europol headquarters the following day and hugo rosetti wondered looking very directly at claudine if there was any practical reason for his remaining either ive got an idea how to get a listening device into smets office but well need your help to achieve it claudine told the commissioner to the pathologist she said the stinking other thing that gaston is going to get rid of will be missing a toe there might be a lot to learn from that body chapter twentyfour claudine proposed the office bugging idea but didnt take part in its implementation not wanting the slightest suspicion from smet at her unnecessary presence equally objective although with less enthusiasm than on the previous evening henri sanglier accepted he had to head the delegation as well as impose his authority upon jean smet to gain the personal meeting with the justice minister immediately after that mornings planning session hopefully using the approach to unsettle the lawyer further by refusing to give a reason for the request burt harrison was the obvious us diplomatic counterpart just as paul harding balanced the inclusion of peter blake duncan mcculloch with more recent homebased training went through the basic practicalities with the fbi chief harding insisted they werent to worry it would be a piece of cake and mcculloch wondered by how many years the expression dated the older man claudine did obviously attend the regular morning review and exaggerated the analysis of the previous afternoons conversation with felicite insisting it showed the woman terrified of the confrontation shes running away from me and clearly at a loss how to conceive a ransom exchange andre poncellet reacted with the anticipated eagerness to hardings suggestion that the available and unemployed fbi and cia personnel should supplement the mobile phone inquiry within belgacom smet maintained the reserve of the previous day during the meeting but forcefully bustled into the car with sanglier and blake for the trip to the ministry making poncellet take the second vehicle with harding before the lead car cleared the forecourt smet asked openly if there was a reason of which he was unaware for the unexpected request to meet miet ulieff i need to know in case he wants some legal advice and when sanglier remained noncommittal made more than one convoluted attempt to get an indication from blake throughout the short trip the lawyer sat with his sagging briefcase clamped between his legs the way blake noted for the first time that hed held it at the earlier briefing they were swept up to ulieffs ornate rococostyle suite where the greying urbane man waited surrounded by a retinue of officials only some of whom his immediate deputy and the chief public prosecutor were introduced again smet ingratiated himself into the lead group he put the briefcase less obviously beside the chair in which he sat only one place away from ulieff this was sanglier supposed the sort of event to which he had in the near future to become accustomed a totally pointless charade of high political officials making the pretence of personally contributing to affairs of great importance which underlings were resolving there was an obligatory photocall of sanglier and ulieff shaking hands for the cameras in apparent seriousfaced discussion before the media were excluded sanglier responded impromptu to a shouted question that the meeting was to discuss important developments which at that stage couldnt be publicly disclosed as soon as the media left sanglier announced that hed wanted to meet ulieff and welcomed the inclusion of so many unexpected officials formally to express on behalf of europol their gratitude for the total belgian cooperation at every level in the investigation knowing smet would not yet have had time to brief ulieff on the mobile telephone discovery he used that to explain his important development remark to the journalist it was sanglier added the first of what he confidently expected to be many more sanglier listened to himself mouthing the empty words actually impressed with how he sounded while he probably needed to become accustomed to such occasions he hardly needed to be any more adept following the unwritten script the moment sanglier finished the belgian officials asked their prepared questions usually one apiece although ulieff allowed himself three to which the answers either had just been given by sanglier or were already available to them on the daily records when the questioning concluded burt harrison echoed sangliers official thanks on behalf of the united states of america and ulieff suggested they all adjourn to a larger adjoining chamber for a reception smet followed for the first time made too awkward by the briefcase to remain close to where the minister his deputy and sanglier were grouped the man did his best standing by the very end of the table upon which the drinks were stacked he took mineral water blake and harding joined him together both chose whisky little point at all in that complained the lawyer there hadnt been the hope had been to get into smets office in advance of the formal gathering and somehow separate the man from his briefcase as well as plant a device within the telephone it left them with only one final option bullshit protocol agreed the disappointed harding greases the wheels of government i warned you it would be a waste of time blake said close up he saw smet was sweating i dont see that were making much progress at all invited smet encouragingly blake accepted two more whiskies handing one to the american to smet he said how about you i dont drink during working hours replied the belgian holding up his water glass i said i dont see that were making much progress i know more about the woman than i do my own mother said harding and claudine knows ten times more than me shes really inside the bitchs mind claudine will get her ill put my pension on it he hadnt thought much about his pension lately he certainly wasnt worried about it any more if i was part of her group id be shitting myself said blake maintaining the pressure me and you both agreed harding there was movement from further along the table as the reception began to break up sanglier gestured that he was leaving with ulieff and poncellet the detective and the fbi man moved when smet did crowding into the same elevator see you this afternoon said smet getting off at the ministers secretariat level on the second floor the two men continued to the ground floor unspeaking pressed the ascend button the moment everyone else got off and were back at the second floor in less than a minute there was a central secretarial pool directly ahead of them with personal assistants and secretaries separated by a low woodslatted barrier beyond them were the offices of ulieff s immediate staff their names inscribed on each door smets was facing them they strode briskly forward smiling and calling greetings to the outer circle clerks who took their conference records and reached the gated barrier before anyone began to wonder at their presence a woman started to stand protectively as they went through harding smiled and gestured and said changed our mind about jean to convey an impression they were expected and physically blocked her way so that blake could knock on smets door and enter at the same time smet was behind his desk about to sit there was no sign of the briefcase he looked visibly frightened at their entry and said what the before fully recognizing them hi said harding cheerfully weve had a great idea all weve done is meet round a conference table added blake lets lunch smet seemed to need the chair he lowered himself swallowing heavily giving a dismissive gesture to the hapless secretary in the doorway he forced a smile i cant possibly the minister expects a report on this mornings meeting he just got it from sanglier said the american leaning forward invitingly over the mans desk take a break we deserve it maybe another time ive got other things to keep up to date with as well as the kidnap you sure you cant make it pressed harding weve got pagers they could get us at once if anything breaks smet had recovered no thank you but no our guests insisted harding no ok then said harding another time until this afternoon said blake at the door in the car harding said theres a great little restaurant on the avenue adolphe buyl sounds good said blake pity the whole thing didnt work out the briefcase particularly weve got something into his office its better than nothing where did you put it under the desk edge when i leaned forward the first time as near as i could to the telephones there was what looked like an individual private line next to the multiextension bank thats the one i got closest to it had been premature to celebrate installing a bug in jean smets office they learned from the two relevant calls among a lot of extraneous interoffice communication not to expect contact that day from felicite and while that allayed the apprehension there would otherwise have been claudine thought that only to be able to hear smets side of a conversation was almost worse man not being able to listen to anything at all felicites was the first and obviously complaining call smet apologizing at once for being kept from his office by ulieffs reception when shed first called there was a comprehensive account of that mornings briefing an apparent agreement that the investigation was stalled and a lot of subservient grunts from the lawyer several times he asked the woman to explain whatever it was shed told him and at the end a long period of silence before the line closed down from smets responses claudine at once identified the second caller as the belgacom executive she guessed the man to be more concerned than hed ended up the previous night from smets saying it had not been one of that mornings decisions that the belgacom investigation should start at senior management level it was only at the very end mat smets remarks became unambiguously clear the lawyer declared outright shes not calling them today and when the man obviously asked why said she wants to make them sweat for a day says she wants to teach them a lesson there was initially more lost bewilderment man anger from the ambassador and his wife after having the appropriate remark replayed twice mcbride said dully nothing until tomorrow no said claudine but its an attack on me not mary what the fuck reassurance is that youre safe here marys with a monster mary isnt safe she didnt have an adequate reply its not just to make us sweat she will attempt a ransom a day insisted the man irrational anger taking over if she doesnt make a definite demand set out how she wants it paid in twentyfour hours im going to insist smet is picked up by our people if necessary i dont give a penny fuck about legality ill make him talk myself if i have to i want it over i want my baby back there wasnt any point in arguing claudine knew twentyfour hours she agreed mary was squatting crosslegged in front of the television on the other side of the riverview room a tub of popcorn in her lap engrossed in the satellite cartoon channel felicite who had already delayed the call twice finally picked up the house phone as usual lascelles answered at once everything is going to be in place for tomorrow wonderful said the doctor weve got our special guests the boy is named robert the girl is yvette how are they being taken down separately of course either by you no i need to get the key from the agents in namur and someone to drive me by myself mary might try to get away you want me to pick you up ill call mcbride at three shell see my face thats not going to matter is it i suppose not i dont want it to hurt is there something an injection of course pills too a choice of pills there mustnt be any pain there wont be she wouldnt know shed just go to sleep feel nothing thats what i want you must have grown very fond of her i love her said felicite although there was a specific understanding between them that francoise never brought her friends to the house sanglier warned her of his return after an hourlong conversation from his europol office with lucien bigot in paris he was immediately alarmed by the unknown parisregistered citroen parked at the head of the drive his first thought was that it might be someone carrying out the background investigation that castille had talked about although he would have expected bigot to have mentioned it and francoise had said nothing about a visitor they met him in the hallway francoise with her arm round the shoulders of a startlingly attractive darkhaired girl she wore jeans and a shirt that was too tight so that her nipples protruded francoise wore trousers too part of a black silk evening suit i wanted you to meet maria announced francoise i told you about her sanglier said nothing hello the girl smiled still sanglier said nothing waiting arent you going to say hello demanded francoise i want you to go immediately sanglier told the girl she was just leaving anyway francoise kissed maria lightly on the cheek and said i told you he was a bore didnt i that night the naked body of a boy was found on the edge of a forest near dilbeek on the outskirts of brussels the big toe was missing from the left foot chapter twentyfive there were too many people in claudines view there always were at crime scenes and their arrival the fbi forensic team with harding rosetti and blake with claudine added to the congestion poncellet had come on ahead after alerting them and established some order but claudine wished there had been more a protective evidence tent had been erected over the body and a generator manhandled alongside for floodlights that not only illuminated the body within the tent but lit an area of about three square metres outside the body was ten metres along a rutted dry stoneanddirt track running into the forest from a minor metalled road what tyre imprints there might have been in the dirt had been trampled underfoot by the baldheaded man whod discovered the body while walking his dog and now stood trembling beside the police car that had answered his call so urgently the further obliterating skid marks still stretched from where it had come to a halt as they approached the dog a mongrel was completing the damage by scratching dirt over its urine puddle theyd all been approaching in a single minimally destructive line along the edge of the track over his shoulder the leading forensic officer said why the fuck are we bothering the forensic team were already suited harding and blake stood back for rosetti and claudine to put on their coveralls and plastic galoshes poncellet was standing ashenfaced away from the tent a handkerchief against his mouth and nose hes been dead a long time claudine said we know the sickly sweet smell of decomposing flesh engulfed them as they went into the tent already inside were a belgian pathologist and a police photographer there were greetings in french but no handshakes the belgians were already contaminated they wore nose clamps and their upper lips were smeared with camphor unguent rosetti and claudine both applied cream and clips beneath their totally encompassing masks the boy was face down and partially on his left side the left shoulder was humped and the left arm and hand hidden beneath it the body was grotesquely ballooned by decomposition gases the skin split in places and the major lesions moving with maggots it was on the edge of a sheet of hessian glued to it in places by congealed body fluid the anal entry was greatly distended and on both shoulders and the neck were bite marks difficult at first to identify because of the bloated flesh the eye sockets were wide open and writhed with maggots that had already destroyed the eyes themselves there was no visible cause of death the two pathologists stood side by side to heave the body over on to its back as they did so the stomach split spilling choking fluid and gas rosetti used a magnifying glass to examine what was left of the penis and had photographs taken of it maggots had attacked the stump of the missing toe making it impossible to recognize a professional amputation anything extra you want asked rosetti his voice muffled and adenoidal claudine shook her head holding her hand up against any approach from either harding or blake as she and rosetti emerged both men had been driven back by the smell from inside the tent they took off their masks and nose clips and rosetti said were badly contaminated infectious the belgian pathologist and photographer had already stripped off their forensic suits head coverings and shoes and piled them in the middle of the path claudine and rosetti added to the pyre and stood back for the mortuary attendant to soak the bundle in petrol it exploded into flame at the thrown match melting plastic adding a new smell you want to go into the tent rosetti asked harding and blake both investigators remained some way away harding said well take your word for it you going to do the autopsy straight away or wait until its properly morning called blake its still only four thirty ill do it as soon as we get back to brussels said rosetti you want to attend invited claudine im going to she went towards the two men away from the stink rosetti followed well leave that to you too said blake and weve seen all we want here he shook his head ruefully or rather not enough theres not a tyre tread to be seen and a herd of elephants couldnt have trodden the side track and undergrowth any flatter and the guy who found the body heard nothing saw nothing and knows nothing added harding it was the dog obviously who found it smelled it maybe therell be something from the autopsy said the disappointed poncellet the mortuary attendants emerged from the tent with the remains sealed inside a body bag leaving it on the ambulance gunney while they added their overalls to the dying bonfire claudine and rosetti both long inured to the horror of violent death returned to the city separately from the others their bodies cramped together in the front of the ambulance each aware of the closeness of the other but not acknowledging it it was thought claudine a bizarre surrounding in which to come physically closer to the man than she ever had before there were changing facilities at the mortuary and claudine stripped and showered with strongly disinfected emulsion before resuiting and remasking herself sprinkling the inside of the protective clothing with disinfecting powder she only bothered with bra and pants beneath the body was already on the metal dissecting table when she entered the examination room rosetti the belgian pathologist and the photographer about to start three of the american forensic scientists were in the side laboratory in which claudine and rosetti had earlier examined the amputated toe one was already working on the hessian the other two were waiting to test samples from the body rosetti led the dissection but in consultation with the other surgeon their masks as well as claudines were electronically linked enabling them to communicate with each other everything said was automatically recorded rosetti dictated quietly in french and formally according to the accepted medical format he identified himself the belgian and the mortuary and stipulated the date and the time he also named claudine as an official observer he worked quickly but methodically removing facial skin scrapings body fluid head and pubic hair and finger and toenail samples for the waiting forensic experts he had to break the jaw to carry out the dental examination when he sawed into the chest cavity carrying the opening up to the humped left shoulder they were all covered in a fine spray of bone and body fluid and had to stop to sponge clean each others visors at rosettis urging as soon as the chest had been opened the belgian pathologist sectioned several lung samples for the side laboratory first having each photographed rosetti also had several pictures taken of the anal distension before carrying out an internal examination to do so he had to turn the collapsing body on to its front having done so he shaved the back of the head up to the crown pointing out to the other man the patterned discoloration that became visible until that moment rosetti had completed ignored claudine now he turned although keeping strictly to medical protocol declaring for the recording that he was interrupting the autopsy for preliminary discussion and gave the time am of the break it was literally like an alarm clock awakening claudine her first impulse was to excuse herself and leave at once but just as quickly she realized she had more than enough time to listen to what rosetti had stopped to tell her there was just the possibility there would be something she could use in what he said although for what she wanted to achieve she doubted it rosetti did not come to her immediately from the side laboratory he collected the clipboard log flicking through the several attached notes as he approached a professional male prostitute declared rosetti there was a metallic playback to his voice through the headset very active i wouldnt put him older than seventeen but i found tunnelling during the internal anal examination the epithelium is thick too indicating constant intercourse rosetti went to the clipboard there were traces of makeup on the facial skin he paused also of a glue that quite heavily impregnated the hessian in which the body was wrapped the clock on the autopsy wall registered am claudine saw impatiently why hadnt she thought of it before why why why there was also the same varnish on the nails that we found on the severed toe continued rosetti how long has he been dead asked claudine forcing the calmness six eight sometime during the last fortnight said rosetti i cant be more definite than that there is still some residual rigor thats why the shoulder snapped when the body was thrown down it was just picked up obviously from a vehicle and tossed aside landing on the shoulder thats why it had rolled almost completely free of the hessian as you saw there was no attempt to conceal it what the caller told smet gaston was going to do just get rid of it remembered claudine anything special about the hessian it looked comparatively new it was although hed been wrapped in it for a long time he looked quickly at his clipboard forensic say its highquality sacking the sort of stuff used for wrapping things of value how did he die rosetti led her to the dissecting table claudine followed unworried by the closeness to a partially dissected carcase he pointed to the opened anus then to the blackened pattern on the back of the shaven head theyre finger bruising could be either ante or post death hands being pressed either side of the head i think it was during anal intercourse not necrophilia theres no rectal lesion or tearing which there would have been if entry was forced after death the lungs are bubbleenlarged definitely showing suffocation during the act of buggery his face was forced into something soft most likely a pillow until he died the anus is distended because muscles dont contract after death he indicated another pattern wounds this time bite marks which could give us a jaw formation impression of the killer i think the penis was bitten too momentarily claudine lost her impatience to leave the room almost to herself she said and that was done by one of the people whove got the tenyearold child were trying to get back unharmed yes said rosetti i dont think ive ever examined a worse manic sex attack its totally animal ive got to go now but later it was six fifteen claudine ran clumsily from the room hampered by the encumbering suit remembering the victims homosexuality and the spray of the body fluids she forced herself to slow stripping off the protective clothing and was even more careful against outside contact while thrusting it down the incinerator chute it was six twentythree when she emerged from the shower six twentyeight when she burst into the corridor searching wildly for a telephone and physically collided with peter blake ive been stupid she gabbled if we tell smet this early hell call i already did blake said holding her at arms length smiling and he called too twice and we got the numbers felicite is felicite galan she lives at the boulevard anspach gastons name is mehre hes an antique dealer in antwerp the smile expanded were well up to speed so you dont have to run with the image of the distorted and sexually mutilated body horrifically vivid in her mind throughout the remainder of the long day claudine couldnt dispel the feeling mat to run was exactly what she all of them had to do to run as fast as they could in every newly pointed direction and break any law to get to mary beth it was irrational and unprofessional she accepted and totally opposite from what they actually had to do which was to proceed step by step with the utmost care make no unpremeditated move until theyd located felicite galan and established the child was with her and only then risk a strike to prevent mary beth being the next disfigured body on the mortuary slab by the time claudine reached the embassy the surveillance had already been organized and in brussels was in place sure of their target and knowing from smets panicked telephone call that gaston mehre was at home over his gallery in antwerps schoenmarkt harding assigned a thirtyman squad to put the antique dealer under total observation the lawyers call to felicite galan while identifying her from the number had rung out unanswered it was again mcculloch and ritchie who led the operation in boulevard anspach watchers were positioned outside as before to warn of the womans unexpected return separate from the evidencecollecting floaters in addition there were four cia agents all women two with paramedic qualifications if mary beth were found to be imprisoned in the house she wasnt it was the first and immediate disappointment after mcculloch and ritchie immobilized the rearmounted outofdate alarm box with instant setting foam and picked the rear door lock the two men varied their routine in their immediate search for the child both looking initially for basement cells before quickly working upwards room by room at the same time as mcculloch reported failure on his mobile phone he said that from the disarray and castaside clothes in felicites bedroom and en suite dressing room as well as an opendoored cupboard in which suitcases were stored shed obviously packed and left in a hurry he and ritchie were reverting to routine some proxile copied material including bank statements was already being ferried back again they hadnt found an address book kurt volker deputed himself without argument to collate what came from the house rosetti got to the embassy by midmorning for the benefit of the entire group he repeated what hed earlier told claudine adding that around the anal area and stuck by body fluid to the hessian hed found four redpigmented pubic hairs obviously not those of the auburnhaired victim from which the killer could be identified by dna comparison the body was too decomposed for any semen trace to have remained there was no dental work from which the victim could be identified from orthodontic or dental records and although quite a substantial amount of the face was intact he thought a model reconstruction from skull and facial bone formation would be necessary if they wanted to issue a picture appeal a mouth impression of the killer was possible from at least two of the bite marks no effort had been made to clean the body and there were a lot of forensic tests still to be carried out no one commented on the quickly developed photographs of the boy that rosetti circulated harding was actually remarking that antique dealers used hessian to wrap sale items and specialized glue for repairs when the first contact came from antwerp none of the combined fbi and cia team had yet entered the premises as purchasing american tourists the prepared cover but from external observation there appeared to be two men working there both had red hair and from their facial similarity were clearly related the hessian will match that in the shop as well as the hair predicted harding so weve got ourselves a couple of murderers one at least the still unknown executive at belgacom was the first caller just after eleven to be picked up on the agonizingly limited microphone in smets office the lawyer did most of the talking as he did on the three subsequent and connected calls and a murmur of anticipation went round the listening group at the repetition in every one my house tonight seven to the man they now knew to be gaston mehre he added its desperate terrible harding had already phoned the controller of the antwerp squad giving the time when the shop would be empty that night by then the search of boulevard anspach had been completed listening devices installed in every room and telephone and all documentation mcculloch and ritchie considered relevant copied and returned to where they had been found there were thirty cia and fbi agents dispersed around the house and along every road feeding into it smet didnt dominate the conversation when felicite galan called he told her about the discovery of the body and in reply to her obvious question said i dont know if were going to meet this afternoon the bastard wouldnt say what was so important about what theyd found just that it was good important im going to try poncellet if they go on saying theyre too busy there was a long period of silence interspersed with grunts and singleword agreement towards the end smet complained i know theyre stupid its too late now too late for anything to her unheard response to that he said kill myself his final words were please im begging you i cant help it do it now when now its got to be now they were careful to keep the sequence in the proper order blake told poncellet there appeared to be a useful amount of forensic clues connected with the body find that wouldnt be analysed in time for any meeting that afternoon further contact from the woman in any case had priority he said exactly the same to smet promising to call him again at the office or even at home that evening if there was any development they all listened to poncellet accurately recount his conversation with blake to the other belgian when smet reached him it looks as if things are moving at last said poncellet they havent told you what it is no felicite did call mcbride her attitude her tone of voice even was totally different from what it had been on any previous occasion claudine tried to involve herself although not goading alert to the change and careful to avoid antagonizing her but the woman told her without anger to get off the line claudine did after her earlier debacle hillary didnt attempt to grab the telephone its a million i know said mcbride its ready yes cash yes deposit it at a branch of credit lyonnais you choose which tomorrow precisely at am ill give you a bank and an account number into which its to be transferred if its not in the account i designate by am mary beth will be killed understood no wait shut up you there claudine yes pay attention and youll learn how a ransom exchange can be made to work the line went dead the scanner failed to isolate the source of the call it was the technicians later insisted again because it had been long distance nowhere within the city limits in his study mcbride looked sideways to claudine and said she didnt sound the same no agreed claudine it wasnt right not right at all am i going home asked the child urgently as lascelles entered the beach house yes but youve got to be very good said felicite i will be honest i will be she smiled up at lascelles and said hello hello are you going to take me home both of us said the man can i wear my new clothes yes said felicite but hurry why are you crying im not crying the wind flicked my hair into my eyes shed actually been hoping the luxembourg lawyer would tell her mat the bank chain hadnt been established as they got into lascelles car felicite said in french youre quite sure it wont hurt positive pills will be best for all of them mary beth first insisted felicite i want to be the one to do it its got to be me chapter twentysix james mcbride chose the nearest convenient bank on the rue de louvain and claudine used the absence of both the ambassador and the accompanying harrison to issue the warning only rosetti wasnt there to hear it back at the mortuary to conclude his finding with the belgian pathologist she replayed that afternoons brief tape and blake said yes she sounds very different its resignation identified claudine practically from the time she snatched mary beth shes been living a fantasy her own private idyll shes fallen in love with the child convinced herself shes protecting her from everyone else it will have been the rest of the group at first now its probably me as well but today some reality has come back theres still more fantasy than anything else but shes accepting although she probably doesnt want to that its coming to an end how bad queried harding as bad as it could be you want to spell that out a little clearer asked rampling i hoped the ransom would be enough that making her hate me and then letting her have the money beating me would be sufficient claudine hesitated the admission thick in her throat i dont think that any longer so the ransoms not important any more frowned rampling yes it is she still has to beat me with that but when the moneys handed over shes won so by paying it we kill mary beth we were always going to reminded claudine thats why i argued against it from the beginning turned it instead into a way of delaying things until we found her shes beaten us by getting out of her house but you say she loves mary protested rampling you dont kill people you love you do if that love is absolute to prevent them falling into the hands of the enemy im the enemy thats fan started harding stopping halfway through the protest biblical romantic fantasy agreed claudine i know i wish i wasnt so convinced im right we dont wait any longer declared harding weve got her house as tight as a drum although shes calling from some place outside the city and we know where a bunch of them are going to be tonight if felicite isnt back by then we hit smets place theyll know where shes got the kid and weve got enough proof of murder to interrogate the shit out of them theyll tell us and then we hit her tonight agreed rampling and we know mary beths safe until eleven thirty tomorrow morning everythings going to work like clockwork lets hope said claudine it was five oclock it was going to be a long two hours smet arrived home at pm there was the familiar sound of decanter against glass the television was switched on in anticipation of the main evening newscast by then mcbride had returned from depositing the ransom to endorse about goddamned time the decision to raid the rue de flandre and insist on being present at the rescue of his daughter hillary announced she would be there too claudine concerned at the easy assumption that mary beths recovery was a foregone conclusion didnt explain her reasoning for recommending the assault and mcbride didnt ask instead he announced that he was going to speak to both state and the president by telephone that guarantee of washington support failed to reassure elliot smith who remained uncertain of legal jurisdiction despite the assurance from peter blake that europol which he represented and from which additionally commissioner sanglier would shortly be arriving had power of arrest in an eu country in which a serious crime had been committed and that the murder of the rent boy provided the justification after we get mary beth back the courts can argue about legality for as long as they like dismissed mcbride do it to provide his promised legal authority blake went with harding physically to take part in the entry that wasnt to be until rampling who remained as liaison at the embassy was satisfied from what he overheard that everyone whom smet expected had arrived a speaker was installed in the ambassadors suite to relay from the communications room every sound picked up from the bugged house smets listening to the six oclock news upon which that days press release predicting major developments within the next twentyfour hours in the kidnap of mary beth mcbride was the lead item provided the sound test it was perfect claudine attended each hurriedly convened discussion and contributed when asked doubting there would be any physical resistance although not ruling out a panicked suicide attempt but fully accepted her subsidiary part in what was an operational field situation she wasnt either as affected as everyone else increasingly became by a tense almost nervous expectation it wasnt any real danger here at the embassy but on the ground mistakes were more likely in a nervous atmosphere still with almost an hour to go before the gathering at smets home claudine decided to combine the background kurt volker had compiled from what had been taken from felicite galans house with what she had suggested before the woman had been identified practically all of it dovetailed even the videofit pictures created from the descriptions of the two kidnap witnesses were reasonable representations of the four actual photographs that had been copied felicites passport put her at thirtynine to within three years of claudines estimate the town house the itemized jewellery the money in copied deposit and current bank accounts in total the belgian franc equivalent of almost as well as the dark green mercedes attested to substantial wealth which claudine had also guessed she had been prepared for marcel still to be alive and one of the paedophile group but she wasnt surprised to read in one of the several preserved obituary notices that felicites late husband had been a leading brussels stockbroker the head of his own firm and a trading member of the citys bourse the several retained newspaper and magazine references to felicites interest in and support for local charities didnt surprise her either nor that two of them involved the protection of children volker entered the briefing room as she was finishing comparing the computer reproductions with felicites photographs i thought that was disappointing said the german those witnesses descriptions were remarkably good and shes reasonably well known from the newspaper cuttings yet we didnt get a single recognition thats human nature said claudine no one thought it could be felicite because shes far too respectable they were frightened of making fools of themselves although it doesnt show paedophilia theres someone remarkably similar in one of the pornographic films that arrived yesterday through the amsterdam outlet said volker come and see what you think only five operators remained in the computer room now that the email flood had dried to a trickle they had been concentrated at the far end of the room separated by a line of dead screens from volkers threemachine command post there were two television sets immediately adjacent a cassette still in the gate of one vcr it was a lesbian orgy most of the participants were totally naked several with dildoes strapped to their crotch as penises others with manual vibrators without exception all the women wore grotesquely ornate animal or occult halfmasks that left their mouths free in almost every shot there were scenes of cunnilingus there said volker freezing the frame to point to a heavily busted woman in a satyrs headpiece she was one of the performers wearing a dildo claudine made herself look away from another participant studying the figure that had attracted volkers attention i dont think so she said look theres dark hair brunette showing beneath the mask at the forehead and at the nape of the neck and the pubis is black youre right agreed the german i thought that was a shadow he restarted the film looks like quite a party yes said claudine looking back to the other participant henri sanglier made a noisy entry and said ive been looking for everyone what are you doing i thought we had a connection but i was wrong admitted volker as claudine snapped the film off no need to waste time on it claudine said leading the commissioner back out of the room the devils mask had done nothing to hide sangliers wife from claudine quite apart from the setting of the film she at once recognized francoise from the languid models grace with which the woman moved and from the extraordinarily longfingered hands that had tried so hard to explore her she hadnt known about francoises tiny bird tattoo which matched that on the thigh of the woman upon whom francoise was using a vibrator but then shed never allowed herself to get into a situation in which francoise was naked despite the womans persistent efforts in addition to all of which it was the location of the film that was the easiest to identify from the still unexplained dinner party to which henri sanglier had invited her and rosetti claudine knew the panelled hallway and opulent antiquecrowded room beyond actually to be sangliers manoir on the road between the hague and delft and so would anyone else who had been to the mans home the first to arrive together were greeted as gaston and charles its the antique dealer and his relative confirmed harding over his mobile link our guys followed them from antwerp theyre on their way back to you mcbride whod made a helpyourself gesture towards the cocktail cabinet but been the only one to take a drink jack daniels sat hunched towards the huge speaker hillary was wearing her green safari suit smet said everyones coming felicite queried a voice everyone except felicite whats happening it was gaston lets wait for the others said smet its a fat guy warned harding before the sound of the doorbell smet said you and i might have a lot of legal matters to talk about michel a new name rampling told the watching fbi head michel weve got the car registration for the full name harding assured him then heres another one august said smet at the door its the belgacom executive said rampling into his telephone from the back of the guy coming in now theres a resemblance to the videofit of the driver of the kidnap car said harding as the sound of a bell echoed through the speaker smet opened and closed the door without speaking there was the sound of carpetmuffled footsteps its good that you all came said smet were at the very edge of disaster theyre all there declared rampling go ordered harding not speaking to those listening in the ambassadors study they didnt need the hydraulic rams to smash the door off its hinges blake rang the bell and harding shouted through a bullhorn and in remarkably good french let us in smet were ready to take the door down from the lounge window dehane his voice chipped by hysteria said theyre everywhere swarming in smet said dont say anything theres nothing to connect us with the girl and then there was the sound of a lot of people all moving at once michel blott was the first to flee through the rear door outside which mcculloch and ritchie were waiting with a squad mcculloch said thanks for opening the door and pushed past the fat lawyer henri cool was cowering inside the rear hallway when he saw the entering americans he said dont hurt me please dont hurt me and began to cry the mehre brothers were standing in the middle of the main room with dehane gaston was holding the hand of the trembling charles dehane kept repeating oh my god oh my god smet was taking the pistol from his mouth when mcculloch entered the bedroom mcculloch said we distorted the pin it wont fire ill help you jam it down your throat if you like by the time they were all brought back together in the lounge the still weeping henri cool had wet himself so had charles mehre he was also crying in the ambassadors study they heard harding say ok which one of you is going to tell me where felicite is with mary beth no moaned claudine none of the men spoke chapter twentyseven henri sanglier accepted at once that it would mean sacrificing a lot of potential personal benefit he could no longer for instance claim to have masterminded the entire operation which had been an early intention but speed at last with official knowledge and authority was the only consideration now how quickly they could recover the child which made the inevitable belgian outrage an irritating delay and claudines suggestion how best to overcome it a godsend it also made mcbride an urgent accomplice it was the ambassador who pressed the justice minister there is an absolutely essential political need that cant be put off until tomorrow to meet them at the central police headquarters only when they arrived within minutes of each other and ahead of anyone from the rue de flandres did sanglier call poncellet the police commissioner said he could be there in ten minutes sanglier hoped that would be sufficient intervening time he wished thered been a justifiable reason to have claudine remain part of the discussion in poncellets pristinely neat office the justice minister listened stonefaced seemingly reluctant to accept copies of everything that had been recorded from smets home telephone and the incomplete transcripts from the lawyers office line he waved the bundle like a flag of surrender and said his voice jagged this is inconceivable horrifying i cant believe it theyre on their way here now all except the woman and they know where the child is said sanglier there was too much for ulieff to absorb too much to think about it was appalling a total disaster smet was a member of his staff someone he personally knew someone whod inveigled himself into an unquestioned position of trust actually as a liaison in the investigation just as ulieff reminded himself in further horror the man had made himself part of a previous investigation into a child sex murder one that had never been solved how could he ulieff escape personal responsibility distance himself all he could do distance himself by as much as possible he made another gesture with the transcripts does he know youve got this instead of answering sanglier said it was necessary to behave as we did we didnt know in the beginning who among us was the informer doubtful awareness registered upon the face of the no longer urbane man so occupied was he by personal concern that it never occurred to him to be affronted by what europol and the americans had done are they admissible its arguable and we dont have time to argue we need to know now this moment where mary beth is of course getting the child back was the most important factor it always had been the quicker they managed that the better able he would be to confront the scandal manoeuvre his way out hed have to lead ulieff decided announce the fullest inquiry the moment they recovered the child recovered her alive not dead he wouldnt be able to survive if she was found dead and one of his own staff was part of whatever had happened to her hed have to resign no choice no alternative destroyed the bastard the insinuating evil perverted bastard mcbride said i spoke to washington before coming here tonight personally to the secretary of state he hoped there wouldnt be any difficulty in our continued cooperation ulieff frowned realizing he was being told something other than the obvious but not easily able to understand what it was it sounded like an apology but what did they have to apologize for i hope that too i dont see why there should be sanglier looked obviously disappointed we dont want smet hiding behind legal barriers ulieff saw a faraway light i wont allow that to happen with so many being the potential informer having access as they did to every early planning discussion it would have been difficult obtaining a judges order authorizing a wire tap without their knowing it persisted sanglier he let a silence grow you could privately have approved it in consultation with myself and the ambassador it begged the question of why they hadnt and sanglier had an explainable apology if ulieff challenged him the man didnt instead his face cleared if it removes an obstacle smet is a criminal lawyer one of the others seems somehow connected with the law from a remark that was made when he arrived at smets house tonight to mcbride the minister said is this what your secretary meant by cooperation we did not speak in specifics only generalities said mcbride easing the belgians way this conversation is between the three of us as it will always remain at that moment andre poncellet bustled into the room stopping uncertainly at finding the other three men obviously well settled ahead of him ulieff said commissioner sanglier has something to explain to you poncellet remained standing he had little choice while ulieff expansively occupied his desk his face tightening as the ministers had initially done for different reasons although sanglier said nothing about the mans own house being entered and bugged you actually thought i could have been one of them protested poncellet aghast we couldnt trust anyone said ulieff taking up the role he had been offered it was my decision it should be this way welcome to the club thought sanglier waiting for the obvious demand about his own home to come from the still incensed policeman it didnt quickly sanglier said your credibility your authority has not publicly been questioned or impugned nor will it ever be there is no reason why it should be you were personally present much earlier today at the discovery of a murder victim the men being brought to this building tonight are unquestionably involved they are also part of the kidnap of the ambassadors daughter that has yet to be resolved when it is again tonight youll be there as the representative of belgian authority of the belgian police i greatly resent being doubted being suspected the protest wasnt as stiff as it should have been until we had positive proof i couldnt make any exception said ulieff i would like now personally to apologize which i do unreservedly the police commissioner would leak the apology to restore his credibility guessed ulieff and by so doing confirm his knowledge as minister from the beginning of the trap everything had settled perfectly poncellet accepted the regret with a short head jerk as he did so the intercom on his desk announced the arrival of the first arrests from the rue de flandres ulieff said lets get the child back end the whole unfortunate business as the lift descended sanglier decided that diplomacy was like a childs early comprehension exercise all you had to do was fit the pieces into their correct shapes to make a smooth unbroken picture everyone had been brought in by the time they reached the ground floor the vestibule was in chaos there had been no advance warning of any arrests on any charge and once again there were too many people milling about virtually all with no idea what to do poncellet at once took officious charge loudly declaring the detentions were connected with that mornings murder and without prompting ordered that each man should be detained in an individual cell charles mehre screamed loud enough to startle when he realized he was being parted from gaston who instinctively reached out a comforting hand charless escort hesitated looking to poncellet for guidance claudine had anticipated the moment manoeuvring herself next to the commissioner quietly she insisted by himself solitary charles immediately began to fight violently scattering everyone around him he headbutted his escort bursting the mans nose and split the eye of one of the three policemen it finally took to subdue him claudine was among those thrown back by the outburst close to where rosetti had remained against the wall well she said both of them have got red hair and misshapen teeth the pathologist pointed out the orthodontic cast should be conclusive but one of thems the most likely candidate something easy at last remarked claudine little else proved to be smets cosseted briefcase did contain an address book there was also a diary the book carried the names and addresses of the five men seized with him in the rue de flandres house as well as that of felicite galan only the house theyd already entered and found empty was listed against the womans name the diary appeared strictly limited to business appointments but claudine quickly isolated the simplistic code redinked stars dotted alongside various dates the majority at weekends one star however was against the midweek date of mary beths disappearance the only other contents of the briefcase apart from every record of their planning meetings were three separate and undesignated keyrings one ring goldcoloured held a single key the ideal psychology indeed virtually a universal practice among police interrogators seeking incriminating confessions from a gang would have been to leave them separated overnight for each man to be eroded by his fear of what the others might admit or accuse him of that night with everyones eyes constantly drawn to the evermoving police station clocks it was difficult for claudine to argue restraint for longer than an hour sanglier agreed to her sharing ramplings questioning of jean smet claudine guessed at once that the psychology was totally skewed a gap of twentyfour hours would probably have broken the lawyer leaving him alone for just one had given the man the opportunity to recover and prepare himself it was clearly forced but when they entered the interview cell there was even an unworried languidness about the way smet was sitting right arm lolled over the back of his chair the room was bare except for the table at which smet already sat and upon which the apparatus was assembled to record the interview alongside was a second tape machine that had been installed in each interview room in the intervening hour claudine saw uncomfortably that they faced the clock she made much of putting a folder on the table in front of her which smet made just as much effort to ignore rampling started the machine and identified everyone in the room before at once listing dates and times that tapes he intended to produce had been made and then pressed the second play button smet was visibly shaken by the greatly amplified sound of his own voice echoing into the interview room involuntarily pulling his arm from the chair back to come forward over the table he half opened his mouth but didnt speak you know what a voice print is demanded the american briskly trying to indicate the encounter was a formality claudine admired the quick ploy to get a voice comparison at the very beginning but it wasnt successful smet remained silent rampling said its as accurate as a fingerprint or dna scientifically we can prove mats you talking to someone we now know to be august dehane about the kidnap of mary beth mcbride smet stared tightlipped across the table now what have we got rampling pressed on weve got you talking to dehane about killing the child weve got felicite mentioned and the mobile phones in fact jean i think weve got you pretty tightly parcelled up and tied in ribbon what do you think claudine liked the mocking technique my home has clearly been illegally entered said the man at last i dont know what any of this is about but it was blatantly illegally obtained i demand a lawyer at once what do red stars in your diary signify asked claudine particularly on the day mary beth vanished are the redstar days those when you all got together the days you abused children you snatched or rented she tried to infuse as much contempt as possible into her voice smet just stared whyd you put a gun in your mouth and try to blow your head off demanded rampling you want to tell us about that i demand a lawyer smet was controlled again polite not showing the hysteria of the bugged telephone exchanges or even the anxiety of their planning meetings felicite is going to kill the child isnt she said claudine i dont know anyone called felicite whos felicite galan listed in your address book going into my briefcase was an illegal search please get me a lawyer it was charles mehre who killed the rent boy wasnt it smothered him during the act of buggery smet didnt reply claudine took the photographs of the anal distension from her folder pushed them across the table thats what he looked like after mehre finished with him thats what the jury are going to see when youre arraigned with charles mehre accused of complicity to murder smet gave no facial reaction i know nothing about this it was nine thirty claudine saw charles mehre was arrested in your house said rampling its on suspicion of murder that youre all being held the tapes of the intercepted conversation were as always marked at relevant passages claudine made her selection starting the playback into the room came smets voice gaston called he said he doesnt give a shit what felicite says hes going to get rid of the other thing its beginning to stink claudine said thats timed and dated before the body was found you knew about it in advance youve got to find some way of helping yourself urged rampling youre a lawyer for christs sake you can judge how bad things are for you were my house and office burgled with the approval of a judge formally claudine said miet ulieff the justice minister your superior authorized both he doesnt have the legal authority he does for anything thats done within the ministry he heads involving a ministry official suspected of serious crime which you are elliot smith the american embassy lawyer hadnt been that adamant at most he had conceded it was possible but a brief flicker of uncertainty showed on smets face i have nothing to say apart from repeating my demand for a lawyer the mocking clock showed nine fortyfive why wouldnt smet break thought claudine desperately because his position was so hopeless she decided answering her own frustrated question there was the sound of a door opening behind them at once rampling recorded blakes entry the man bent to claudines ear and whispered not one of the bastards is saying anything charles mehre has had to be sedated smile like ive just told you something youve been waiting to hear blake straightened isolating the three sets of keys from the diary and the address book that had been in smets briefcase charles was the weak link had to be he said you know all about it and that youve got the key the lawyer hesitated swallowing then he said dear jesus he began to shake it was felicite she made us do it always her ideas i didnt have anything to do with the murder and finally he pushed across the single key on its gold ring blake picked it up dangling it in front of the man thats the way now tell us where the house is smet stared at the fairhaired detective that was a trick it isnt blake looked directly towards the recorders let the record show mat jean smet isolated from a choice of several the key mat fits the house in which mary beth mcbride is being held he smiled broadly you just forgot your own advice and convicted yourself shed forgotten the kamikaze legacy of ireland claudine thought following blake from the interview room in the corridor directly outside she said furiously what if it hadnt worked id have tried something similar on all the rest until it did admitted blake easily now we havent got to waste any more time he grinned you didnt smile when i told you to the helicopters were utilized at last to fly the advance group to antwerp the party included miet ulieff as well as the tense ambassador and his safarisuited wife sanglier had wanted to be the most senior judicial figure at the childs recovery but the justice ministers presence guaranteed that every local need was instantly provided by the time the american backup arrived by road the entire antwerp detective division had been mobilized and there were three of the citys river police boats on the schelde opposite the house with their engines muted just holding them against the current and far enough away for them not to be obvious officials in the planning land registry and rating departments of antwerp city council had been located and returned to their offices the original architects drawings for the houses construction incorporating the wartime nazi bunker had been located for their inspection and pieter lascelles an eindhoven surgeon identified as its owner lance rampling accompanied peter blake in the threecar cavalcade that went to eindhoven from a radio car sanglier alerted the eindhoven police to their impending arrival until which no approach was to be made to the doctors home and gave a fuller explanation to the awakened dutch justice minister after ulieff ended his conversation with the man into their car as rampling and blake drove towards holland was radioed the message that a tenyearold boy named robert flet and a girl of eleven yvette piquette had vanished in eindhoven the previous day it was eleven thirtyfive when harding and mcculloch led the assault upon the riverside house which was in total darkness claudine remained at the head of the drive drawn against a clump of trees with sanglier ulieff and the ambassador and his wife there was remarkably little noise from so many men spreading out through the grounds only occasionally was she able to pick out the shape of someone becoming part of the encirclement lights suddenly blazed on ahead of them abruptly there was a scurried rush of men pouring into the house lights pricked out as room after room was entered mcbride began to run and immediately hillary sprinted after him literally racing everyone followed at a run claudine was directly behind the ambassador when he went into the house a gravefaced harding was waiting in the hallway the basement door open behind him down there he said mcbride got to the basement just ahead of hillary claudine followed men already in the bunker basement shifted away from an open door as if embarrassed mary beths school hat was on top of the neatly made bed her brace was on the sill of the sink on a bathroom stool some shells and waterbleached stones were laid out in a pattern on the wall by the bed were drawn two stick figures dad was in uneven print beneath the bigger mom beneath the smaller their arms were raised against each other it was five minutes to midnight chapter twentyeight by am with just eight and a half hours to go before her deadline they had it all except for what they wanted most a location for where felicite galan held mary beth mcbride the search of pieter lascelles eindhoven home authorized by the dutch justice minister on suspicion of serious crime produced a substantial amount of paedophile pornography but no clue to felicites whereabouts or his her dark green mercedes was discovered garaged at the riverside house but lascelles jaguar was missing from his home the registrationlinked dutch national police computer provided the number as well as the make which was circulated with stopanddetain orders to all road traffic units in holland and belgium confronted in brussels with the proof that mary beth had been in the antwerp house felicite galans paedophile group collapsed into recriminating accusations against her with the exception of the still deeply sedated charles mehre and any confession he might have made became unnecessary so full were the frantic admissions of the other five desperate to shift guilt and blame away from themselves so desperate were they jean smet seemingly most of all that claudine became convinced within an hour of the interrogations resuming at the belgian police headquarters that one if not all would have disclosed an address if theyd known one which meant that the lead had to come from them subconsciously and that she had to recognize it when it did it was the once devoted gaston mehre who rushed to name his retarded brother as the killer of the dilbeek victim as well as the previous rent boy even before being faced with the preliminary forensic comparison matching of what had been found on the decomposing body and the hessian glue specialized antique polish and dirt recovered from the basement storeroom of his schoenmarkt antique gallery in which additionally had been found blood from which a dna comparison was already being made jean smet eagerly volunteered his misdirecting part as the justice ministry liaison during that earlier murder investigation which surprised claudine until she accepted that he was virtually setting out his defence to foreseeable criminal charges acknowledging paedophilia in a country of minimal childsex sentencing but denying any part in murder i certainly obstructed justice but i had nothing to do with that killing nor this one neither was i in any way involved with the kidnap of the ambassadors daughter it was felicite felicite and henri cool from the first day i argued for her to be safely returned before theyd left antwerp sanglier had drafted a new europol squad into eindhoven and rampling was only thirty minutes behind claudine returning to brussels enabling them to resume their questioning of the ministry lawyer together they were briefly hopeful despite his insistence that felicite and the child wouldnt be there when smet explained how the groups had protected themselves by not owning secondary property in their country of residence and revealed felicites ownership of a country villa in goirle it was locked and shuttered when europol and eindhoven police raided it minutes after being alerted how did you know she wouldnt be there demanded rampling shes planning a special party bigger than anything shes ever organized before goirle is too small is that what mary beth was snatched for a special party asked claudine her concentration was absolute searching for the smallest telltale sign smet nodded not replying is that where shes gone with lascelles to wherever its being held asked the american id expect so dont you know said the disbelieving rampling no youre part of her group why arent you and the others included i dont know about the others i told her i wasnt interested like i said im not involved a defensive lie judged claudine the disagreement between them had been as serious as shed guessed could that help her maybe if she knew the proper questions but she didnt who is going the leanfaced man shrugged lascelles group i suppose i dont know how many and some french i think who are the french group pounced rampling i dont know why not thats the way the system worked only the people who organize the gatherings know each other its safer in case anyone gets arrested they cant talk about people they dont know how come you know about lascelles persisted the american because of the antwerp house i held the spare key is it lascelles group who snatched two children in eindhoven yesterday there must be something somewhere i dont know anything about what happened in eindhoven who are the people in lascelles group i dont know any of them youve had parties with them before havent you we dont use names usually we wear masks it wasnt coming thought claudine nothing was coming that she could follow so you film what happens smet shifted uncomfortably sometimes will this special party be filmed i told you i dont know anything about this special party what happens to the films theyre kept have you got any apart from the two in your safe how do you know what ive got in my safe we opened it said rampling impatiently answer the question no i havent got any do you know anyone who has no who takes the films someone who has a camera i never did how far in advance are these parties planned said claudine if something didnt become obvious soon shed check the transcripts of the other resumed interviews seeking her lead there she tried to push away the frustration aware it could cloud her judgement this one took a long time months she wanted it to be better than any before it in a sharp outsideherself moment claudine was distracted by the awareness that they were talking in ordinary lowvoiced conversational tones no one visibly angry no one visibly offended no one visibly judgemental about other adults conspiring sexually perhaps in other ways too to abuse children sometimes young enough to need comfort blankets and imagine their favourite bunny rabbit or teddy bear could hear what was said to it what she wondered happened to that imagination when people like jean smet and felicite galan and all the other stunted freaks finished with them even if they allowed them to live wrong allowing personal emotion to intrude if she stood any chance whatsoever and with the taunting clock inexorably counting off every minute of every hour she was beginning to doubt that she did stand any chance allowing that sort of intrusion actually put mary beth at risk the host absolutely agreed smet she was determined to control the others as she controlled us she liked disciples claudine frowned at the biblical analogy disliking it instead she thought of another unsure in her absence of religion of the accuracy of her recall it was something about suffer the little children reluctant to concede defeat claudine said tell me about felicite galan as a person smet weighed the question arrogant needing constantly to be the object of all attention to be admired never opposed sophisticated used to every good thing in life after being married to marcel a hedonist willing anxious for every new experience claudine had been prepared for the man to attempt every possible personal benefit rather than give a truly accurate opinion but decided that he hadnt instead surprisingly hed answered honestly curiously she said you admired her didnt you maybe you were even physically attracted to her she terrifies me confessed the man i could never lose the feeling that one day shed destroy me suck from me every ounce of blood and leave me to rot in her web he gave a bitter snort of a laugh and she has hasnt she claudine said charles would have killed mary beth wouldnt he smet gazed steadily at her across the table to kill someone would be an experience felicite hasnt had before i think shell want to do it mary beth hadnt been able to sleep again after waking up to make pee pee although she pretended to trying to breathe how people breathed when they were asleep in and out and making funny gurgling noises the woman had startled her being right there in the chair when shed put the light on jerking awake at the sudden glare and coming to the bathroom with her and she hadnt liked it afterwards when the woman had taken off most of her clothes and got on the bed not beneath the covers but on top so that the bedclothes were tight trapping her like the womans arm was trapping her heavy over her shoulders and along her arm she hadnt liked either the way the tall bony man had held her too tightly to carry her into the house when she could easily have walked or the noises the house itself made creaking and groaning like an old man who couldnt move properly any more but most of all she didnt like hated the pink fairy costume the woman said she had to wear for the party before going home tomorrow the material had been stiff and scratchy when theyd made her try it on and she knew she hadnt looked lovely as theyd said she did it was too tight around her tummy and the straps cut into her shoulders hurting her youre not asleep are you darling almost im going to miss you mary beth said nothing would you miss me if you didnt have me any more it was another one of those silly conversations i suppose i dont like the fairy dress its a fancy dress party all of us are going to dress up why it sounds silly she wished the womans arm wasnt so tight around her she shrugged trying to ease it off dont you want me to cuddle you youre too heavy will you wear the fairy costume just for me im going home after the party arent i yes promise i promise but i want to change first back into my new clothes all right ill wear it then will there be a cake and candy very special candy the soaring expectation and plunging despair increased everyones exhaustion only blake and harding were still determinedly interviewing michel blott everyone else slumped listlessly around beaten harrison said hed persuaded the ambassador and his wife there was no sense in their staying promising to call if there was any development henri sanglier had left with them miet ulieff had gone with poncellet claudine was vaguely aware of volker hunched before his threescreen computer assembly in the adjoining communications room more surprised at finding rosetti still there seeing the look on claudines face the pathologist said i didnt have anywhere else to go after mcculloch had me explain to gaston mehre all the forensic and medical evidence and i wanted to see it through anyway weve lost felicite said claudine and by the time we find her its going to be too late no idea at all none she admitted there was still none two hours later with the new day lightening up outside when she finished listening to all the interviews volker was with the patient rosetti when the italian carried in the third cup of coffee peter blake followed almost at once volker offered claudine the papers he was carrying and said eindhoven police wired the specification of felicites goirle house our people are still going through it so far theres nothing and wont be said claudine dully you cant find what isnt there sympathized rosetti and it isnt said blake the ransom instructions are our only chance this time weve got to get a fix she wont kill the child immediately with helicopters wed have time to get to her before anything happened the coffee was stewed and disgusting and claudine put it aside undrunk there has to be a way she insisted stubbornly weve got so much know so much about felicite galan in particular that there has to be a direction to follow were just not seeing it there isnt blake was equally insistent weve been through it all each and every way claudine stared down unseeingly at the villa details forcing every iota of her profile through her tired mind as well as suffering a psychosis felicite galan is arrogant opinionated and rich she recited to herself shes the link between her own and at least one other paedophile ring and shes determined to impress them with the best childsex orgy she can organize shes going to be the host claudine stopped blinking finally focusing upon the papers in front of her spread them she told blake hurrying away from the table he had done so by the time she returned with the architects drawings of the antwerp river house theyd obtained earlier from the citys planning department she used the remaining halffilled coffee cups to weigh down the edges to make a sidebyside comparison what demanded blake antwerps got the huge basement room we all saw tonight said claudine tracing the drawing with her finger as well as that huge room overlooking the river and six bedrooms she switched to the other set of specifications goirles got an even bigger main room and five bedrooms she looked up stretching trying to ease the ache from her back and neck felicites the host thats what smet said so theyre all coming to her its her party so its going to be somewhere of her choice but these two houses arent big enough and we know its not at the boulevard anspach here in brussels if youre throwing a party a very special party like this and your own house isnt big enough for all the guests what do you do you rent something said the everanticipating volker it took him less than an hour knowing the name and branch of felicite galans brussels bank from the statements taken from her boulevard anspach house he hacked into its mainframe computer and accessed her personal financial records they listed two legally held accounts opened in luxembourg ten years earlier at first held jointly in the names of both herself and marcel galan they had reverted to felicite within a month of her husbands death one was an investment account serviced by five different share portfolios from the investment holding there was an automatic quarterly transfer of into a working current account from that account two days earlier had been paid to bildeek and doorn which was listed in the namur telephone directory as an estate and house rental agency i should have found the luxembourg accounts within an hour of getting the brussels bank statement said volker apologetically weve still got it in time claudine reassured him i know how she planned to get the money too offered volker from luxembourg in me last week accounts have been opened in andorra liechtenstein and switzerland its classic money laundering shell have mcbrides money transferred into one of them and move it on immediately from bank to bank and country to country until it gets back to the mother account in luxembourg and each time it moves the account will be electronically closed we wouldnt be able to trace it after the first transfer but how long will the whole process take until she knows its finally got to luxembourg demanded blake itll surely give us an extension on her eleven thirty deadline volker smiled at the naivety of the question as long as it takes to press a computer button say two or three seconds felicite galans could go from whichever bank she nominates through two more countries and be in luxembourg in less than five minutes thats the joy of electronic money transfer its one that she isnt going to know promised rampling chapter twentynine having predictably started the irritating dispute between james mcbride and his wife continued longer than it should have done but it didnt delay the practical effort to find their daughter miet ulieff decreed the operation be centralized from the namur police building and that the local police chief and the mayor having mobilized their gendarmerie meet him there he added the warning that he would hold both personally responsible for the slightest public leak henri sanglier dismayed at having to share the potential glory for mary berns rescue but unable to argue against ulieffs presence despatched almost half the task force by road together with radio and telephone vans before organizing the second helicopter airlift in less than twelve hours to ferry the remainder and themselves south also by helicopter went the mobile forensic and photographic facilities as well as specialized cameras and through it all james and hillary mcbride fought over their child as a spoil of their own very personal war and yet again claudine was unwillingly caught in the crossfire i must be there insisted mcbride shed expect me to be hillary said nothing having already heard most of the argument and claudines reaction to it you cant be claudine said we dont know what were going to find in namur mary beth might not be there yet not be there at all youve got to be in brussels just as i have if things go wrong and felicite galan calls the embassy at the time shes given we could literally still be mary beths lifeline and there really is no need for you to be there said the perfectly prepared hillary whod returned from the residency in another freshly pressed action woman safari outfit jungle green like the first ill be there when mary beth is brought out having suffered what wondered claudine the woman was talking like a hollywood movie mcbride said my authority might be needed on the ground you stay and take the call his attempts were getting weaker its you the galan womans negotiated with up till now not me hillary pointed out you insisted on talking to her all the time remember it wasnt until people began leaving the building for the nato base and the waiting helicopters that mcbride finally capitulated personally demanding from both harding and rampling that the radio and telephone link from the mobile communications centre that kurt volker was going to monitor at the embassy remain permanently open for him to get a minutebyminute account ill give mary beth your love hillary threw over her shoulder to her husband as she left bitch said mcbride to the empty doorway and for the first time claudine thought that if mary beth existed in anything like this level of tension between her parents it would not have been difficult for felicite galan to insinuate herself into the childs feelings hans doorn was a prematurely balding complacently fat man of thirty who had inherited namurs most prestigious estate agency along with its chairmanship upon the death of his father and in whose comfortably settled uneventful life nothing disturbing had ever occurred the totally unannounced am doorstep arrival of the belgian justice minister a europol commissioner and an assortment of field investigators was so unbelievable that it took ulieff several minutes and ramplings and hardings cia and fbi shields to convince the man he wasnt the victim of an elaborate practical joke it took him even longer to recognize the photograph of the sharpfeatured elegant woman that was thrust at him as felicite galan whod rented for the weekend one of their most imposing country properties a chateau no less just outside the city near st marc she was suggested doorn the sort of cultured and sophisticated person with whom his agency most liked to do business miet ulieff s terse explanation of why they were there caused the nightshirted doorn the biggest shock of all by seven twenty dressed and no longer complacent he was in their discreet convoy on his way into the city to provide photographs floor plans and every other known detail of the chateau to a demanding paul harding even while he was doing that the helicopters that had carried those in charge of the investigation and the ambassadors wife from the belgian capital made a high reconnaissance pass over the identified mansion which was set in expansive woodland almost two kilometres from the only public thoroughfare a minor country road from the air there was no sign of movement around the house which was hardly surprising so early nor of pieter lascelles jaguar or any other vehicle which was less easily understandable although the house plans showed extensive stabling converted into garages they only risked one overflight but managed to expose forty frames of high speed high density film ulieff commandeered the office of the local police chief a nervous man who stuttered and didnt bathe often enough as autocratically as he had taken over poncellets in brussels but sensibly deferred to local knowledge both the policeman and the mayor whod dressed in formal black doubted that any surprise daylight assault could be made upon the chateau an opinion quickly confirmed by the arrival of the aerial photographs which showed the outer boundaries thickly wooded but the area between the coppices and the turreted building totally open in places for more than a hectare helicopters would give us an element of surprise suggested blake drawing upon his northern ireland experience harding shook his head doorns room plans are to describe the house to potential renters or buyers the place was built over three hundred years ago and is honeycombed with escape passages and underground tunnels when he first showed it to felicite five months ago she asked particularly to see them said she was interested in medieval architecture and the precautions people took for their safety all those years ago he looked uncomfortably to the ambassadors wife there are also some original dungeons and oublier wells for the unfamiliar oublier means forget oublier wells or holes were pits sometimes bottomless in which people who werent wanted any more were dropped and never seen again renters think crap like that is cute apparently felicite spent a lot of time looking at it all as part of her historical tour hes right said rampling whod shared the interview with the realtor he indicated the photographs theres a gatehouse that isnt visible through the trees in any of these photographs and according to doorn cant be seen from the outside road either its around the first bend in the drive therell obviously be someone there checking arrivals we wouldnt even clear the trees before they were warned inside ok so we go in a different way there isnt one that isnt wide open for hundreds of yards all theyd have to do is see us coming which they will to lock and bar the doors which according to doorn are about a foot thick by the time we got past them there wouldnt be a person in the place surely all youve got to do is guard the tunnel and passage exits protested hillary mcbride we could if we knew where they all were agreed harding doorn told me of three and weve already got them covered but he thinks therere more he says therere no reliable maps and that he doesnt know of the existence of any this is ridiculous said hillary she was ignored the local legend is that some of the escape routes lead into the cave systems offered the local police chief and that there are a lot of ancient skeletons at the bottom of the oublier wells its supposed to be haunted of course if we know the entrances to three passages why cant we go in along them persisted the woman were trying that sighed harding the people who built the chateau thought of it too according to doorn the doors are ironribbed on the inside and secured by iron crossbars as well as by locks the idea is to get out but not to get in there are no cars not even lascelles jaguar said blake the party obviously hasnt started but maybe felicite hasnt arrived with mary beth yet either telephone demanded hillary if someone answers say it was a wrong number at least wed know someone was inside this time blake didnt ignore the woman instead he looked at her head to one side and said we couldnt get away with a wrong number excuse shes been told for days by smet were getting closer and closer thats been her buzz but a genuine call could work doorns office is five minutes away anticipated harding i left ritchie with him the fbi man brought the estate agent running in four although the man arrived breathless he kept breathing heavily as harding talked long after he should have recovered i dont think i can do it he pleaded you will insisted harding youre the best realtor in town she knows that you take trouble over your clients she knows that too she told you she didnt want any of the staff which are normally available youre doing your job youre calling to see if shes changed her mind about that there are people you could send in at an hours notice you want to know if everythings all right or if there are any problems that need sorting out if theres a drain or a john thats blocked or a fuse thats blown anywhere were in and if theres no reply im going to become your assistant announced blake youve got the right to get past anyone at the gatehouse she wouldnt panic if it was you with someone else from the agency shed open the door which is all id need why bother with the phone at all demanded ulieff why dont one of you go up with doorn she was adamant she wanted privacy said doorn anxiously repeated over and over again that she didnt want any staff i promised to leave her entirely alone by yourself it could be explained away the diligent realtor harding reluctantly conceded a stranger would make her suspicious i think its worth a chance said rampling carelessly isnt chance what were trying to avoid said sanglier we cant just sit here doing nothing said hillary blake said i think i should go up with doorn i could wear a wire youd know the minute i was through the door be right behind me the place has got twenty bedrooms alone pointed out harding there are ten rooms on the ground floor and thats not counting the kitchen and servant accommodation or whatever the hells below ground apart from the storerooms and dungeons and holes that people disappear in which arent even on the plans weve got here somebody make a decision demanded hillary and everyone looked at henri sanglier no thought sanglier although not in answer to the choice whatever decision he made could ruin his grand exit triumph from europol couldnt do that it was going to be his electoral launch why wasnt claudine carter here he couldnt call her show his indecision its an operational judgement prompted ulieff bastard thought sanglier still almost three hours before the womans deadline expired something anything could happen in three hours thered be a reason to speak to claudine carter before then sanglier said we phone felicite answered even claudine was affected by the sense of isolation it was physical within the embassy with only mcbride harrison and rosetti with her in the ambassadors study volker moving between there and the radio room and actual over their link with the mobile communication centre duncan mcculloch was maintaining voice contact from a treeshielded track off the namur to gembloux road close enough to the st marc turnoff to monitor the passage of cars with french and dutch registrations with the number of lascelles jaguar the highest priority as irrationally as everyone else claudine had expected the verbatim twoway exchange of smets bugged telephone what they were getting was mccullochs overall commentary on what was happening comprehensive in itself but devoid of any backandforth discussion essential for the special pictures claudine had to draw without the closely defined maps of the area from which they were working at namur there was no way for the five of them in the embassy to follow the dispersal of belgians europol officers and americans around the chateau although claudine visualized the same encirclement theyd imposed around the very centre of brussels trying to scan felicites phone calls they even had to imagine the impossibility of approaching unseen the towered chateau and it was only when claudine impatiently spoke herself to mcculloch that she realized he was in turn relaying decisions being reached not on the ground which shed imagined but in namur twentyfive kilometres away while they were speaking mcculloch hurriedly broke away for a muffled conversation with namur returning to her just as quickly felicites inside they had the agent call the chateau and she answered he broke away again for another mumbled conversation before coming back to her a car with french licence plates has just turned off on the st marc road im sure it had a kid in it and theres another just behind dutch car with two guys inside theyre starting to arrive when are we going in demanded claudine they havent decided how tell namur im calling them will there be other children yes darling dressed like this yes its silly its a fairy castle isnt it were the other children taken like me yes are they going back home yes thats what the partys for because youre all going home but were going to play games first what sort of games youll see are you dressing up probably in those funny masks yes youre not going to hurt me are you no do anything bad to me no i wont love you if you do dont say that not that you dont love me then dont hurt me claudine listened astonished to peter blake cutting him off before he finished peter they dont know each other thats what smet said how they protect each other if a lot of strangers are going in your only problem is the gatehouse and by then that had been minimized chapter thirty at last they moved from namur to where the communication centre had been established along the gembloux road although the cars were obviously unmarked they still staged their arrival to avoid the appearance of a convoy to any participant on his way to the chateau blake harding and rampling were in the lead car anxious to reach the electronics expert whose scanner had picked up the mobile conversation from the gatehouse to the chateau at the first arrival the citroen with the french registration it was an american technician a fat bearded man named marion burr who wore a check shirt and cowboy boots and emerged from the vehicle smoking a small cigar a europol technician flown in that morning from the hague took over the scanner inside the truck another fbi man replaced mcculloch burrs accent was strongly southern its a man speaking french good job i come from good old louisiana weve counted fifteen through so far he says different things at different times with no reason why as far as i can see sometimes its how does your garden grow other times its with silver bells and cockle shells and then theres pretty maids all in a row whatever the hell that all means the rest of felicites original nursery rhyme identified blake at once jesus what a sick screwedup bitch said harding blake disagreed no it means something its us whore screwed unless we work out what it is who responds to the man in the gatehouse male or female a man said burr always a man the same man pressed the cia chief burr hesitated yes youre sure its important always the same man insisted burr and we got the first call so it has to be lascelles said harding sneaky bastard hid his car away in a garage why are the phrases different wondered blake burr shrugged no idea whats the response from the chateau asked blake behind him other cars began arriving he moved to the side of the road to allow them to pass out of sight further along the treecanopied track hillary mcbride was in the last vehicle with ulieff and sanglier not much thank you mostly sometimes just i understand or thats good ulieff sanglier and hillary came up to join them whats happening demanded sanglier things were moving of their own volition and he knew hed made the right decision about telephoning the chateau from namur it was important to go on giving the impression of still being in operational charge we dont know replied rampling honestly but unhelpfully at once he said its some sort of identification its got to be youre not making sense said sanglier rampling shouldered his way past the man towards the communications van close to which burr and mcculloch stood inside at mcbrides demand mccullochs replacement increased the volume for the discussion to be relayed to brussels fifteen cars he demanded fifteen that made uncertain turns towards st marc as if they were strangers to the area looking for an unfamiliar address and fifteen telephone intercepts answered mcculloch ahead of the other man with whom hed shared the communication vehicle blake smiled doubtfully and each time you logged the registration french or dutch to trace the identity of the owners agreed the texan and additionally those you think carried children yes replied the man curiously three to my count blake switched to the scanner technician and you recorded each line of the nursery rhyme against each arrival yes let me see the sheets demanded blake around him everyone was quiet no one understanding except rampling blake didnt have to go further than the first comparison the first car was a frenchregistered citroen possibly with a child he looked at mcculloch there was a child he went to burr you didnt tell us that sometimes there were two lines recited to the mansion theres two on that first message but theyre not consecutive between how does your garden grow theres a line missing before and pretty maids all in a row what the hell are you talking about demanded hillary blake continued comparing the two record sheets for several minutes before looking up how does your garden grow identifies the french group with silver bells and cockle shells is the dutch identification pretty maids all in a row designates cars carrying a child he offered the papers generally its all there felicite knows she hasnt got anyone coming lascelles has a count of his people so has whoevers organized the french if the count doesnt tally theyve got trouble brussels wants to talk to you called the liaison man from inside the van blake put on the headphones to hear claudine say youre right thats how i read it i know im right said blake be careful no kamikaze stuff speak to you later he emerged to hear harding forgetting hillarys presence say so how the fuck do we get past that barrier blake went back to the scanner record not much longer he read aloud that was the last reply from the chateau said burr they havent all arrived declared blake he jerked hurriedly round to ulieff and the local police chief we want cars with french plates they must be french because if lascelles is talking to the gatehouse hell know how many of his own people to expect they might all have already arrived and felicite hasnt included any of hers he gestured towards the main road stop anyone persuade them pay them arrest them whatever just get cars he included sanglier we cant see the gatehouse from the road which means the gatehouse cant see the road any vehicle on that road from now on gets stopped and the occupants arrested the partys over for them at ulieffs shooing gesture the local police chief moved off towards the main road beckoning namur officers to follow itll work agreed rampling theres a lot of people ahead of us so therell be a lot of movement inside the house and lets not forget as we did in namur that were all strangers once were out of the car the dutch will think were french and the french will think were dutch and felicite will think were one or the other it still wont give us much time but well be inside harding looked at mcculloch youre aboard because youre the biggest bastard weve got you dont move away from the front door once were through it youve got to keep it open for everyone whos going to come behind us the american came to a halt belatedly remembering jurisdiction to sanglier he said that would be my suggestion of course i understand the planning has to be yours another easy decision thought sanglier you blake and rampling in charge in the lead car choose your own people to follow well be wired said blake our getting inside the house is the signal to put everyone in from every direction we dont worry about the perverted fuckers felicite galan even suggested harding we just get the kids find them and get them out including mary beth theres four there could be more so we go on looking even after four leave everything else to backup it had become a discussion between themselves the rest excluded anything else we need to talk about i dont think so said rampling lets go said the fbi chief for the first time it had been possible to hear most of the briefing verbatim in the brussels embassy at hardings final remark mcbride said to harrison you got a helicopter ready waiting said the other man as the ambassador rose claudine said we dont leave until we hear mary beth all of them i hope are safe who the hell do you think you are talking to me like that demanded mcbride looking steadily at the ambassador claudine said im the person if anything goes wrong whos going to tell the world that scoring points off each other was more important to you and your wife than getting your daughter back mcbride sat down again it was nine fortyfive thirty minutes later no frenchregistered car had gone in either direction along the namur to gembloux road and the local police chief had radioed namur for any french car to be seized there at ten thirty a dutchlicensed ford was stopped on the narrow feeder road to the chateau the amsterdam tanker pilot angrily maintained that he was a lost tourist until a namur constable found a bag containing a devils costume complete with mask and whip and two child sex videos in the boot ten minutes later the message came from namur that two french cars both citroens were on their way and rampling said were going to miss felicites deadline theyve still got to have their party said blake maybe theyve already started said harding she wont have done not until shes spoken to mcbride said blake at five past eleven the cars arrived neither police driver turned his engine off when he got out there were two plainclothes namur detectives in the fourman backup car the man at the gatehouse was small and hunched with a profusion of dark hair worn long and falling over his face a curtain through which he watched them drive up he said youre late traffic said harding its going to be a good party im looking forward to it felicites call came precisely on time have you done what i told you to do yes said mcbride you got a pen yes i want the money wired to account number at the credit suisse bank on zurichs bahnhofstrasse you got that yes read it back to me while he was doing so claudine pushed a prompt note sideways to mcbride what about mary beth how am i going to get her back youll be told when the bank transfer goes through not before but you mcbride started to protest but felicite cut him off when i know the money has been sent is claudine there yes put her on what do you want said claudine well well what who won you did said claudine say it you won but we need to know how but claudine was talking into a dead phone youve got to send the money insisted claudine its the kidnap evidence and shell probably check well do it on the way to the nato base said mcbride hurrying up from his desk theres nothing for me to do here rosetti said to claudine ill go on back to brussels or rome rome felicite had telephoned from the upstairs bedroom directly opposite that in which shed locked mary beth she remained there for several minutes undecided whether to have the luxembourg lawyer check the swiss deposit before tossing the mobile telephone on to the bed beside a still closed cardboard box theyd have made the deposit been too frightened not to it didnt matter any more she was still standing there arms tight by her sides hands clenched when lascelles came into the room you all right yes here there were three pills in the palm of his offered hand she wont feel anything nothing almost everyones arrived im going down yes there was only one small sob after he left quickly felicite regained control breathing in deeply and squaring her shoulders before picking up the box mary beth looked up at her entry are we going now when ive dressed what are you going as youre the fairy im the fairy godmother mary beth sniggered what are you laughing at it was the hard voice mary beth didnt like nothing briefly felicite stood naked in front of the child before putting on the dress zip me up darling mary beth did awkwardly do you think im pretty yes tell me youre very pretty felicite put the pills in a tiny handbag hesitating look she said taking something from it the lucky stone you gave me by the river i said id always keep it didnt i can we go to the party now yes said felicite you havent put any ups on im not going to the last message harding got from the communications vehicle before disconnecting his earpiece outside the chateau was that the scanner had monitored the conversation between mcbride and felicite they carried overnight grips and bags that could have held masks or fantasy clothing and once away from the cars didnt stay together instead they straggled towards the huge entrance heads lowered strangers about to meet strangers the door opened to hardings knock and at once he pushed through blake and rampling now tightly behind him the man just inside was small and thin blinking behind thicklensed spectacles in french he said who are you with harding continued walking bringing the man further into the huge hallway guarded by two pedestalled sets of armour and frowned down upon by the mounted heads of stags and boar and antelope behind those in the second car including the two belgian detectives followed smoothly but didnt come deeply into the hall instead they went immediately sideways in both directions harding said i didnt think we spoke of who we were with you heard from the gatehouse didnt you blake said id like to change where can i do that and before the man could answer rampling said yes where can we go both started moving away in opposite directions there was a lot of noise and music coming from a room at the end of the hall and two men one dressed as a clown the other as a harlequin and both masked by their makeup turned from the bottom of the stairs towards the sound i took the call said a voice harding turned guessing the figure to be lascelles from the physical description theyd got at eindhoven although the man was wearing a tight facefitting mask and thats why i was at the door said georges lebron harding started back towards the small man but saw a fairydressed mary beth descending the stairs holding felicites hand the child immediately recognized him she smiled and said hello have you come to take me home yes said harding he surged forward spreadeagling lebron as he pushed the french priest aside harding felt lascelles groping hands on his back but jerked free continuing on police screamed lebron still on the floor and pandemonium erupted blake and rampling ran towards the noise further along the corridor shouts and screams burst from other rooms and from upstairs there was a gunshot from outside came the sound of overrevved cars slewing across the gravelled forecourt to block in already parked vehicles and then helicopters deafening thunderous helicopters descending so close to the house the gravel and grass and plants were hurled against the windows in a manmade hurricane men and women flooded into the house throughout those first few moments felicite galan remained frozen disbelieving as the chaos exploded around her in what seemed a slowmotion tableau harding was already climbing the stairs before felicite grabbed out enveloping mary beth no came out as a screaming wail so tightly was the woman clinging to the child holding her against her own body that harding couldnt immediately get his arms between the two to pull mary beth away he drove first his right then his left hand into them careless of hurting either at last dragging mary beth partially free the child was screaming in pain from being pulled between two adults and fear at all the noise and people as she began to lose her grip on mary beth felicite freed her right hand and clawed out hysterically shouting mine shes mine she missed gouging hardings eyes by a fraction too difficult for surgeons later to calculate but still marked him for life so deeply did she rake her nails down the americans face from cheek to chin the agony drove harding back making him loosen his hold but only by one hand which he smashed as hard as he could into felicites face only inches away feeling and hearing the sharply defined nose crush under his fist the woman gurgled falling backwards finally releasing mary beth a greenmasked man wearing a matching green tunic that ended at his waist below which he was naked ran towards the main door yelling its a trap its a trap mcculloch said i know im part of it and doubled the man up with just one forearm sideswipe let me out wheezed the man i will if you tell me where all the children are said mcculloch in the party room groaned the man two upstairs in the first bedroom i tell lies said mcculloch hitting him again although not intending to break the mans jaw which he did he fractured two of his own knuckles as well wim no need any longer to keep the door open the texan took the stairs two at a time leaping over the moaning felicite and found a boy and a girl dressed as wood nymphs cowering in the first bedroom were going home he said scooping them up both began to fight him the girl wet herself mcculloch held one child under each arm as he plunged back down the stairs the groaning felicite made what could have been a gesture to trip him but mcculloch kicked past only when he got out into the forecourt was it established that the children he had rescued were robert flet and yvette piquette the two snatched in eindhoven blake had found a boy later identified as jacques blom a nineyearold who had disappeared the previous day in lille in the party room he like the other two was dressed as a wood nymph all three were immediately handed over to a combined belgianamerican medical team hillary mcbride was refusing to surrender mary beth she knelt in the very centre of the forecourt crying and repeating oh my darling my own darling what else she said was drowned by the arrival of another helicopter although it landed further away from the chateau than the others had done mcbride ran from it arms in the air he threw himself down to the kneeling woman and child embracing mary beth as best he could without including hillary i got you back darling i got you back from between her parents mary beth said i want to go back inside and take this silly costume off its got her blood on it ive got some new clothes i like them claudine was at the entrance to the chateau when the swollenfaced bloodied woman was led out she said you didnt win after all felicite you were never going to i was never going to let you felicite took away the surgical dressing she had pressed to her face and spat bloodily but it missed christ youre ugly said claudine a total of thirtythree men including the man at the gatehouse were arrested at the chateau and three more at the outside road block felicite galan was the only woman among them were two tax inspectors unknown to each other another priest and a police inspector from lille the gunshot had been an attempt by an airline pilot to kill himself he failed but the bullet lodged in his brain destroying the left lobe and his mentality the finding of the medical team later confirmed at namur hospital was that none of the children had been sexually abused although all of them apart from mary beth mcbride were severely traumatized makes you believe in miracles doesnt it said blake only just said claudine theyll still need a lot of counselling bastards said the man at least we got them therere still too many left said claudine chapter thirtyone a disgruntled henri sanglier had to share the platform and the limelight with mcbride and his wife miet ulieff and the police chiefs of brussels and namur for the following days press conference mcbride described the operation as a brilliant example of international police cooperation and ulieff said it proved the worth of an organization like europol a very dangerous crossborder crime conspiracy preying upon children had been irrevocably smashed proceedings against those detained would take months maybe even years hillary mcbride said that although her daughter had been recovered completely unharmed she intended taking the child back to america to recuperate from what had been a horrifying experience and thanked the media for the restraint she knew she could expect them to show towards the child claudine didnt attempt to contact rosetti until after the weekend when she failed to get a response from his apartment and found his answering machine turned off she called the medical division and was told that hed taken leave for personal reasons with no indication of a return date she was mildly unsettled by blakes dinner invitation but saw no reason to refuse by coincidence he chose the restaurant by the lake to which rosetti had taken her the first time they had gone out together it all got a bit hectic towards the end he said hows hugo hes away in rome his wifes ill why was she offering explanations again seriously she wont get better poor guy yes you told me in brussels you were lonely yes she said again no reason why we shouldnt be friends is mere no enjoy ourselves without any serious commitment no unless we wanted a serious commitment that is why not claudine asked herself the situation with hugo was never going to resolve itself and shed decided she wasnt going to wait for ever why dont we just for a change stop trying to analyse it and do just that enjoy ourselves it was the third week of rosettis absence and claudines affair with blake that the rumour began claudine heard it first from kurt volker whose predilection for surfing into other peoples secret places made him a natural gossip she was curious that he hadnt already tiptoed down some darkened electronic alley to confirm it the europol commission did that at the beginning of the fourth week in a formal announcement of henri sangliers resignation it was timed to coincide with the paris press conference at which sanglier appeared flanked by roger castille and guy coty francoise looking the epitome of french chic was with him there was a hugely enlarged photograph of sangliers father being decorated by de gaulle as a backdrop to remind television viewers of the family honour and sanglier made an impressive vow to maintain that honour in a political career that had been declined by his father but he had decided to pursue it was the cue for castille to denounce the corruption of the present government that he would sweep aside in the coming election henri sanglier his intended justice minister would be in the vanguard of every fight against crime as he had been as the most famous of europols governing commissioners it was only at the end of the televised conference that claudine was reminded annoyed that she hadnt remembered it earlier she actually considered telephoning volker that night but decided there was no urgency she did however call him as soon as she got into the europol building the following morning im just tidying up my final report on the mary beth kidnap she said ive already filed mine said the german i was wondering about all that pornography you got in she said recalling the miniature bird tattoo on the thigh of a masked francoise parading in sangliers house what about it asked volker i know its hardly necessary to remind you but the regulations are that its got to be destroyed with all the chaos at the end i thought you might have overlooked it no said the german unoffended i intended to intended sanglier asked for it all when he said pornography was going to be his next priority i thought he meant here in europol he meant when he becomes the french justice minister obviously obviously agreed claudine rosetti returned at the end of that week hed called from rome to warn her and they met that night it was virtually the only one she hadnt spent with blake flavia died he announced bluntly we actually thought there was going to be a recovery her eyes opened and there was some movement but it came down to muscle reflexes even the squeezing of my hand im sorry so very sorry the priest said it was for the best so did the doctors and theyre right yes so now theres us claudine didnt reply i love you i want to wait obviously out of respect but im asking you to marry me yes said claudine you should wait her period was already more than a week late now she didnt think she should put off the pregnancy test any longer that was the easy decision the more difficult one was whether she still wanted to marry hugo rosetti
