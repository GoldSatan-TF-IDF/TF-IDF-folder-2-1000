doorway leading to the back room in the back room are four round wooden tables with five chairs grouped about each in the rear a family entrance opening on a side street it is late afternoon of a day in fall as the curtain rises johnny is discovered johnnythepriest deserves his nickname with his pale thin cleanshaven face mild blue eyes and white hair a cassock would seem more suited to him than the apron he wears neither his voice nor his general manner dispel this illusion which has made him a personage of the water front they are soft and bland but beneath all his mildness one senses the man behind the mask cynical callous hard as nails he is lounging at ease behind the bar a pair of spectacles on his nose reading an evening paper two longshoremen enter from the street wearing their working aprons the button of the union pinned conspicuously on the caps pulled sideways on their heads at an aggressive angle first longshoreman as they range themselves at the bar gimme a shock

toward the street door it is pushed open and christopher christopherson enters he is a short squat broadshouldered man of about fifty with a round weatherbeaten red face from which his light blue eyes peer shortsightedly twinkling with a simple good humor his large mouth overhung by a thick drooping yellow mustache is childishly selfwilled and weak of an obstinate kindliness a thick neck is jammed like a post into the heavy trunk of his body his arms with their big hairy freckled hands and his stumpy legs terminating in large flat feet are awkwardly short and muscular he walks with a clumsy rolling gait his voice when not raised in a hollow boom is toned down to a sly confidential halfwhisper with something vaguely plaintive in its quality he is dressed in a wrinkled illfitting dark suit of shore clothes and wears a faded cap of gray cloth over his mop of grizzled blond hair just now his face beams with a tooblissful happiness and he has evidently been drinking he reaches his hand out to johnny chris hello yohnny have drink on me come on larry give us drink have one yourself putting his hand in his pocket ay gat money plenty money johnny shakes chris by the hand speak of the devil

purple veins her thick gray hair is piled anyhow in a greasy mop on top of her round head her figure is flabby and fat her breath comes in wheezy gasps she speaks in a loud mannish voice punctuated by explosions of hoarse laughter but there still twinkles in her bloodshot blue eyes a youthful lust for life which hard usage has failed to stifle a sense of humor mocking but goodtempered she wears a mans cap doublebreasted mans jacket and a grimy calico skirt her bare feet are encased in a mans brogans several sizes too large for her which gives her a shuffling wobbly gait marthy grumblingly what

defiantly and i aint sorry neither after a pause with bitter hatred it was all mens fault the whole business it was men on the farm ordering and beating me and giving me the wrong start then when i was a nurse it was men again hanging around bothering me trying to see what they could get she gives a hard laugh and now its men all the time gawd i hate em all every mothers son of em dont you

curtain falls act ii scene ten days later the stern of the deeplyladen barge simeon winthrop at anchor in the outer harbor of provincetown mass it is ten oclock at night dense fog shrouds the barge on all sides and she floats motionless on a calm a lantern set up on an immense coil of thick hawser sheds a dull filtering light on objects near it the heavy steel bits for making fast the tow lines etc in the rear is the cabin its misty windows glowing wanly with the light of a lamp inside the chimney of the cabin stove rises a few feet above the roof the doleful tolling of bells on long point on ships at anchor breaks the silence at regular intervals as the curtain rises anna is discovered standing near the coil of rope on which the lantern is placed she looks healthy transformed the natural color has come back to her face she has on a black oilskin coat but wears no hat she is staring out into the fog astern with an expression of awed wonder the cabin door is pushed open and chris appears he is dressed in yellow oilskins coat pants souwester and wears high seaboots chris the glare from the cabin still in his eyes peers blinkmgly astern anna receiving no reply he calls again

dont you come turn in anna its late after four bells it aint good for you stay out here in fog ay tank anna why not with a trace of strange exultation i love this fog honest its so she hesitates

its only some fallar hail anna loose his course in fog must be fishermans power boat his engine break down ay guess the ahoy comes again through the wall of fog sounding much nearer this time chris

ay gat heave line to dat fallar he picks up a coil of rope and hurries off toward the bow anna walks back toward the extreme stern as if she wanted to remain as much isolated possible she turns her back on the proceedings and stares out into the fog the voice is heard again shouting ahoy and chris answering dis way then there is a pause the murmur of excited voices then the scuffling of feet chris appears from around the cabin to port he is supporting the limp form of a man dressed in dungarees holding one of the mans arms around his neck the deckhand johnson a young blond swede follows him helping along another exhausted man similar fashion anna turns to look at them chris stops for a second volubly anna you come help vill you you find vhiskey in cabin dese fallars need drink for

him go gat oder fallar yohnson johnson yes sir he goes the door is closed again mat burke stumbles in around the port side of the cabin he moves slowly feeling his way uncertainly keeping hold of the port bulwark with his right hand to steady himself he is stripped to the waist has on nothing but a pair of dirty dungaree pants he is a powerful broadchested sixfooter his face handsome in a hard rough bold defiant way he is about thirty in the full power of his heavymuscled immense strength his dark eyes are bloodshot and wild from sleeplessness the muscles of his arms and shoulders are lumped in knots and bunches the veins of his forearms stand out like blue cords he finds his way to the coil of hawser and sits down on it facing the cabin his back bowed head in his hands in an attitude of spent weariness burke talking aloud to himself row ye divil row then lifting his head and looking about him whats this tub well were safe anyway with the help of god he makes the sign of the cross mechanically johnson comes along the deck to port supporting the fourth man who is babbling to himself incoherently burke glances at him disdainfully is it losing the small wits ye iver had ye are deckscrubbing scut they pass him and go into the cabin leaving the door open burke sags forward wearily im bate out bate out entirely anna comes out of the cabin with a tumbler quarterfull of whiskey in her hand she gives a start when she sees burke so near her the light from the open door falling full on him then overcoming what is evidently a feeling of repulsion she comes up beside him here you are heres a drink for you you need it i guess burke lifting his head slowly confusedly is it dreaming i am anna half smiling drink it and youll find it aint no dream burke to hell with the drink but ill take it just the same he tosses it down aah im needin that and tis fine stuff looking up at her with frank grinning admiration but twasnt the booze i meant when i said was i dreaming i thought you was some mermaid out of the sea come to torment me he reaches out to feel of her arm aye rale flesh and blood divil a less anna coldly stepping back from him cut that burke but tell me isnt this a barge im on or isnt it anna sure burke and what is a fine handsome woman the like of you doing on this scow anna coldly never you mind then halfamused in spite of herself say youre a great one honest starting right in kidding after what you been through burke delighted proudly ah it was nothing aisy for a rale man with guts to him the like of me he laughs all in the days work darlin then more seriously but still in a boastful tone confidentially but i wont be denying twas a damn narrow squeak wed all ought to be with davy jones at the bottom of the sea be rights and only for me im telling you and the great strength and guts is in me wed be being scoffed by the fishes this minute anna contemptuously gee you hate yourself dont you then turning away from him indifferently well

making no impression on her and i can lick all hands on this tub wan be wan tired as i am anna sarcastically gee aint you a hard guy then with a trace of sympathy as she notices him swaying from weakness but never mind that fight talk ill take your word for all youve said go on and sit down out here anyway if i cant get you to come inside he sits down weakly youre all in you might as well own up to it burke fiercely the hell i am anna coldly well be stubborn then for all i care and i must say i dont care for your language the men i know dont pull that rough stuff when ladies are around burke getting unsteadily to his feet again in a rage ladies hoho divil mend you let you not be making game of me what would ladies be doing on this bloody hulk as anna attempts to go to the cabin he lurches into her path aisy now youre not the old squareheads woman i suppose youll be telling me next living in his cabin with him no less seeing the cold hostile expression on annas face he suddenly changes his tone to one of boisterous joviality but i do be thinking iver since the first look my eyes took at you that its a fool you are to be wasting yourself a fine handsome girl on a stumpy runt of a man like that old swede theres too many strapping great lads on the sea would give their hearts blood for one kiss of you anna scornfully lads like you eh burke grinning ye take the words out o my mouth im the proper lad for you if its meself do be saying it with a quick movement he puts his arms about her waist whisht now me daisy himselfs in the cabin its wan of your kisses im needing to take the tiredness from me bones wan kiss now he presses her to him and attempts to kiss her anna struggling fiercely leggo of me you big mut she pushes him away with all her might burke weak and tottering is caught off his guard he is thrown down backward and in falling hits his head a hard thump against the bulwark he lies there still knocked out for the moment anna stands for a second looking down at him frightenedly then she kneels down beside him and raises his head to her knee staring into his face anxiously for some sign of life burke stirring a bit mutteringly god stiffen it he opens his eyes and blinks up at her with vague wonder anna letting his head sink back on the deck rising to her feet with a sigh of relief youre coming to all right eh gee i was scared for a moment id killed you burke with difficulty rising to a sitting position scornfully killed is it itd take more than a bit of a blow to crack my thick skull then looking at her with the most intense admiration but glory be its a power of strength is in them two fine arms of yours theres not a man in the world can say the same as you that he seen mat burke lying at his feet and him dead to the world anna rather remorsefully forget it im sorry it happened see burke rises and sits on bench then severely only you had no right to be getting fresh with me listen now and dont go getting any more wrong notions im on this barge because im making a trip with my father the captains my father now you know burke the old square the old swede i mean anna yes burke rising peering at her face sure i might have known it if i wasnt a bloody fool from birth where elsed you get that fine yellow hair is like a golden crown on your head anna with an amused laugh say nothing stops you does it then attempting a severe tone again but dont you think you ought to be apologizing for what you said and done yust a minute ago instead of trying to kid me with that mush burke indignantly mush then bending forward toward her with very intense earnestness indade and i will ask your pardon a thousand times and on my knees if ye like i didnt mean a word of what i said or did resentful again for a second but divil a woman in all the ports of the world has iver made a great fool of me that way before anna with amused sarcasm i see you mean youre a ladykiller and they all fall for you burke offended passionately leave off your fooling tis that is after getting my back up at you earnestly tis no lie im telling you about the women ruefully though its a great jackass i am to be mistaking you even in anger for the like of them cows on the waterfront is the only women ive met up with since i was growed to a man as anna shrinks away from him at this he hurries on pleadingly im a hard rough man and im not fit im thinking to be kissing the shoesoles of a fine dacent girl the like of yourself tis only the ignorance of your kind made me see you wrong so youll forgive me for the love of god and let us be friends from this out passionately im thinking id rather be friends with you than have my wish for anything else in the world he holds out his hand to her shyly anna looking queerly at him perplexed and worried but moved and pleased in spite of herself takes his hand uncertainly sure burke with boyish delight god bless you in his excitement he squeezes her hand tight anna ouch burke hastily dropping her hand ruefully your pardon miss tis a clumsy ape i am then simply glancing down his arm proudly its great power i have in my hand and arm and i do be forgetting it at times anna nursing her crushed hand and glancing at his arm not without a trace of his own admiration gee youre some strong all right burke delighted its no lie and why shouldnt i be with me shoveling a million tons of coal in the stokeholes of ships since i was a lad only he pats the coil of hawser invitingly let you sit down now miss and ill be telling you a bit of myself and youll be telling me a bit of yourself and in an hour well be as old friends as if we was born in the same house he pulls at her sleeve shyly sit down now if you plaze anna with a half laugh well she sits down but we wont talk about me see you tell me about yourself and about the wreck burke flattered ill tell you surely but can i be asking you one question miss has my head in a puzzle anna guardedly well i dunno what is it burke what is it you do when youre not taking a trip with the old man for im thinking a fine girl the like of you aint living always on this tub anna uneasily no of course i aint she searches his face suspiciously afraid there may be some hidden insinuation in his words seeing his simple frankness she goes on confidently well ill tell you im a governess see i take care of kids for people and learn them things burke impressed a governess is it you must be smart surely anna but lets not talk about me tell me about the wreck like you promised me you would burke importantly twas this way miss two weeks out we ran into the divils own storm and she sprang wan hell of a leak up forard the skipper was hoping to make boston before another blow would finish her but ten days back we met up with another storm the like of the first only worse four days we was in it with green seas raking over her from bow to stern that was a terrible time god help us proudly and if twasnt for me and my great strength im telling you and its gods truth thered been mutiny itself in the stokehole twas me held them to it with a kick to wan and a clout to another and they not caring a damn for the engineers any more but fearing a clout of my right arm more than theyd fear the sea itself he glances at her anxiously eager for her approval anna concealing a smile amused by this boyish boasting of his you did some hard work didnt you burke promptly i did that im a divil for sticking it out when them thats weak give up but much good it did anyone twas a mad fightin scramble in the last seconds with each man for himself i disremember how it come about but there was the four of us in wan boat and when we was raised high on a great wave i took a look about and divil a sight there was of ship or men on top of the sea anna in a subdued voice then all the others was drowned burke they was surely anna with a shudder what a terrible end burke turns to her a terrible end for the like of them swabs does live on land maybe but for the like of us does be roaming the seas a good end im telling you quick and clane anna struck by the word yes clean thats yust the word for all of it the way it makes me feel burke the sea you mean interestedly im thinking you have a bit of it in your blood too your old man wasnt only a barge rat begging your pardon all his life by the cut of him anna no he was bosun on sailing ships for years and all the men on both sides of the family have gone to sea as far back as he remembers he says all the women have married sailors too burke with intense satisfaction did they now they had spirit in them its only on the sea youd find rale men with guts is fit to wed with fine hightempered girls then he adds halfboldly the like of yourself anna with a laugh there you go kiddin again then seeing his hurt expression quickly but you was going to tell me about yourself youre irish of course i can tell that burke stoutly yes thank god though ive not seen a sight of it in fifteen years or more anna thoughtfully sailors never do go home hardly do they thats what my father was saying burke he wasnt telling no lie with sudden melancholy its a hard and lonesome life the sea is the only women youd meet in the ports of the world whod be willing to speak you a kind word isnt woman at all you know the kind i mane and theyre a poor wicked lot god forgive them theyre looking to steal the money from you only anna her face averted rising to her feet agitatedly i think i guess id better see whats doing inside burke afraid he has offended her beseechingly dont go im saying is it ive given you offence with my talk of the like of them dont heed it at all im clumsy in my wits when it comes to talking proper with a girl the like of you and why wouldnt i be since the day i left home for to go to sea punching coal this is the first time ive had a word with a rale dacent woman so dont turn your back on me now and we beginning to be friends anna turning to him again forcing a smile im not sore at you honest burke gratefully god bless you anna changing the subject abruptly but if you honestly think the seas such a rotten life why dont you get out of it burke surprised work on land is it she nods he spits scornfully digging spuds in the muck from dawn to dark i suppose vehemently i wasnt made for it miss anna with a laugh i thought youd say that burke argumentatively but theres good jobs and bad jobs at sea like thered be on land im thinking if its in the stokehole of a proper liner i was id be able to have a little house and be home to it wan week out of four and im thinking that maybe then id have the luck to find a fine dacent girl the like of yourself now would be willing to wed with me anna turning away from him with a short laugh uneasily why sure why not burke edging up close to her exultantly then you think a girl the like of yourself might maybe not mind the past at all but only be seeing the good herself put in me anna in the same tone why sure burke passionately shed not be sorry for it id take my oath tis no more drinking and roving about id be doing then but giving my pay day into her hand and staying at home with her as meek as a lamb each night of the week id be in port anna moved in spite of herself and troubled by this halfconcealed proposal with a forced laugh all you got to do is find the girl burke i have found her anna halffrightenedly trying to laugh it off you have when i thought you was saying burke boldly and forcefully this night hanging his head humbly if shell be having me then raising his eyes to hers simply tis you i mean anna is held by his eyes for a moment then shrinks back from him with a strange broken laugh say are you going crazy are you trying to kid me proposing to me for gawds sake on such short acquaintance chris comes out of the cabin and stands staring blinkingly astern when he makes out anna in such intimate proximity to this strange sailor an angry expression comes over his face burke following her with fierce pleading insistence im telling you theres the will of god in it that brought me safe through the storm and fog to the wan spot in the world where you was think of that now and isnt it queer chris anna he comes toward them raging his fists clenched anna you gat in cabin you hear anna all her emotions immediately transformed into resentment at his bullying tone who dyou think youre talking to a slave chris hurt his voice breaking pleadingly you need gat rest anna you gat sleep she does not move he turns on burke furiously what you doing here you sailor fallar you aint sick like oders you gat in focstle dey give you bunk threateningly you hurry ay tal you anna impulsively but he is sick look at him he can hardly stand up burke straightening and throwing out his chest with a bold laugh is it giving me orders ye are me bucko let you look out then with wan hand weak as i am i can break ye in two and fling the pieces over the side and your crew after you stopping abruptly i was forgetting youre her old man and id not raise a fist to you for the world his knees sag he wavers and seems about to fall anna utters an exclamation of alarm and hurries to his slde anna taking one of his arms over her shoulder come on in the cabin you can have my bed if there aint no other place burke with jubilant happiness as they proceed toward the cabin glory be to god is it holding my arm about your neck you are anna anna sure its a sweet name is suited to you anna guiding him carefully sssh sssh burke whisht is it indade and ill not ill be roaring it out like a fog horn over the sea youre the girl of the world and well be marrying soon and i dont care who knows it anna as she guides him through the cabin door ssshh never mind that talk you go

opening out on the deck toward the stern in the right wall two more windows looking out on the port deck white curtains clean and stiff are at the windows a table with two canebottomed chairs stands in the center of the cabin a dilapidated wicker rocker painted brown is also by the table it is afternoon of a sunny day about a week later from the harbor and docks outside muffled by the closed door and windows comes the sound of steamers whistles and the puffing snort of the donkey engines of some ship unloading nearby as the curtain rises chris and anna are discovered anna is seated in the rockingchair by the table with a newspaper in her hands she is not reading but staring straight in front of her she looks unhappy troubled frowningly concentrated on her thoughts chris wanders about the room casting quick uneasy side glances at her face then stopping to peer absentmindedly out of the window his attitude betrays an overwhelming gloomy anxiety which has him on tenter hooks he pretends to be engaged in setting things shipshape but this occupation is confined to picking up some object staring at it stupidly for a second then aimlessly putting it down again he clears his throat and starts to sing to himself in a low doleful voice my yosephine come aboard de ship long time ay wait for you anna turning on him sarcastically im glad someones feeling good wearily gee i

floor and sits down in the rockingchair he stares at the paper for a while then puts it on table holds his head in his hands and sighs drearily the noise of a mans heavy footsteps comes from the deck outside and there is a loud knock on the door chris starts makes a move as if to get up and go to the door then thinks better of it and sits still the knock is repeated then as no answer comes the door is flung open and mat burke appears chris scowls at the intruder and his hand instinctively goes back to the sheath knife on his hip burke is dressed up wears a cheap blue suit a striped cotton

he tries to kiss her at first she turns away her head then overcome by a fierce impulse of passionate love she takes his head in both her hands and holds his face close to hers staring into his eyes then she kisses him full on the lips anna pushing him away from her forcing a broken laugh goodbye she walks to the doorway in rear stands with her back toward them looking out her shoulders quiver once or twice as if she were fighting back her sobs burke too in the seventh heaven of bliss to get any correct interpretation of her word with a laugh goodbye is it the divil you say ill be coming

big and strong pointing to burke like you burke half springing to his feet his fists clenched god blarst it he sinks slowly back in his chair again the knuckles showing white on his clenched hands his face tense with the effort to suppress his grief and rage chris in a cry of horrified pain anna anna to him seeming not to have heard their interruptions that was why i run away from the farm that was

voice so i give up finally what was the use she stops and looks at the two men both are motionless and silent chris seems in a stupor of despair his house of cards fallen about him burkes face is livid with the rage that is eating him up but he is too stunned and bewildered yet to find a vent for it the condemnation she feels in their silence goads anna into a harsh strident defiance you dont say nothing either of you but i know what youre thinking youre like all the rest to chris furiously and whos to blame for it me or you if youd even acted like a man if youd even been a regular father and had me with you maybe things would be different chris in agony dont talk dat vay anna ay go crazy ay vont listen puts his hands over his ears anna infuriated by his action stridently you will too

the chair and hiding her face in her hands on the table the two men have sprung to their feet chris whimpering like a child anna anna its lie its lie he stands wringing his hands together and begins to weep burke his whole great body tense like a spring dully and gropingly so thats whats in it anna raising her head at the sound of his voice with extreme mocking bitterness i spose you remember your promise mat no other reason was to count with you so long as i wasnt married already so i spose you want me to get dressed and go ashore dont you she laughs yes you do burke on the verge of his outbreak stammeringly god stiffen you anna trying to keep up her hard bitter tone but gradually letting a note of pitiful pleading creep in i spose if i tried to tell you i wasnt that no more youd

features beginning to work with fury she pleads passionately will you believe it if i tell you that loving you has made me clean its the straight goods honest then as he doesnt reply bitterly like hell you will youre like all the rest burke blazing out turning on her in a perfect frenzy of rage his voice trembling with passion the rest is it gods curse on you clane is it you slut you ill be killing you now he picks up the chair on which he has been sitting and swinging it high over his shoulder springs toward her chris rushes forward with a cry of alarm trying to ward off the blow from his daughter anna looks up into burkes eyes with the fearlessness of despair burke checks himself the chair held in the air chris wildly stop you crazy fool you vant for murder her anna pushing her

mingled hope and fear anna faintly come in then summoning her courage more resolutely come in the door is opened and chris appears in the doorway he is in a very bleary bedraggled condition suffering from the after effects of his drunk a tin pail full of foaming beer is in his hand he comes forward his eyes avoiding annas he mutters stupidly its foggy anna looking him over with contempt so you

goodnight he picks up the can of beer and goes slowly into the room on left his shoulders bowed his head sunk forward dejectedly he closes the door after him anna turns over the pages of the magazine trying desperately to banish her thoughts by looking at the pictures this fails to distract her and flinging the magazine back on the table she springs to her feet and walks about the cabin distractedly clenching and unclenching her hands she speaks aloud to herself in a tense trembling voice gawd i cant stand this much longer what am i waiting for anyway like a damn fool she laughs helplessly then checks herself abruptly as she hears the sound of heavy footsteps on the deck outside she appears to recognize these and her face lights up with joy she gasps mat a strange terror seems suddenly to seize her she rushes to the table takes the revolver out of drawer and crouches down in the corner left behind the cupboard a moment later the door is flung open and mat burke appears in the doorway he is in bad shape his clothes torn and dirty covered with sawdust as if he had been grovelling or sleeping on barroom floors there is a red bruise on his forehead over one of his eyes another over one cheekbone his knuckles are skinned and raw plain evidence of the fighting he has been through on his bat his eyes are bloodshot and heavylidded his face has a bloated look but beyond these appearances the results of heavy drinking there is an expression in his eyes of wild mental turmoil of impotent animal rage baffled by its own abject misery burke peers blinkingly about the cabin hoarsely let you not be hiding from me whoevers here though tis well you know id have a right to come back and murder you he stops to listen hearing no sound he closes the door behind him and comes forward to the table he throws himself into the rockingchair despondently theres no one here im thinking and tis a great fool i am to be coming with a sort of dumb uncomprehending anguish yerra mat burke tis a great jackass youve become and whats got into you at all at all shes gone out of this long ago im telling you and youll never see her face again anna stands up hesitating struggling between joy and fear burkes eyes fall on annas bag he leans over to examine it whats this joyfully its hers shes not gone but where is she ashore darkly what would she be doing ashore on this rotten night his face suddenly convulsed with grief and rage tis that is it oh gods curse on her raging ill wait till she comes and choke her dirty life out anna starts her face grows hard she steps into the room the revolver in her right hand by her side anna in a cold hard tone what are you doing here burke wheeling about with a terrified gasp glory be to god they remain motionless and silent for a moment holding each others eyes anna in the same hard voice well cant you talk burke trying to fall into an easy careless tone youve a years growth scared out of me coming at me so sudden and me thinking i was alone anna youve got your nerve butting in here without knocking or nothing what dyou want burke airily oh nothing much i was wanting to have a last word with you thats all he moves a step toward her anna sharply raising the revolver in her hand careful now dont try getting too close i heard what you said youd do to me burke noticing the revolver for the first time is it murdering me youd be now god forgive you then with a contemptuous laugh or is it thinking id be frightened by that old tin whistle he walks straight for her anna wildly look out i tell you burke who has come so close that the revolver is almost touching his chest let you shoot then then with sudden wild grief let you shoot im saying and be done with it let you end me with a shot and ill be thanking you for its a rotten dogs life ive lived the past two days since ive known what you are til im after wishing i was never born at all anna overcome letting the revolver drop to the floor as if her fingers had no strength to hold it hysterically what dyou want coming here why dont you beat it go on she passes him and sinks down in the rockingchair burke following her mournfully tis right youd be asking why did i come then angrily tis because tis a great weak fool of the world i am and me tormented with the wickedness youd told of yourself and drinking oceans of booze thatd make me forget forget divil a word id forget and your face grinning always in front of my eyes awake or asleep til i do be thinking a madhouse is the proper place for me anna glancing at his hands and face scornfully you look like you ought to be put away some place wonder you wasnt pulled in you been scrapping too aint you burke i have with every scut would take off his coat to me fiercely and each time id be hitting one a clout in the mug it wasnt his face id be seeing at all but yours and me wanting to drive you a blow would knock you out of this world where i wouldnt be seeing or thinking

for all men to spit at then furiously but ill not be getting out of this till ive had me word raising his fist threateningly and let you look out how youd drive me letting his fist fall helplessly dont be angry now im raving like a real lunatic im thinking and the sorrow you put on me has my brains drownded in grief suddenly bending down to her and grasping her arm intensely tell me its a lie

ship her father is sailing on the londonderry its the same oh this is too much with wild ironical laughter hahaha burke whats up with you now anna hahaha its funny funny ill die laughing burke

exasperated is it no shame you have at all im a fool to be wasting talk on you and you hardened in badness ill go out of this and lave you alone forever he starts for the door then stops to turn on her furiously and i suppose tis the same lies you told them all before that you told to me anna indignantly thats a lie i never did burke miserably youd be saying that anyway anna forcibly with growing intensity are you trying to accuse me of being in love really in love with them burke im thinking you were surely anna furiously as if this were the last insult advancing on him threateningly you mutt you ive stood enough from you dont you dare with scornful bitterness love em oh my gawd you damn thickhead love em savagely i hated em i tell you hated em hated em hated em and may gawd strike me dead this minute and my mother too if she was alive if i aint telling you the honest truth burke immensely pleased by her vehemence a light beginning to break over his face but still uncertain torn between doubt and the desire to believe helplessly if i could only be believing you now anna distractedly oh whats the use whats the use of me talking whats the use of anything pleadingly oh mat you mustnt think that for a second you mustnt think all the other bad about me you want to and i wont kick cause youve a right to but dont think that on the point of tears i couldnt bear it itd be yust too much to know you was going away where id never see you again thinking that about me burke after an inward struggle tensely forcing out the words with difficulty if i was believing that youd never had love for any other man in the world but me i could be forgetting the rest maybe anna with a cry of joy mat burke slowly if tis truth youre after telling id have a right maybe to believe youd changed and that id changed you myself til the thing youd been all your life wouldnt be you any more at all anna hanging on his words breathlessly oh mat thats what i been trying to tell you all along burke simply for ive a power of strength in me to lead men the way i want and women too maybe and im thinking id change you to a new woman entirely so id never know or you either what kind of woman youd been in the past at all anna yes you could mat i know you could burke and im thinking twasnt your fault maybe but having that old ape for a father that left you to grow up alone made you what you was and if i could be believing tis only me you anna distractedly you got to believe it mat what can i do ill do anything anything you want to prove im not lying burke suddenly seems to have a solution he feels in the pocket of his coat and grasps something solemnly would you be willing to swear an oath now a terrible fearful oath would send your soul to the divils in hell if you was lying anna eagerly sure ill swear mat on anything burke takes a small cheap old crucifix from his pocket and holds it up for her to see will you swear on this anna reaching out for it yes sure i will give it to me burke holding it away tis a cross was given me by my mother god rest her soul he makes the sign of the cross mechanically i was a lad only and she told me to keep it by me if id be waking or sleeping and never lose it and itd bring me luck she died soon after but im after keeping it with me from that day to this and im telling you theres great power in it and tis great bad luck its saved me from and me roaming the seas and i having it tied round my neck when my last ship sunk and it bringing me safe to land when the others went to their death very earnestly and im warning you now if youd swear an oath on this tis my old woman herself will be looking down from hivin above and praying almighty god and the saints to put a great curse on you if shed hear you swearing a lie anna awed by his manner superstitiously i wouldnt have the nerve honest if it was a lie but its the truth and i aint scared to swear give it to me burke handing it to her almost frightenedly as if he feared for her safety be careful what youd swear im saying anna holding the cross gingerly well what do you want me to swear you say it burke swear im the only man in the world ivir you felt love for anna looking into his eyes steadily i swear it burke and that youll be forgetting from this day all the badness youve done and never do the like of it again anna forcibly i swear it i swear it by god burke and may the blackest curse of god strike you if youre lying say it now anna and may the blackest curse of god strike me if im lying burke with a stupendous sigh oh glory be to god im after believing you now he takes the cross from her hand his face beaming with joy and puts it back in his pocket he puts his arm about her waist and is about to kiss her when he stops appalled by some terrible doubt anna alarmed whats the matter with you burke with sudden fierce questioning is it catholic ye are anna confused no why burke filled with a sort of bewildered foreboding oh god help me with a dark glance of suspicion at her theres some divils trickery in it to be swearing an oath on a catholic cross and you wan of the others anna distractedly oh mat dont you believe me burke miserably if it isnt a catholic you are anna i aint nothing whats the difference didnt you hear me swear burke passionately oh id a right to stay away from you but i couldnt i was loving you in spite of it all and wanting to be with you god forgive me no matter what you are id go mad if id not have you id be killing the world he seizes her in his arms and kisses her fiercely anna with a gasp of joy mat burke suddenly holding her away from him and staring into her eyes as if to probe into her soul slowly if your oath is no proper oath at all ill have to be taking your naked word for it and have you anyway im thinking im needing you that bad anna hurt reproachfully mat i swore didnt i burke defiantly as if challenging fate oath or no oath tis no matter well be wedded in the morning with the help of god still more defiantly well be happy now the two of us in spite of the divil he crushes her to him and kisses her again the door on the left is pushed open and chris appears in the doorway he stands blinking at them at first the old expression of hatred of burke comes into his eyes instinctively then a look of resignation and relief takes its place his face lights up with a sudden happy thought he turns back into the bedroom reappears immediately with the tin can of beer in his hand grinning chris me have drink on this py golly they break away from each other with startled exclamations burke explosively god stiffen it he takes a step toward chris threateningly anna happily to her father thats the way to talk with a laugh and say its about time for

his beer absentmindedly finally burke turns on him burke is it any religion at all you have you and your anna chris surprised vhy yes ve vas lutheran in ole country burke horrified luthers is it then

premonition as anna reenters from the left its funny its queer yes you and me shipping on same boat dat vay it aint right ay dont know its dat funny vay ole davil sea do her vorst dirty tricks yes its

preoccupation shakes his head and mutters fog fog fog all bloody time you cant see vhere you vas going no only dat ole davil sea she knows the two stare at him from the harbor comes the muffled mournful wail of steamers whistles the curtain falls
